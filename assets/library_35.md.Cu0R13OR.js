When I started to look into this subject I faced so many barriers cause of lack of clarity and easiness of the other books and materials covering this subject. I have to admit also that I sometimes decided to give the whole thing up. Fortunately, I came across this book and it revived my hope. It is really a good book to start with and deserves of studying. Particular attention should be paid on Sockets. I would however suggest some matterials on the web which could be covered before reading this book. Many examples have worked for me. The way he provides the code examples (which are in C) is also comprehensive and anyone with experience in C should not have problems with understanding them. I would, however, recommend other books (such as Stevens Unix Network Programming and Advanced Programming under the UNIX environment as well as &lt;in the case of client-server programming&gt; Comer's and Steven's Internetworking with TCP/IP III) to read as a flow-up manuals. One should also test available code (the coplete ones) to have some hands on experience on the subject. Some of the thing did not seem consistent with the author to me."},{"Title":"Unix Distributed Programming","review":"This book has very nice explanations. Sometimes they almost seem too simple, but you can count on it not being over your head. It has lots of illustrations and is fairly easy to read. I think the author takes a complex topic and explains it very, very well. It's also a lot shorter than some of the books by W. Richard Stevens. Both this book and Stevens's &quot;UNIX Network Programming&quot; are too old to include POSIX semaphores. If you get your hands on a book on UNIX distributed programming, look in the index for &quot;sem_init&quot; or posix to see if it has the latest technology. I think everyone who programs in a unix environment should read this book to get a broad introduction to this topic. If you have the time to read 2 books on this topic, I recommend this one 1st to understand the concepts and another book with more examples to get more ideas for coding."},{"Title":"Unix Distributed Programming","review":"This book has helped me a lot with my assignments in a graduate distributed systems course.

I took the example from the book in Sockets and with a couple of very minor tweaks and the stuff to setup winsock I wrote a very simple windows console server application.OK, some of the commands, like close is closesocket, have changed for windows BUT the majority of code came from the book.

The story ends on a bittersweet note as the children are growing up, but is nonetheless worth reading."},{"Title":"The Golden Road","review":"\\"The Golden Road\\" is the sweet-souled sequel to Lucy Maud Montgomery's excellent \\"The Story Girl.\\" The novels must be read in order; \\"The Golden Road\\" picks up without preamble where its predecessor left off.The King brothers Bev and Felix; their King cousins Felicity, Dan, and Cecily; \\"Story Girl\\" Sara Stanley; and neighbors Sara Ray and Peter Craig face winter in the small town of Carlisle, on Canada's Prince Edward Island. To pass the time, the children decide to publish their own magazine, with stories, advice, and personal ads. The magazine will be only the beginning of their adventures, as the children wrestle with New Year's resolutions, host the strange visit of an aunt who isn't an aunt, survive a snowstorm, spend a night in a witch's house, attend a wedding and a funeral, and prepare for the departure of some of their own.\\"The Golden Road\\" is less about telling stories, although the Story Girl has a beauty in finally solving the mystery of the Awkward Man. This novel centers on the interactions of the children as they arrive at the awkward edges of adolescence. Much of the story, including a bittersweet ending, is told in retrospect by one of them. However, it is Montgomery's superb narrative gift that makes the journey entirely worthwhile. \\"The Golden Road\\" is very highly recommended to fans of Lucy Maud Montgomery, especially those who enjoyed \\"The Story Girl.\\""},{"Title":"The Golden Road","review":"The Golden Road and its prequel, The Story Girl, are two of the best books I have ever read.

I think the ending is very sad, the realisation that we all have to grow up, and the hints we are given about the future of the characters we have grown to love. I was near tears reading about cecily, and the ending seemed so final. We can never return to our childhood, but we can remember the good times in reading this book.

Young or old, a good story is a good story."},{"Title":"The Golden Road","review":"The Golden Road, which is a sequel to The Story Girl, is beautifully written. It will make you laugh, and even shed a tear or too. It will bring back memories of childhood, or of the childhood we wished we'd had. Of all of Montgomery's novels, this is the one I return to most often. A true little gem, for all ages. The sotry of great aunt Eliza's visit is one of the funniest chapters I have ever read. Delightful!"},{"Title":"The Golden Road","review":"Despite the long-ago nature of the story, children like Beverley, Felix, The Story Girl, Felicity, Dan, Cecily, Peter and Sara Ray live today. Montgomery treats children - and their points of view - with respect. She shows their virtues, faults, triumphs and follies in an honest light - sometimes poignant, sometimes funny. She also captures that magical betwixt-and-between time that the Story Girl and Beverley are approaching, as they begin to move away from childhood. The ending is sweet and sad at the same time."},{"Title":"The Golden Road","review":"I enjoyed The Golden Road, but not as much as I enjoyed The Story Girl. I recommend you read the two novels together, one right after the other. If you enjoy reading books set in a long-ago era, the books have a charm to them. If you like action, these books will not appeal to you as much.In my opinion, it is not possible to enjoy The Golden Road unless you have just recently read The Story Girl. Not all of the characters and actions in TGR will be understoon unless you have read TSG. The characters are a lot of fun and are well-written. The adventures this group of friends have together will stay in your memory forever."},{"Title":"The Golden Road","review":"I loved this book. I read the Story Girl years ago, but the 'Road to Avonlea' books ruined the concept for me, and I forgot that there was an original sequel. And then, my sister borrowed it from the library; I was bored, and so picked it up. I read the entire book that afternoon - forget about the fact that exams were six weeks off, that I should be vaccuuming - I couldn't put it down. I admit, I had cherished hopes of the Story Girl and Bev, but they were dashed. Felicity and Peter, I am sure, were happy for the rest of their lives....and I was crying so hard when I read about Cecily.

If you&#65533;ve ever wondered about reality; if you&#65533;ve ever wondered about what is real and not real; and if you&#65533;ve ever had trouble telling one from another, here is a book you&#65533;ll not be able to put down.The protagonist, Carly Worthington is a 43 year old ad agency art director, not to mention an alcoholic and a bar prowler whose alter-ego, Wicked Sister continually leads her to destruction. Carly&#65533;s life---her feeble attempts at happiness---is made up of drinking and sleeping around with older men. The why of her life, the reason for Carly&#65533;s path to self-destruction is her alcoholic, dysfunctional mother, and the background for this transforming story of self-rescue. And since Carly cannot admit this to herself, it is Wicked Sister who takes the blame.Like a freight train speeding down the track to a terrible destination, Carly&#65533;s People barrels through Carly&#65533;s rape and beating. Her mom&#65533;s heart attack signals a change in track to a new destination, revelation. And the track man is the Blue One in a &#65533;... conscious level that is neither dream nor material reality to which your human body is accustomed.&#65533; It is these Blue People, call them angels or Christed Ones, that teach Carly a self-directional guide to individual higher expression---Recognize, Confront, Forgive and Release---words we can all live by.Carly learns the truth, &#65533;...the simple, pristine pathway to Increase of Light...&#65533; It is the One law of the Law of One. It is the track to salvation and understanding. And so, Carly&#65533;s People is about forgiveness, the beginning of healing. With the wisdom of all time, Ann Hildreth writes, &#65533;There is the bridge that spans the waters of forgiveness that flows throughout eternity; you cannot cross over the River of Forgiveness until you&#65533;re ready to go to the other side.&#65533; Carly was finally ready!"},{"Title":"Carly's People","review":"Once picked up, Carly's People by Ann Hildreth is difficult to put down. Fortunately, it's a fast-paced, easy read. Carly is clearly a mess, but is she clinically schizophrenic, or does she just happen to talk to herself like you and I do? Why do the traumas of her adulthood so closely resemble those of her childhood? Where does memory end and fabrication begin?If Carly is a role model it would be for her bravery in confronting the past as a means to move foreward.When the reader begins to hear the message -- which is about unconditional love and forgiveness without coming off as some &quot;channeled&quot; new-age love-gush claptrap -- she will forgive herself for engaging in what has seemed to be lowly highway gawking or unseemly &quot;trailer trash&quot; voyeurism. Yes, it's THAT juicy, and for every base, shameful titillation there is a higher, more intriguing question. And maybe an answer or two."},{"Title":"Changing Children's Behavior (Prentice-Hall series in counseling & guidance)","review":"This book was in the condition as stated.

It provides a very full and clear understanding of the different question and content types found on the TOEFL exam. It also gives numerous practice exercises that reinforce skills necessary to achieving a higher score on the TOEFL. There's a great list of idiomatic expressions for the listening section and vocbulary terms for the reading section, both with fill-in exercises, too. In addition, all of the listening, grammar, and reading exercises are wonderfully written. I have the sense that Rogers really put a lot of care into the material. The book comes with a CD which contains one practice test. There are also two practice tests at the end of the book. Drawbacks: For $42.95, Complete Guide to the TOEFL does not come with the tapes for the listening material ($99.95), the transcripts or the answers ($15.00). So, you're going to have to pay around $170 to really &quot;get&quot; this book. In addition, the TWE section of the book is not too stellar.

Wether your a scholar studying the pharmacological and cross-culture use of hallucinogens, or a 18 year old, this book explains the process of growing mycelium with potent psilocybin in easy to follow steps with descriptive pictures. The toxicity of psilocybin, the main alkaloid in the psychedelic mushroom also known as Stropharia Cubensis (this books goes by that strain) is 200, that is L.D. 200 in other words, 200 times the effective dose approaches toxicity, So in other words, in pharmacological terms, these substances are harmless, since you cant even ingest that much. This book does state that in fairly technical terms, in a section separate from the main. Mushroom use in ancient civilizations has been in use for thousands of years, the knowledge, unparalleled in the sense of human understanding upon subjects which otherwise with go without. What psychedelics ultimately do is they dissolve boundaries, and in the presence of dissolved boundaries, one cannot continue to close ones eyes to the ruination of the earth, positing of the seas, and 2000 years of unchallenged dominator culture, based on monotheism, hatred of nature, suppression of the female, so forth and so on. You have a godlike understanding to learn and assimilate new information, the kind of experience you have when looking over a landscape from the air, when previously only viewed from the ground. This book while eloquently outlining this in the introduction primarily focuses on growing the mycelium, in which it does flawlessly. In the process of growing mycelium, you have to have very sterile conditions, and this book stresses contamination, while other books don't emphasize that, which I find a problem. While this book gives you a list of tools, which are easily bought in any town or on the internet for a reasonable low price (Excluding the pressure cooker) it also gives you a sense of understanding for the process as a whole, which gives this process specifically a tint of art, because it is, in and of itself an art. It would be recommended to have at least a college level of English, and college level chemistry wouldn't hurt as well. These substances can show you what has never been seen before, and never will be seen by any human ever again. Our culture is in a ridiculous position in relation with these substances, and in reading this book one becomes more familiar to the properties and uses, preparation and dosage alike, so one doesn't have a culturally sanctioned basises toward something which he/she had no prior knowledge. This book, written by Terence &amp; Dennis McKenna, however written under the name Oss and Oeric, are the foremost spokesperson's for the psychedelic experience, among other things, and are literary geniuses (in the purest definition) whose knowledge is unparalleled as well.

Really eye-opening to see all the organisms that would invade the growth media!For those of you who may be unfamiliar with the magic substance of psilocybin (and psilocin), these substances have been around thousands of years and are presently being scientifically studied for their capacity to change the perceptions of humans in difficult or unorthodox situations, like when a person is faced with their own death.One such group that is sponsoring such studies for these presently forbidden (by the U.S. Government) substances is MAPS, who can be found at [...] on the Internet.

Darlene Wilkinson gives the Prayer of Jabez a slightly different spin, putting her perspective on it. But beware of several items: 1) this is written from her perspective, so don't presume that all she says will apply or even make sense from yours; and 2) asking for God to enlarge your territory doesn't necessarily mean make you rich. I noticed a few other reviewers of Bruce Wilkinson's book thought that it meant make me rich. I took it to mean, make me more effective for Your kingdom, Lord, by taking me out of my comfort zone (my territory). Just as King Solomon prayed for wisdom and God, because He was pleased with his request, made him the richest king of all time, so with Jabez. The very same day I began my 30 day trial (I am still in it, by the way), God granted my wish by opening a position at my church for me to minister through serving. The Lord has truly blessed me through this prayer. It is 100% effective if you keep your eyes open and don't expect physical riches. For me, the riches I am seeking are those to be found in my eternal home. Though I'm not going to turn down any earthly riches if that is God's plan!"},{"Title":"The Prayer of Jabez for Women Audio","review":"I would have enjoyed this book more if I had not already read The Prayer of Jabez by Bruce Wilkinson. This version lays out much of the same information, with a few insights for women tucked in. The overall message of both books (which is valuable) is the same.

What I found out is that God wants to bless us, not according to our worthiness but because we know He will answer our prayers.Wherever you are is your territory to bless others and glorify God. God will use you to benefit others, bless others, according to His perfect plan. We need to remove our limits on what we can do and who we can become to glorify God. God wants us to have a bigger impact on the lives of others by expanding our network of influence to reach others for Christ.On page 42, Darlene states a process to help us along in our Jabez Prayer:*Ask God to let me do more for him.*Aim to be available to those around me.*Approach surprise encounters as potential Jabez Appointment.*Acknowledge it's about God's agenda, not mine.I believe that if we are tired, overwork and stressed we are not living the prayer of Jabez because God always leaves us exhilarated, not exhausted.I would recommend this easy to read book to anyone who wants to feel like they are doing more for Christ as we are His Servants on earth. Darlene touches our hearts with personal stories that help understand why the Prayer of Jabez should be the first thing we say when we get out of bed each morning.2011 Jackie Paulson All Rights Reserved"},{"Title":"The Prayer of Jabez for Women Audio","review":"Prayer of Jabez for Women is a good reading.

I also felt I was re-reading sections from her husband's book in her book; his words were just changed around a bit. There was nothing new nor were any original ideas presented in the book.She makes reference on why God loves to answer such a prayer as the Jabez prayer. Does that mean that God does not answer other kinds of prayers, and only chooses \\"prayers such as . . .?\\" I think not. She talks of women being very fearful and giving up on miracles in their lives. Well, thoughts have energy and if one constantly thinks fearful thoughts, then fear shows up in our lives. If one does not believe in miracles happening, then they won't. Ernest Holmes, in his ministry, stated, \\"Change your thoughts, change your life.\\" Jesus was able to do what he did, not only because of his faith, but also because of the power of his thoughts. Faith is a huge concept.The feeling I get after reading this book is that if one says this prayer then the miracles unfold. If one doesn't believe, or is skeptical, or has negative thoughts, their lives will not change. The author also talks about supporting one's husband. How about the husband supporting his wife's career? It works both ways and spousal support is not just \\"one\\" way. Have I stepped back into the 50's here? Satan is also mentioned in her book, which, in my review of the Prayer of Jabez, is getting old. We have free will, which God has given us. Our choices need to be held accountable by the person who made them and not blamed on someone else.She also makes reference that we have to realize that Jesus died for payment our sins and once we accept that we are saved. I think not. God's Spirit is with us always and if one does or does not accept the above statement, it does not mean that God will not bless us. We are God's expression on earth. We are already whole and complete and we are loved always. I am really tired of reading \\"Christian\\" books where the guilt it constantly laid on. This book also does not talk about a forgiving and loving God, which is very disappointing.She also talks ad nauseum on fear, on women's fears. Sure we all have fears, but again we either give into them or change them. It makes me wonder that as a minister's wife, she is so filled with fear, where is her supportative husband? Does she feel that insecure? Has her husband not helped to boost her self-confidence or has she been put down and made to feel insecure. Makes one wonder.This book was just as bad as the original, if not worse. Another disappointment."},{"Title":"Music, Society, Education (Music Culture)","review":"Speaking as a practising creative musician, I would say that no other book has had such a profound effect on me. I've re-read it several times.Two of Christopher Small's many excellent points particularly struck me: 1) the glories of Western classical music (and I love Beethoven as much as the next fella) shouldn't blind us to the fact that it is but a tiny strand of the awe-inspiring diversity of humanity's music, and 2) much of our listening experience in the West takes the form of passive consumption of musical product, whereas for the great bulk of the world's peoples (in traditional societies, at least) music is about participation and the process of making music, rather than the end product.First published in 1976 ( I believe- don't have my copy handy to verify this) I feel Small's appraisal of the entirety of music of the world, and the unjustifiably exalted place that Western classical music holds in the mind of the general public (not just in the West, either) was way ahead of its time. Keep in mind that he was writing well before the explosion of interest in so-called \\"world music\\" that we saw in the 1980s.Small's treatment of the concepts of process versus product in music performance opened my eyes in ways that still resonate for me, two decades after first reading this book.I said earlier that I've re-read it several times; to be more precise that was a while ago now, and I hadn't actually read it for ten or more years. When I recently did, I was particularly struck by Small's idealism, something that many in today's cynical times might scoff at, to which I simply say that now more than ever they could do with a good dose of such idealism.Do check out \\"Musicking\\" and \\"Music of the Common Tongue\\", both also excellent (in fact I think \\"Musicking\\" may be his greatest book) but start with this one."},{"Title":"Music, Society, Education (Music Culture)","review":"Want to know bit more about how the traditions of Western music connect with Newtonian science and our approaches to the scientific method and the development of technology? Interested in exploring the cultural relationships between music as an art form and the societies which produced it? Then this is the book for you. First appearing over 30 years ago. this has become a 'must' for all undergraduate music students as well as people with a general interest in the arts and how they relate to the societies they grew out of.This is an 'ideas 'book par excellence. Sometimes quite a demanding read, it is, nevertheless, worth the effort. You are going to hear that Brahms symphony or Bach cantata in a different way once you have read this book. Julian Mincham."},{"Title":"Music, Society, Education (Music Culture)","review":"Anyone with an interest in the emergence of Avant-Garde in Western classical music should read this book. Those with general interests in music -- in rock or jazz or &quot;world&quot; -- should also pick it up. Small's well-argued points about Western ideals and preconceptions of music -- especially its limitations -- are compelling. A classic in music scholarship!"},{"Title":"Music, Society, Education (Music Culture)","review":"Small makes a few valid points, but he seems too closed-minded.

Suspected, but never charged, in the drowning death of another victim during 1972 (Not many people are aware of this fact!!!). Sentenced to life imprisonment despite a bizarre insanity defense. The DeFeo home has subsequently become the central object of novels and films in the \\"Amityville Horror\\" series, alleging that Ronald 'Butch' DeFeo was possessed by demons.This book presents the DeFeo case from the prosecutor's point of view. Especially revealing in regard to the suspect's lame insanity defense.I found the book to be of great interest to the student of criminology. If you are obsessed with the so called 'Amityville Horror' gibberish or are looking for ghosts, then look elsewhere, this book is definetely ***NOT*** for you. This is a 'serious readers' crime case study in line with Bugliosi's 'Helter Skelter'"},{"Title":"High Hopes: The Amityville Murders","review":"This is EXACTLY the story I wanted......the actual, factual, grisly story of the murder of the DeFeo family..... NOT ghosts and evil spirits and devils and possession. This is REALLY what happened in the famous Amity house with the eyes.....I would classify this as a TRUE CRIME book and it is very interesting and informative. It's like you're getting a personal tour of that fateful night in 1974. It is AWESOME and I would highly recommend it to anyone wanting to read about the true story behind the Amityville Horror."},{"Title":"High Hopes: The Amityville Murders","review":"Living only two towns away in LI when this murder(s)occured, I could not be more aware of all the hype, changing scenarios, gossip, etc. that went down, as we all talked about this for about two years after it happened. This book brings to light one very startling fact by a juror who makes an incredible discovery/comparison. It settles my mind for sure. The book is awesome and I highly recommend it for all the first hand info, direct testimony, etc. I could not put the book down and read it in 3 days, and with my busy schedule. I actually did not want it to end. It is also the first time one can read about the extended family (aunt, grandfather) which I always wanted to read about but never came across. Like Butch stated not too long ago - \\"no demons, no ghosts, just cold blooded murder\\". And drugs at the bottom of it for sure."},{"Title":"High Hopes: The Amityville Murders","review":"The first part of this book kept me reading, when it got to the trial it turned into a big brag fest about the author, who was also the prosecutor.

Butch Defeo's attorney summed up the real boring story. \\" This was the story of the killing of a middle class family by their mentally disturbed son who found access to a shot gun \\". There are many more colorful books on this subject but all, like Jay Anson's fairytale are works of fiction or blending of fact and fiction. This book is and remains the only true account of what happened."},{"Title":"High Hopes: The Amityville Murders","review":"Good book. It was interesting to read the attorney's perspective.

Haring created an instantly recognizable style with his drawings. His portrayals of heart shapes, human shapes, and other elements have both an iconic quality and a life-affirming energy. Many of his drawings combine a mystical feeling with postmodern playfulness.My only reservation about this book involves a note on the page of publication data. It reads, &quot;The Keith Haring artwork in this book has been reproduced faithfully; however the colors of some works have been altered.&quot; Huh? I see no need to change the artist's colors. I think the editors of the book overstepped themselves with that decision. Nevertheless, this book effectively captures the genius of Keith Haring, an artist who continues to inspire people all over the world."},{"Title":"Love","review":"Pop and colorful picture book full of hearts and couples designs.

What I did read confirmed my initial fear: Carol Ashton has become a walk-on in her own life and, without an interesting, full life for the main character, the thin mystery has little to recommend it.There is no longer anything remotely interesting about this series but, having read all the other books in the series (I should have stopped at about #10) I had a strange compulsion to revisit what used to be an old friend. The character is so disconnected as a mother that I wonder why the writer gave her a son in the first place but she is really not connected to anyone in her life -- least of all lovers past and present. It seems almost accidental that she manages to solve any mysteries because she is so generally clueless and unexpressive. After wading through so many of the books in this series, plus the other books of this writer, I can say there are probably four books in this particular series that are good (with the first two being top of the list), and the others seem to have been phoned in.Claire McNab is a good enough writer that I can't help feeling there is a really good book lurking inside her, with characters who have depth and who express thoughts and emotions. I am not ready to give up on the writer but -- barring some future Carol Ashton book that garners rave reviews -- I have given up on this series and am looking askance at the other two series, Ms. McNab is now putting out, fearing more of the same. It's like the characters are stuck in the 1960's James Bond image of quick sex with no emotional connection.There are too many writers putting out books showing deep connections, not to mention hot sex that lasts longer than one paragraph, for me to waste my time. Count me as very disappointed that a once promising character is content to wander in a haze."},{"Title":"Fall Guy (Detective Inspector Carol Ashton Mystery)","review":"In this 16th outing for Inspector Carol Ashton, she is called into the desert to determine whether a millionaire's death is accidental or murder. She has no shortage of suspects because the dead man was universally hated. Many of her suspects had both motive and opportunity to have cut the cords to his parachute causing him to plummet to his death.This is one of the better Ashton books in recent years because it is more of a procedural than a romance. With the exception of one critical clue, the reader is privy to the clues as they come to Ashton and her team.There were two things that detracted from my giving this book a higher rating. One was the over-use of the word \\"gesticulate\\" (and it's various uses - gesticulated, gesticulating, etc.). McNab used it so often during the first half of the book, I was ready to fling the book across the room hoping to hit the trash can and not the cat. However, McNab apparently got tired of using the word and moved on to other words.The second thing that annoyed me was the fact that Ashton spent the first 99% of the book telling us how much she loved her house - even giving up her lovers for the house. How she couldn't possibly move and how it was the perfect house for her and Slinker (her cat). Then on the last page, she says to a woman that she'd be willing to sell the house and move in with the woman. Huh? What's with that? For years, we've heard about her house. We know what it cost to keep it both in terms of money and emotional sacrifice. And suddenly she's willing to give it up - without so much as an agonizing thought. No way."},{"Title":"Let's Get Financial Savvy! From Debt-Free to Investing With Ease","review":"The more money I made the more debt I acquired and the more confusing my finances became.

From Debt-Free to Investing With Ease","review":"Dr. Center-Shabazz explains the notion of financial savviness in her book, Let's Get Financial Savvy!, using this adage, &quot;You can take a million dollars from a rich man and chances are he will regain it within a year. You can give a million dollars to a poor man and chances are he will lose it within a year.&quot; The difference between the two is financial savvy. Concisely, financial savvy comes from knowledge and knowledge is power. The purpose of the book is to empower others to claim and retain their &quot;savviness&quot;.I think this book is an excellent resource for beginners who desire an understanding of financial concepts because it is not a comprehensive &quot;how-to&quot; guide. The author provides some budgeting formulas and worksheets that are largely self-explanatory and rudimentary. She does a great job dissecting complex topics and restating them in layman's terms to ensure thorough comprehension. She also covers the basics by featuring numerous financial topics ranging from budgeting (cash flow and debt management) to retirement and investment planning. Simply stated, she tells the reader what should be done without all the details on how to make it happen. This approach may be too elementary for the experienced investor who may be looking for advanced strategies and tactics. For example, on the subject of mutual funds, she discusses the benefits, types, and other fund aspects and then instructs the reader to &quot;read a lot of mutual fund reports&quot; without providing an example of how to analyze such a report to understand the terminology, indicators, or components of such reports. This reviewer is of the opinion that advice like this is akin to a parent briefing their teenager on the benefits of car ownership and then handing them the manuals to the GM models to read on their own.Nonetheless, the author's enthusiasm and dedication toward personal enrichment shines through in the book. Her &quot;can do&quot; attitude, illustrated in her &quot;How I Came To Be MSFINANCIALSAVVY&quot; chapter at the beginning of the book, resonates throughout to demonstrate that personal change is possible one step at a time.PhyllisAPOOO BookClub"},{"Title":"Let's Get Financial Savvy!

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Military memoirs of a Confederate;: A critical narrative,","review":"This book is the work of one of Lee's Lieutenants, General Edward Porter Alexander. Alexander was Longstreet's artillery commander for most of the Civil War. As such, he saw action in the Eastern Theater from 1st Manassas, through to the surrender at Appomattox Courthouse. After the war, he was encouraged by General Longstreet to write a history of his Corps. Unfortunately after completing most of the primary research, very few of the officers he contacted were willing to give him the first person authoritative accounts he wanted. What he instead was to write a memoir that almost 100 years later is still the model of historical writing.For historians the danger of memoirs is twofold. First, many authors have an axe to grind and will suffer from &quot;selective memory&quot; in retelling their experiences. Also, but less deliberately, we are all the leading stars of our lives (if you aren't you oughta be). Taking center stage, authors can appear to have a larger role in the subject than they should otherwise have. With General Alexander's book though, there is no romanticism of the &quot;Lost Cause&quot;, nor hero worship of the Lee/Jackson pantheon. Alexander dispassionately relates the campaigns he saw, with insightful critiques of the leaders of both sides. He doesn't spare himself from criticism either; you don't often see that in a memoir.Anyone with a serious interest in Civil War campaigns should have this book in their library. However, if you are looking for a Confederate mea culpa, or a social history you should look elsewhere. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Military memoirs of a Confederate;: A critical narrative,","review":"Alexander's memoirs is perhaps the best of any officer from the North and South. His narrative is brutally honest when it comes to the strategies of the Army of Northern Virginia. He is also not shy when it comes to pointing out mistakes made, even when made by Lee, Jackson, and others of the high command. Alexander writes in a very clear, and understandable way. He starts out with his being on the West Coast when the Southern states begin to secede from the Union. When his home state leaves, he reports to Lt. McPherson, later to become an admired officer in the Union army, that he must go with his state.From here, Alexander gives his first-hand experience in nearly every battle fought in the Virginia vicinity, as well as Chickamauga in the west. You may also be surprised to find out that he writes in detail about the Army of the Potomac as well, giving its officers and strategies both praise and criticism. He always uses their reports, as well as the South's, when it comes to their accounts of the battle, and their casualty lists, giving credence and respect to both sides.Alexander was one of Lee's most valuable officers, and perhaps his best artillerist. He was a man Lee could not spare. Longstreet and Jackson both appreciated his great knowledge and value. This book will not disappoint you. Many historians have given great praise and due credit to Alexander's scholarly narrative. I highly recommend this book to any Civil War buff."},{"Title":"Military memoirs of a Confederate;: A critical narrative,","review":"This book, unlike Alexander's more recently discovered personal memoir, is only for the serious scholar. His account of strategy, tactics and troop movements is almost completely unleavened with anecdotes or personal reactions. I found it to be very dry, very hard to maintain interest in. That isn't to say it's not an important book -- it is, very much so. There are areas where Alexander's knowledge falters and he should not be taken as a sole source of information, but in general, this is a very detailed and worthwhile account by an intelligent participant. But recreational reading? Not on your life. I'd recommend the author's Fighting for the Confederacy instead."},{"Title":"Military memoirs of a Confederate;: A critical narrative,","review":"Any serious student of the War for Southern Independence has learned that memoirs are a veritable minefield of self-serving half-truths and outright misrepresentations. Alexander's is the notable exception. Long allied with, and perhaps a bit beholden to, James Longstreet, Alexander tries to if not defend, at least explain his old chief, particularly at Gettysburg. Alexander's fundamental honesty triumphs, though he is at pains to put the best face on Longstreet's actions. The memoir is frank, enormously fact-filled, and about as honest as someone with a personal stake in the matter could be. An absolute must-have for any student of The War."},{"Title":"Military memoirs of a Confederate;: A critical narrative,","review":"General Alexander gives almost a blow-by-blow account of each major battle of the War Between the States, complete with Orders of Battle, casualty reports, and numbers of troops engaged.

A must-have for any library on the period"},{"Title":"Military memoirs of a Confederate;: A critical narrative,","review":"I believe this to be the most accurate, and honest, first-hand account of the Army of Northern Virginia. After reading this book, your perception of certain battlefields will never be the same. Not only was Alexander a true soldier, but also a fine scholar."},{"Title":"Military memoirs of a Confederate;: A critical narrative,","review":"The most fascinating book I've read so far on the Civil War, with so much detail that I believe it re-writes history -- I doubt many future books will be written without referencing his work. Written in a very balanced style when anayzing the actions of the north and the south and its various commanders, it provides tremendous insight into their personalities, and their brilliance and blunders. The pages devoted to Picketts Charge at Gettysburg will be a revelation to most I believe. And, blended in are pages devoted to his personal life, adding another dimension to the book."},{"Title":"Military memoirs of a Confederate;: A critical narrative,","review":"A very good critical narrative. He breaks it down each battle The ANV participated in. He gives a good account what each commander starting withBrig Gen Johnston and Brig McDowell at Manassas(Bull Run) ending withAppomattix Courthouse did and how they as commanders could have fought their battle and win. Good insight especially since he was in the commandtent with General Lee and Longstreet. This is what is lacking with mosthistorians now days. He gives very good details but some readers say thereading is dry. This is not a daily journal on a privates war. Read theTitle. It should explain itself. The narrative briefly tells what eachbrigade did if needed to help develop the battle line. He does not getinto each regimental history unless there is a particular point to make. He does break it down What each army brings to battle and casualties. Very important to my thought. Also there are a few snippets here and there to make things funny. One thing In a way before reading this book I bought the other one his personal journal \\"Fighting For the ConfederacyThe Personal recollections of General Edward Porter Alexander\\" This is amore personal side of him. It has more personal thoughts and observations on the war and the people he met during the war. I think Iwould have enjoyed The Military Memoirs even more by reading the Personalrecollections first but that is my take. In any event General Alexanderis accurate enought with his information that he can still hold his ownwith modern historians today. Even better he didn't let the \\"lost cause\\"mentality interfere with writing the Critical Memoirs."},{"Title":"Military memoirs of a Confederate;: A critical narrative,","review":"I bought this book because I like non-fiction.

Much of what he writes about is very interesting....for instance day-to-day happenings that others leave out.

A deeply uplifting story. - Prof Michael Haller"},{"Title":"Higher Learning in Islam","review":"Stanton has put together an excellent study on the nature and history of higher education in classical Islam by drawing together some of the most important literature in modern European scholarship on the subject. He begins the book by succinctly exploring the roots of Islamic perceptions of knowledge: the Prophet Muhammad, he tells us, highly valued learning, while the Koran, in turn, strongly encourages reflection over the grandeur of existence (3). These pivotal foundations lead the early Muslims to hold knowledge in high esteem.Stanton shows that the Muslims advanced significantly in almost every scientific field. Some of the most noted figures, he notes, were polymaths adept in a number of sciences, such as Ibn Sina, Farabi, Omar Khayyam, Biruni, and Nasr al-Din al-Tusi. Their multidisciplinary achievements lay in their unified vision of the cosmos, which saw phenomenal existence as organically interconnected and structured upon a divinely ordained order. The phenomenal universe was, for them, bound by a unity and religiously inspired hierarchy according to which each physical entity not only related to everything else, but was also invested with a spiritual significance/meaning for existing in the first place. This interconnection implied that the various sciences were unified at a deeper level, and that those sciences that dealt with the deeper levels were qualitatively superior. Scientific knowledge, Stanton notes, was not sought to control the universe - as in the case of Western Enlightenment science - but simply to discover the patterns as revelations or signs of a Divinity beyond them. It was this attitude that prevented the Muslims from studying the universe for its own sake or for some form of domination (as Roger Bacon would later advocate). This is one reason why science as we see it today did not arise in the Muslim world despite the phenomenal contributions made by medieval Islamic thinkers.The 11th to the 13th century saw massive translations of Islamic scholarship into European languages. Through this retranslation movement, Europe accessed not only Islamic learning, but also the Greek heritage that had influenced Islamic learning but which had been lost in Europe during the Dark Ages. Jews played a significant role in translating Arabic texts into Latin and other European languages just as the Syriac Christians had helped the Muslims access the writings of the ancient Greeks.Not only was Islamic learning absorbed by Europe, but, as Stanton, notes, so too were the structures of higher Islamic education. Frederick the II, for example, founded the University of Naples in 1224 modelling it on institutions established by royal patronage in Islamic Spain. The method by which issues related to Islamic law (shariah) were studied and disputed also had a significant impact on the way philosophical problems were formally approached in Europe.There are a few minor factual errors in Stanton's work. On p.63 he writes, \\"the Quran states that for every disease there is a cure.\\" As I recall this is a Prophet saying, not a Koranic verse. He reiterates the same mistake on p.99. On p.64 he says that Yazid was the third Ummayad caliph. He was actually the second. On p.157 he misdefines kalam as &quot;Islamic speculative philosophy&quot;. Kalam is Islamic dogmatic theology. On p.78 and 90 he contends that Islamic philosophy died after Ibn Rushd (13th century). Recent research has discounted this outdated view. Islamic philosophy flourished again in the 16th century in Iran in a form which infused Peripatetic thought with sufism (cf. THE VOYAGE AND THE MESSANGER: IRAN AND PHILOSOPHY by Henry Corbin). On p. 76 he refers to &quot;three intellectual schools: kalam, falsafah, and Asharism'&quot;. Asharism is one school of kalam, not separate from it.Despite these minor errors, Stanton's work is an exceptional contribution to a field that has not been sufficiently explored. Not only does he succeed in bringing to light the Greek influence on Islamic learning (which is well known), but he explores the rarely acknowledged impact that Islamic learning and institutions of learning had on later medieval Europe. One of his purposes behind writing the book is to expose Europe's debt to classical Islam. He writes, &quot;Histories rarely describe the great centers of learning that arose in Islamic society and the impact of these structures on institutions of higher education as they emerged in Europe [...] Through its scholars, Islamdom manifested its higher cultural achievements, and we are the beneficiaries of their unparalleled intellectual energy&quot; (ix)."},{"Title":"Interlinear NRSV-NIV Parallel New Testament in Greek and English, The","review":"I was looking for a parallel NRSV-NIV Bible, and was excited when Ifound this one because I thought it would give me the chance to reviewand enhance my college Greek as well.My excitement turned todisappointment when I opened the book and saw its tiny print andespecially the poor print quality of the interlineartranslation. Rather than put the NRSV and NIV on one page and theinterlinear on the facing page, each page contains all threetranslations. This means that all the English is in 6-point type, withsuperscripts and footnotes in 3- or 4-point. The NRSV and NIV wereobviously re-set for this edition and are still readable, but theinterlinear appears to have been photocopied, manually cut and pasted,and then reduced. There are obvious variations in type weight on thesame page (e.g. pp. 140, 389), many characters are smudged or blurred,the superscripts are little more than tiny blobs, footnotes are oftenskewed from the text (pp. 346, 393), text columns themselves aresometimes skewed (p. 399), and in one case the edge of the pastedpaper is visible above the footnote (p. 350). In all, it exhibits thequality of a poor fax, not of a scholarly publication.It took quitesome research to determine that the Greek text, from the 21st editionof Novum Testamentum Graece, dates back to 1952. This is six editionsand 41 years behind the current 27th edition from 1993.I lookforward to the day when I can buy a readable NIV-NRSV-interlinearGreek Bible, including a current version of the Greek text.

She successfully presents both sides of the arguments by summarizing the work of other scholars.But: That's basically all the book does. Chancer doesn't offer much of her own opinion, and where she does, she merely offers a rehashing of another scholar's work. This book fails to dive into the true tensions behind sadomasochism or pornography, and I found myself skimming sections in search of new, exciting ideas.This is perhaps a decent resource for someone studying the birth of third-wave feminism, but otherwise, the book is simply dated and fails to illuminate new ideas."},{"Title":"Reconcilable Differences: Confronting Beauty, Pornography, and the Future of Feminism","review":"This is an amazing book, especially if you are involved in Sociology, sexuality, gender and sexual deviance.

I can't recommend Seeing Systems too highly.Reading Leading Systems second was appropriate as it detailed what participants experience in one of Oshry's workshops (a simulation not described in detail in Seeing Systems). Often the book reads like a novel as Oshry describes the behaviors of key players or the behaviors of one of the groups as they struggle with issues in the community setting of the workshop.Oshry shares how he was thinking when he had a chance to be a participant in his own workshop and in settings in which he was personally involved. He believes a leader can do much to influence outcomes and he creatively struggles to find ways to perturb the situation toward a better life for all in the setting. This is best done with a knowledge of systems.Near the end of the book, Oshry shares an experience of being shafted by an organization and his response to it. Most of us, being members of organizations, can relate. I read an excerpt of this incident to a group of downtrodden teachers and I heard a number of them catch their breath at the power of his thoughts and words.His creative, yet peaceful and constructive response was an example of how we can be with each other and, for me, was worth the price of the book. If we can \\"see\\" systems, we can understand behaviors of others and ourselves and be influential in the co-creation of something better for all.--Jack Bender, author ofDisregarded: Transforming the School and Workplace through Deep Respect and Courage"},{"Title":"Leading Systems: Lessons from the Power Lab","review":"Barry Oshry's book about the Power Lab is the next best thing to being there. The Power Lab is a thirty something year old educational institution that has attracted men and women from all different walks of life. It has been a &quot;laboratory&quot; for Oshry, who has derived a set of truly fascinating insights about the dynamics of social systems by a constant focus upon a microworld of his own creation.As described in Seeing Systems, participants are born into the Power Lab as either members of the Elite (who own everything), the Immigrants (who own nothing), or the Middles (who own a little). There is a rich texturing of the simulation, provided in detail via a number of vignettes in the book, which help us get a sense of what life is like in these differing positions in the system. And, it turns out that life presents some daunting leadership challenges no matter where one is in the Power Lab.Through the Power Lab, and his reflections on it, Oshry has accomplished what so many experiential educators long for: He has generalized from a set of macro insights from his observations regarding the particulars of specific events. I believe that he has achieved the ideals for laboratory education that the founders of organizational development as a discipline, such as Kurt Lewin, had hoped for. Therefore, Leading Systems (and its companion volume, Seeing Systems, also published by Berrett-Koehler) occupy a very special place in the field of experiential education theory and practice, quite equivalent to the product of authors such as Argyris and his school.By using the Power Lab's imitation of life, Oshry offers some profound insights on the dynamics of power at the level of the world stage, and I would recommend these to anyone who wants the possibility of global peace to be anything other than lofty rhetoric. In a simple, but compelling way, he shows the reader how &quot;systems make choices&quot; that, then, affect the thoughts, feelings, and actions of everyone who is a member of the system. So, for example, Americans living in a system that chooses &quot;individuation&quot; are, predictably, going to misunderstand and criticize the Chinese, who live in a system which values &quot;integration.&quot;When the driving principles of systems differ, it is very easy, and human, for the members of contrasting systems to begin to express contempt for the other system in general and for the people who are &quot;stupid, gutless, corrupt, etc...&quot; enough to live in it. Combine mutual contempt with eqivalent access to armaments and a contest over scarce resources, and you've got a near perfect breeding ground for war.There are a lot of big ideas in this little book, and that's a real relief from a variety of books with a completely opposite construction. In addition to the book's stimulus to the mind, there are many nice touches that make the book easy to use: the author's crisp and cartoon-like illustrations, the structured reflection exercises sprinkled liberally throughout the book, and, last but not least, his embrace of the &quot;real&quot;, the &quot;human&quot;.Oshry wants us to look at ourselves unromatically. In a way which is somewhat akin to Gurdjieff, Oshry wants us to understand how completely bound up we are by the systems we live in and how doomed we are to live automatic, sonambulent lives, if we don't understand the forces that are shaping our experience. But, if we do understand them, we have the power to shape and change any system we care about and any structure which threatens us. Therefore, in perhaps his most important contribution, Oshry offers us an antidote to the oppressive and disheartening social diseases of cynicism, alienation and boredom.There are some difficulties with a book which is so intimately involved with an event. One senses that the next best thing to being there is a pale rendering of the systems insights that are available to those who take the trip to the Power Lab itself. There are many nuances of intensity and understanding that come through in the book, but were not, to me, completely accessible for one who hadn't been there.That said, the student of systems thinking will find much to profit from in this potent little tome."},{"Title":"Leading Systems: Lessons from the Power Lab","review":"Really useful books about complex system issues are hard to find. Many offer ideas that are either too hard to imagine implementing or are too familiar, but claimed as original. Then there are some that actually suggest that we can overcome or even manage things that feel like they are just so unmanageable. Imagine being told to manage something like chaose! I'd embrace it first!For those of us who work with other human beings - though at times, who knows - Oshry's two books make the issues about living and working with those other people readable and useable. I shared my copy of &quot;Seeing Systems&quot; with a colleage professor friend of mine. After reading a few chapters he told me that there was &quot;nothing new here&quot;. The very next day he called again and said that not only had he read the entire book, but he arose having actually remembered what he read, and saw lots of opportunities to use the ideas in his university peer relations and consulting practice.&quot;Leading Systems&quot;, like Oshry's earlier book, makes it easier to grasp what is so complicated in system life. The stories about the &quot;Power Lab&quot; are in the realm of archetypes for system thinkers. Rather than telling us just how to do it - do we really need another title about leadership tips from historical figures - Oshry paints pictures filled with the feelings, confusions and revelations that many of us can relate to.If you are looking for some erudite, academic tome, or the latest &quot;rah-rah do it this way&quot;, or someone telling you that you just need to make it a bit more complicated, then don't read these two books. If however, you want a more simple but deep set of primers that will fill you with good ideas about your organizational context and your options - and your responsibility for what you create - read these books."},{"Title":"Leading Systems: Lessons from the Power Lab","review":"I have followed the work of Barry Oshry for many years. &quot;Leading Systems&quot; is an illuminating read !

So many of the other &quot;leadership guru&quot; books borrow from each other and simply re-scramble the words.....the result? Nothing new. Oshry has a way of speaking from the heart, but with an anthropologists lense that provides real clarity amidst the chaos we live in every day.

If you haven't noticed a system encircling you, look again at your socioeconomic group, which governs you in far more ways than you suspect. To teach power, leadership, and systems, Oshry runs an experiential program in which participants totally immerse themselves in an \\"assigned\\" system, usually by living and working in a particular socioeconomic realm (as in \\"Who Wants to be a Millionaire\\" or a pauper). He has taught this \\"Power Lab\\" for thirty years. In this book, Oshry looks at human systems and at lessons from the Power Lab experiences. His insights are casually written, but well crafted.

It is based on a construct in which there are 'elites', 'middles' and 'immigrants', each with a defined role and each, in a sense, dependent on the others. They are thrown into a situation which is systemically designed to throw the interdependencies and tensions into sharp relief. This is, of course, a reasonable reflection of the situation ordinarily found inside a typical organisation, although apparently built in a somewhat stark and exaggerated form. The book does not make it clear whether the failure of participants to challenge and overthrow the entire framework is a product of the rules, the expectations of the participants or the dynamics of the system.If you accept the basic framework, the messages that come out of the experience are useful, but hardly surprising."},{"Title":"Leading Systems: Lessons from the Power Lab","review":"Excellent.

Not everything can be distilled into a Descartes reductionism; thus it is with the Power Lab.This book is a door to a better reality, or a path to danger. Yes, that is very dramatic. But so is life.

It provides a very full and clear understanding of the different question and content types found on the TOEFL exam. It also gives numerous practice exercises that reinforce skills necessary to achieving a higher score on the TOEFL. There's a great list of idiomatic expressions for the listening section and vocbulary terms for the reading section, both with fill-in exercises, too. In addition, all of the listening, grammar, and reading exercises are wonderfully written. I have the sense that Rogers really put a lot of care into the material. The book comes with a CD which contains one practice test. There are also two practice tests at the end of the book. Drawbacks: For $42.95, Complete Guide to the TOEFL does not come with the tapes for the listening material ($99.95), the transcripts or the answers ($15.00). So, you're going to have to pay around $170 to really &quot;get&quot; this book. In addition, the TWE section of the book is not too stellar.

FBorFW is definitely that kind of strips.It was really an joy to see all the character develop over time. The Patterson family really portray a &quot;normal&quot; family. While I adore them, with the exception of April in some cases, I really wished Lynn would make a separate collection for the supporting characters. Especially Lawrence, Gordon, Brian, and Weed. I really like this collection especially because of Lawrence.Lawrence, one of Michael's best friend, is revealed to be something no one would have guessed. It indeed is controversial, but the way Lynn wrote it, it had sincerity and sympathy in the whole story. I read about some trouble she went through doing this strip, but in the end I think it is one of her best strips out there, along with Farley's death, and Michael and Deanna's reunion.I mainly like the strip because of the Lawrence story.

It's not the only survival guide you'll ever need, nor is it best survival guide that you could possibly find. What it is, is a starting point for every 19 year-old who was scooped up out of a random city block, and might be dumped into a jungle, desert, ocean, or snow bank in the next six months.The breadth of the content covered is remarkable. The writers have tried to literally talk about everything that you might need to know in a survival situation, from ways to not be so cold and wet, to elementary mongoose catching. The table of contents reveals seventeen chapters which include, but are not limited to the following topics: medicine, tool-making, water, fire, shelter, food, and guides to specific environments. Four appendices offer color photographs of plants, weather indicators, and poisonous snakes.The information presented in each chapter is, no doubt, based on the decades of experience accumulated by soldiers in the field. I am admittedly not a wilderness expert, but can say that every suggestion seems entirely plausible to me, and that the authors have thought of things that might never have occurred to me. There are detailed instructions, for example, on the construction of a gill net for fishing, in addition to four other means of trapping fish, three types of hooks and four types of fishing spear. One person, even a clever person is not likely to come up with twelve possible solutions to one problem in a stressful situation, and that is a major strength of the manual.There are deficiencies in this work, of course, most of which are unavoidable given its purpose. The authors have presented useful ideas, but occasionally sacrificed some important detail in order to keep the explanations simple. The section on \\"field expedient weapons,\\" for example, presents an illustrated guide to stone tool manufacture without any discussion of suitable materials. I can unfortunately say from experience that trying to make a useful tool form the wrong rock, and most rocks are wrong, can be a frustrating and dangerous waste of energy. Still, it's probably better to have the idea than to have no idea at all.The final selling point for me, and one likely underappreciated by both the producers of the manual and its intended audience, is its sheer entertainment value. The terse, and sometimes brutal, prose of military technical writing at times drifts into comedic genius. I submit as an example one entry form a bulleted list on catching small animals:\\"Beaver - Wait for the beaver to come on land, then club it, drop-kick it, hit it with a rock, or catch it by the tail. It is a sturdy animal, so if you catch it by the tail, swing it in a pendulum motion until it begins to relax, then swing it against a tree or the ground or use a noose to kill it. Another way to get a beaver is to dig out the beaver dam so the water drains. The beaver will come to inspect the damage at which time you can straddle the channel and grab the beaver by its tail as it swims through. Immediately start to swing the beaver as above. CAUTION: Take care to keep it from biting you. Its bite will leave a large wound.\\"Picture a tentative Joe-Jack from Brooklyn, compelled by hunger to temporarily disregard the welfare of what he thinks might be a beaver (there's no clear picture of one), straddling a brook and pondering the execution of any one of the recommended maneuvers. If that doesn't cheer you up... well, it's still a pretty useful book."},{"Title":"United States Army Survival Manual","review":"before the impending nuclear apocalypse.I was afraidI was petrifiedKept thinking I could never livewithout you by my sideBut I spent so many nightsthinking how you did me wrongI grew strongI learned how to carry onand so you're backfrom outer spaceI just walked in to find you herewith that sad look upon your faceI should have changed my stupid lockI should have made you leave your keyIf I had known for just one secondyou'd be back to bother meGo on now go walk out the doorjust turn around now'cause you're not welcome anymoreweren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbyeyou think I'd crumbleyou think I'd lay down and dieOh no, not II will surviveas long as i know how to loveI know I will stay aliveI've got all my life to liveI've got all my love to giveand I'll surviveI will survive...because of this manual."},{"Title":"United States Army Survival Manual","review":"This book does not address current survival situations (Natural or manmade).

The disparate story lines are brilliantly joined after more twists and turns than a bleak mountain roadway.

Refusing to read about it when the story is a very sympatheitc read is silly."},{"Title":"Past Imperfect","review":"When I started reading Past Imperfect I felt that I had made a mistake in downloding this book, but i was determined to give it a try and I am glad I did. The jumping back and forth in the 30 year span can get confusing at times and I found myself going back to earlier chapters to make sure I was following along properly. All in all I am glad I finished it and I did enjoy it even though it did take some time and drive to get fully into the story."},{"Title":"Past Imperfect","review":"Very slow to start,but a very exciting ending. Dominic a very passionate and interesting character. I would suggest this book to someone with a lot of patience. A long book!"},{"Title":"Past Imperfect","review":"I took this book on holiday with me because I wanted a nice chunky novel to last me for my three weeks in the sun. It was the best book I read, in fact I read it twice and I enjoyed even more the second time around!The plot, which at first seems complex but eventually follows several simple threads, follows a tragic car accident in California in the 1990s in which a young boy is left fighting for his life, and a horrendous assault in Provence in the 1960s where a young boy eventually dies from internal injuries. What ties these two boys together seems to be a life after death experience, and the California survivor suddenly finds himself able to recall the last days of Christian Roussel, viciously attacked then murdered by the debonair and sadistic Duclos, an up and coming French Politician.The story jumps between America, France and England as the threads of these two young lives are slowly and inevitably bought together by a dogged and emotionally scarred French Detective, Dominic Fornier whose guilt over Christian's death 30 years previously has never died.Moving back and forth between two continents and through time itself, the story steadily heads towards its staggering climax, proving that revenge and redemption can sometimes be served up in the same dish.This is a cracker of a novel, and has the potential to be made into a really good movie."},{"Title":"Past Imperfect","review":"Past ImperfectThis was a hard book for me to rate.The author says the book is \\"a crime thriller with a difference\\" and I think that is a great description to use. The book starts off with two separate story lines that eventually merge into one. I found the first story line and what I will call the merged story line to be excellent. I found the second story line to be slow, tedious and boring.The writing is fantastic, the author really knows how to tell a great tale. The characters, events and locations are very well developed and believable. There is plenty of action and suspense in the first story line and merged story line to make you not want to put the book down. I found those parts to be top quality reads.I was a tad slow to work out how the two story lines tied in and, to my great dismay, when I did there was still a lot of tying in to go. This is the part that I found slow, tedious and boring. It was a real struggle for me to read it BUT I can see where others might not mind the approach taken. A lot of copies of this book have been sold and it has a high rating so I can accept that I am in the minority here but I need to tell it how I found it. I have not described this story line in detail as I do not want to spoil it for the reader.Would I read another book by this author? Definitely YES!, and probably in the very near future."},{"Title":"Past Imperfect","review":"I picked up Past Imperfect by John Matthews and couldn't put it down until I finished. The character description, plot and local knowledge is incredibly detailed. This is one of the best books I have had the pleasure of reading in quiet a long time. No cookie cutter writing here. I do not understand why John Matthews doesn't have a big following in the U.S.A. already. Can't wait to read his other books, even if I have to order them from the U.K.A MUST READ for any serious crime/mystery fan with the wits for more involved stories."},{"Title":"Past Imperfect","review":"This has been one of my best kindle finds all year. Two intertwining stories thirty years apart: a boy attacked in a lonely Provence wheat field in one, another boy in a car accident in California thirty years later. The link explored between these two boys, first through parapsychology then the criminal justice system makes this probably the most excitingly different legal thrillers it's been my pleasure to read.I'm a big fan of John Grisham, but certainly he's never attempted anything as bold as this. Also, you will get deeper detail on some thrillers. For me personally I found this a sharper pace to the average Turow or Grisham's The Chamber or indeed The Rainmaker, one of my favorites of his. Sometimes that detail will add to the fabric and richness of a book. Certainly I found that to be the case here, as I found myself totally immersed in the atmosphere of the small Provence village, Taragnon, brought to life so vividly that I felt I knew all of its characters and felt sad to leave them when I finished this book.The parapsychology elements too had me totally gripped. I suppose that's the thing: if some things grab you, you'll want more of them; if not, less. In the end though this book is so much more than just a basic thriller. It's a richly created book that combines a mystery, a love story, a quest for justice and thirty years in a French family's life as they come to terms with tragedy and pursue that justice. It was also refreshing to read something which explored French life and its justice system rather than being set once again in downtown Boston or Philly. If you're fed up with repetitive clone-like thrillers and are looking for something different, dive in and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Past Imperfect","review":"One of the best crime and legal thrillers I have read in some time. The separate story lines merge halfway through in a very cleverly developed theme. Very hard to put down and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Past Imperfect","review":"Two tragedies separated by three decades and linked by the dedication of a detective, Past Imperfect quickly pulls the reader into the crime, the tragedy, the apparent escape and the retribution to follow. In the French countryside one 10-year-old boy accepts a ride that ends in his death and his killer walks free, seemingly untouchable, for 30 years. Then in California another 10-year-old is yanked from his family by a tragic car accident, emerging from a coma only to be haunted by dreams in which he befriends another boy who has also lost his family. Back in England, hypnosis reveals the new friend is French and may well be a boy murdered by a pedophile. But can the detective who always felt the wrong man was convicted right the wrongs of the past and bring a killer to justice? I literally read it until my Kindle died and my eyes were screaming for a break. Loved it. Not just the mystery and past life regression, but the visit into the French judicial system as well. Terrific book."},{"Title":"Past Imperfect","review":"So many strong characters. Many nuances with each of them. Was afraid of the ending. Never disappointed in the many places the story went."},{"Title":"Past Imperfect","review":"Although it started out as two separate stories with so many years between them, the book caught my imagination and I found it intriguing but easy to read. I loved the very different storyline, the character and scenery descriptions. I will be looking for other works by John Matthews!"},{"Title":"Past Imperfect","review":"This is a very stylish and atmospheric book and extremely well-written too. The writing in fact borders on the literary so might not appeal to those who like their writing more slam-bang and simplistic. Some writing samples were given by another reviewer, but actually each part of those sentences says something slightly different and adds another facet. Stripped down, I don't think they'd carry the same meaning or weight, or at least that's how I feel.&#8232;&#8232;The pace too was very good. Indeed there were points where periods of 10-12 years were caught up on in only a few pages with characters, which is probably why for a book covering thirty years it managed to achieve such a strong thriller rather than family-saga pace. I found myself totally absorbed throughout. The writing reminded me of John Connolly at this best with a splash of Stephen King. It was far more mean-edged and imaginative than the average legal thriller. &#8232;&#8232;I notice a lot of glowing press reviews, but since one side of my family are from Western Ireland in particular I took notice of the Cork Examiner review: 'One of the most compelling novels I've read... an ambitious and big novel which will keep you enthralled to its last page.' I would wholeheartedly agree. I think this is one occasion where the newspaper reviewers have it right."},{"Title":"Past Imperfect","review":"This is not the kind of book that you casually skim through. This is a book where you find yourself immersed in another world, or two worlds really. The pace is slow but deliberate. The story draws you in, little by little, into the complex connection of events and characters until you feel like you know these people, as well as the times in which they live.I would also compare the writing of John Matthews to Scott Turow. All authors who wish to be taken seriously as writers should aspire to the meticulous high standards with which this book was written."},{"Title":"Past Imperfect","review":"The United Kingdom has produced countless number of great Authors. I am adding Author JOHN MATTHEWS to that royal list.\\"PAST IMPERFECT\\" is among the best detective/mystery novels I have been favoured to read.A British Solictior relocates his wife and young son to California where he passes the Bar Exam and begins his structured assent to being a highly successful Attorney. December, 1994 while returning to their San Diego home from a weekend visit with friends they are involved in a horrific auto accident. Both parents die. Eyran, 10 years old is the only survivor. His Uncle Stuart rushes from London to care for his nephew and eventually takes him back to London. Eryan has nightmares and is soon taken to a Psychiatrist.August, 1963 in Provence, France a boy of ten years old is found clinging to life in a wheat field. He had been sexually assaulted and brutally beaten. The boy eventually dies and a suspect is charged and convicted. Police Warrant Officer Dominic Fornier who had worked the case and argued with his superiors over his doubts as to the guilt of the suspect was not satisfied.Eyran's nightmares almost thirty years later bring the two boys together and the novel explodes.Dealing with Past Life Therapy; young Eyran, his Uncle Stuart and now Chief Inspector Dominic Fornier are brought together.This novel is so neatly written; entwining two young boys' tragedies spread over a span of thirty years, bringing them together with a dedicated police inspector's relentless pursuit of truth and justice.I was kept in suspense which grew even greater to the very last page. This is one of the BEST novels by a British Author I have ever read. If you enjoy a detective novel with a parnormal twist, this will excite you. GET IT!Michael Phelps"},{"Title":"Past Imperfect","review":"I thought I was going to like this book, it has an interesting start but early in the second chapter I deleted the book from my Kindle and was glad I didnt pay for it. I was repulsed by several pages written with detailed description of the pick up and rape of young boy by a pedophile. I cant patronize an author that seems a little too intimate and comfortable writing in this way, it is not necessary. Could be a good book but I will never know."},{"Title":"Past Imperfect","review":"It took me several chapters to figure out what was going on and where this book was heading. I even, frequently, re-read the book description to remind myself what the book was supposed to be about.That said, I stuck with it and, about half way through the book, I DID get into it and, from that point, read it straight through to the end, totally, compulsively, immersed in the story, in one long - day and a half session of constant reading. It was an intriguing premise!One other quibble, there were SO MANY minor characters popping in and out, that I constantly found myself using the Search This Book feature on my kindle - which allows you to enter a name or keyword and get links to previous mentions of a character or place, etc. - to remind myself who the character was and what his role was in the story. I don't think I would have, could have, stuck with this book all the way through without this tool . . . there were THAT MANY minor characters and events to remember and keep track of.This book could have been more skillfully edited. I feel it was over-written."},{"Title":"Past Imperfect","review":"I gave this book three stars only because it had a lot of switching back and forth. The book got more interesting past the middle.It was a fairly decent crime story.r.sinclair"},{"Title":"Past Imperfect","review":"Thought this would be a great book but it turned my stomach very quickly!

My only beef would be the incorrect spellings and typos which seem to populate e-books as a rule. You can't expect spell check to know the difference between \\"bare\\" and \\"bear,\\" for example - someone has to READ THE BOOK and PROOFREAD it properly. (not just this book)"},{"Title":"Past Imperfect","review":"kept me up all night. Interesting concept. Good writing style, Hope to see more from this author. Too much published today is same theme regurgitated again and again. Nice to find something new, especially with some historical background"},{"Title":"Past Imperfect","review":"John Mathews is an excellent writer. The story was so developed I had to know what happened, had to finish it. The problem with this book is Mr. Mathews kept writing and writing. There was nothing left for me to imagine every little thing was spelled out, to the point it made for a rough read. Some examples of this (not really spoilers):I did not need to know just about every song on Louis' s bar jukebox.Lambourne studied dozens of other psychiatrists, I did not need all of them listed.Corbiex has MS, 6 pages of how his symptoms were making it impossible to play racquetball and to take out his boat was not necessary.There was so much description that was unnecessary at points it just made the book seem to drag on and on. Just like minor characters, they would pop up and in the end held absolutely no relevance. I used the 'search in book' feature on my kindle more in this book than I have the since I have owned. Trying to see if I had met a character before or if they would appear in the book more.When it comes down to it I will recommend the book, making it very clear the person needs to be committed for the long haul. I would have loved to give this book a 5 star if all the unnecessary fluff wasn't there."},{"Title":"Past Imperfect","review":"I loved the book and the storyline, but it was just a little too wordy for me in places. Sometimes using a $100 word to explain a 10-cent sentence can destroy an entire paragraph. Still a good book."},{"Title":"Past Imperfect","review":"This book took me a couple of days to finish. I sometimes struggled with all the details, but it was all very much worth the read."},{"Title":"Past Imperfect","review":"I have intended for a while to read this book. So happy I did. Spell binding--just my kind of book."},{"Title":"Past Imperfect","review":"With the introduction of all the players right off the bat, I found this a little hard to get into. However, after a few chapters, this book became one I didn't want to put down. I was really shocked with the ending, or what I thought was the ending! This book would make a great movie."},{"Title":"Past Imperfect","review":"I thought because this is a story based in France and involving the French criminal system I would not like it, but it was an excellent story with good pacing. There were times when I got lost in the switching between eras, but I think those plot devices were necessary to telling the story. All-in-all a surprisingly good, exciting and suspenseful read, with characters that were humanly faulty and believable."},{"Title":"Past Imperfect","review":"This book draws you in wonderfully. The depth of description of scenes and characters make you feel as if you are there not just in the scenes but with the characters many thoughts too. This makes the characters three dimensional and very real. The small Provencal village in 1963 came alive vividly and for me were some of the best parts of the book. Interesting too to learn something about the French criminal justice system on the way. We know so much about how our own police and legal system works, but so little about others.These elements alone would have made this book stand out, but then it went to another level entirely as the link between the two boys was revealed. I read the final 200 pages in a single 4-5 hour burst, couldn't break off for a minute. Amongst the best crime and legal thrillers I've read in years."},{"Title":"Past Imperfect","review":"I kept expecting more. I'm sure the author did his research, but it just seemed such a simple story with a predictable ending."},{"Title":"Past Imperfect","review":"Not often you get a thriller that is intelligent but also gripping and pacey. Past Imperfect scores on both fronts. Sure, some of that thrill is built around the psychological link between two boys, but that for me made it all the more exciting and different. The way the pieces all fall into place will take your breath away and the final 200 pages were probably the fastest paced I've ready in any book.Was going to say 'an author to watch', but then checking back on the blurb I see this book has already been entered in a top ten all time best legal thrillers list. I can see why now!"},{"Title":"Past Imperfect","review":"I loved the book. It kept me alert to the storyline all the way through. I will definitely look for more from John Matthews. I recommend this book if you like legal mysteries."},{"Title":"Past Imperfect","review":"The story was gripping from the beginning. However, it was complex enough that I decided to make a few notes for myself. There were time differences and many interesting characters - all with different missions. Once I got the names and places into my head, it was a book I hated to put down. The author provided a lot of detail. He developed characters and described places very well! It's one of the best books I've ever read!"},{"Title":"Past Imperfect","review":"I found this book interesting since it had a \\"different\\" approach to mysteries. It is interesting the way the author brought in the concept of a spirit revealing itself to another person some 30 years later."},{"Title":"Past Imperfect","review":"I loved this book from the get go! It definitely lived up to it's &#34;thriller&#34; title! One of the better mysteries I've had the opportunity to read. Do plan on looking for more from this writer."},{"Title":"Past Imperfect","review":"I was attracted to this author after recently reading The Second Amendment. This is probably the most intelligent legal thriller I've read since Scott Turow's 'Presumed Innocent', but that's primarily because it's so different to the many legal thrillers I've read in between. Some of them quite repetitive plot-wise if I'm brutally frank.The author here for once takes a risk, trying to blend a standard crime-legal plot with the paranormal. Something not easy to pull off convincingly, I might add. There are some subtle nuances and character interplays going in the background that not everyone will get, but to those who do they'll appreciate that not a word has been wasted. Even the sub-plots have resonance and add to the whole - particularly the loops and hurdles Duclos finds himself jumping through to try and evade justice. For those who missed it, this is one of the most intriguing reflections on karma I've read in a crime novel. In short, even if justice doesn't always catch up with bad people, they end up punishing themselves through their actions."},{"Title":"Past Imperfect","review":"Full Disclosure: I bought this book when Amazon was offering it for free for the kindle. The same offer seems to come around every couple of months.The story is fine; there are two overarching plots throughout the book: the story of a young boy murdered in the 1960s and the surrounding investigation, and the modern story of another young boy experiencing psychological issues after a car wreck. The book is described as a mystery, but since the reader knows everything about the murder, the real mystery is the connection between the two stories.This could have been a great book if it wasn't so ridiculously bloated. Nothing else about this book could possibly be called a \\"mystery\\" since the author is determined to tell us everything that has ever crossed every character's mind, ever. There is a scene from the point of view of just about every major character, including the murderer, so for me there was no real intrigue.Matthews also never uses one word when ten will do. Here's an example: \\"Dominic noticed Poullain openly flinch; then his head cocked slightly, as if he hadn't heard properly, his eyes darting fleetingly across the desk top for explanations before looking up again. The surprise showed in his face.\\"Basically, either of those sentences could have told us that Poullain was obviously and visibly surprised, but for some reason we had to have both. It would be a minor quibble if it didn't happen multiple times on every page. The very next paragraph tells us that a character \\"...exhaled audibly and waved a hand to one side. A dismissive gesture, as if the whole affair was suddenly unworthy of his emotions.\\"One of the cardinal rules for writing fiction is: \\"Show, don't tell\\". Matthews shows us and tells us, and very little of the showing and telling do anything to advance the plot. Halfway through the book, after an entire paragraph about the canapes offered at a dinner party (a party which had little to do with the plot) I had to stop reading. I finally picked it up and finished it a few months later.The plot finally picks up about 75% of the way through, the connection between the two stories is revealed, a supernatural element comes into play, and the book finally comes to a pretty satisfying conclusion typical of most modern thrillers (Jeffrey Deaver, etc.) It just took way too long to get there."},{"Title":"Past Imperfect","review":"Superb research and insight into the perversity and complexity if the French criminal justice system. Set un a corner if France that is not quite fictitious, touches a nerve with anyone who knows how clumsily the French system deals with pedohiles"},{"Title":"Past Imperfect","review":"I would recommend this book to readers that enjoy a lot of mystery and suspense spread across three continents. Very well written and intriguing. A superb read."},{"Title":"Past Imperfect","review":"This was one of the best mystery/thriller books I've read in a long time. There are many characters and twists to this amazing story that weaves the lives & death of one boy and past life regression of another, their families, the police detective and the criminal Alain Duclos. I highly recommend this book for a page turning fun read!"},{"Title":"Past Imperfect","review":"It was a little slow in the beginning but was a very good read. I would recommend this to others."},{"Title":"Past Imperfect","review":"Strong on atmosphere and character detail, with a shifting perspective between 1960s France and the current day with another boy in a car accident.The link between the two was well-handled, with some interesting detail on the rift between standard psychiatry and the more unconventional PLR territory. This made it very different to the normal crime or legal thriller, though all the time the unfolding main investigation keeps you gripped. For a long book, the pacing is extremely brisk, particularly the final 150 pages.Another reviewer mentioned the Sixth Sense and I wouldn't disagree with that. Sort of a combination of that and The Client, the Grisham book where a young boy is the client. If you're looking for something different, put this high on your reading list."},{"Title":"Past Imperfect","review":"The book is long and hard to put it down. I enjoyed it. It is a good story with a good ending."},{"Title":"Past Imperfect","review":"Takes the standard crime and legal thriller to another level with its step into the paranormal. This could have stretched credibility, but it was deftly and surely handled as these elements were put under the spotlight of the French legal system, exactly as you'd imagine would happen in real life. I bought into it 100%.The depictions of life in a rural Provence village in the 1960s were captured fantastically. These contrasted with the modern sections with psychiatrists, computer tracking and high speed trains. A gripping blend of classic crime thriller, atmospheric mystery and a love story too! Because make no mistake, the heart of this book is about justice and redemption. I found myself ripped apart as the tragedy grips Monique. But can she survive re-living the loss of her son 30 years later to finally see his killer brought to justice?Exceptional! One of my best kindle finds of the past few years, though I see this was originally published by Penguin books. Which I suppose explains the high level of writing and editing."},{"Title":"Past Imperfect","review":"The story jumps around too much and does not connect well. I am reading it now and am having a hard time getting through it."},{"Title":"Past Imperfect","review":"The plot of Past Imperfect is intriguing, but the author's style is so boring that by the midway point I felt as if I were marching through molassas."},{"Title":"Past Imperfect","review":"Read this book. It is compelling and timely. Indeliably drawn characters, a strong integrity of place - especially in France, and a realistic, fast-paced riveting plot draw the reader into the drama of Christian Rosselot's murder. The plots develop so gradually and against such an innocent setting that the horror of the crime comes alive. Over thirty years, this crime, with its miscarriage of justice haunts Detective Fornier. From Valerie and Louis, the American song-loving dancers in their juke box bar, he draws a sense of innocence and stability. Louis directs his attention to Monique, who provides an unfailing stability. It is she who urges him first, to fulfill his professional dreams and later, to seek justice for her son and for the drunken oddball Machanaud. This ordinariness serves him well as he skirts the murky world of \\"rent boys\\", the Varcheret pimps, the hitman Chapeau and the amoral politician Alain Duclos.But it is memories of the murdered Christian that haunt them- Fornier, Monique, and Duclos. For it is Christian's innocence which cries across three decades, touching each of them, rendering each vulnerable. Eyran exists as the vehicle through which Christian, as \\"Jo-Jo\\", gradually reveals himself in a psychological drama in which Lambourne and Calvan represent different approaches to PLT. At Duclos' pretrial, legal theatrics revolve around this therapy and threaten justice. National political scandal supersedes the controversial therapy, igniting murder plots, high speed escapes, and Duclos' unexpectedly \\"just\\" violent death. With justice providentally served, Fornier seeks his lost innocence in the wheat field that unifies the story. This compelling book invites reflection of modern lifestyles and the \\"newsworthy\\" horrors that permeate modern existence. Yet, it is an enjoyable read. Like life, the story develops gradually until all is right with the world."},{"Title":"Past Imperfect","review":"I normally don't write book reviews, but I couldn't help but do it for Past Imperfect. Although there were a few scenes that offended my sense of morality and decency, the overall story was incredibly well written, the characters were very believable, and the twisting plot kept me riveted well into the wee hours of the morning. I couldn't put the book down. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Past Imperfect","review":"As an avid reader of mysteries, I really appreciate anyone that can develop a different plot. This is a very uniquely plotted book and since the characters are partly from France on top of the unique nature of the story line: it is very well done. I have another book on my Kindle from Mr. Matthews and now know I will enjoy that as well. Touching on family homes in the U.S., U.K. and France, the descriptions of places as well as the feel of these communities is concise, yet right. The book wraps around six degrees of separation in life and how at any moment, any one of us can become a neighbor and unintended voyeur to something unforeseen."},{"Title":"Past Imperfect","review":"I'm so sad about this book. I was really looking forward to reading it. However, the writing was so distracting because of incomplete sentences and poor punctuation, I could not get thru the first chapter. This obviously British author either tried to reinvent proper English (mistaking it for his 'literary style', or he never bothered learning it in the first place! I wish I could have gotten further into the story to at least be able to comment on it, but his grammar style was just too distracting. Needless to say, I am just happy I didn't spend good money for this book."},{"Title":"Chevrolet: The Coming of Age--An Illustrated History of Chevrolet's Passenger Cars, 1911-1942","review":"This book is packed with photos! Includes photos of the overall body and hundreds of detail photos of design features that illustrate changes made from one model year to the next, such as changes to gauges, wheel covers, badges, trim, etc. Sixteen pages in the center are all color. Many early Chevrolet print ads are also reproduced here. It is organized by year with a chapter devoted to each model year, except that 1911 - 1922 are covered in 4 chapters. I especially like the art deco details from the 1930s and '40s.On the hardcover edition, the front flap states: \\"The products of the Chevrolet Motor Division are studied on an annual model change basis ...\\"The book is intended to be an aid to those interested in identifying significant features and design characteristics of the cars. In addition to a study of the overall appearance, much attention has been given to study of the details as for example the wheelcovers, hood ornaments, door knobs, dashboard instruments, etc.\\"It has been the intent of the author to provide a ready reference for those interested in the evolution of the Chevrolet passenger cars. From the point of view of the restorer seeking to define his needs to that of an interested bystander simply indulging in nostalgia, the intent has been admirably achieved.\\"This is a very comprehensive study of the design of early Chevrolet cars illustrated with hundreds of photos. It is a keeper in my library."},{"Title":"Chevrolet: The Coming of Age--An Illustrated History of Chevrolet's Passenger Cars, 1911-1942","review":"Very nice book, however I have a 1926 Chevy and this book skipped that year for some reason.

I'm not that into plain recipe books because, really, there are zillions of recipes on the Internet. So, when I look for a cookbook, I also look for something that has stories, theories, history, culture and so on. This book is delightful, not only are there lovely stories about the author's experiences, it is also filled with Greek history, anthropology, and culture. And the recipes? I only tried a couple of recipes in the book so far and they were just absolutely popping with flavor."},{"Title":"The Olive and the Caper: Adventures in Greek Cooking","review":"As an avid reader of cookbooks, the title of The Olive and the Caper, intrigued me enough to purchase it and I am so glad I did. Even if I never cooked a thing from it, I learned so much about Greek culture and cuisine, that it is worth having for the information and insights alone. Ms. Hoffman's personal anecdotes, mythological connections, historical references, and etymological asides, enlighten the reader without sounding pedantic or didactic. However, it is precisely these stories that accompany the recipes that make me want to try them. What a wonderful way to educate and entertain ! I first read it as I would read a travel book of a place I intend to visit then, I went back for the simple, yet elegant recipes Ms. Hoffman includes in the book. I have always enjoyed Greek food, but have been reluctant to try preparing it. The arrangement of the recipes in the book and and the format make it easy to read and follow. For each recipe she offers alternative suggestions for ingredient not easily available. The step by step process is not intimidating to a beginner. Ms. Hoffman's respect and love for the Greek people and the food that represent them emboldened me to try making the dishes. I love peasant food, I grew up eating the food from my own ethnic background and have a deep gustatory appreciation for how \\"lowly\\" food can be prapared to elevate one's taste buds. She did exactly that in this book. Thank you, Ms. Hoffman, for motivating me to try preparing Greek food at home and for adding so much to my knowledge of Greek culture and cuisine. I even tried some of the Greek words she introduces in the book at a Greek restaurant and impressed the daylights out of the waiter."},{"Title":"The Olive and the Caper: Adventures in Greek Cooking","review":"This book is a thorough collection with broad varieties and styles of Greek recipies.

I prefer to give people the benefit of the doubt. This, however, is an exception. I have been driven to take the time to write a review (which I almost never do) because I recently made a stuffed eggplant dish from a recipe included in this book. First, the recipe called for 6lb of eggplant. The quantity demanded by the recipe isn't the problem. The issue is that Ms. Hoffman calls for this massive amount of eggplant to be placed in a 12in skillet - along with 1lb of ground beef. Those that are experienced cooks (or even those that are not that experienced) will know that 1lb of ground beef fills up a 12in pan quite sufficiently. There is no room for 1lb of eggplant, let alone 6. I had to painstakingly remove the eggplant from the skillet and place it in a 2qt saucepan to be cooked.My misadventure with Greek cooking continued when I had finished cooking the eggplant. The 2c of crushed tomatoes called for by the recipe were completely reduced and consumed. I had to add 2c more based on my better judgement. When the eggplant was finally ready, I scanned the recipe again and again for when I was supposed to add the eggplant to create the stuffed eggplant. There was, in fact, no mention of when to stuff the eggplant shells. I ask you, how does one write a recipe for stuffed eggplant and fail to let the reader know when to stuff the eggplant?I am forced to conclude that Ms. Hoffman never made this dish, though she implies that she has, given that it is included in a cookbook that she purports to have written. This is more than just irresponsible. It suggests an inattention to detail and a disregard for those who, in good faith, purchase her book. As a chef myself, I would never write a cookbook that includes a recipe that I never used. To do so would suggest that I did not care about my readers. I strongly believe this is the message Ms. Hoffman is conveying to me and all others who purchase her book. I find this unacceptable and I hope you will join me in holding Ms. Hoffman accountable by opting to choose a cookbook written by a different author (Milona's Culinaria Greece is fantastic).Culinaria Greece: Greek Specialties"},{"Title":"The Olive and the Caper: Adventures in Greek Cooking","review":"According to the preface and acknowledgments to this book, \`The Olive and the Caper' by Susanna Hoffman, the author went through many more difficulties than usual in bringing this book to completion. Heading the list was the loss of the virtually complete manuscript in 1991, and its reconstruction in the following years. I for one am delighted that the author took the effort to reconstruct this volume, as it should stand as a template for how to put together a readable, useable, entertaining exposition of the cuisine of a country.I am not saying Ms. Hoffman has given us the very best treatment of a national cuisine or even necessarily the very best treatment of Greek cuisine. Diana Kennedy's \`From My Mexican Kitchen' is a different approach to a national cuisine that works equally as well as a format and her content is of the highest possible quality. Similarly, Diane Kochilas approaches Greek food in \`The Glorious Foods of Greece' in an entirely different manner than Hoffman, giving us a third valuable approach.While Kochilas' approach is by region, with each chapter covering a different ethnic and culinary enclave such as The Peloponnesos, The Ionian Islands, Thessaly, Macedonia, Crete, and Athens and others, Ms. Hoffman approaches her subject by ingredient or type of dish. While this seems very conventional and while it is definitely less scholarly than Ms. Kochilas book, it is done with a depth that is uncommon among lesser books on a national cuisine. For example, the very first chapter deals with the drinks of Greece, including lowly water, which just happens to have a special place in Greek tradition. It reminds us that it is Greek intellectual tradition and customs that contributed much more to the development of early Christianity than Roman customs. Most of the first bishops of the church in Asia Minor were Greek and the intellectual underpinning of theologians such as St. Augustine was Plato. If the traditions of baptism and holy water did not originate with Greek Christians, their traditions certainly reinforced these Christian ideas.Interspersed with recipes within each chapter are excellent culinary sidebars on things like Greek cheeses, olives, pickles, bread, tomatoes, saffron, and marinades, among many other topics. There are also excellent sidebars on Greek history and mythology on subjects such as Zeus, Byzantium, Cyprus, Pericles, the Olympics, Alexander the Great and so on. And, there is much here which may be new to even well informed readers. I did graduate studies in Philosophy and was an avid reader of Greek Mythology, and I find things here that I did not know. The reference to the mysterious Sythians, a culture which lived in Hellenic times above the Black Sea shows they had culinary and trade connections to the Greeks, before they were erased from world history by the Tartars.The book divides the material into three great parts. The first is Drinks, Meze, and Savory Pies. I have already discussed the drinks section which includes wine ouzo, tsikoudia (similar to Italian grappa), brandy, beer, coffee, tea, and fruitades. The second chapter is Meze, of which much has been written recently. The third chapter in the first part covers savory pies, primarily constructed from filo pastry.The second part covers the lions share of savory dishes. The chapters are:Bread - Greek bread is really different from what you expect from French and Italian bakers. This is where the Eastern Mediterranean flatbread terroir starts, with lots of stuff like eggs, olives, and figs baked into the bread.Soup - Much closer to Italian traditions and recipes than the bread. Lots of vegetable soups with beans and greens.Salads - The famous Greek Salad plus new variations on common Mediterranean themes.Eggs - One of the most distinctive Greek ingredients. The author explains how the Greek colony in Denver, with their traditional involvement in running diners, created the Denver omelet, much more a Greek than a cowboy dish, it turns out.Sustaining Grain - Barley, Wheat, Rice and NoodlesThe Vegetable ParadeFish and Shellfish - One of the very few lapses in this book is that it makes no mention of the fact that contrary to expectations, fish does not play as big a part in most island cuisine as you may expect, since almost all fish is shipped off to Athens for sale. That is not to say Greece does not have a lot of fish recipes, just that you may not find them where you expect.Meat - Lots of lamb.Birds - Mostly ChickenWild Game - The other birdsSauces, Toppings, and MarinadesFruit as the FinaleThe third part of recipes is a single chapter on sweets. Like the Italians, Greeks eat fewer sweets after their meal than they do in the afternoon with coffee or late at night. The star of Greek pastry is filo, honey, and nuts in dishes such as baklava, kadaifi, and other cakes, fried pastry, cookies, and puddings.There are many very good books on Greek food, but if you have none yet, this should definitely be your first. It is a great survey by topic with recipes written in an extremely clear, detailed style which even a novice should have no trouble following. I also find practically no overlap between this book and Diane Kochilas' classic. Get them both, but get this one first. Then get Kochilas' book on Mezes, as neither of these others cover the full range of this topic.Highly recommended for all foodies, especially for those with an interest in the Greek, Turkish, and Eastern Mediterranean cuisines."},{"Title":"The Olive and the Caper: Adventures in Greek Cooking","review":"Having never been to Greece, I won't even begin to comment on how \\"authentic\\" Ms. Hoffman's recipes are. They are, however, accompanied by many sidebars, articles, anecdotes and mini history lessons that make the recipes seem like illustrations in a wonderful travel book.The recipes run the gamut from difficult (exotic ingredients and complicated prep) to simple (glass of water, anyone?) and not all dishes are for everyone. But there is a nice sense of generality to the collection, from the traditional to the seasonal, as if everything you ever wanted to *sample* from a Greek table is in this book.What really makes it so attractive, however, is the conversational running commentary kept up by the author throughout. One learns why water is such a sacred inclusion at the Greek table, why Constantinoble became Istanbul, and what it takes for a foreign woman to be accepted by her Greek neighbors. Whether giving us a history lesson or just a glimpse into modern daily life, Ms. Hoffman's experiences in the Greek Isles are an invaluble inclusion here.

This is one of those enjoyable creatures: a readable cookbook. The recipes are practical and delightful. Be careful: if you have visited Greece, it will make you desperate to return; if you haven't, it will make you want to visit.The prose is a bit overdone, epecially when she waxes liyrical about how \\"Greek beckons with rich and vivid people, multifarious folkways - and incredible food.\\" But her passion for things Greek is excusable. A delightful book on all counts."},{"Title":"The Olive and the Caper: Adventures in Greek Cooking","review":"An opening quote is a great way to get started with this cookbook: \\"Grinning up at me, the casserole boils and chatters to itself and fishes leap up in the frying pan.\\" This is credited to Euboulos, Giants, 385 B.C.E.Why the book title? One of the reasons for relating the olive to the caper is probably their opposition and sameness: the olive was domesticated on Greek shores; the caper sprouts wildly from almost every cliff and cranney. In their alikeness, they are both cured much the same way, brined and stored in clay vessels or jars.Workman Publishing is capable of some large production cookbooks, but The Olive and the Caper has to eclipse many. Its handsome intro could be compared with a grand musical fanfare, and they accomplished this with exquisite photographic folk and geographic studies. The early pictorial preview starts with Central Greece and its olives. They then move to the Peloponnesos' awesome citrus, ease up to Northern Greece's elegant capers, then swoop to the Ionian Islands and its succulent seafood, fish from the Aegean at Cyclades. Next, it's on to Crete and her tavernas' treats, then the preserves of Dodecanese resting at last with the bountiful fruits of Cyprus.Author, Susanna Hoffman, a chef and anthropologist, has lived in Greece on and off for thirty years which gave her the opportunity to get into the backgrounds of the people, their foods and customs. This brings their history and geography together nicely.It would be easy to get lost in this book if it weren't for the loose groupings in its Table of Contents: For instance, Part One starts with \\"From Water to Wine,\\" followed by the \\"tapas\\" in Greek cuisine, \\"Meze.\\" These are broken into fascinating categories. (Not the least of which seems \\"A Mix of Mushrooms Marinated in Wine, Fennel, and Thyme.\\") The next sections are Savory Pies, Breads, Soup for Hard Times and Good Times,\\" Salads, Eggs and Sustaining Grains, Barley, Wheat, Rice & Noodles. Her Vegetable Parade is broken down into Simmered, Sauteed & Fried, Stewed Vegetable Stand-outs, Crisp Croquettes and Fritters and Stuffed Vegetables then the famed Greek Casseroles. The remaining sections: Fish and Shellfish; Meat, Birds; Wild Game; Sauces, Toppings and Marinades; Fruits as the Finale and Sweets in Profusion round out this large undertaking.Here's some pauses during an Olive and Caper riffling:In the meze section, Eggplant and Yogurt Spread with Red Onion and Olives.A simple Pickled Red Onions recipe calling only for red wine vinegar, water, sugar and a bay leaf.Zesty Lentil Soup with fresh dandelion greens, fresh oregano and a touch of tomato paste. Your reviewer made this delicious dish using green Parisian lentils.Tomato and Bread Salad with Feta, Basil and Capers. The recipe suggests you use the book's recipe for Barley Ring bread.Homemade Trahana Sour Dough Noodles, again is simply made with an egg, yogurt, salt and semolina flour.Spinach-Oregano Pesto with scallions, red wine vinegar, lemon juice and olive oil. Plan to serve that day.Pork Stew with Olives, Anchovies, Cilantro and White Beans.The recipe directs the book to used freshly wilted Cilantro which is the green tossed with vinegar and salt.For desserts: Semolina Custard Pie with Clove and Orange Syrup.Sesame Cake with Sesame Icing. The icing is made with tahini, confectioners' sugar and vanilla.The Greeks seem to be quite taken with many varieties of Spoon Sweets (fruits stewed down with sugar to a desired consistency): Quince and Pomegranate, Cherry and Tsikoudia, Apricot and Metaxa and Grape. There are probably as many Spoon Sweets as there are fruits.Spoon Sweets are usually served with Greek-inspired ice creams like: Olive Oil Ice Cream, *Mastic Ice Cream and Mavrodaphne Ice Cream.The Olive and the Caper is a beautiful book covering not only the Moussakas we find in all Greek restaurants but a whole lot of family, highly-nourishing, dishes. If you have room for only one Greek cookbook, along with some well-told Greek history, you'd be pretty well off making this book the one you keep.* Hoffman also confides her love affair with the \\"very special Greek ingredient, Mastiha\\" (mastic).Reviewed by Marty Martindale 2005, Largo FLMarty Martindale, 2005, Largo FL"},{"Title":"The Olive and the Caper: Adventures in Greek Cooking","review":"if i could only have one book on greek cooking, this would be it. not only are the recipes good and consistent, there is a ton of info on the food and its origins, traditions, folklore, history and more. i teach a cooking class in greece every summer ([...]) on the mediterranean diet and i carry this book back and forth to show it to my students."},{"Title":"The Olive and the Caper: Adventures in Greek Cooking","review":"Do you love Mediterranean flavors, fresh tasting \\"jump in the mouth\\" dishes?

And with every passing year, he became more and more embittered and pessimistic as his dreams went unrealised. Nowhere is this clearer than in \`The Shape Of Things To Come', which despite discussing the \\"History of the Future\\" and making some startlingly accurate predictions, bears no resemblance to Wells' early scientific romances. There is some frame story in the form of Dr Philip Raven and his \\"dream of the future\\", but there's very little in the way of narration or storytelling in the traditional sense. \`The Shape Of Things To Come' is essentially a very long and very serious essay representing Wells' most detailed outline of how a World State might be achieved.In the first half, Wells begins by outlining the history of the immediate past and present (Book 1), and then-near future (Book 2) in the context of the development of a World State. This part of the book is very academic and can be quite heavy going at times. Certainly there is some interesting historical information here, presented in an unconventional context. But it is also very simplistic: the formation of a World State is portrayed as inevitable, the few people who advocated it are beatified as flawless visionaries, and everyone else dismissed as ignorant clods. It goes further than Victors' History; Wells is unrelentingly snarky and vindictive in savaging those who disagree with him.Special mention must be made of Wells' predictions of the Second World War. While a number of his predictions were spot on (the date and location of its commencement), he gets it badly wrong in two ways. Firstly, he refuses to believe that re-armament and warfare can bring huge economic benefits (as WW2 did to the US and other countries), so does not accept that the world can lift itself out of its 1930's doldrums. This was a major flaw in Wells' logic, since his World State is based on the idea that countries and nationalism will disintegrate due to the unending Great Depression. Secondly, he blames the coming war solely on Poland and Western Europe, with poor defenceless little Germany the persecuted victim. While you can argue that Versailles was vindictive, and Wells could not have foreseen in 1933 what Germany would be like in 1939, Book 2 is nevertheless a deeply disturbing read. It's the history of the 1930's as it would have been written had the wrong side won the war.The second half of the book (Books 3-5) deals with Wells' theories as to how the World State would be established from the ruins of Depression, war, and disease, and Book 5 describes the conditions World Citizens would live under. This section is generally more interesting and easier-going than the first half, and takes on a more personal and emotional element. The World State in 2105 certainly seems like a perfect place; however, once again Wells' passion overcomes his logic. If the World State is such an inevitable utopian paradise, why does it require a century or so of repressive military dictatorship (Book 4) to \\"convince\\" people to support it? Wells never resolves this fundamental contradiction, and in fact he tries to gloss over this a bit. He seems to regard with chilling indifference the persecution and enforced suicide of those who get in the way, and also \`Nineteen Eighty Four' style re-interpretation of history and literature. Anything, literally anything, is acceptable if it furthers progress, and Wells doesn't seem to appreciate that four generations of humanity might not be happy to be enslaved under the Air Dictatorship just so he can have his Perfect World a hundred years' hence.So in summary, \`The Shape Of Things To Come' is a difficult book that doesn't necessarily reward you for the effort you're required to put in. There is no doubting Wells' imagination, and he has clearly thought in great detail about many specific aspects of the world in 2105. But he undermines his own arguments with logical gaps and flaws, and his partisan writing style does grate after a while. The book is an excellent insight into the aging and embittered Wells' mindset of the time, but be aware that it is a very challenging read that will not appeal to everybody."},{"Title":"The shape of things to come,","review":"_The Shape of Things to Come_ is the Penguin Classics edition of the novel first published in 1933 by the famous science fiction writer and British socialist H. G. Wells which provides an account of the \\"history of the future\\" and offers predictions as to what the future (at the time of writing) will bring. H. G. Wells envisioned this book in many ways to be a sequel to the historical work _The Outline of History_ (1930) which attempted to predict future developments taking off from where \\"history\\" left off. This book is particularly prescient and offered predictions for a Second World War and the creation of a \\"World State\\" and world government. As such, it is apparent that the thinking of individuals in the milieu of Wells had a profound influence on the thinking of the elite who operated behind the scenes in the Twentieth Century to erect a world government. H. G. Wells (1866 - 1946) was a British science fiction writer of world renown best known for his novels dealing with various scientific predictions and developments. However, there is another side to Wells. Wells also had an interest in politics and was an avid socialist, seeking to redress perceived social wrongs, who joined the Fabian society of socialists seeking \\"revolution\\" through gradualism for a time. Wells ardently believed in the ideals of socialism and world government as the answer to Nineteenth and early Twentieth century discrepancies in wealth. Wells was also an historian who was influenced heavily by Darwinian thinking and science. This novel which is really more of a political outline for a utopia than a real \\"novel\\", provides a vision of the World State achieved through co-operation among nations, as well as predicting various Twentieth century events including the Second World War. The \\"novel\\" is presented as the \\"dream book\\" left behind by one Dr. Philip Raven, an intellectual working for the League of Nations, who dies in 1930. This \\"dream book\\" reveals Raven's visions for the future of mankind and the creation of the World State. These visions are particularly prescient in light of the developments of the Twentieth century and the coming emergence of a worldwide government, and it is obvious that Wells was certainly no small visionary. As such, I believe this book is highly important and can be profitably read today to understand the events that have taken place in world politics during the Twentieth century and even into our own times.The novel begins with an Introduction to \\"The Dream Book of Dr. Philip Raven\\". This introduction explains that Dr. Philip Raven was an intellectual working for the League of Nations who died in Geneva in 1930. Further, it is explained the means by which Dr. Philip Raven maintained contact with the future and through his visions was able to predict the coming World State. The introduction is supposed to be written by H. G. Wells himself who serves as the \\"transcriber\\" of Dr. Philip Raven's manuscripts. The novel then turns to \\"Book I: Today and Tomorrow: The Age of Frustration Dawns\\". The novel explains how following the First World War and the crippling Treaty of Versailles there arose the desire to put an end to war once and for all through means of an international overseeing body (which became the League of Nations). Further, the novel explains how economic crises led to various socialist proposals for alleviating poverty and resolving such economic downturns. Following this, the novel turns to \\"Book II: The Days After Tomorrow: The Age of Frustration\\". Here, the novel shows the development of economic theory through the London Conference as well as the rise of dictatorships and fascisms. The novel also explains how the old order was \\"sloughed off\\" and subsequently replaced by a new order based on world government. The novel also predicts the Second World War and shows the role of the Russian revolution and the theories of such economic theorists as Karl Marx and Henry George. Following this, the novel turns to \\"Book III: The World Renascence: The Birth of the Modern State\\". Here, the novel explains the plan of the modern World State, the development of the technocracy, and the role of a new \\"technical revolutionary\\" in the creation of the modern World State. Following this, the novel turns to \\"Book IV: The Modern State Militant\\". Here, the novel explains the rise of the World State and the Air Dictatorship. The novel explains such features of the \\"modern World State\\" as \\"futile insurrections\\" against it and predictions for the future. Following this, the novel turns to \\"Book V: The Modern State in Control of Life\\". This part of the novel discusses such topics as geogonic planning, changes in control of human behavior, the increase in lifespan and \\"wisdom\\" of the average man, and other topics as they relate to the \\"modern World State\\". The novel ends here by explaining that the World State has made possible a new development in the history of mankind devoted to socialism and cosmopolitanism.This novel by H. G. Wells lays out an important blueprint for the history of the Twentieth and Twenty-First Centuries. Wells' predictions are particularly prescient as they relate to the Second World War, the development of the League of Nations, the rise of socialism, and the creation of a global world state. Herein, H. G. Wells reveals himself to be a conspirator of the highest order whose utopian schemes were to be played out in the schemes of the elite in the coming ages. While this book is primarily meant to be a sequel to Wells' works on history, it lays out his coming plan and understanding of the new age. As such, this book reveals not only Wells as a primary thinker behind the goal of the New World Order but also as a powerful utopian dreamer and seer who predicted the coming age."},{"Title":"The shape of things to come,","review":"From Google Groups Jordan179:The book was published in September 1933, which means that it was presumably written up to a year earlier. This is interesting in terms of _when_ its \\"present\\" was (the early years of the Great Depression, and right when Hitler had taken power in Germany). It is also interesting to note that this was around the same time as _Last and First Men_, and that Stapledon and Wells, as two British socialist literary science fiction writers, almost certainly would have known one another in person. I wonder if there was some sort of informal challenge in their circle to try to \\"write about the future,\\" or something of that sort?_The Shape of Things to Come_, of course, is a far less ambitious work than _Last and First Men_, in terms of scope. While LaFM covers two billion years of the history of not only our own species but its successors as dominant sapient races of the Solar System, TSoTtC covers only about a century (to the 2040's) in any sort of detail, and gives some vague hints of what happens out to 2100. This is roughly 110 to 166 years past the point of publication, corresponding to the very earliest parts of Stapledon's book in terms of timescale.The framing story is that this is the \\"dream book\\" (recording of a series of dreams experienced by) of Dr. Phillip Raven, a progressive-minded statesman, influential in the League of Nations, who died in 1930. As becomes apparent to his friend (presumably H. G. Wells himself), the dreams were accurately prophetic (he foretells the election of FDR among other things), channelling a history book written in 2106, and so Wells decides to write them up into this history of the future.I say \\"history of the future\\" rather than \\"novel\\" with precise meaning. Like _Last and First Men_, _The Shape of Things to Come_ is not really a novel: it has very little characterization and indeed few named characters engaging in anything like normal dialogue or plot. It's actually set up as if it really were a history of the last 200 years, writen in 2106 (as it claims to have been). The only places where it's dramatic is where one might expect a well-written, lively sort of history book to be so.This of course ruins it as a novel, but then that's never what Wells was aiming at. He was aiming at a \\"future history,\\" and as such this book really has more in common with works such as the _Star Trek Spaceflight Chronology_ than with science fiction _novels_ in general.It's interesting to note that both TSoTtC, and LaFM, were written several years before the earliest story in Heinlein's famous \\"future history.\\" I wonder if Heinlein read either book before coming up with _his_ notion of a \\"future history?\\" Wells was, of course, quite famous by the late 1930's / early 1940's, both as a fiction writer and a serious futurist.The work is divided into five \\"books,\\" each the length of a short history book. The first: \\"Today and Tomorrow: The Age of Frustration Dawns,\\" is Wells' precis of the history of the world from roughly 1914-1933, as it might be seen from the viewpoint of his fictional 2106. It is, as one might expect, essentially socialist and pessimistic in view: Wells believed that Western Civilization had lost and was continuing to lose tremendous opportunities of education, production, and progress owing to what he saw as the pernicious effects of capitalism and superstition. He also had by this time lost almost all hope that the Soviet Union was going to turn out any better than Western Europe had. This part is somewhat amusing in terms of exposing Wells' own views, but is less than fascinating even viewed as history (and I like to read history). Wells himself would do this sort of thing _far_ better in his famous _Outline of History_.The second book,\\"The Days After Tomorrow: The Age of Frustration,\\" is essentially about the wreck of Civilization. Basically, the Great Depression (which he calls \\"the Slump\\") gets worse and worse. In 1935, Franklin Delano Roosevelt calls The London Conference in which all the nations of the world try to come to an agreement to end it: they fail miserably and the Depression continues to deepen.(this follows logically from Wells' own socialist views: if the Depression was caused by the limitations of capitalism, obviously nothing short of a complete restructuring of the economy towards socialism could cure it).(in our time line, of course, what happened was that the Depression partially lifted in 1934, and conditions gradually improved throughout the 1930's; finally, World War II caused governments everywhere to demand massive war production that put an end to it once and for all. Wells, embarassingly, was to see his theory proven false _within one year after the publication of the book_, which may be why there isn't any mention of a Depression On Steroids in the movie version).Anyway, things get worse and worse, socially as well as economically. Production of whole classes of goods ceases (this is logically inconsistent with the structure of a Depression, but Wells isn't a very good economist). Crime and despair spread.In 1940, the Germano-Polish War starts, by accident, over the Danzig Corridor. A Nazi shoots a Polish man at a train station, and Poland invades Germany and drives a good way into the Eastern part of the country before being stopped by German fortifications.(this is the same year that \\"the Second World War\\" starts in the movie, but in the movie we never learn the cause of the war or even the identity of the foe)Germany and Poland trade continual air raids while their ground armies are locked in stalemate on massive trench lines, including extensive poison gas and anti-tank obstacles ...(continued on google groups)"},{"Title":"The shape of things to come,","review":"Reading Wells' biography, I think I understand where he came from and why he wrote what he did.Wells' parents were at best lower middle class and hadn't a clue how to get on in the world. Joseph went from gardening to playing part-time professional cricket and keeping a shop that ultimately failed. From working in service, Sarah became a home-maker and, when the shop failed, became a ladies' maid who could contribute financially but not personally to the household. She was not allowed to have her children or husband in the house where she worked.Wells failed at a couple of jobs including being a chemist (pharmacist to us Yanks) and he also let a scholarship slip through his fingers. When he finally graduated, he had no connections that could help him find a job, but he married anyway -- twice within five years.His book is full of economic impracticalities and dreamy hopes for a future in which everybody will suddenly \\"come to Jesus\\" only to him \\"Jesus\\" is socialism and obeying a world government.It is also full of Victorian prejudice (e.g. against Raven) and myopia, as well as socialist unrealism. He had just come to realize that Stalin was a dictator, not a champion of socialism. He talks about Hitler as if Wells believed the man to be nothing more than a speech-maker. An English translation of Mein Kampf came out a couple of years before Shape was published. Wells either didn't read it or, like some who did, failed to realize that what Hitler did to come to power tracked with the book.Another coincidence is that oil was discovered in the Middle East just as Wells published, and Iraq and Kuwait became independent about the same time. The value of oil to the Axis and Allied powers cannot be underestimated, and Wells would never have described the West as choosing Basra for his world conferences had he paid attention to the headlines or been able to grasp the possibilities of the two events. That once again comes down to his limited understanding of economics and to a Victorian view of every nation in the world except the European ones.The lesson here is that histories written from a fictional future stance don't work. To make them work, the author has to have a grasp of all the main currents contributing to the Shape of Things to Come. Who has that? Wells certainly didn't."},{"Title":"The shape of things to come,","review":"A mix of past history, plus a load of wildly inaccurate predictions presented as if this so-called novel was some kind of history book published in the 21st century. Wells acknowledges J.W. Dunne's Experiment with Time. It's not clear if this book was the outcome of Wells attempting to follow Dunne's technique in that book, or whether he saw himself as some kind of modern day Mother Shipton. Anyway, the only thing he gets nearly right is the outbreak of another war, which he predicts as starting in 1940. One example of the inaccuracies is that he states Poland would declare war on Germany and that the Poles would heavily bomb Berlin so that it would be like a primitive village afterwards. Elsewhere, he speaks highly of Lenin and goes on about the modern state being in control of life. In his Experiment in Autobiography he says he \\"took great pains to make it as exciting and readable as anything I have ever done\\". It nearly sent me to sleep."},{"Title":"The shape of things to come,","review":"This book by H. G. Wells is only a sort of novel.

The First Men in the Moon, the War in the Air, the Time Machine are some of my favorite literary works. Unfortunately, many of his later works were full of Fabian Socialist Utopian ideas that essentially say if the stupid masses would just get out of the way and the \\"right people\\" were to make decisions for everyone, the world would be a great place. Of course, in novels, these people never want anything but the greater good. Of course, in reality, everyone who espouses these ideals, such as the aforementioned Soros, really want wealth and power for themselves. As a result, this is a simpleminded and boring approach to a future history novel. If it weren't written by HG Wells, probably no one would pick it up. While the movie made from this book, \\"Things to Come\\", is worth watching, don't waste your time with this preachy and silly book."},{"Title":"The shape of things to come,","review":"Excellent condition and very interesting reading - especially now in our troubled times.

Their ONLY purpose is to \\"prompt\\" our bodies to protect us from them. In other words for our bodies to naturally provide a defense or cure for the disease or ailment. Wigmore accurately points out that this natural ability to maintain good health is something we have within our bodies, evolved over millions of years of surviving in the midst of all the maladies our world has produced. Why are we suffering from the myriad of health challenges we suddenly find in our world? We have to look no further than what we are putting in our mouths. While what we are doing to our planet in terms of pollution etc. has an effect on our health she accurately points out that it is our cooked, over processed food that is turning off our natural healing power.

If you are a regular subscriber to \`Gourmet', I guess this book can be something of a tough decision, as virtually all the material herein is from the magazine. In fact, I would be willing to bet that practically all the recipes from the magazine in the last year are in this volume. I suspect it should be labelled \`Everything but the Duds'.The book has three main sections. The first, \`Celebrations' is a collection of nine (9) menus based on specific common plus unusual twists on common events from around the world such as \`A Russian Easter Feast' and \`A Bohemian Thanksgiving'. Two things which immediately appeal to me about these menus aside from the excellent selection of themes is the large number of recipes per menu and the fact that the recipes are written to serve up to 10, rather than the usual 4 to 6.The second, \`The Menu Collection' is also recipes organized by seventeen (17) different themes conceived by season and occasion with some additional international themes and some menus for a somewhat larger than usual home entertainment gathering. Samples are \`Dinner for a Dozen' and \`A Modern Irish Supper'. I'm hard pressed to really see the difference between these two sections except that the first section is generally more formal.The third section, \`The Recipe Compendium' is organized like a conventional cookbook, except that it covers some topics such as breads and sandwiches which is not usually covered in conventional cookbooks.Although I subscribe to \`Gourmet', I have never found it as good a source on general cooking as \`Cooks Illustrated', \`Saveur', or \`Fine Cooking', but it is a very good alternative to, for example \`Cooks Illustrated' in that its recipes are created more to impress than to be practical for the amateur cook. Like all recipes published in periodicals, they have the advantage over individual authors in that they are reviewed by a standardized vetting process carried on by both culinary and literary (copy) editors, and I happen to know the \`Gourmet' copy editor is very, very good.For those of you who may not be familiar with the magazine's recipe style, I find they typically have little commitment to doing ethnically accurate recipes, but they are never entirely \`easy' or entirely uninterested in ethnic recipe sources. On the one hand, for example, their recipe for the Spanish (Catalan) condiment, alioli is not only revisionist in the sense that it includes eggs, it is totally un-Spanish by including bottled mayonnaise as a principle ingredient. On the other hand, the recipe for Russian Easter bread which I have made several times and which I have compared to \`authentic' versions is quite similar to recipes cribbed directly from the steppes. This book does me the special favor of being able to discard my worn copy of the \`Gourmet' issue with this bread recipe, and I can ignore the mayonnaise alioli and rely on my various Spanish cookbooks for the real thing.With a few exceptions, \`Gourmet' generally doesn't go out of its way to give you quick versions, although the truly excellent index common to all recent \`Gourmet' collections makes a point of identifying those recipes which can be done in 30 minutes or less. For all recipes, it does give the \`active' time and the total time from start to finish. I suspect these times are for the experienced amateur cook. These books also have a truly excellent reference in the back for where to get any and all unusual ingredients or kitchen tools.If you reallylike \`Gourmet' magazine and you don't have a lot of cookbooks, this is an excellent \`value added' collection of their recipes, which takes up less space than 12 issues. If you already own 500 cookbooks, it still has value in that it has some of the best entertaining material I have seen this side of Martha Stewart. I believe that if entertaining dinners is your thing, a complete set of these books may be as good or better than many books on entertaining, except for Miss Martha's classic \`Entertaining'.Better than I expected!"},{"Title":"The Best of Gourmet: A Year of Celebrations (20th Anniversary Edition)","review":"...that we had to own the 20th Anniversary Edition.

It is also expained that not every bird in the talking list will talk, but they have the potential to talk. The birds that talk clearly are identified as well as the birds that simply do not talk. Although parrots are the most common talking birds, there is also a list of non-parrot birds that are known for talking ability.The chapter Parrots Jump Into The Conversation contains input from several people who wrote in about conversations with their pet birds and is a lot of fun to read.The Model/Rival Training Technique chapter explains how this method of training is used and this is the way that Alex, the famous African Grey Parrot belonging to Dr. Pepperberg was trained.Of course, the whole book is not just about teaching your bird to talk. There is wonderful advice on general pet bird care, solving problems, playing games with your bird, and what to do if your bird turns out to be a non talker.This book has good basic information for the beginner in bird care or ownership as well as advanced information for those who have experience with birds."},{"Title":"Teaching Your Bird to Talk","review":"This book summarizes what you need to know if you are responsible for the care of a bird. You never really own them, since they have a mind of their own. But you can bribe them with attention and treats. I have two parrots that talk, a blue and gold macaw and a lessor sulphor crested cockatoo. I used techniques similar to those described in the book to teach them. Whether you have owned parrots for 20 years or are just starting to keep birds, you can learn something from this book. I have heard the authors speak at conventions, if you have a chance, take the time to hear them speak."},{"Title":"Teaching Your Bird to Talk","review":"Diane Grindol has done it again! Another great book with great information that everyone who lives with a parrot should have in their book collection. In easy to understand language, Diane explains Dr. Irene Pepperberg's model/rival technique for teaching parrots. This book isn't just for people that want to teach their bird to talk, its for every parrot owner."},{"Title":"Teaching Your Bird to Talk","review":"This book provides a wealth of information on birds but the title is a bit misleading. There is only one strong chapter on the \\"hows\\" of teaching a bird to talk with understanding rather than simple mimicry. The rest of the book details the funny things and the many things talking birds say(as reported by their owners), bird habits, nutrition, etc. I would have preferred a bit more in the tutorial section."},{"Title":"Teaching Your Bird to Talk","review":"I waited more than six months after I bought this book to try the techniques inside it before I wrote my review. Although I was using some methods mentioned inside the book but this book encouraged me to keep using them and also adds some amazing methods and ideas that were very helpful, useful and easy to imply. Simply, my old African Grey Parrot started to talk, and that was my fist experience in such thing and I really feel grateful to this book and to the efforts inside it. I am giving four stars since I feel some information are ideas need proves rather than facts. However, aiming to make your African talk, buy this book and be patient."},{"Title":"Teaching Your Bird to Talk","review":"After I read the book cover to cover, I had to figure out if I missed the chapter where it specifically teaches you to give talking lessons to your bird. I went back and looked, and I hadn't. While the book covers a lot of ground, it uses anecdotes of other parrot owners examples of bird's talking. And basically all it teaches you is that when the bird starts to talk, to reward it for this behaviour. There are no step-by-step instructions on teaching your bird to talk, which is what I was expecting, given the title. In fact, this book beats around the bush too much, and while it gives you a some information on pet birds, nutritional guides, how and why they make sounds and talk, and mentions trick training, it does NOT give you a lot of information on how professionals train birds to talk. It does briefly explain the Model/ Rival method of Irene Pepperburg, but it suggests that if you want to use this method, that you should further study it. All in all, this is a pretty good parrot book, but it DOES NOT go in depth about how to teach your bird to talk. The book comes off as patronizing in some ways, as it wants to teach you how to keep a pet bird, which should be something you've already learned to do before reading this book. A book called \\"Teaching Your Bird to Talk\\" should do just that."},{"Title":"Teaching Your Bird to Talk","review":"Very easy to read and unterstand.

Crowther does an excellent job of concisely reviewing relevant anatomy, function, diagnosis, and treatment. The text is well organized and written."},{"Title":"Primary Orthopedic Care","review":"While the anatomy portions of the book are done well, Crowther contradicts herself at many points regarding examination and diagnosis of various conditions. Additionally, she uses some information that does not incorporate recently published studies (though that may be due to the publishing time lag). Finally, in todays healthcare market, she needs to expand her ideas of conservative care to more than NSAIDS. There are many alternative and complementary modes of treatment available today. I urge the PCP and patient to explore some of these options."},{"Title":"Shelter of His Arms (Love Inspired #31)","review":"The author combined romance and suspense to keep me turning the pages!

Each is a fictional account of life in 1) the gold rush, 2) San Francisco, and 3) Spanish land grant ranchos. My favorite thing about White is his ablility to convey the spirit of his settings and put the reader there. He wrote them between 1910 and 1920 and certainly received many firsthand accounts while preparing material. I think one can learn more by experiencing this one book than by taking several college semesters of Californian history. Please disregard the uninspiring title, the drama contained therin is increadible. Comparable to; Bret Harte, Mark Twain, Jack London, Frank Norris."},{"Title":"the story of california","review":"Stewart Edward White makes California history come alive in his three short stories that depict the Gold Rush, the development of San Francisco after the Gold Rush with characters we think of street names, such as Sansome, and land development further south in Arguello. Most amazing is his description of how people overinvested in real estate and the banks made bad loans. We never learn!I wish this would be made into a movie or mini-series. It is great PBS content! There are so many fascinating facts that we don't know about: the enormous amount of gold just under rocks at the start of the Gold Rush and how people helped each other. I was amazed to learn about the many fires that burnt San Francisco to the ground before the 1906 earthquake. There are details about how people lived and how the city developed. I was amazed at the extent of lawlessness in early San Francisco, the hundreds of ships abandoned in the Bay later put to use as warehouses and how women adjusted their hooped skirts to go out into the street. The rain that the miners found in winter is familiar to Californians but it was new to those who came across the land or via Panama. His description of Panama is fascinating.He also describes life in the rural Central Coast of California near Santa Barbara before a vast irrigation system was developed. It is hard to imagine such empty areas, but the beauty of California is striking. The characters are alive and keep your attention. Wonderful book!"},{"Title":"For the Audience of One: Worshiping the One and Only in Everything You Do","review":"You'd think that a guy who helped birth the ministries of people such as Matt Redman, Tim Hughes and Kevin Prosch would have something significant to say about worship.Well, you'd be right.In a very non-threatening, conversational style, Mike Pilavachi lays out a theology of worship that will likely stir the waters for many believers:\\"How many times have you said something like \`The worship didn't do anything for me today'? Hello! Whoever said it was for us in the first place?\\"If you are one of the many that have become \\"worship junkies,\\" looking for an increasingly self-indulgent excuse to get a \\"quick fix,\\" this book will surely disappoint you. But if you've ever questioned the traditions-turned-doctrine that seem to have a strangle-hold on modern worship mentalities and methods, For the Audience of One will be a welcomed and insightful addition to your library."},{"Title":"Four Empty Walls","review":"Four Empty Walls, a first novel from exciting new writer Megan Somogyi is beautiful. I found it to be a breath of literary fresh air in a medium increasingly cluttered with \\"Sex and the City\\" type brain candy. With clear and at times heartbreaking prose Ms. Somogyi takes her reader to the depths of pain without ever giving up the hope of redemption. A very grown up comming of age story with a tip of the hat to Kafka. I cannot reccomend this book highly enough."},{"Title":"Four Empty Walls","review":"This book is life changing. The way in which Somogyi delves into a myriad of difficult issues is heartening. Her writing style is also beautiful. Though it seems to touch upon Kafka's famed style a bit, it is all her own.

They appear on this stage like innumerable stars in the sky.So, much patience is needed to read it through.Nevertheless, it is very useful to give us not only the main streams, but the alternatives of the politics.They contain modernization, underdevelopment, dependency, imperialism, and so on.As the economic growth comes to be more important in these days, the author emphasizes that politicsmust be \\"political economy\\".Also he asserts that Marxian paradigm, not his ideology, is recommended to study politics as well as orthodox political theory."},{"Title":"Jimmy Olsen: Adventures by Jack Kirby - Volume 2","review":"This one has a lot more Kirby concepts and the story gets rolling along a lot faster. We get to see Dracula...in this case Dragorin as an adversary against Superman. The Shield and the Newsboy Legion from Kirby's earlier works make another appearece here. I have to admit Kirby is an aquired taste.When I was a youngster in 1970 I thought anyone could draw in the style of Kirby. It wasn't until I started creating my own art that I understood what he was trying say. It isn't the perfect anatomy that tells the story ..but the cartoony figures that are so dynamically portrayed, that do.I wish that DC would follow Marvel's lead and put all of Kirby's greatest works on CD ROM. This could really lead to more exposure to the man who created characters for two universes..Marvel and DC."},{"Title":"Jimmy Olsen: Adventures by Jack Kirby - Volume 2","review":"More fun comic book stories from Jack \\"King\\" Kirby's early 1970s stint as the writer/artist of Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen. In this volume, collecting issues #142-148, Kirby continues to flesh out his new Fourth World characters as they interact with Jimmy Olsen, Superman, and the revived Newsboy Legion. Crazy cool stuff! Be sure to check out Volume 1."},{"Title":"Jimmy Olsen: Adventures by Jack Kirby - Volume 2","review":"Wow, it was so wonderful to see these &#34;Jimmy Olsen&#34; issues again, and in color, too! These comic books were illustrated by the awesome Jack &#34;King&#34; Kirby, and he turned the DC Comics - &#34;Jimmy Olsen&#34; franchise into a winning book title, again for DC Comics. This was part of his &#34;New Gods vs. Apokolips&#34; - Fourth World&#34; series of book titles for DC Comics. This goes with &#34;The New Gods&#34;, &#34;The Forever People&#34;, and &#34;Mister Miracle&#34; comic book titles. Jack Kirby has the unique ability to predict technology and draw it in a form that looks believable, with geometric shapes, before such objects became mainstream in the world of today. It was magnificent to rediscover the thrill I had when I first read them in the early 1970's."},{"Title":"Jimmy Olsen: Adventures by Jack Kirby - Volume 2","review":"I am a Kirby fan and was intrigued to read this - since it marked Kirby's critical departure to DC. But it really isn't for all readers - by this time, Kirby had become an acquired taste, and in all honesty, this absurdist version of Olsen just didn't feel like the right vehicle for his ideas at the time. If you want to know what Kirby was really up to - then his New Gods series is a much better work..a classic that truly defines Kirby's vision. Jimmy Olsen was just a pitstop along the way - and such an odd comic that never quite worked. Jimmy and Superman exist in Kirbyvision - but they never feel like they quite belong there. Should you get this? Only if you're a Kirby completist I guess."},{"Title":"Jimmy Olsen: Adventures by Jack Kirby - Volume 2","review":"Once upon a time, there was Superman. And he wasn't invincible, he couldn't fly, and he wasn't infinitely strong. He wasn't even entirely bullet-proof, he relied more on his speed than his armored hide to keep from getting shot by... gangsters.Yep, that's right, he wasn't always fighting bizarre aliens, giant robots, or mad scientists. He even defeated such prosaic criminals as the mastermind of a car-stealing ring. And life was good, because he was a character who could have interesting stories written about him.Then began the superhero wars of the late 1930s when every cartoonist was trying to one up their competitors by making their superhero characters that much stronger, faster, more capable. Of course you need equally-invincible enemies to make any sort of a story, and pretty soon you end up with Utterly Invincible Being who gets trapped by a ludicrous plot device: Alien Overlord #322, Magical Substance #419, or Magical Creature #671. Boring.And thus Superman stagnated for the next 40-50 years, with a few notable exceptions. One of which was Jack Kirby's efforts for the extremely moribund \\"Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen\\" series.Before Jack, the series was far worse than the main Superman comic. Each issue Jimmy'd get turned into some stupid (and usually evil) monster: giant turtle, giant robot, giant Jimmy Olsen, mind-controlled Jimmy Olsen, giant ape Jimmy Olsen, Jimmy Olsen from Jupiter, combinations of all of the above, etc, etc. And it had few readers, though I'm sure they were loyal.Fortunately, Kirby had apparently never read any issues of Superman's Pal. He started off with a remarkably strong story about a secret \\"D.N.A. Project\\" to create Mutated Humans for Good, and he tossed in some ideas he had about \\"The Hairies\\" (a bunch of techology-overequipped hippies) and superbeings from other planets (proto-New Gods) and Intergang and Morgan Edge... and knockoffs of the old 1940s Newsboy Legion cartoon series.It had its bad points. For example, he never should've created the idea of extremely small humans; it simply opens up too many plotholes (not to mention it doesn't make any sense at all). And he still had to contend with Invincible Superman, though by giving him some genuine competition (and focusing more on Jimmy Olsen and the Newsboy Legion) he could keep things more balanced.Started off strong... but in usual Jack Kirby fashion it deteriorated into a parody of his original ideas--and ended up looking an awful lot like the old Superman's Pal.About halfway through he pretty much tossed out everything he'd been doing before, and started writing about vampires, the Loch Ness monster, and Victor Volcanum the fire-eating archcriminal. Those are the stories you'll find in Volume II. Frankly, they stink, and it's no wonder readership dropped back to its pre-Jack-Kirby levels.When Jimmy gets turned into a DNA-regressed version of himself you can be sure it's all downhill from there. Morgan Edge (the evil mastermind behind Jimmy and the Newsboy Legion's investigations) makes only one appearance in Volume II, three token Intergang members are dispatched without so much as a whimper, and the Hairies make one brief appearance in a side story. The story about Supertown (something mentioned at the start of Volume I) took up maybe 3 pages and was utterly pathetic compared to what was hinted at.Read Volume I if you want some idea of what could have been; read Volume II if you want to see the awful mess it turned into."},{"Title":"Clinical Manual of Cultural Psychiatry","review":"A very comprehensive review on cultural psychiatry.

While Harlequins give us pulsing and quivering, The Executioner gives us such unforgettably awful lines as \\"You delivered nothing but a flaming coffin.\\" and \\"But there had been frictions early on, fueled perhaps by the inevitable male-female chemical reactions flowing between these two exceptional poles of human excellence.\\"The poles in question are Mack Bolan, The Executioner and April Rose, who despite her porn star name, is a fed. They've known each other for five minutes and are in love. Of course. Having disabled the Mob once, Mack is back to make sure their efforts to rebuild are thwarted. April is \\"on loan\\" for Mack's six-day war, because the president wants Bolan alive and well and ready to head up a covert response to world terrorism. That Mack succeeds is a given, that he and April wind up in bed is inevitable and, if you're into the masculine response to Harlequin, you're bound to enjoy it.I can't really say anything bad, because it's not awful. I can't really say anything good, because it's not good either. It's a book, flowing with enough testosterone to make some of it laughable.

The relationships he describes between thinking, computing, and human behavior are extremely interesting and provide a &quot;look toward the future&quot;.

For me, there seemed at first to be a disjointedness among the first three or four chapters; however, as I progressed from chapter to chapter, Simon's principle themes continued to unfold ever more clearly. The final chapter on the architecture of complexity ultimately pulled together Simon's thoughts and elaborations from all preceding chapters.In sum, this book is both highly insightful and thought-provoking. Admittedly, I was at first skeptical, due mostly to the various negative reviews posted on Amazon.com; however, having taken the time to read Simon's seminal work, I am truly glad I did. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"The sciences of the artificial, (Karl Taylor Compton lectures)","review":"Let me first say a few words about the writing style. Simon's writing style is quite lackluster. He isn't a great writer like say Bertrand Russell, or George Orwell for that matter. But for the purposes of this book, his style suffices and is perhaps spot-on.Ok my general impression about the book: I think historically it's a groundbreaking book; it's a book written by a visionary; it's a book that at the time must have challenged a lot of people's opinions on a lot of things; in short it's an extremely important book! Having said that, here one needs to ask the all important question, reviewing it as one is, after a gap of more than 40 years since it was first published: Overall, has the book stood the test of time?The answer, surprisingly, is: \`Yes' and \`No'! Some of its insights are still very relevant, while some others are pretty outdated (which makes one wonder why Simon in later editions did not feel the need to say at least a few words about where he had gone wrong, and where he had over-simplified things to an astonishing degree).But before talking about both the great and not so great parts, let me briefly sketch the central idea that Simon has delineated in this book, which in fact drives the entire book. Simply, it can be described as the importance of concentrating upon the interface of a system with its outer and inner environments, without having to understand in detail either the inner or outer environments. In Simon's words, \\"We might look toward a science of the artificial that would depend on the relative simplicity of the interface as its primary source of abstraction and generality\\".Let's start with the parts that he got right. Well, first off, \\"Bounded rationality\\" of course. Simon states that the concept of bounded rationality was used by economists in some domains, even in his day (though he did coin this specific term). But he shows it quite clearly, without being antagonistic, through many examples that the concept of perfect rationality is incorrect, not only in reality (which everyone including its saner proponents accept) but also for practical purposes. Its not even good enough for practice, Simon argues persuasively. It is better to view people as bounded rational agents who adapt and satisfice rather than as perfectly rational agents who can optimize and possess an unrealistic degree of information and computational ability.Simon also says something extremely important that people tend to often forget. He highlights the fact that the debate between markets and hierarchical organizations often misses a very important empirical fact: \\"Roughly eighty percent of the human economic activity in the American economy, usually regarded as almost the epitome of a \\"market\\" economy, takes place in the internal environments of business and other organizations and not in the external, between-organization environments of markets\\". (For other, even more \\"shocking\\" facts about \`free' markets, I would refer the reader to Chomsky's writings). What Simon says about organizations, about centrally planned systems utilizing markets and vice versa, is enlightening to read and merits close attention!Ok, now onto the bad parts. These are ironically the parts for which I know Herbert Simon best: Artificial Intelligence. And it is here that Simon gets it quite wrong; his vision quite flawed and again, I would say, it is quite strange that he didn't deem it fit to acknowledge his mistakes in later editions.Simon gets the abstraction terribly wrong in his ideas about the human mind. The same idea of artificial systems having simple interfaces, that works (or can work) in the sphere of human economic activity, at that particular level of abstraction, simply cannot and doesn't work when applied to the creative use of the human mind. As Simon says in this book, (and as others from the group of \`cognitive revolutionaries' Chomsky, Miller et al would also say), the mind can be represented as an information processing system. But in line with the theme of the book, he feels that the mechanisms inside this information processing system are simple adaptive rules. His example of an ant finding its way back home is indicative of how extremely wrong he went with this kind of thinking. I quote:\\"In the case of the ant (and for that matter the others) we know the answer. He has a general sense of where home lies, but he cannot foresee all the obstacles between. He must adapt his course repeatedly to the difficulties he encounters and often detour uncrossable barriers. His horizons are very close, so that he deals with each obstacle as he comes to it; he probes for ways around or over it, without much thought for future obstacles. It is easy to trap him into deep detours. Viewed as a geometric figure, the ant's path is irregular, complex, hard to describe. But its complexity is really a complexity in the surface of the beach, not a complexity in the ant\\" Say what!?Let me just state, as a matter of FACT, how ants (or other insects) do path integration is still not clear, to this very day. To make a very long point short, so that its clear to the reader where Simon gets it wrong: Even if there was no beach, even if the path to home ended up tracing a straight line, even then there would be much complexity inside the ant. The complexity of the beach pales in comparison to the complexity of what is going on inside the ant. How is it that it integrates such different cues as sun position, leg movement etc, etc, is still unknown. This is where, I feel, as far as AI is concerned, Simon's whole abstraction, his central idea, his edifice (of artificial systems) falls apart.How could a visionary like Simon go so awfully wrong? I think the answer is pretty simple. I believe it stems from the nave hopes that he (and others) had for AI, namely, simple adaptive mechanisms could give rise to \\"intelligence\\". I feel that what he said on this subject stemmed from his exuberance for AI, which can be described thus: \\"If the mind is an artificial system with simple adaptive rules, then we shall soon invent \\"intelligent\\" machines as well. It's only a matter of time people!\\"So in short, I think it was his excitement about the birth of AI, which led him to his mistakes. Like many early ambitious AI theorists, he probably must have felt that \\"intelligent\\" machines were just around the corner.Having said that, is Simon to be blamed alone? Here's what one of my favorite scientists, the granddaddy of computing, Alan Turing says in his famous paper: \\"Instead of trying to produce a programme to simulate the adult mind, why not rather try to produce one which simulates the child's? If this were then subjected to an appropriate course of education one would obtain the adult brain. Presumably the child brain is something like a notebook as one buys it from the stationer's. Rather little mechanism, and lots of blank sheets. (Mechanism and writing are from our point of view almost synonymous.) Our hope is that there is so little mechanism in the child brain that something like it can be easily programmed\\"So we see that it is Turing who should be \\"blamed\\" for the early naive exuberance for AI. He hopes that a child's mind would be more or less a blank slate with some basic, simple mechanism.

The old mechanistic paradigm is in its last throes as the combined weight of relativity, quantum mechanics, new biological insights such as Goethean science, the ideas of wholeness, complexity theory etc etc forcfully remind one of the creativity not only of the human mind but all of nature. Is this so new ? Of course not, new ideas have appeared all throughout history but it is the mechanical way of thinking which confines the human being ie his/her own thinking is the culprit and this of course is then automatically supported by the construction of ideas or the manipulation of creative new ideas into mechanical form. As a good friend of mine says &quot;the machine is taking over&quot;. The mechanical way of thought has gone so far as to allow the creation of a machine society he would say. Is this so far from the truth ? Maybe not, but there are ways to elude this process. The person's own mind can achieve it. Edelglass, Maier, Gebert and Davy propose to do just this.The book has probably one of the best introductions I've seen, when it discusses how mechanistic science would describe the human smile as : &quot;a widening of the oral aperture, caused by the contractions of the cheek musculature&quot;, in other words such a science could not possibly hope to understand the &quot;warmth&quot; of a greeting or the &quot;gladness&quot; associated with it. It basically dehumanises the human experience. This book attempts at least to find a way to alleviate this situation through understanding how such a science came about and how to avoid this dehumanising approach without loosing objectivity. They discuss the senses used in scientific investigation noting especially that the sense of touch is most prevalent although many other senses exist other than the known 5 eg kinesthetic sense : awareness of our body, somatic sense : sense of well being of our body, sense of balance. It is the apparent separateness of the sense of touch which seems to create in the mind the idea that everything in reality is separate and made of parts. Piaget has shown such a learning takes place in small children and also gives rise to a construction of the self separate from everything else, people and nature. The book describes Galileos ideas of primary and secondary properties constructed through his own studies of phenomena such as the components of velocity in the moving object, periodicity of pendula etc, Descarte's &quot;Cogito Ergo Sum&quot; is discussed as well as the devlopment of the new science through the scholar and the craftsman, the enigma of quantum reality and the ideas of conscious participation of Goethe. In other words can the whole human being be used to understand a phenomenon ? Does it make sense without the loss of objectivity ? They believe it is possible to avoid the machine-like aspects of &quot;normal science&quot;. They give examples of such attempts eg Brian Goodwin, Jochen Bockemuehl and finally conceive of a science which expresses the whole in all its subtlety and as such evoke a new way of living itself, the mind, the body are now not separate things but all part of a whole. Part looses its separation and can only be defined through the whole.The book is a wonderful read being only short, 136 pages and can easily lead one to further interest in such ideas. Its well thought out without the annoying speculative reaches into insubstantial ideas which is the usual approach when objecting to current scientific dogma. Highly recommended for the scientist and layman alike although scientific concepts mentioned can confuse someone completely unfamiliar with them."},{"Title":"The Kind of Light That Shines On Texas","review":"The sensitivity and creativity with which the characters within these short stories grace the pages is a gift for us as readers, and an even more gracious gift of insight into our vast humanness.

The first section discusses the traits that are uniquely male, and contains chapters on male energy, male role models, male separation and love & sex. I thought this was particularly informative.

Such is the case here."},{"Title":"Cool Of The Evening: The 1965 Minnesota Twins","review":"You don't have to be a Twins fan to fully appreciate 'Cool of the Evening', but it helps. Jim Thielman covered the Twins as a freelancer and staff reporter through a couple decades.The book is meant to take fans back to 1965, the very first pennant winning season of the Minnesota club. The World Series, the first ever to be played in Minnesota, is almost an afterthought, but it's been so well documented elsewhere, Thielman prudently allows space to go behind the scenes, through spring training and the entire season.Thielman goes in depth on player backgrounds, the trades and twists of fate that brought them all together, and where they ended up after '65.Even though the team came out on the losing end to the Dodgers, '65 has always been special for Twins fans. The record of 102-60 is still the best ever for the franchise, in terms of wins. (The 1933 Senators who later became the Twins had a better win-loss percentage.)But beyond the statistics, Thielman brilliantly captures the drama of a pennant winning season by an underdog with a losing record the year before, a team that would dethrone the Yankees, winners of the past five pennants. He recounts the struggle of the league MVP and makes his case why Zoilo Versailles was absolutely more crucial to the pennant winning cause than any other team member, including Hall of Famer Harmon Killebrew and batting champ Tony Oliva. He details the conflict between pitching coach Johnny Sain and players coach and future manager Billy Martin, all the while leaving the reader sympathetic to each.He delves into the histories of the early Twins' stars, Oliva, Killebrew, Bob Allison, Camilo Pascual, and owner Calvin Griffith.Most of these players and coaches stayed connected throughout the years, such as Martin as manager of the Yankees in the '70s and Mele as coach with the Red Sox.He demonstrates how connected everyone in baseball seems to be, the degrees of seperation that seem minimal to the point of being nearly incestuous.He shows the development of several aspects of the game which are now common, such as the use of multiple relievers in a game, something the Twins did throughout the '65 season, but not so common in that era, or the platooning of players to challenge left or right-handed pitching.While the casual baseball fan may not care so much about these things, it's intriguing insight for the die-hard fan, offering information not available in a baseball encyclopedia.'Cool' is a rather quick read, but definitely one to be savored, and one that will help fans remember a season it seems the rest of the baseball world has largely forgotten."},{"Title":"Cool Of The Evening: The 1965 Minnesota Twins","review":"I appreciated that Thielman didn't put the players on pedestals but wrote about them in a way that made me see a real person in each uniform. Thielman gave equal time to a number of the lesser known players so that by book's end, you felt you knew third-string catcher John Sevcik almost as well as league MVP Zoilo Versalles.I think there is a tendency for fans to believe that championship seasons are \\"magical.\\" One thing you will take away from Thielman's book is that a championship season is really about hard work and being able to overcome adversity. The 1965 Minnesota Twins lost Camilo Pascaul and Harmon Killebrew - their best pitcher and most feared hitter - for significant portions of the season, but managed to still keep winning thanks to players like Jim Perry and Don Mincher filling in for them and not missing a beat.Another thing I liked about Cool of the Evening was the depth in which Thielman dealt with manager Sam Mele and coaches Johnny Sain and Billy Martin. These three men were as vital to the team's success as Mudcat or Versalles or Oliva and just as interesting to read about.Cool of the Evening was an entertaining and well-written book that I would recommend not only to Twins fans, but to any baseball fan. I compare it favorably to The Last Good Season which I read last year and also enjoyed."},{"Title":"Cool Of The Evening: The 1965 Minnesota Twins","review":"This book makes great reading for a Twins fan like me who is starved for more information on the 1965 Twins. The book shares stories about some of the great Twin players of the 1960's that I've read nowhere else. The only reason that I rated it 3 stars rather than 5 is not because of the material in the book. It's because of what wasn't in the book. There should have been a lot more photos. Instead, there were small \\"soft focus\\" snapshots at the beginning of each chapter. The text is well written, but more large, clear photos of the players particularly off the field would have made the book come alive even more."},{"Title":"Cool Of The Evening: The 1965 Minnesota Twins","review":"I just finished reading this and really enjoyed it.

I hadn't realized there was such a strong Cuban connection on this team put together on the heels of Castro's takeover. Also interesting to learn about how the owners of those days (The Griffiths) often struggled financially to make ends meet.

The Twins of Old were rockin' -- Mincher, Hall, Allison, Oliva, Killebrew -- they were somewhat the American League equivalent of the SF Giants of the same era with tons of power and a few great arms throwing at a very, very good catcher (in this case, Earl Battey). And the AL MVP, Zoilo Versalles, to boot. And like the Giants, those Old Twins were seldom \\"The Best,\\" but they were NEVER, ever far behind ...The '65 Series was the second I ever watched, the first since the collapse of the former Yankee Dynasty; I will NEVER forget the home run by Mudcat during it nor the stunning lead the Twins took at the Series' outset.I agree with another reviewer that we could have stood for a few more photos in this book, but what the heck.That's all, folks - time to get ready for tonight's game!"},{"Title":"Cool Of The Evening: The 1965 Minnesota Twins","review":"This is a great book about the American League Pennant Winners in 1965--The Minnesota Twins.

It could have been better though. At times the book seems a bit sketchy. The author should have interviewed opposition players and coaches about key series with the Twins that season. I especially enjoyed some of the stories about future Twin heroes like pitcher Jim Perry--trying to find himself and save his pro career (he later wins a CY Young in 1970) but nobody in majors wanted him at start of 1965--and Coach Billy Martin teaching players how to slide into second base using opposite hip.

Maybe it's the team itself. I mean, there really weren't a lot of characters despite many of the players who had character.I've also got to say I'm not having much luck with books on Minnesota's pro sports teams as the Klobuchar book (Knights and Knaves of Autumn) on the Vikings also did zip for me."},{"Title":"Cool Of The Evening: The 1965 Minnesota Twins","review":"The book was an entertaining read because it was a realistic view of the players. One could see the conflict between Johnny Sain and Billy Martin and understand how their personalities would cause clashes for them in future jobs.

I liked the mention of Al Worthington and how his religious faith caused problems for him on previous teams because he had a problem with teams stealing signs. The background mention of Don Mincher, Jim Kaat, Bobby Allison, Earl Battey and Harmon Killebrew among others gave an appreciation of the players.I like the mention of factors that influenced the attendance, such as the weather. 1965 was a horrible year in Minnesota and it affected the Twins, especially in the first part of the season.I could sense from the chapter on the 1965 World Series that this team is still revered in Minnesota."},{"Title":"Authority of the believer (Faith library publications)","review":"A wonderfully insightful study of God's Word and some of what He wants us to know until He returns for us."},{"Title":"Foundation Flash 8","review":"I just finishing reading Foundation Flash 8, co-authored by Sham Bhangal and Kristian Besley. The technical reviewer was Todd Yard, a role that he has played in 11 other Friends of ED books. I was checking out Todd's company website, and was very impressed. He works for Jeremy Allaire, former CTO of Macromedia. You might recognize him as the creator of the product that made Dreamweaver so great - Allaire Homesite. I digress, back to the book review.First of all, let me specify who this book is for: Those looking to get a handle on Flash, starting from square one. One fellow gave it a really harsh review, probably expecting it to be something along the lines of Flash 8 Essentials. That being said, Foundation Flash 8 is a very good book in its own right. Sure, the first few chapters are elementary, but considering that this text is supposed to take you from beginner to intermediate in your skill-level, it's right on target. It takes you step by step through each part of the interface, and then builds from there. By the end, you're making simple video games.Even seasoned veterans could benefit from reading through the introductory chapters, because of some of the significant changes to the way Flash works. For instance, object drawing used to cut out shapes that overlapped each other, which was an annoyance those who were used to a different graphics program.This was always confusing to me, being a big fan of Macromedia Adobe Fireworks, the interface of which looks very similar to Flash. Now that this has been tweaked, the two cousin programs behave more similarly. This book does a good job of pointing out things like this, that while simple, could possibly prove confusing for those already used to the previous behavior. You could say that before, Flash was in \\"quirks\\" mode, and now it's more streamlined.One of my favorite section of the book was chapter 12, which covers sound and video optimization. Flash 8 goes leaps and bounds beyond where its MX 2004 predecessor had been. I like that fact that the authors emphasize that you should tweak, listen to, and watch your projects as you work on them. While Flash has some heavy-duty compression by default, you would do well to choose specific settings for each media file you use, as this will help you get the best sound / picture clarity, while keeping your file size as low as possible. As is the case with most things in digital / physical art, practice makes perfect.Another thing I appreciate about this book is its emphasis on learning real code. Some of the Flash books I've read in the past tend to gloss over this as too difficult for newer users. This may be true, but it does them a disservice not to teach it. Thankfully, these guys encourage the reader to delve in further, and draw the line between beginner or expert at the point of ActionScript...\\"You can use a drag-and-drop behavior. It's fast and efficient, but at the expense of reducing your understanding of the problem, and it offers a solution that addresses problems that may not be part of your particular task. It's also a 'one size fits all' solution - and how many times have you bought a one-size-fits all shirt and thought 'Mmm, fits perfectly, almost as if it was tailor-made for me?' Me neither.\\" - Page 302The above quote pretty much sums up the jist of all web-based design. I can't tell you how many times I've got an email or been asked in person, even by experienced visual designers: \\"What program do you use to make your CSS websites?\\" What they mean is: How can I point-and-click my way through it? The short answer is: You can't, not of you intend on learning anything. Most people are disappointed to find out I use Araneae for all of my hand-coding.Likewise, if you want to really harness the power of dynamic animations in Flash, you need to get comfortable with ActionScript. For those of you who are familiar with JavaScript already, it shouldn't be too hard to pick up because AS syntax is modeled after JS. If you're new to both, fear not, because Flash comes in with a built-in code assistant, similar to that in Dreamweaver.The authors start out the ActionScript chapters using the code assistant, and then gradually steer the reader towards typing out code by hand. You could think of it this way: at the beginning of the book, you're riding a tricycle, but by the end you're handling a Harley Davidson.My advice is this: as you're reading this book, take it all with a small grain of salt. They tend to hail Flash as the final point in web evolution, and sort of treat HTML as a necessary step for embedding your SWF file. I would swing the pendelum back towards the center, treating Flash as part of a wholistic solution to the web, using the most logical solutions where appropriate. Sometimes we over-complicate things, and lose the beauty of simplicity. As long as you maintain a larger perspective, you will learn much from this book."},{"Title":"Foundation Flash 8","review":"Being a novice designer, I learn most effectively when I have experts telling me the ins and outs of how things work in a program, explaining the logic behind a certain sequence of actions, and sharing the tips and tricks from their wealth of experiences using the program. And this is how I exactly felt embarking on the exciting exploration of the Flash world using the Foundation Flash 8 book by Sham Bhangal and Kristian Besley.The book covers Flash 8 from its basic tools and techniques in dealing with shapes, text, colors and animations to the more advanced action/interactions and ActionScript. Rather than just prescribing step by step procedures to use the many tools and functions in Flash 8, the authors reveal what is behind the scene - from simply how terms such as \\"Tweening\\", \\"Onion Skins\\" and \\"Masking\\" came about to the underlying mechanisms of ActionScript. In addition, I found also most useful the many \\"rules of thumb\\" of using Flash that the authors share throughout the book.The book proved to be very helpful for me as a novice Flash user to gain some solid foundational skills and a well-formed beginning understanding of how things work in Flash. The authors achieved this through their well-written explanations and illustrations, plus hands-on practices for the users, which consist of numerous mini exercises in each chapter of the book and a larger project that the users continuously build on throughout the chapters. The final few chapters also provide some nice additions including how Flash works with the Internet, principles of good design, and so on. These help put learning Flash in context and making it fit nicely in the large picture of Web design.In the end, the five hundred plus pages of the book were fairly easy to go through, (also thanks to the light humors intermittently found in the writing). I felt more confident working with the powerful program, and I just cannot wait to roll up the sleeves and get started with some real work using Flash!"},{"Title":"Foundation Flash 8","review":"\\"Foundation Flash 8\\" by Sham Bhangal and Kristian Besley is, overall, an excellent introduction for all new Flash users, be they right-brained artists who think a line is something you draw in a picture or left-brained techies who think a line is something you write in a program.Right-brained readers will be enthralled by the first half of the book's focuses on Flash's drawing and animating features, with exhaustive treatment of symbols, colors, tweening, and masks. There's even an excellent section on text and text animation. Left-brained readers will drool over the second half of the book, which runs from simple behaviors to intelligent actions to \\"intermediate\\" ActionScript. Somewhere in the middle, there is lots of talk about buttons -- and artists will be thrilled with all the things they learn to do to make them look pretty and programmers will be equally thrilled with all the things they learn to do to make them do neat things when pushed.Of course, if artists didn't learn some ActionScript (or at least some basic Flash behaviors), or if programmers didn't learn animation, then there would be no point to learning Flash. Bhangal and Besley manage, in \\"Foundation Flash 8,\\" to teach the full range of foundation Flash functionality to the full range of novice Flash users. While programmers might yawn a bit during the first few, graphics-intensive chapters (and, I imagine, while artists' eyes might spin somewhat during the last couple of ActionScript chapters), there's plenty in this book to keep everybody happy. Conveniently, the authors have structured the ongoing case study -- and have provided intermediate project files -- so that skipping sections or chapters is possible.The authors make no assumptions about the level of knowledge of readers, other than that experienced Flash users are not their target audience. Everything is taught from square one (or, sometimes a bit frustratingly, from square zero). Straightforward and moderately complex topics are explained well throughout, and the more advanced scripting topics are equally well presented. One shortcoming is the less-than-stellar handling of complex, abstract graphics topics, such as advanced gradients and B&eacute;zier curves; as the authors put it on page 63, \\"It's easier to do than to explain!\\"Friends of ED publishes what are probably the best design-oriented books in the business, and \\"Foundation Flash 8\\" certainly fits their usual high standards. The paper is thick and bright, the typography is pleasant, and the writing style is friendly -- at times bordering on plucky (page 132: \\"Colors, fills, and gradients are the extra paprika on the already tongue-tingling dish that is Flash\\"). This particular volume does suffer a bit from its two-column layout, which results in figures -- particularly screenshots -- being a bit too small for comfort, and from its one-color printing, which is not so much a problem in a book on, say, Dreamweaver or PHP but which is a significant disadvantage in a book dealing with a drawing and animation tool. (As the authors themselves acknowledge on page 132, \\"It's never going to be entirely satisfactory to discuss color in a book printed in black and white...\\")Pluckiness and monochromicity notwithstanding, \\"Foundation Flash 8\\" does exactly what its name suggests -- it gives the reader a solid foundation in Flash 8 -- and it does it well. The book is comprehensive, accurate, clear, and well organized, and most importantly, it bears the \\"Friends of ED\\" cachet and is backed up by the best support in the business: the Friends of ED readers' forum, a lively and helpful online community frequented by authors and other experts always willing to answer question and to help solve problems. \\"Foundation Flash 8\\" is a fine choice for anyone eager to get his hands wet with Flash. I strongly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Foundation Flash 8","review":"just needed to counter the previous review, because i found (an earlier edition of) this book the best resource of many for getting my head around Flash. Sham is a brilliant author - RESPECT ! the content was thorough and engaging - well recommended."},{"Title":"Foundation Flash 8","review":"This book covers a lot of ground and does so in a detailed and friendly way. It's organized and laid out logically enough, getting you started with the interface, tool types and basic animation, and then working its way through more and more complex topics. The book's working examples are appropriate for each level the book advances through,and the writing style is approachable enough that a wide range of users should find it worth their while.I gave this book four stars and not five because it wasn't proofed well in some areas. For example, the chapter on Flash video notes incorrectly, that Mac users -even prior to the days of OS X- could download a free version of iMovie to start making movie content. The actual situation is that iMovie has only been available since OS X arrived, and only to those who have purchased a new Mac with a super-drive, or purchased the iLife suite. It is not and has never been available as a free download.Another flaw this book has is that many of the screenshots are scaled down so much, that you cannot read the dialog text without squinting or looking very closely. (I don't wear glasses btw : ) Not all the screenshots suffer from this problem, but enough do to make it frustrating at points. A better idea for the next edition is cropping out the empty space or unimportant parts of a given dialog box, rather than scaling the whole dialog box -even the parts with important text- down.Overall still a good book, and worth owning if you only have time or resources for one Flash Book. I prefer this book's learning style to that of the Lynda.com type books, which seeminly are all made from the same cookie cutter.

One of the challenges of these intensive courses is that we cover so much material, so fast, that it is hard to get any depth before we are off to the next tool. I looked around the net for tutorials and other resources to supplement class materials and having had previous good experiences with this publisher I picked up Foundation Flash 8 as a beginner book (and ActionScript for Flash 8 as my next step up).I found this to be a very solid book. The early chapters are, in effect, the manual that didn't come with my Education Version product. All the basics that we zoomed through in class were right there when I needed them and I found myself enhancing my homework assignments by doing what was required, looking up topics when I was stuck and adding extras to the projects that helped me nail an A in the class.I reviewed many programming books a few years back, and my first impression was that these books felt a bit different. I think some of the complaints one or two have voiced may be related to this. But upon review of the material and test projects I find this book friendly and well laid out. The material covered served both as a ready reference and as a good foundation for more advanced material. It starts at raw beginner and moves into some meatier intermediate stuff that I am still using to get ready for the more advanced ActionScript I am interested in.About the only complaint I can register is that my personal interests lie more towards producing games and animated cartoons so I would have found an emphasis on that more \`fun' - but that isn't a reflection on the book, just my childish nature. ;)I recommend this book for beginners as a good reference and foundation for more advanced Flash topics."},{"Title":"Foundation Flash 8","review":"you should buy it if you need it . r e c o m m e n d e d."},{"Title":"Foundation Flash 8","review":"It's very educational but the contents...yuck.

This collection gives us three plays - one less than the usual four per collection that can be found. While this may overall seem like quite a bit, it is not, in fact, worth much.Yes, \\"A Doll's House\\" is still the intriguing, fascinating play it always is. As a play, \\"A Doll's House\\" is highly recommended. Just don't get it HERE. Why? Well, mostly because of what ELSE is offered. The first play here is the strange, confusing \\"League of Youth\\". It unfortunately did not reach Ibsen's level of mastery as found in the later plays. Too many characters and nothing particularly interesting just had the play stop and stall.While all of Ibsen's plays are worth purchasing (if only for study), the problem here is the edition. For the same price (or less), one can get \\"A Doll's House\\" with much better plays with four per collection. A personal recommendation is that of Oxford's World Classics, mostly due to the presence of the incredible \\"Ghosts\\". Signet Classics also has an edition, for those who want something cheap and easy, though it has \\"The Wild Duck\\" (not as good as \\"Ghosts\\", but still so much better than \\"League of Youth\\"). Both editions also have \\"Hedda Gabler\\" and \\"The Master Builder\\". When given a choice between four plays or three, four is preferred, especially when they are the better works.Turn elsewhere."},{"Title":"Doll's House and Other Plays","review":"The description of this purchase said the volume included about 6 or more of Ibsen's works. However, upon recieving the book I discovered only 3 of Ibsen's works were included. I was buying the book for the main play of \\"A Doll House\\" but I was looking forward to having the other plays as well. Nice printing, just not as many plays as expected."},{"Title":"Doll's House and Other Plays","review":"In this interesting play, Henrik Ibsen sets up a scenario of a married couple with three children that seem to have a good relationship with each other. This couple is Nora and Helmer (called Torvald by Nora). They always seem to have romantic conversations with each other, but soon, we learn that years ago Nora had to take a loan from Nils Krogstad, in order to pay off a lifesaving medical treatment for Helmer. He doesn't know this and thinks that the money came from Nora's father, who has passed away.Helmer, who has just been named a manager of a bank, is always treating Nora in such a sweet manner, such as \\"Is that my little lark twittering out there?\\" or calls by another bird's name. She always gets little money from Helmer, but never gets large sums because Helmer is worried he thinks she doesn't know how to manage her money wisely. In the beginning, Nora treats Helmer with overwhelming respect although Nora is hiding her loan that she is paying off on a regulaly with some of the money from Helmer. Nora doesn't want Helmer to think she took a loan since she thinks it could affect their relationship.There are three other supporting characters in this play: Dr. Rank, Nils Krogstad, and Christine Linde. Dr. Rank is a friend of the family who is seriously ill. Nils Krogstad a worker at the bank, who is about to his job to a friend of Nora's, Christine Linde, a woman who recently moved back to the area because her husband died.At the end of Act II, we find out Nora forged her father's signature on the loan. Krogstad had written a letter to tell Helmer about the loan. Nora is worried that Helmer will read the letter Krogstad wrote.This play is about a woman trying to understand her marriage, and always wanting something wonderful to happen. With Helmer, she finally realizes that she isn't being treated the way she wants, and nothing wonderful seems to happen. Nora had no trouble making the decision of leaving her family, but perhaps she would have had a hard time recovering from this rare type of circumstance in this time and age."},{"Title":"Doll's House and Other Plays","review":"As I very clearly stated above, this is a read-worthy book, though not my favorite or one of the best books that I have ever read.

The story is simple, and sweet, and makes you feel that you are back in Scotland at the turn of the century. After reading Cronin I must find other books that he had written.

Cronin's characters are generally so well crafted that one gets a sense of who they are without having to dodge labels of \\"good\\" or \\"bad.\\" They're just people compellingly portrayed, behaving and responding to one another against a dramatic background. There are no car chases, fistfights, courtroom scenes or gun battles, but there's still plenty of drama -- and humor.

It lacked the cynicism of Maugham's book, and instead of endless philosophizing, it simply provided the reader with good thought-provoking material and left him to draw his own conclusions, if he wished.It was also consistently enjoyable, though some sections were rather depressing.The characters were realistic and vital. Most of them were multi-dimensional, while a few of them were deliberately done in one dimension. As in real life, one was constantly changing one's opinions about the characters. It was unusually good in this respect.The plot, finally, was engrossing and, again, realistic.

This book covers in depth sailing including in bad and icy conditions, a whaling station (ie slaughterhouse), and an icy trail on foot and skis across Norwegian mountains. Each is described with the eye of one who has lived it, and that is the primary treat in every Hammond Innes book. He went there, he lived it, he flensed, he gybed, he trekked. The story is a standard one with bad guys and good guys and a pretty girl, but the characters are deeply enough drawn to make the experience vivid and alive. If you see it, buy it.

For example, a number of works weren't available to Demuth for one reason or another, or he had seen only piano reductions. More importantly, Demuth's judgments about certain works have simply not been borne out by the history of the last 50 years. The opera Padmavati is not on a par with Wagner. The orchestral suite Evocations is not as important as a Beethoven symphony.Despite this, there is much of interest here. It is the best English-language source of biographical information, for example. Furthermore, Demuth is thorough and entertaining, making this second only to Basil Deane's biography for those who do not read French.But most of all, for those of us who love Roussel and feel he is underrated, seeing him compared to Beethoven and Wagner is an indescribable thrill"},{"Title":"The Theory of Inspiration: Composition As a Crisis of Subjectivity in Romantic and Post-Romantic Writing","review":"this is a very clever work, inspirational in itself. the relation to modern and classical philosophical ideas of the complex and imaginative philosophy surrounding deism, the source of inspiration and the role of the poet/prophet is adressed in a unique fashion. this is an inspirational insight into others thoughts on inspiration.

Iwahara's work actually reminds me a bit of Calvin and Hobbes, especially in the detailed backgrounds and use of varying line widths to great effect. The characters are super cute and very individualized and the plot, though nothing super new, is definitely fun to follow. If you've been wanting a shoujo manga with a new and different look, then this is the one for you!"},{"Title":"Chikyu Misaki, Vol. 2","review":"I'm a manga skeptic--I read *everything* when I was a kid, but nowadays, something has to jump up and grab my attention to get me to read it.In the case of Chikyu Misaki, what jumped up and grabbed my attention was the art style (bold and definite, with solid, unique character designs and lots of emotion and expression that doesn't use many of the shorthand emoticon-esque tricks found in many manga) and the creature design for Neo. I am a sucker for a fuzzy big-eyed plesiosaur.The plot here is an old standby of kids' movies--kid moves somewhere new, lives in a big old house, and discovers a legendary creature that she has to protect from the world. It's the way Iwahara Yuuji tells his version of the story that makes it well worth reading. While it comes across as active, light-hearted, and sweet, it doesn't veer away from some difficult territory--there's violent death, kidnapping, and a lot of fear and pain for a bunch of young kids to work through.In this volume, the crime and conspiracy plotlines take off. Where the first volume spent time focusing on Neo and his sheer adorableness and vulnerability, this one pushes Neo a bit to the background as the mysteries and competing ambitions converging on Lake Hohoro start to spark revelations, tension, and action. In the end, though, Neo's sadness still anchors this volume, as does Masaki's care for him. Asai Tokuko also steps forward as a character, another lonely kid trying to find her place in the world and unable to address her own emotions."},{"Title":"The improvement of sight by natural methods: A complete treatise upon the newer methods of treating all conditions of imperfect sight by natural ... necessity for glasses, drugs, or operations","review":"This doctor preserves The Bates Method.

Kallmaker, arguably the bestselling writer of lesbian romances, contrasts images of a \\"traditional romance\\" (if such a thing can be said to be portrayed in lesbian writing) with the realities of love as it exists in everyday life. The lead character, Sugar Sorenson, is a talented, intelligent woman in her thirties struggling to establish her own specialty bakery business in Seattle's post-DotCom-boom. The action opens when Sugar's home is destroyed by fire and her plans for competing in a city-wide \\"Cook Off\\" contest, with its related monetary prize and boost in notoriety, are seriously threatened.After months of no social life, Sugar suddenly finds herself under the romantic notice of not one, but three attractive, dynamic women. There is a gentle but strong social worker named \\"Tree,\\" a tall, dark and handsome firefighter named \\"Charlie\\" Bronson, and the elegant and vivacious television producer named Emily. Their combined energy is almost more than Sugar can juggle after her long, self-imposed solitude, not to mention the stress of the fire. For a time, Sugar is confused because her apartment is not the only fire she is feeling. The sexual tension is palpable and Kallmaker serves readers a few deliciously hot scenes. Sugar tries to decide which woman really attracts her - and, more importantly she realizes -- which woman's life is headed in the same direction as Sugar's.With nowhere to go Sugar finds herself returning to her maternal grandmother's house and braces for the onslaught of judging, preaching and meddling that characterized her grandmother while she was growing up. But something has changed dramatically and Sugar discovers that she perhaps didn't know her grandmother as well as she thought. There are assorted complications and miscommunications to occur in the weeks following the fire and Sugar's life does not turn out as she'd expected.Food and baking flow through the novel in many ways. Descriptions of complex baking projects occur through much of Sugar's day as well as the steady, comfort baking of Sugar's grandmother. Further, Sugar's world view is often cooking related with Emily's eyes being \\"the blue of four drops of food coloring into a quarter-cup of sugar\\" (p7) and a woman is \\"hotter than Tabasco.\\" (p132)Sugar is a kind of \\"every lesbian\\" and the issues she and her friends deal with are those that most of us face in our day-to-day lives. Kallmaker's Sugar does not follow the \\"story book romance\\" formula; however, she plays with its themes. Even the cover art, which is reminiscent of a 1950s \\"happy home maker\\" image, tweaks at this \\"ideal.\\"Kallmaker's writing is charming entertainment. Her wry wit and gentle humor prompt smiles and quiet chuckles, as when Sugar dresses for her first date in months to discover \\"Good God in heaven, how long had that enormous black hair been growing out of her chin?\\" (p63) Or when Sugar mentions that she'd heard Charlie and Tree had dated for a time, and is told \\"We did not. We met at agreed upon places and argued.\\" (p182)In many ways, Sugar is a return to some of Kallmaker's earlier romances, like Painted Moon or Making up for Lost Time. However, if it is a return, it is not without the maturity that her writing continues to develop. Peopled with real women who are grounded in the realities of life and willing to accept the risk of love, Kallmaker's \\"romance\\" provides readers with simple, touching moments. As Sugar reflects, \\"The world seemed peacefully asleep. It was just her and the moon and the scent of Emily on her fingertips.\\" (p111) Sugar is a lovely dessert of a book made with real eggs, butter, and no doubt, chocolate. Light and fun it is, yet it's not an artificial confection. Readers of the lesbian romance genre will want to lick the spoon."},{"Title":"Sugar","review":"Like jam on toast done golden and crisp, this latest romantic tale from Karin Kallmaker was just right for me. I'd recommend it to any fan and certainly to anyone (if there *is* anyone who hasn't yet experienced her light, pleasing romantic touch) who likes a good read.Like all of her novels, she avoids the formula even though in the purest dilution of the plot it reads like a classic formula. The reason it's not is that lesbian romances (unlike het ones) most often open with the presentation of two characters we know will get together before the last page. The pleasure is in reading how. Kallmaker )like Radclyffe, another favorite of mine) can take that simple outline and do wonderfully different things with it. In Substitute for Love, for example, Holly and Reyna don't actually meet until at least 3/4s of the way into the book, yet their collision course is clear from page 1. In Embrace in Motion, Sarah chooses Ms. Wrong for the first part of the book, then comes to realize Ms. Right has been under her nose all along.In \\"Sugar,\\" Kallmaker twists the usual lesbian romance beginning of two primary characters by giving us Sugar and three potential suitors for her affections. All three are charming, sexy, persuasive and very interested in Sugar. But only one will earn her love. Along the way Sugar -- like you and me and all the women we know -- has crud to cope with, a business to run, life to handle.I loved the journey with Sugar, all the way. I loved her confusion when she felt real lust for a woman she wasn't yet sure she could like as a friend. The puzzlement of feeling affinity with someone but the lack of that spark that would create that first kiss. And finding herself feeling lust *and* affinity and then being completely tongue-tied and scared to make the first move -- and so is the woman who is trying awfully hard to say I love you but doesn't quite know how. These are women still forming, strong in their own sense of self but not yet deft at dealing with their own emotions. It made me full of wonder that at any point any of us ever figure out how love works. The romantic sentiments in this book are charming, all the way through.If that story weren't enough, the plotline with Sugar and her grandmother is vintage Kallmmker and yet brand new. She set up Sugar's dread of living with the raving bible-thumping homophobe so I was dreading it just as much and then pulled the carpet out from under my expectations and own presumptions as she so often does. I scraped my jaw up off the floor at about the same time Sugar did. Sugar's three older (and bossy) sisters are delightfully drawn, as is her fascinating ex and still friend, Noor. I'd love to see a short story about Noor and her gf in a \\"Frosting on the Cake 2.\\"Which is the whole reason I'm writing this review -- how about it, Miz K? Can we have some more Frosting? I really want to know so many things! Did Shea and Anthea have their baby? Is Sydney President yet? And c'mon, Holly and Reyna need more story! More Frosting? Please???I'll quit begging and end by saying that while Sugar herself is indecisive and founders a bit in trying to decide what love is and isn't, when it comes to what's right for her family, doing the right thing, she doesn't hesitate. She's a complicated young woman, getting by the best she knows how and I would be *proud* to be her big sister.Thank you once again, Miz K, for a great read, worth every penny and every minute. Like all the others, I know I'll read it more than once."},{"Title":"Sugar","review":"I am not a romance fan and most of my lesbian focused reading has been erotica anthologies. Recently I ran across a hot hot hot story by this author in one. I had presumed she was basically vanilla and had never read any of her books. But the story was great and so I ordered a couple of her novels.I didn't realize that she writes two styles and that I was ordering a \\"traditional\\" romance (if you can call a lesbian romance that). My mistake, but I thought I'd read this one anyway. (The other was All the Wrong Places, a romantic/erotic novel that I was so pleased with I still can't get my head around how to review it.)I truly enjoyed this story, though romances aren't my cup of tea. It was funny, to start with, and touching at times. Other reviewers have pointed out that the main character could be your next door neighbor and it felt that way to me too. I liked it, to my surprise. Not the love story - though it was convincing and sweet - but the sense that this ordinary story of two women falling in love was NORMAL...what we all should have in our lives without denigration from Jesusland types.I felt good when I finished and might even read another again sometime, and if you knew me, then you'd know that's a major compliment. The sex is indeed vanilla in this tale (not so in All the Wrong Places!) but still explicit enough to be steamy. I am giving it 5 stars because it is exactly what it's supposed to be, and well-written."},{"Title":"Sugar","review":"First, the disclaimers. I am not a professional book reviewer, nor do I play one on TV. Secondly, I am hopelessly prejudiced toward Karin Kallmaker as she has displaced all previous authors in my long, long, (sometimes I think way too long), almost 40 years of reading, to reign as \\"my number one.\\" And yet, I am a reluctant reviewer of her latest offering, \\"Sugar.\\" My reluctance is due to the fact that as an avid hetero fan, I can't help but feel embarrassingly out of place and intrusive reviewing literary works not aimed at me. And I cannot escape the sense that those readers to whom it is aimed, would say, \\"who cares what he thinks anyway.\\" However, as an unabashed admirer of all her works, in my mind that this alone is more than sufficient to persuade me to overcome my reluctance in singing her praises.I hate labels. And yet its is just the sort of shorthand we humans seem to require in order to make sense of the chaos that is our reality. So I suppose labels are a necessary evil. I say this because I've never agreed with the idea that her works are strictly \\"romance\\" novels. Her authorial abilities and insight are so far and away from such limited pigeonholing, that only those who have read and appreciated the quality of her works, could possibly understand what I mean. While romance is clearly one of the central aspect of her works, it is by no means limited to that. I prefer to see it as human interaction from the lesbian POV. She writes of love that's sometimes lust, and lust that sometimes transforms into love. Sexy lips and curvy hips, sometimes pleasingly plump, sometimes with morning mouth, hate your boss, love your neighbor. Those with envy and spite, life with the dull and bright. All with equally generous portions of despair, humor, wit and introspection. All this and more can be found in her works. Heterosexual writers should be so gifted.Her fantasy writings, as Laura Adams are imbued with a quality that allows one to envision olden times in what I can only describe as a truly magical reality. You know it can't be true. Can it? Yet you fall into those fantasy worlds she creates without hesitation, nor looking back. Not a bad feat. And I have coined my own phrases to describe her abilities, by referring to them as \\"KK's.\\" Particularly whenever I read some of her prose that I feel is actually closer to poetry. An example of this from Sugar: \\"The kisses seemed endless but always new,\\" is only one of so many that constantly causes me to hesitate to catch my breath, to muse, or to laugh uproariously, or simply think and sometimes wonder in awe at the beauty of her words. Now that's poetry. Her writings reflect a uniqueness, a earthiness and honesty rarely found among most of the publisher's offerings today. There is nothing trite, banal or pedestrian in her writing, and yet her characters are talking about and living in the same workaday reality as all of us. Life as \\"we\\" know it. She's simply better at describing that world, and the characters she's created who live in it.\\"Sugar\\" is a case in point. Sugar Sorenson is most definitely a \\"Kallmaker\\" character. Funny, believable, self-effacing, filled with personal anomie, and yet lusty, sexually intriguing, honest and original. How she is able to time and time again create such characters is worthy of its own analysis. \\"Sugar\\" is both a comical and insightful story that illustrates the life of an almost middle-aged lesbian filled with the uncertainties and fears of having to start life over after a fire devastates her attempts to make her own way in the world. As a result of this calamity, she then suddenly finds herself surrounded by people so supportive and interested in her, that she can't seem to make the leap of faith to believe in its truth. Let alone their raving assessments of her beauty and other attributes. In this case, there are three particular admirers, Charlie, Tree and Emily, that come to her rescue after the fire and one immediately finds oneself weighing their various qualities to \\"help\\" pick the right one for Sugar. It took all my will power not to turn to the last pages to see in advance who it was she finally chose. (I picked the wrong one. But then I always root for the underdog).If there were ever to be an examination required in order to become an official lesbian, there is no doubt in my mind that Karin Kallmaker would be required reading prior to testing. As it is, I think it should be included among the subjects that any serious university English Department would include on it's fiction book lists. Much of literature written today is forgettable in my opinion. With Kallmaker, you find yourself reading, re-reading and re-reading them again, both for the simple pleasure of it, and as a way to see you through until the next one is published.I have little doubt that when I am pushing up the proverbial daisies, Kallmaker's works will still be available through reprints. And although in a perfect world I would love to see her writings spread far and wide to be enjoyed by others of my ilk (I found her by accident), there is also a part of me that wants to keep her secret with \\"just us.\\" So where can I apply for my honorary lesbian membership card? Kallmaker has totally won me over. Once you read her, she'll get you too. Because this \\"Sugar\\" is just too sweet."},{"Title":"Sugar","review":"I tend to finish a book of this length in about two days. This one took longer than usual because I just couldn't get into it at first. In fact, I finished Madam President and First Lady while I was trying to read Sugar. I have a tendency to read more than one book at a time, especially when one doesn't really keep my interest... That said... by the time I was finished with Sugar, I decided I really liked the book. I'm sure when I read it again in a few years I'll appreciate it more.Sugar's illegal apartment burns down and she suddenly finds herself surrounded by eligible, attractive women. There is Tree, the social worker from whom Sugar receives comfort. There is also the TV producer Emily, a woman about whom Sugar feels undeniable lust. Finally, there is the firefighter Charlie, a woman for whom Sugar gets both types of feelings... but appears to be already in a relationship. Add this to Sugar's less than stellar relationship history, and you've got this little gem from Kallmaker.When I got to the end, I had a better understanding of the author's intent, but had a tough time following the main character's confusion. I'm not sure I understand why she's suddenly so attractive to so many women. Has she really led a sheltered life? Or, did she just happen to run across three potential lovers at one time? Even though they are secondary characters, her sisters seem rather underdeveloped... maybe she should have had only two? And she finally chooses Charlie, but Charlie's character seems underdeveloped too. I might say the same about Tree. Emily was better done. Maybe if the book had been longer and the three love interests had interacted, I'd have liked it more in the beginning?Give this one a chance... When Kallmaker closes the loop on her story, you'll find it's been worth the wait."},{"Title":"Sugar","review":"There was a time when I wouldn't touch a \\"romance\\" because the writing was torrid and cliched, the plots absolutely unbelievable and contrived and the characters made of sickly sweet cardboard. Then, because I was blown away from Karin Kallmaker's alter-ego Laura Adams, a friend insisted that I read my first romance. I've been eating crow ever since.Sugar is a sweet story. Those who found the despair and trauma of Bree in Maybe Next Time heavy going are going to be pleased with this one. It's light, funny and absolutely *real.* Sugar's story could be that of any friend of mine. Frankly, I wish it were mine!Imagine, disaster strikes and you find yourself the object of fervent attention from not one, not two but THREE bona fide wanna get down to business lesbians. Each woman is real, has an absorbing career and personality to spare. It's a dream come true.Except, if you're Sugar Sorenson, you're just muddling through life the best you can and can't really fathom what these great women see in you. But over time you begin to realize you have far more to be proud of and celebrate in your life than you thought. Maybe, just maybe, you *are* lovable and sexy. I know you can't grow your own self-confidence based on the opinions of others, but it surely helps! I want to meet Sugar at the laundromat and gab over burgers. She's the epitome of the lesbian-next-door.One of the ways, I think, that Kallmaker makes her romance stories so real is that they are liberally sprinkled with background characters that are well-crafted and do more than arrive to announce some plot point or allow our heroine to discuss what's on her mind for our benefit. She also wonderfully sprinkles her books with elements of multi-culturism that are never contrived. Her books look like the America I live in, at least in a state struggling hard to stay blue. I really *wish* some of my unneighborly neighbors could see Jesus the way Sugar's Grandmother did!The courting dance is one of the delights of this book, and Kallmaker's humor is, as always, part and parcel of her gift for prose. Sometimes it's a belly laugh, but more often than not I smile over a delightful turn of phrase or image. When Sugar passes out after the opening page fire, she thinks of her three rescuers, \\"Angels of cocoa, cinnamon and vanilla... If she'd known they were coming she'd have baked a cake.\\" Minutes later, when her landlord tries to blame Sugar for the fire: \\"Her lesbian trinity closed ranks.\\" What a wonderful, empowering image! The scene and the following fun with cell phones had me grinning ear-to-ear.Sugar's not a perfect being. She can be childish but brave, sensitive but scared, funny or scathing as the situation calls for. But she's always kind, tries to do the right thing by her family and herself and all in all, I think another reviewer said it best: I'd be proud to be her big sister. Or best friend. Actually, I'd kind of like to get to know her, but I'm thinking her girlfriend (and I won't spoil the surprise!) wouldn't like my motives.Another delightful read from Miz K's pen. And because the friend who first urged me to read her romances never forgets my ignorant opinion of them, another serving of crow for me."},{"Title":"Sugar","review":"Sugar is sweet.

Charlie Bronson, firefighter - Gantry \\"Tree\\" Racine, Victim's Services and Emily Dorsett, producer of the TV show interested in doing a story on Sugar and an upcoming cookoff. One Sugar was working hard to be able to enter.Able to salvage some of her things from the fire, Sugar slowly begins the process of recovery. Charlie, Tree and Emily are all interested in helping. Though Sugar suddenly feels like SHE is the prize in a lesbian bake-off, she has to admit to a bit of attraction for each of the women. Whom will she choose? Does she even have to? While each woman would like to be the one chosen, Charlie hopes with all her being that she is the one Sugar wants to be with. Will she be? Or will she find herself losing Sugar to the enigmatic TV producer or the ever friendly Tree?Karin Kallmaker has long been an established talent. Sugar is a book that shows that while sweet, sugar can also be a bit sticky as the author throws in a mix of romance with drama."},{"Title":"Sugar","review":"I'm a huge Karin Kallmaker fan and find all of her novels entertaining, illuminating, thought-provoking and -- importantly in today's world -- fun. Some can be completely emotionally draining. Others fast-paced and full of wit. Some, like this one, are sweet, simple and thoroughly satisfying.I couldn't figure out why such a simple story stayed on my mind. Sugar isn't the same emotionally-wrenching story that Maybe Next Time or Substitute for Love is. It's not the immersion into a woman's inner life that Unforgettable or Wild Things is. And yet it stayed in my mind. I found myself thinking of little moments from the story and once even thinking \\"Sugar would think that was funny\\" -- like I knew her!I think that is the magic of this deceptively simple tale. Sugar could be an old friend you haven't seen her for a while and you're sitting down over cups of coffee as she updates you on her life. It's not a rollercoaster, but it's interesting. It's nothing that would make you say \\"you're kidding!\\" Everything that happens feels like a slice of a Real Lesbian Life.Sugar is like the cure for the L Word, where no one on the show looks or acts like any lesbian I've ever met.If you're expecting another masterpiece of craft like Maybe Next Time, you might disappointed. But there can only be so many lesbian violinists out there in the world, rare beings that I relate to on a human level but might not show me much about being a lesbian.If anything, Sugar is the flip side to Maybe Next Time. There are Sugars in all of our lives, some of us *are* Sugar, and this story picks up this ordinary life and shows its humor, drama, conflicts and tough choices. Maybe Next Time was like a Nora Roberts emotional pot-boiler. I would have to say that Sugar is like a gentle, insightful Anne Tyler story.Sugar has been nominated for a new award called a \\"Golden Crown\\" which focuses exclusively on lesbian literature. The reason that excites me is that it's about time that these great writers in our community got some recognition for how much they've done to elevate the stories of lesbian lives into stories that anyone could read and relate to.Karin Kallmaker is my favorite lesbian writer (though I have developed an extreme liking for Radclyffe) and the easy simplicity of Sugar to me proves her lasting talent at telling relevant, meaningful *fun* stories of lesbians lives that reflect back all the things in my life and make them seem special. If Sugar can have such a charming book written about her, then all of us are just as special. That feeling of validation is an incredible payoff for the price."},{"Title":"Sugar","review":"The main character is a little slow to figure out which woman is right for her but with three women interested in you, who wouldn't be a little confused? Great story development and romance!"},{"Title":"Sugar","review":"What can I say that hasn't been said all ready. It's a classic Kallmaker story with all the goodies that come from her: steamy, realistic and trustworthy characters."},{"Title":"Sugar","review":"Yumm!! toasted banana bread !!!This is a terrific novel. The dialogue is probably the best I have read by this author and she excels at snappy dialogue. My favorite character is Sugar, I loved how she related with Emily, Gantry, Charlie - anyone of these women had potential to be an ideal partner for her. Sugar's grandmother is a hoot! The humor sparkled throughout the novel.I couldn't be happier that I chose this book to read while bringing in the new year."},{"Title":"Sugar","review":"It's just unbelieveable to have three woman wanting you at the same time.All because your home burned down.Sugar is turning up the heat for a cook-off contest.How will she determine which suitor best suits her?"},{"Title":"Sugar","review":"This offering from the queen of lesbian romance is pretty disappointing. As a long time reader, I'm used to very appealing characters that you can route for all the way.

I quote the heart of it because it is simple pleasure to read this analysis of the great critic- creator on the master literary creator.\\"In Hamlet he seems to have wished to exemplify the moral necessity of a due balance between our attention to the objects of our senses, and our meditation on the workings of our minds, - an equilibrium between the real and the imaginary worlds. In Hamlet this balance is disturbed : his thoughts, and the images of his fancy, are far more vivid than his actual perceptions, and his very perceptions, instantly passing through the medium of his contemplations, acquire, as they pass, a form and a colour not naturally their own. Hence we see a great, an almost enormous, intellectual activity, and a proportionate aversion to real action consequent upon it, with all its symptoms and accompanying qualities. This character Shakspere places in circumstances, under which it is obliged to act on the spur of the moment :- Hamlet is brave and careless of death; but he vacillates from sensibility, and procrastinates from thought, and loses the power of action in the energy of resolve. Thus it is that this tragedy presents a direct contrast to that of \\"Macbeth;\\" the one proceeds with the utmost slowness, the other with a crowded and breathless rapidity.The effect of this overbalance of the imaginative power is beautifully illustrated in the everlasting broodings and superfluous \\"Anyone who wishes to know what great literary criticism is should read and study this volume."},{"Title":"Japanese Prints","review":"This book is without the illustrations. Useless. It seems almost fraudulent to pretend to publish a book about pictures and which references the pictures in the text, then not include the pictures.What the heck are they trying to do?Don't waste your time or money, go to woodblock.com if you want to find out about Japanese prints, Its free and complete."},{"Title":"The Medieval Calendar Year","review":"Bridget Ann Henisch has written a delightful book. She knows what she's talking about, and writes well, with enthusiasm. She imparts her knowledge easily. A reader with scant knowledge of the importance of the medieval calendar year will understand a lot more by the time she's finished the book. The selected bibliography is worth the book's price. Very useful for those interested in medieval history or looking for reliable reference sources. BUT this is a book about the illustrated calendar, stunning medieval illustrations, some tiny, but all in glorious colour. My gripe is that most of the illustrations in the book are in black and white and very small. Henisch urges readers to note some fine detail but the reader often needs a magnifying glass! Surely there is enough interest in the medieval period these days that the publisher, Penn State Press, could have really gone to town on a large, beautifully coloured, lavishly illustrated text? Look at the sales of that lovely medieval calendar! Shame not to support Henisch's excellent text with better reproduced illustrations."},{"Title":"The Medieval Calendar Year","review":"This book is clear and straightforward. There are lots of illustrations around which the text is woven. This is not exactly about my main area of interest (which is depictions of Labours of the Months in wood and stone) but Henisch's comments on manuscript illuminations shed light on my areas too. I liked her utterly unpretentious style - it is a pleasure to read. Perhaps a bit repetitive, and rather too much on gardening(!), but overall a very interesting book on a subject not much seems to have been written about in recent years. (I only know of T.P.Higuera's &quot;Medieval Calendars&quot; 0-297-82370-1.)"},{"Title":"English from the Roots Up Flashcards, Vol. 2","review":"I was so happy to see volume two of these cards available. I have used volume one for years. I can't think of a more easy, effortless way to enhance vocabulary studies, foreign languages, or even science (classification). When the kids know these roots, they can figure out the meaning of so many words; it is just amazing! My students test really high in vocabulary and I give these little items credit for a large part of that (also reading lots of GOOD books)."},{"Title":"English from the Roots Up Flashcards, Vol. 2","review":"I love, love, love these cards. I was exposed to Latin terms when I was in college, and it thrills me to no end to expose my two students to these terms now. My 9th grade student uses these cards when defining terms in her biology class. And my young 3rd grade student has been exposed to them more slowly in terms of thinking of how these root words are used in our English language still.We didn't buy the workbooks with these two volumes of cards. We just stuck with the cards. It was much cheaper, and these cards will last for several years. I look forward to using and reusing these cards for many years to come."},{"Title":"English from the Roots Up Flashcards, Vol. 2","review":"Speedy delivery and good product. The cards are a little thin, but not flimsy."},{"Title":"English from the Roots Up Flashcards, Vol. 2","review":"My son just started using these cards to study Greek and Latin Root words.He(a 9th grader) took PSAT test before we got these and got his score yesterday.He missed 5 vocab questions, which is big deal in this test.After he reviewed what he had missed, he said, \\"mom, now that I know more Greek and Latin root wordsI could've gotten most of these answers right\\"There are books and flashcards, but a few reviewers said that flashcards were more helpful to study.I absolutely agree with them.I and my husband are ESL learner so sometimes we can pick a few cards each to study and rotate the cards between 3 of us.Sometimes my 5th grader learns a word or two and thinks it's not too bad. Much less intimidating than dealing with pageful of all big words.We love them and would recommend to our friends."},{"Title":"English from the Roots Up Flashcards, Vol. 2","review":"These are index card type flash cards, easy to read. One side has the word root and the other has the definition and several words made from the root with their definitions. If you are trying to decide between the book and the flash cards I would say go with the flash cards unless you want your child to make their own cards which is the point of the book. The book does give a little history behind each root but that is the only extra info within the book itself. The only con with the cards is durability. They are the same as an index card and over time will wear and tear."},{"Title":"English from the Roots Up Flashcards, Vol. 2","review":"My son is in 3rd grade this year and is really enjoying his flash cards. I bought the other set as well and picked all the Latin roots out for him to learn first since he is learning Latin this year. The cards have been very helpful and fun! Later in the year we will incorporate the Greek roots as well."},{"Title":"Lessons in Bobbin Lacemaking (Dover Knitting, Crochet, Tatting, Lace)","review":"Includes everything you need to know to make bobbin lace. The patterns are simple and attractive with an emphasis on yardage laces for trim as opposed to motifs and doileys. If you're taking up lacemaking on a budget, this is the book for you. This one was written during the Dark Times when lacemaking equipment was scarce, so there is a chapter included on making your own pillow and bobbins. This is a keeper."},{"Title":"Lessons in Bobbin Lacemaking (Dover Knitting, Crochet, Tatting, Lace)","review":"This is the book I used to get started with making bobbin lace. The directions for the patterns start out with excruciatingly exact and precise details. As you move farther into the book, the directions assume a certain level of experience and become less detailed. That's okay, by the time you get to those lessons, you already know what a half-stich and cloth stitch are and no longer need that level of detail. I heartily recommend this book to all of my students."},{"Title":"Lessons in Bobbin Lacemaking (Dover Knitting, Crochet, Tatting, Lace)","review":"Fro many years this book was the only book on Lacemaking available in English and we are so grateful for it. But almost all the English language books available today use a different method from this one, and it would be confusing to start with this method and then have to change when buying any other English book. It might be better to start with the method you will continue with.But if you have a teacher from Belgium this would be the method she will use.(as opposed to an American or English teacher)"},{"Title":"Lessons in Bobbin Lacemaking (Dover Knitting, Crochet, Tatting, Lace)","review":"I bought this book when I joined a lacemaking guild thinking it was a great beginners book that would help with my learning; I was wrong. My teacher said, \\"it is worth having, don't get me wrong, just don't pay attention to what she tells you.\\"First off the stitch terminologies used are completely different than those used in the greater lace making community. So, as one other reviewer pointed out, all other books and prickings will \\"read\\" differently. You may end up confused and frustrated.Second, all the patterns require the use of heavier linen threads. This makes the finished lace thick and coarse. Honestly most lace makers I know prefer fine cotton or silk threads over linen, also cotton and silk is infinitely more available. The text provides no alternatives to the linen thread; which I feel a \\"beginners\\" book should. I've had to invest a lot of time into recalculating the thread weights and/or reducing the pricking sizes of the patterns. There is another great book that helps with this \\"Threads for Lace\\" a Must must have if you want to get serious about lace making.Third, there isn't a variety of lace styles. They all seem to be Torchon styles and I've found that I much prefer tape laces (Idrija, cantu, etc.) as a beginner. That is taste I know, but it would have been nice to have some tape lace option in a book for beginners as they are simple and use fewer bobbins.I would recommend Jean Jagendorf's books for the best guide to learning bobbin lace - she really knows her stuff and actively teaches."},{"Title":"Lessons in Bobbin Lacemaking (Dover Knitting, Crochet, Tatting, Lace)","review":"I have other books referring to bobbin lace but not so in detail.

The book is both informative and interesting as it is written as if the author is having a conversation with the reader. She did a great job in listing and describing materials needed. Her lessons were clear and progressive as I moved from one to the next. The author is a real teacher. And with the help of videos on YouTube I was able to learn without going to a class. And I have moved onto the book by Pamela Nottingham. If someone were to ask me to help them get started I would loan them Doris Southard's book."},{"Title":"W. H. Auden's Book of Light Verse (New York Review Books Classics)","review":"I finished reading W.H. Auden's Book of Light Verse and I found it to be a mixed bag. First some definitions: this book was originally published as part of the Oxford University Press' collection of books of poetry. Commissioned in the 1930s, it is not, simply stated, a book of comedic verse, although many of the pieces are quite humorous.It is rather a collection of poetry of popular verse, beginning with poems in Middle English (\\"Sitteth alle stile and herkneth to me ! / the kyng of Alemaignr, bi mi leaute,\\") and carrying through to Auden's contemporaries (\\"Spirits of well-shot woodcock, partridge, snipe / Flutter and bear him up the Norfolk sky:\\"). Representing many forms, from nursery rhymes (the original \\"Jack and Gill went up the Hill\\" is in here -- Gil, who knew it was Gil) to elegies to limericks to odes, and many voices (some American, Irish and Scottish, though mostly British) it is a thorough collection.And therein lies my problem with it. As a collection, I found myself thumbing through, looking at particular pieces and savoring them, and skipping others completely. It is collection which, to me, is often excellent, and occasionally horrible.One of my favorite pieces (which I have marked since I am sure to read and re-read it) is \\"The Careless Gallant\\" by Thomas Jordon. It begins \\"Let us drink and be merry, dance, joke, and rejoice, / With claret and sherry, thorbo and voice ... In frolics dispose your pounds, shillings, and pence / For we shall be nothing a hundred years hence.\\"Another seemed particularly relevant to our current time. John Gay's \\"Ode for the New Year\\" makes fun of King George, and I drew some inspiration from it, and wrote my own re-interpretation of this poem, titled \\"Ode for a Second Inauguration.\\" Much of the piece is based on the original John Gay piece -- grab the original to compare and see for yourself.So, in short, a worthwhile piece to add to a poetry collection, but not one to start your library."},{"Title":"Breakout from Stalingrad (S.S.Wotan)","review":"This is another riveting, beginning to end, must read in one session for the description and story. The author had to be there to write such a terror filled account of the author's time there and his escape. Action filled from beginning to end. This book has been reprinted many times and it is time to reprint it again due to the popularity of this author for riveting storyline and his other books of his experiences during WW2..You cannot put this book down until its end."},{"Title":"Heidi Redux","review":"Heidi Redux is a memoir as unique as the woman who wrote it. Every page reflects her irrepressible personailty and strength. In the foreword by U.S. Surgeon General (Retired) C. Everett Koop, he states that Heidi has &quot;rubbed shoulders with the great and near great.&quot; Still, it's clear that she has not allowed friendships and professional associations with presidents and senators to change her basic outlook.Heidi grew up poor in the forties. Admittedly, her childhood was far from being Utopia. From one failed attempt at farming to another, her hard working step father and less-than-nurturing mother struggled to make ends meet. Heidi was a precocious child, curious with a vivid imagination. Her clothes and hair were often unkempt; their homes had no running water or electricity so cleanliness was not a priority. But Heidi made straight As in school and took great pride in every accomplishment. Good grades earned her paid scholarships to nursing school. Heidi excelled in nursing school, despite a disastrous first marriage, and took life firmly by the horns soon after passing R.N. state boards.The adult Heidi is intelligent, erudite, an adventuresome spirit, risk-taker, adept manager, devoted wife to her second husband.....and alcoholic. True to form, she takes on the world and climbs the ladder of success while battling a dependency on alcohol. Her husband is a respected Neuropsychiatrist appointed to responsible positions in both the public and private sector. First Governor, then President Reagan is his friend. It's during the Reagan years that Heidi and her husband gain important positions in Washington D.C. Their work takes them around the world as they circulate with potentates and kings. But it's her determined struggle for sobriety that this reader will remember.Heidi Redux is an amazing journey. The author takes us with her from stark childhood to policy maker in the rarefied air of Washington D.C. to her retirement in the present day. Along the way, as we see the world through her eyes, she shares her thoughts on such profound subjects as the causes and effects of our failed mental health system and the labyrinthine workings of government and military spending.The author shares her life with forthright humor. She doesn't mince words or make excuses. Heidi simply tells it like it is with fast-paced prose and keeps on trucking. Hers is a fascinating story, well told, and deserving of a wide audience. Heidi is one of a kind."},{"Title":"Heidi Redux","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Heidi Redux. Heidi's is a true-to-life Cinderella story, minus the benefit of a fairy godmother. She tells her story with humor and a frankness that keeps you reaching for the next page. It's a beautifully written and inspiring book. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Heidi Redux","review":"An Astonishing look into an innocent heartTo read this small jewel of a book is to look into the mind and heart of a simple, wholly unsophisticated farm girl who, by dint of a certain joyous, courageous effort journeys into the highest levels of government power, telling it exactly as it was, with refreshing candor and the simplicity of a Grandma Moses painting. An inspiring and touching tale of the colorful life of an American girl who became a powerful woman. Along the way she conquers alcoholism, finds her soul mate, and lives out her life 'happily ever after.'"},{"Title":"Heidi Redux","review":"This is a gutsy book by a gutsy woman. As C. Everett Koop, M.D. noted in the Foreword, it reads almost like a diary. The writing style is Grandma Moses in literary form. It flows effortlessly from one chapter to another, chronicaling the life of an unloved child who matter-of-factly trudges onward and upward. It's also a touching love story along the way. I found the description of how she dealt with her alcoholism enlightening and believe it will give hope to the women battling this devastating disease."},{"Title":"Jean Baudrillard: Selected Writings","review":"critics of &quot;postmodernism&quot; often fail to see past ideological blinders or perhaps are just too lazy to actually read the works of (anti)theorists like jean baudrillard. this collection is superb as mark poster offers a concise overview of baudrillard's &quot;project&quot; and also reveals baudrillard's work in all its iconoclasm and hyperbole all at once. this definitely makes for a fascinating read if not a critical insight into late modern society."},{"Title":"Jean Baudrillard: Selected Writings","review":"Like so much travelling these days under the fashionable banner of &quot;post-modernism,&quot; Baudrillard and his ilk fuel the arrogant irrelevancy that has reached epidemic proportions in the lower reaches of the Humanities, exemplified by that most dubious of 'disciplines,' &quot;cultural studies.&quot; A no less fashionable curative to this pretentious non-sense is the (otherwise, but much more fruitfully, problematic) work of Richard Rorty, particularly his widely-read book, CONTINGENCY, IRONY AND SOLIDARITY."},{"Title":"Struggle for the Land: Native North American Resistance to Genocide, Ecocide, and Colonization","review":"Long out of print, this new edition of Ward Churchill's Struggle For The Land: Native North American Resistance To Genocide, Ecocide And Colonization is an impressive and very highly recommended collection of fiery essays that will give the contemporary reader pause concerning the American government's systematic exploitation of the land and elimination of the Native American peoples who have inhabited it, and the bittersweet results of the Native American attempts to defend the land from defoliation, strip-mining, and other destructive depredation of the 19th and 20th centuries. An extensive detailed collection of essays chronicling such events as the Lakota struggle for the Black Hills, an acute perspective on the Navajo-Hopi land dispute, a stringent presentation of the American Indian diaspora, and more, make Struggle For The Land a core addition to community and academic Native American Studies collections."},{"Title":"Struggle for the Land: Native North American Resistance to Genocide, Ecocide, and Colonization","review":"I found this book to be very well put together and supported with mountains of evidence. Recently Mr Churhcill has come under fire from the right for some remarks he has made in the classroom. This does not surprise me since this book is a rather damning indictment of past american treatment of native americans.I was interested in this book for it's environmental implications since that is my field. Regardless, I found myself more and more interested in the humanitarian issues contained within as the book marched on. So, while I lack the socio-ethical background to provide any in depth critique of those issues, I will say that it is well put together, is interesting, and won my sympathy.All in all definately one of the better books I've read."},{"Title":"The Biology and Conservation of Wild Canids","review":"The book has three parts. The first part consists of several overview chapters on canid society, infectious diseases, and similar general topics. The final section is a single chapter on conservation, which provides a very strong summary though it fails to break new ground. The middle part, and the bulk of the book, is a series of case studies of canids, both well-known and unfamiliar.Some of these case studies (i.e., those on red and gray wolves, or island foxes) focus intensively on management issues. Other case studies seek basic information about poorly-known species (i.e., bat-eared foxes), or seek to make some purely-biological point (i.e., that Finnish racoon dogs are becoming a separate species from Japanese racoon dogs). A few other chapters straddle the biological and management perspectives, extending moderate bodies of scientific knowledge and discussing management problems briefly (i.e., Ethiopian wolves).Like the focus, the quality of these chapters varies widely. It seems that the editors never really got control of their contributors and were unable to force a conservation or management perspective on everyone. This is especially ironic since one of the co-editors was a co-author of one of the chapters that fits least well.As a result, the book will be of limited interest to the general reader (and I cannot say how interesting it is to the specialist). The chapters on wolves are interesting but the material in them is available elsewhere because these species are so well known."},{"Title":"The Biology and Conservation of Wild Canids","review":"If you want to learn about canids all over the world this is the book for you. Not only is it a credible resource, it has up to date information about conservation issues and research currently being conducted. Overall, a great scientific resource that cuts to the chase and gives you the facts."},{"Title":"The Golden Road","review":"This book has the same charm and story telling as Anne of Green Gables. It concentrates on a family on P.E. Island and the various adventures of the young band of cousins growing up together. If you recall the old Disney Channel show \\"Avonlea\\", this book is where most of the main characters originated, with some name changes."},{"Title":"The Golden Road","review":"I have read this book many times since I was 13, and I'm 19 now. I think the ending is very sad, the realisation that we all have to grow up, and the hints we are given about the future of the characters we have grown to love. I was near tears reading about cecily, and the ending seemed so final. We can never return to our childhood, but we can remember the good times in reading this book. Whereas the Story Girl, although a fascinating book, is, in reality, little more than a stringing together of many stories, in this book the characters are properly developed."},{"Title":"The Golden Road","review":"The Golden Road and its prequel, The Story Girl, are two of the best books I have ever read. I never seem to get tired of them, either...I have read them countless times! If you enjoy L. M. Montgomery's novels, such as the Anne of Green Gables series, these books are a must. The Golden Road tells the story of cousins, Beverley (who narrates the story), Felix, Cecily, Felicity, Dan, and Sara Stanley, also known as the Story Girl, plus their friends Peter, the hired boy, and Sara Ray. The adventures these eight have are sometimes exiting, sometimes sad...but mostly really funny! For instance, one time, they have the governors wife to tea...but they think she's their deaf Aunt Eliza and comment on the governors big nose and such things!

It will make you laugh, and even shed a tear or too. It will bring back memories of childhood, or of the childhood we wished we'd had.

Delightful!"},{"Title":"The Golden Road","review":"Despite the long-ago nature of the story, children like Beverley, Felix, The Story Girl, Felicity, Dan, Cecily, Peter and Sara Ray live today. Montgomery treats children - and their points of view - with respect. She shows their virtues, faults, triumphs and follies in an honest light - sometimes poignant, sometimes funny. She also captures that magical betwixt-and-between time that the Story Girl and Beverley are approaching, as they begin to move away from childhood. The ending is sweet and sad at the same time."},{"Title":"The Golden Road","review":"I enjoyed The Golden Road, but not as much as I enjoyed The Story Girl. I recommend you read the two novels together, one right after the other. If you enjoy reading books set in a long-ago era, the books have a charm to them. If you like action, these books will not appeal to you as much.In my opinion, it is not possible to enjoy The Golden Road unless you have just recently read The Story Girl. Not all of the characters and actions in TGR will be understoon unless you have read TSG. The characters are a lot of fun and are well-written. The adventures this group of friends have together will stay in your memory forever."},{"Title":"The Golden Road","review":"I loved this book. I read the Story Girl years ago, but the 'Road to Avonlea' books ruined the concept for me, and I forgot that there was an original sequel.

I read the entire book that afternoon - forget about the fact that exams were six weeks off, that I should be vaccuuming - I couldn't put it down.

The story ends on a bittersweet note as the children are growing up, but is nonetheless worth reading."},{"Title":"The Golden Road","review":"\\"The Golden Road\\" is the sweet-souled sequel to Lucy Maud Montgomery's excellent \\"The Story Girl.\\" The novels must be read in order; \\"The Golden Road\\" picks up without preamble where its predecessor left off.The King brothers Bev and Felix; their King cousins Felicity, Dan, and Cecily; \\"Story Girl\\" Sara Stanley; and neighbors Sara Ray and Peter Craig face winter in the small town of Carlisle, on Canada's Prince Edward Island. To pass the time, the children decide to publish their own magazine, with stories, advice, and personal ads. The magazine will be only the beginning of their adventures, as the children wrestle with New Year's resolutions, host the strange visit of an aunt who isn't an aunt, survive a snowstorm, spend a night in a witch's house, attend a wedding and a funeral, and prepare for the departure of some of their own.\\"The Golden Road\\" is less about telling stories, although the Story Girl has a beauty in finally solving the mystery of the Awkward Man. This novel centers on the interactions of the children as they arrive at the awkward edges of adolescence. Much of the story, including a bittersweet ending, is told in retrospect by one of them. However, it is Montgomery's superb narrative gift that makes the journey entirely worthwhile. \\"The Golden Road\\" is very highly recommended to fans of Lucy Maud Montgomery, especially those who enjoyed \\"The Story Girl.\\""},{"Title":"The Golden Road","review":"The Golden Road and its prequel, The Story Girl, are two of the best books I have ever read. I never seem to get tired of them, either...I have read them countless times! If you enjoy L. M. Montgomery's novels, such as the Anne of Green Gables series, these books are a must. The Golden Road tells the story of cousins, Beverley (who narrates the story), Felix, Cecily, Felicity, Dan, and Sara Stanley, also known as the Story Girl, plus their friends Peter, the hired boy, and Sara Ray. The adventures these eight have are sometimes exiting, sometimes sad...but mostly really funny! For instance, one time, they have the governors wife to tea...but they think she's their deaf Aunt Eliza and comment on the governors big nose and such things!

I love the fact that the recipes are simple and delicious (I think I have tried nearly all of them), but it is the layout and extras offered that make the book especially great. For example, there is a full size colour picture of every dish beside the recipe; each recipe includes a suggested wine; and suitable ingredient substitutions are provided for most recipes.. The beginning of the book lists the staples you need to have for most of the recipes (most of which are stocked in the average kitchen anyway)and at the end of the book there is a breakdown by season of what recipes are best suited given the availability of local produce. Finally, there is a section of the book entitled &quot;leftovers&quot; which lists the recipes within the book which could be used for each type of leftover you may have.

Every little sentence, and I mean, Literally every little sentence, will get to the sweet spot, and tickle you again again, until you have spent the whole of yourself, and are wondering, what , what exactly is there after ecstasy. I am a radio engineer, since the last 20 years, but have spent almost half a decade, building line modems for a living. This book, with every word, hits me in the right spots, but then, this kind of background is a little clumsy.

As it turned out, we could not have found a better candidate. Fred doesn't just offer state-of-the-art processing techniques - many of which he himself has developed - his pragmatic focus on efficiency and real-world implementation is truly refreshing.This superb book delivers that same approach and philosophy in a very readable, approachable text. Unlike the vast majority of books in the field, which teach only the mathematics of signal processing, Fred teaches you what it really means, and how to make it work. You'll learn extremely efficient signal processing techniques, but even more importantly, you'll gain a much deeper understanding of digital communications that will change the way you approach systems design. From my perspective, this is quite simply the best book available for practitioners who are creating advanced digital communications systems.Do you want to become a better engineer? Buy it!"},{"Title":"Multirate Signal Processing for Communication Systems","review":"I purchased the book \\"Multirate Signal Processing for Communication Systems\\" by Fredric J. Harris because it contained an entire chapter devoted to the Cascaded Integrator Comb (CIC) filter. This filter, sometimes referred to as the Hogenauer Filter, can be used to implement efficient multirate decimation and interpolation filters for large sample rate changes.To date no author of any book or technical paper that I am aware of has ever been able to explain the mathematics of pruning bits in each of the N stages of a CIC decimation filter design. I had high hopes that Harris's book would finally be the one book that would go where no book has gone before.Unfortunately the book could not be previewed on Amazon so I bought the book on faith alone. I ended up being disappointed. In his treatment of CIC filters that are used for sample rate decimation he presents an obtuse equation with 6 variables that is supposed to explain something about determining the number of bits that can be pruned from each stage of an N stage CIC decimation filter. The problem is, this equation was presented right out of the blue, without any definition of what the 6 variables were. Nothing preceded this equation, or followed this equation, that was relevant to explaining what the equation was or how to interpret it. Somehow the reader is supposed to magically figure out how this equation and all 6 of its undefined variables, is relevant to CIC bit pruning. I held out some hope that this equation had been derived and explained in previous chapters, so I spent several hours searching the book from the beginning to the end for any material that was remotely connected to that equation. I had no success.I have read many papers and many texts written by many authors that dealt with CIC filters. Without exception all the authors arm waved and side stepped this critical bit pruning topic, but this is the first time I have ever seen anything as crazy as this."},{"Title":"Multirate Signal Processing for Communication Systems","review":"With excellent clarity, multirate filters are described, derived and then implemented. Any DSP filter designer will benefit from this book, advanced or not. Also, a series of proprietary filter structures have been 'donated' to the DSP community in this book, wherein some of the most effecient filter structures I've ever seen are explained and implemented."},{"Title":"Multirate Signal Processing for Communication Systems","review":"I was hoping to get a good understanding of multirate DSP out of this text, having no knowledge of it previously. However, I was not succesful. The text starts out well with a practical illuminating example of the use of multirate signal processing. However, I was not able to absorb much knowledge in the subsequent chapters and gave up on continuing. There are very few equations in this book, which to me was initially promising as I am tired of DSP math books. The author relies more on graphics and figures to explain his point, but I found that the detail was lacking. Perhaps someone with stronger background in this area would be better served by this text."},{"Title":"Multirate Signal Processing for Communication Systems","review":"I wish this work were available when I was implementing multi-rate, multi stage filters with MSI integrated circuits and a wire wrap gun! But we are now in the FPGA world, and professor harris's work is in tune with today's hardware implementations. His attention to implementation efficiency with realistic comparisons is valuable. My only minor \\"ding\\" would be that some of the MATLAB code is not well documented and the results take some effort to interpret. That said, having the MATLAB code is a BIG plus. Even better would be to have Simulink models of the filters."},{"Title":"Multirate Signal Processing for Communication Systems","review":"Every decade or so a book comes out that distills a lot if scattered knowledge on an important subject into one concise and comprehensible tutorial. This is such a book.

I've used a few of these tricks in the past, but what an eye opener to see so many great examples of sneaky DSP.Fred Harris makes it clear with vivid examples and MatLab illustrations that using multi-rate signal processing moves you into a whole new class of implementations. No longer does one ask, \\"What sampling rate do I need to satisfy Nyquist? The question is now, \\"What sampling rate do I need in each section to optimize the design? This book helps the DSP practitioner answer that question. The sampling rate degree of freedom liberates!

Every chapter (and additional matlab code) provides you with simple and up to the point effective and elegant solutions to most modern DSP issues. Channel shaping with modified SRRC, fractional rate matching including Farrow filter, FFT-based channelization, multirate FIR, IIR, CIC etc. Each topic here can be a book itself.

This new edition is only for Shabbat and festivals (it has no weekday services.) Many of the translations of prayers are nearly identical to the original 1985 edition, but there have been a number of changes. This siddur uses gender-sensitive translations of the names of God, and presents a more literal translation of a number of key prayers. It presents the option to use the Imahot (matriarchs) in the Amidah (Shemonah Esrah).This edition also restores some traditional Ashkenazic prayers that were not in the 1985 version, including Rabbi Ishamel's 13 principles of biblical interpretation, the B'rah Dodi poems for Pesach, Ana B'kho-ah in Kabbalat Shabbat, and the Ushpizin for Sukkot, included in a new, egalitarian version. The Y'hi Ratzon meditation following the Musaf Amidah is restoredThis edition includes new translations of a number of prayers and poems that were not translated at all in the previous edition, including Akdamut and the Hoshanot (only summaries of these prayers had been given previously). Based on reader feedback, and the popularity of the (Orthodox) Artscroll Siddur, this edition incorporates many helpful new features: an easier to follow layout and table of contents; many pages have notes explaining the background and meanings of the prayers; guidelines and instructions on the content, choreography and continuity of the service.

The plot is based upon a technology the author has thoroughly researched; it is presented in a way to make it plausible. The heroine, Toby Harper, is a likeable, if naive character you can root for all the way. I loved this book until the last ten or fifteen pages which include at least one event that makes no sense and exclude at least one badly needed explanation.

She also learns that her knowledge of the practice makesher expendable by people who do not want their profitable business ended.HARVEST was one of the top ten books of 1996, but LIFE SUPPORT is aneven better novel. Tess Gerritsen has created a medical thriller thatleaves readers with the creepy crawly feeling up and down their spines dueto its chilling realism. The implications are terrifying, leaving readersto ponder what next after completing this pulse pounding, natural mescalinelike ride of a best selling novel.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"LifeSupport","review":"This was, I believe, the second Tess Gerritsen book I have read. Now, you should know that I love medical thrillers. Robin Cook is one of my favorites. But Tess crosses the line: with scientists creating chimeras of various body parts, inserting them into prostitutes, wait for the chimera to grow, then kill the prostitutes (and then catch the chimera as it slithers across the floor, so you can harvest its parts). It was all just way too graphic for me.If you find the concept of cloning reprehensible, then you will NOT enjoy this book. If you want to read about scientists doing the above things in the name of science, then maybe you would like this book. But I don't recommend it."},{"Title":"LifeSupport","review":"I don't read many medical thrillers. I've read all the Kay Scarpetta novels but those don't count. It is Robin Cook that I can take or leave, but after a couple of years of my wife leaving Tess Gerritsen novels strewn around the house I decided to pick up the earliest written one that I could find and see what the fuss was all about. Gerritsen is a gifted writer. Toby Harper is a totally believable heroine and Gerritsen has crafted a multi-layered page turner. All the characters, and there are quite a few from all walks of life, are well developed. I look forward to more Toby Harper novels."},{"Title":"LifeSupport","review":"...perhaps it is the genre, but every medical thriller I read (or, in this case, hear) seems like a re-hash of \\"Coma.\\" Evil medical doctors who are conducting illegal/immoral experiments/surgeries are stopped by good guys who stumble upon the plot and eventually thwart it.In this case, our hero (Dr. Toby Harber) stumbles upon two elderly men from the same gated retirement community who are exhibiting sudden onset dementia and who have similar twitching in the exremeties. Is there a connection? Will she solve the mystery?This abridged book on tape was ocassionally a little too abridged, but it was not too hard to follow. The reader was Megan Gallagher (the wife on the dark thriller TV show \\"Millenium\\"). Gallagher's voice is excellent for exuding (practically oozing) sympathy. This is wonderfully appropriate for some of the scenes, especially when there are deaths in the hospital. At other times, she turns on this \\"sympathy voice\\" on odd ocassions. At one point, she sounded like she was going to cry as the character baked a casserole!So, in short - not an original over-arching plot, but there were several good thriller scenes and the sub-plot concerning Dr. Harper's mom was a nice touch to the story. Gallagher's excessive sentimentalizing as she read was both a plus and a minus so we'll call that a draw."},{"Title":"LifeSupport","review":"Just not one of her best books.

When Gerritsen is at the top of her game, as she is in this novel, I think nobody can beat her. Not Robin Cook, not anybody.It's hard to describe the plot without giving away vital information, and I don't intend to be a spoiler. But I can tell you that the action starts hard and fast on the very first page, when a world-renowned surgeon, elderly but revered in his field, attempts a simple appendectomy and winds up killing his young, healthy patient in the most gruesome of ways. Our glimpse into his mind while this is going on is almost scarier than the act itself...and that is the first chapter of the book! It doesn't get calmer from there.It seems that a number of very fit elderly men, in full control of their faculties and all living in a very upscale retirement home, are showing strange mental symptoms, one after the other, and eventually dying horrible deaths. Dr. Toby Harper,who heads the ER rotation at a local hospital, encounters two of these patients, and is at a complete loss to diagnose the problem, let alone solve it. Her dogged determination to get to the bottom of the illness(es) lands her in a conspiracy so sinister that she can't even guess at the true nature of it, except to know that it is putting herself, her dear elderly mother who suffers from Alzheimers, and seemingly her entire medical reputation at stake.A subplot, wherein innocent young runaway girls are captured on the streets and impregnanted with god knows what, forms a counterpoint to the main tale.All I can tell you is that Toby, probably the one innocent in the drama, ends up wanted by the police for murder--and the bad guys, who are diabolical, seem to be getting away scott-free with their intensely fiendish plot.Sound good? Try it. You may not sleep well at night, but it's worth it. Tess Gerritsen is without peer when she truly believes in what she is writing about, and this book proves it. All I can say is, WOW!"},{"Title":"LifeSupport","review":"Wouldn't it be wonderful if the heroine from Harvest could meet the star of Life Support for a cup of coffee. Picture them together, the amazed looks on their faces as they realize how much they have in common! Both are talented female hospital based physicians who find out that an evil cabal of doctors is wreaking havoc on the health of patients. And, in both cases our protagonists digging into their affairs do not amuse the dastardly doctors.Toby and her new found friend discover that a few missteps in their work coupled by efforts of the vile physicians have placed their jobs and personal safety in great jeopardy. And, gasp, both of them had to face real or potential malpractice lawsuits.Tess Gerritsen can write attention-grabbing thrillers. No question of that, but is she going to use the same plot format for all of her stories? I realize that her latest novel, Bloodstream, which I have not read, takes place outside of a hospital, but a read through of the cover summary makes me awfully suspicious that the same plot is going to descend on us once again.Please, TG, you seem to be a good thriller writer, but would you please, please, change some of the basic elements in your next story? If you have not read either of these novels, please do read one of them, and you will be well rewarded. If you read both I'm sure you will be drenched in d&eacute;j&agrave; vu."},{"Title":"LifeSupport","review":"Life Support is the first book I have read by this author, but it definitely won't be the last! The story is well paced and gripping with good characterization. The plot revolves around an upscale retirement community whose doctors have discovered a way to prolong an individual's natural lifespan; unfortunately, the procedure can also create horrific consequences. Dr. Toby Harper, a doctor working in a local ER, admits two of these retirees and is baffled by their symptoms. Her determination to get to the bottom of the case ultimately threatens her very life. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys medical thrillers."},{"Title":"LifeSupport","review":"I believe I'm actually going backwards as far as the chronology of her titles are concerned. The first book of hers that I read was &quot;GRAVITY&quot;, which I thought was perfect. &quot;LIFE SUPPORT&quot; didn't disappoint either. What makes Gerritsen's medical thrillers work is her utter believability. Although a lot of the medical jargon went right over my head (I'm sure I'm not the only one) it certainly comes across that she knows what she's talking about. So far, both books that I've read have centered around an intelligent heroine, who beat the odds of having their reputations tarnished, and yet end up victorious. I would, however, have preferred to know a little bit more about the fate of the heroine's love interest in the book, maybe by Gerritsen explaining a bit more in detail as to the curability of the illness and so on.Overall, I preferred GRAVITY to LIFE SUPPORT because the heroine in the former was not only a doctor, but a flight surgeon on a NASA shuttle. Makes for a great plot! If you haven't tried that one yet, you certainly should. I'm looking forward to checking out her latest novel THE SURGEON... just waiting to find a copy at a nice price. :)"},{"Title":"LifeSupport","review":"This was the first book that I read by Tess Gerritsen. From the very first few pages, I was automatically taken into the fast-paced content. I literally had a hard time putting the book down! The characters were like pieces of a puzzle that Gerritsen created, but didn't put together until the end of the book. I have read quite a few medical thrillers in the past, but none have kept my curiosity going like this book. Gerritsen is a wonderful writer. I feel as though anyone can enjoy this book--although I loved it even more since I am a health care professional. This is truly an enjoyable read. I only hope that Gerritsen will continue to write novels that are as great as this one!!"},{"Title":"LifeSupport","review":"Toby Harper, night shift supervisor of Springer Hospital's emergency room, comes under administration's intense scrutiny and is called onto the carpet in front of a hospital board inquiry after a patient suffering from tremors and confusion walks out of the hospital and disappears. When the home health care aide who is taking care of her ailing elderly mother resigns and a colleague seeks to use the missing patient incident as a reason to dismiss Harper, stress turns Harper's job in a big city hospital into a daily battle for survival. As a second patient presents with the same symptoms and dies in the frantic chaos of a crash \\"Code Blue\\", Harper's investigation turns stress into full-blown crisis as she uncovers a conspiracy related to an illicit hormone therapy program at an upscale home for the aged.As she did in Harvest, Gerritsen uses her experience in the medical field to flesh out a superb plot with chilling realism - the ever present fear of litigation as the smallest error can be considered in the light of hindsight outside the chaos of the emergency room; the heart breaking experience of watching Alzheimer's deprive a loved one of their memories and their faculty for independent living; the frightening symptoms of the rare and fatal neurodegenerative diseases carried by the newly discovered not quite alive prions, BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) and CJD (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease); the extraordinary pressure exerted by pro-life groups on abortion clinics and those mothers wishing to terminate pregnancies; the lightning pace of unfolding events in a \\"Code Blue\\" emergency; the messy, harsh reality of an autopsy; and much more.At the same time as the plot unfolds with such incredible speed, we witness a heart-warming set of extremely well-constructed characters come to grips with the dynamics of their relationships - Harper struggles with her homemaker sister, Vickie, over the time and difficulties involved with the care of their confused mother; a black Dr Robbie Brace and his white red-haired wife struggle with the cruel ostracism they receive as a result of their mixed race marriage; Daniel Dvorak, the medical examiner, faces inner turmoil as the legal requirements of his position conflict with his growing fondness for Toby Harper; Carl Wallenburg seeks professional revenge for the slight he perceives on his competence as Harper questions his judgment over the handling of a case.A fact-paced, compelling page turner that proves Harvest was not a fluke and Gerritsen is here to stay! Great stuff!"},{"Title":"LifeSupport","review":"If you reach for a Tess Gerritsen novel, you know what you're going to get -- a psychological thriller cloaked in enough medical terminology to have you sounding like an ER doc, with some graphic blood-and-guts scenes thrown in for good measure. While Gerritsen's books are not for the faint of heart, they are well-plotted and well-written, with strong characters and plenty of action. Because they're all written from that recipe, they do tend to run together, and \\"Life Support\\" is another one that fits that bill. The storyline involves tracing a killer virus whose roots lie in \\"fountain of youth\\" hormone transplants. With all the recent talk about biochemical warfare and killer viruses, this book is sure to strike a chord with the public.One question -- what's with the naked babe on the cover of the book? I guess Gerritsen's having a hard time letting go of her romance roots."},{"Title":"LifeSupport","review":"A doctor's sense of responsibility to follow up on a missing patient turns into a dread-filled horror that leads her to the worst nightmare of her life. Dr. Toby Harper is a tough, intelligent woman with too much to do and too little time. An ER doctor working the night shift at Springer Hospital in the Boston suburbs, Toby must also act as caretaker for her Alzheimer's-stricken mother during the day while trying to catch some sleep. As difficult as her routine is, things take a turn for the worse when Dr. Harper finds her life completely unraveling in a matter of only weeks. Dr. Wallenberg, a geriatrics specialist, has devoted his career to researching a way to extend life beyond its normal span. His blind passion leads to the deaths of many, but in the name of progress he continues his experiments. He finds his subjects among the elderly who are wealthy enough and desperate enough to risk anything for a chance at longevity. Aside from the nuisance of dying patients, Dr. Wallenberg is well on his way to success until Toby Harper enters the scene.This is yet another triumph for Gerritsen. I have also read Gerritsen's first thriller, &quot;Harvest&quot; (1996), and I thoroughly enjoyed both. &quot;Life Support&quot; has interesting medical aspects without getting too dry or detailed. It also benefits from realistic characters and dialogue, and a good dose of creepiness that heightens the suspense. The story's end is a bit disappointing as it dips into the improbable, but the book is nonetheless a definite must-read."},{"Title":"LifeSupport","review":"I didn't read Tess Gerritsen's books in the order they were published, so I've backtracked a bit. My first introduction to Tess Gerritsen was reading Bloodstream and I thoroughly enjoyed that story. My friend, the one responsible for getting me hooked on Gerritsen told me that Harvest and Life Support were even better than Bloodstream. I wondered if it could be possible and decided to see. The result: I only thought I was hooked on this author before, but after reading both of these other books, I'm definitely an avid fan!Life Support focuses on Dr. Toby Harper, an emergency room doctor who works the night shift at Springer Hospital so she can take care of her elderly mother who suffers from Alzheimer's. Toby's normal, structured life is turned upside down when an elderly patient suffering from confusion is brought into her ER and then he suddenly disappears. Of course a surgeon bent on revenge against Toby uses this as a catalyst in an attempt for her dismissal. Her once boring life has suddenly turned into a battle - a fight to keep her job, a fight to continue taking care of her mother after her longtime home healthcare aide resigns, and a fight to figure out what happened to the disappearing patient.Enter Dr. Carl Wallenburg, doctor from Brant Hill, an upscale retirement housing area. The missing patient just happened to live at Brant Hill and this is more than the coincidence Wallenberg wants everyone to believe when a second patient turns up disoriented and showing signs of seizures. When Toby tries to find a connection between Brant Hill and the patients, she begins to uncover a research program using an experimental hormone protocol that is touted as the Fountain of Youth. The only problem is that this procedure has a big drawback - a few of the patients are dying from it.The plot is wonderfully laid out so that it keeps the reader on the edge of the seat throughout most of the book. Just when you relax another twist takes place and you're back on the edge once again. A few of the subplots are predictable, but that seems to be part of the overall design in drawing in the reader to the point where you don't know which subplot will be predictable and which will be a roller coaster ride. It will have you second-guessing yourself from the beginning to the end.Character development is excellent. The physical descriptions are such that you can close your eyes and actually see the character vividly. The interactions bring emotions to the reader - you can feel the friendship between Dr. Toby Harper and Dr. Robbie Brace; you can feel the attraction between Dr. Toby Harper and Dr. Daniel Dvorak; you can feel the animosity between Dr. Carl Wallenburg and Dr. Toby Harper. The imagery used with these characters and scenes are so enticing, I actually felt as if I was Toby Harper.Are there any negatives to the book? Yes, but you have to look very hard and be very picky about it. So in order to appear unbiased towards this author, I'll list a couple of negatives.The sub-story of Molly Pickard is weak. Molly is a sixteen-year-old prostitute who is impregnated with cells that grow into pituitary glands that form a cross between a tumor and a deformed fetus (the formula for the Fountain of Youth). The idea that these scientists would use a prostitute to \\"host\\" their experiment seems far-fetched. Drugs, sexually transmitted diseases, etc., would ruin the \\"gland\\" they are trying to generate. It would seem that tricking a prostitute into being a \\"host\\" and believing that she's pregnant with a baby wouldn't be the best option for their project. (OK, so I told you it was a picky negative).Then the romantic sub-plot of Dr. Dvorak's assistant and the cop seems unnecessary. It's alluded to and then nothing ever happens and it's not relevant to the main story, so why is it in there in the first place? Could it be a page filler? Possibly, but I'm not sure.If you enjoy medical thrillers and take pleasure in a story that is both spine tingling and horrifying, then this is the next book you should read. You won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"LifeSupport","review":"Tess Gerritsen has done it again...she has managed to make me lose track of an entire day...and not reget it for a moment.I have read some of her other books, and since I am a student in the medical profession, I like reading them based on her medical background. But thats not the only reason...the woman can plot a book with the best of them and ratchet up the tesnion level like no other.Toby, an ER doctor sees something strange come into the emergency room while on shift, but the patient leaves the hospital, and Toby is blackballed at every turn by those who hold higher positions than she does.The story of this mysterious disease in one steeped in money, wicked doctors, stolen babies and hidden truths. As each layer of the mystery is peeled back further and further, Toby loses those that are most dear to her. Will her fears win the day, or will the quest for truth and accountability be the ultimate victor?When this book reaches its conclusion, you will be left with a breathless feeling of relief, but hungering for more of Ms. Gerritsen's novels.

When I finished the half-way point, I thought to myself, this is a really good, well-written book. Then toward the end it seemed to get more contrived and disappointing. Since it was mostly a very good read, I'll give it four stars. Yes, I have read several of Tess Gerritsen's books."},{"Title":"LifeSupport","review":"The topic research Gerritsen does shines through in the way she is able to create a character as a specialist within a field. Life Support is no different in this way. It presents a plausible idea (at least plausible to anyone who isn't rich.. lol), with a couple of current issues many of us face in our aging families. Add another smart woman running around trying to save everyone while tentatively falling in love and you've got a story that keeps the pages turning well into the night :)I also must add that what I enjoy most about every Gerritsen book I read is the story within the story. A young woman-child makes some bad decisions early in life and finds herself in a nightmare. You can't help but hold your breath for her as well."},{"Title":"LifeSupport","review":"Great read!

When Toby is finally able to get back to Harry, he is missing and can't be found. The fallout from losing a patient leaves few people on her side and causes Toby to investigate on her own. What she finds is shocking and puts her life in danger.Life Support is a fast paced medical thriller. If you have not read Tess Gerritsen before, Life Support is a good book to start with. It gives you a fair representation of her writing style and is a standalone book so you won't be jumping into the middle of her Rizzoli and Isles series which is better if you start at the beginning. Gerritsen does a great job in Life Support of pulling a fairly complicated plot together without leaving any loose ends. I felt invested and completely engaged in Toby's life making it hard to put this book down."},{"Title":"LifeSupport","review":"Life Support is the 10th stand-alone novel by Tess Gerritsen. Springer Hospital's night-shift ER doctor, Toby Harper, finds her job is on the line when she literally loses a patient. The elderly man presents with confusion and apparent seizures, but while the ER staff are dealing with another emergency, the patient disappears. When another patient with identical symptoms, from the same exclusive residential community, with the same doctor, dies in the hospital, Toby wants to investigate further, fearing an infectious cause. As Toby tries to find out more, she hits a brick wall with the admitting doctor and the residential community, which arouses her suspicions. But problems in her personal life complicate matters even further. Medical murder mystery is Tess Gerristen's forte and she, once again, gives us a great plot and credible characters and dialogue. The ME in this novel can, in some ways, be seen as the blueprint for Maura Isles role in the Rizzoli and Isles series. Another great Gerritsen read."},{"Title":"LifeSupport","review":"Dr. Toby Harper is a woman who has seen a lot of cases working at Springer Hospital, yet nothing has even come close to what happens with a certain man she admits one night. Two men on different days show the same symptoms of a disease that they can't identify. Toby Harper is determined to find the cause of these symptoms, yet men like Dr. Wallenburg have a suspicious strong urge to keep her from finding the truth. I recommend this book if you like mystery. The case winds in to a long, twisted, and complicated mystery starting with the observation that both men are from Brant Hill Facility and both have undergone top-secret surgeries that may be the cause of their diseases. Dr. Harper struggles to hold her job while continuing in her search to prevent anymore deaths from occurring. I loved this book because it was a thrilling mystery that was full of suspense and cliffhangers."},{"Title":"LifeSupport","review":"As a nurse, I can tell you that modern day medicine is not too far behind this.

She works the twelve-hour overnight shift in the Emergency Room, and at home, she takes care of her elderly mother who has Alzheimer's. When a patient is brought into Toby's hospital in the middle of the night, delirious and confused, she's stumped as to what he may be suffering from. His immediate medical tests are clear, and his family knows nothing of any former medical history that may have led up to this. Then things get even more complicated. The patient disappears right off the table, even though he's been strapped down.In an effort to get to the bottom of things, Toby starts investigating a nearby retirement home for the wealthy. With the help of Dr. Robbie Brace who works at the Brant Hill retirement center, Toby slowly starts uncovering clues that finally begin to point her in the right direction. At the same time, Toby's career is in danger as she's being blamed for letting the patient disappear, and her home life is quickly collapsing around her as her mother's nurse quits and she's forced to hire someone else on short notice.Toby Harper makes a wonderful heroine in LIFE SUPPORT. She's strong and intelligent, and yet she's also very vulnerable and incredibly loyal to her mother. Though it means basically giving up her privacy and her social life, Toby would rather have her mother continue living with her than consider putting her in a nursing home. The secondary characters are also wonderfully three dimensional and interesting, from Robbie Brace, the black doctor among the elitist white staff at Brant Hill, to Molly Picker, the sixteen year old prostitute who wants nothing more than to get off the streets and go home, even though her parents want nothing to do with her.A fully believable, beautifully crafted novel, LIFE SUPPORT is a must-read for fans of medical thrillers."},{"Title":"LifeSupport","review":"I didn't enjoy this one quite as much as Harvest, but I did like the book and found it suspenseful.

The Medical Examiner finds that the patients had Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a rare malady caused by a prion, an agent simpler than a virus, that usually infects only by ingestion of prion-containing brain tissue. With the help of Dr. Robbie Brace, a physician at a retirement home where Dr. Wallenberg is in charge, she tracks the disease to the retirement home.

She's immediately put off by the sleazy location but plays along entering a white walled room filled only with a bright light and what appears to be a doctor's examination table. She hops up on the table as instructed but is soon sucking in noxious fumes and knocked unconscious . . .Next we meet Dr. Toby Harper who works the graveyard shift in the emergency room. One night an old man appears in the ER with no apparent illness besides a penchant for stripping off his clothes in public and a bit of disorientation. As Toby goes about examining him his leg starts to twitch. She's called out on another call and when she returns he has disappeared and Toby is held responsible. Soon another old man arrives (who was, coincidentally, living in the same fancy retirement community as the first mystery man) with similar symptoms but this man dies. Toby is suspicious, orders an autopsy and does some snooping around on her own when she is met with unreasonable resistance to her questions. It seems that some experimentation with prolonging life has been going on at the retirement home with frightening side effects. When Toby eventually discovers a bit of what has been going on her own life becomes endangered.This was an interesting medical thriller with an engaging protagonist but once Tape 2 begins the abridgement becomes very apparent. Events begin to happen fast and furiously and characterization is minimal. For the most part, the cuts necessary for this abridgement are smooth but I did find myself left a bit confused on more than one occasion and would've loved to have gotten to know all of the players a bit better.

One of the things we liked about the book was anyone having experiences with an elderly person requiring around the clock care could really understand and relate to and feel sorry for Dr. Harper and her emotions about her mother. I recommend this book for others to listen to, but go with the abridged version as the unabridged version drags along and is juste interesting enough to keep you listening. It dosn't get exciting until about the 5th or 6th tape in the 8 tape series. One of the things we didn't like about this book was the length of time it took Ms. Gerritsen to bring the plot to fruition. Again, we did like the plot. Mr. George Guidall whod did a good job, read the unabridged version we listened to; however, we didn't really care for his style. This is the first book by Ms. Gerritsen we have had the pleasure of listening to or reading. It is a good book; however, after listening to it, we are not ready to place it on the same shelf beside authors such as Robin Cook. It was decided that we would listen to other books by Tess Gerritsen."},{"Title":"LifeSupport","review":"I enjoyed Harvest but I thought Life Support was a bore. It never caught my interest and never even intrigued me. Don't bother with it."},{"Title":"LifeSupport","review":"Alright where to start where to start! I first heard of her when i picked up the book \\"the vanished\\" her most recent one, which i alreayd reviewed, im guilty of reading her new book before loving her and going back to her older books. Glad to say im not too dissappointed.once you open this book will would basically get sucked into the first few paragraphs. she doesn't hide the juciey stuff for later! she just gives it to you, grabbing your attention. which is really rare for some authors to do. She is fastly growing to bbecome my favorite.getting along, the story revolves around Dr. Toby a seurgeon who works hard night shifts while a sitter stays at home taking care of her mom who is suffering from memory loss. all the weight is on her, all the stress of work, slams Dr. Toby pretty hard. but she is a very strong headed woman and refuses to admit defeat! all while her sister vicky, who i think is really selfish and a big pain in the behind, complains complains on how Toby doesn't take care of the mom.well to start off the good parts. it all began when a man was imited into the hospital on one of Toby's night shifts not knowing who he is and not knowing where his home is, a sign of alzimers from first glance, but the strange part of this man was that he wasn't wearing any clothes! either way since it is in the hospital, so many things are going on at once when suddenly a patient who was in a horrible accidnet rushes in, Toby leaves the man in the \\"supposed\\" care of another nusrse who had alreayd informed the son that his father was in the hospital. when all the drama was over, and the son comes in to see his father. THAT was when Dr. Toby realized that the old man has gone missing... the plot unravels from there, where the private home where the man lives in his gated private \\"stepfords wives\\" sort of neighborhood wanted to have dr. Toby dismissed for her incompetance in handleing THERE patient and losing him.all while not too far away a teenage girl was getting pimped out to a man who she though has a fetish with playing \\"doctor\\" when in actuality, these were doctors preforming an extreme and must be monitored procedure/experiament. what does this all have to do with the private gated community in which the old goes to be young again? well you just have to read the book.the book only lost one star from me because at the end, i was not too happy with how it all got thrown togehter. i can't tell you the ending though but it left A LOT of questions unanswered for me in how the heck did so and so know this?....this didn't discourage me from picking up another one of her books though!"},{"Title":"LifeSupport","review":"This was not my favorite of all Tess Garritsen's books (I liked Gravity and Bloodstream a little more), but it was still a very good, fast read and quite entertaining. I'd recommend it."},{"Title":"LifeSupport","review":"I really thoroughly enjoyed this book. Toby was a good main character to the problems that were faced in the ER. It was interesting how dr. carl wallenberg was opposing her so much of the time! To find out more, read the book!"},{"Title":"LifeSupport","review":"I swear, if something ELSE wrong happened to this woman I was going to throw the book against the wall! For heaven's sake! I can't stand reading repeated angst and this book is chock full of it. Mom has Alzheimers, sisters don't get along, then everything bad happens. It was almost too much. The medical information was almost completely spot on (I caught one goof where she mistook an H&amp;E stain for a PAS stain) and lots of fun to read, though. So, if you can stand a whole lot of angst in your medical thriller, go for it, she's still a lot of fun."},{"Title":"LifeSupport","review":"it is really an useful book because iam a medical student, i get a lot of medical information from it."},{"Title":"LifeSupport","review":"While better than the thoroughly predictable &quot;Harvest,&quot; Ms. Gerritsen's second medical thriller still isn't that great. She sets off with a great creepy prologue and builds continual suspense throughout, yet the book is so relentlessly downbeat it's a little hard to take. Basically, everything that could go wrong for our heroine does: she's accused of abusing her mother, all of her allies end up dead, and the whole world basically turns against her. I personally read for enjoyment, and I found it hard to enjoy one horrible thing happening to this woman after another. Maybe people who get off on the endless suffering on &quot;Party of Five&quot; will enjoy it. I don't know. The medical detail is superb and Gerritsen keeps you on your toes, but the book's so painful (even the ending) that I left it more depressed than satisfied. Proceed at your own risk."},{"Title":"LifeSupport","review":"I first read Tess Gerritsen's book 'The Surgeon' and loved it, in fact I read it 3 times. But when I decided to check out some of her earlier work I was dissapointed. 'Life Support' is a pretty good story but who hasn't done the evil nursing bit? I think just about everyone has. Toby (the main character) was pretty cardboard. She was an ER doctor yet when it came to danger she was a wuss. What the? She ended the story very abruptly. I want to know what happened with Dr. Dvorak and I want to know what happened to Wallenberg and everyone.I do not recommend this book at all. I'll admit it's okay but come on! Why did certain people have to die? I just did not like what she did to some of the characters."},{"Title":"LifeSupport","review":"To keep this short, Life Support is a very good book but parts of it are not for the squeamish. This might make a great movie. Anyway, Life Support is definately worth the read."},{"Title":"LifeSupport","review":"Excellent medical suspense story. Have not read one bad book by this author!"},{"Title":"LifeSupport","review":"I absolutely love Tess Gerritsen's novels!!! This is the fifth one I've read, and I have to say, it was good, but not as thrilling or suspenseful as her other novels.Life Support depicted Dr. Toby Harper as the beleaguered main character - an overworked, socially deprived ER doctor trying to sort out mysterious patient deaths while dealing with her ailing older mother. I was not as impressed with Dr. Harper as I was with Dr. Gerritsen's other protagonists (think Dr. Maura Isles and Det. Jane Rizzoli - these ladies were hard-as-nails but also feminine) because Dr. Harper's character just seemed too plain tired and drained to be strong! Also, I thought the other characters in this book were a bit one-dimensional...The story was somewhat formulaic and stretched....the threads of the plot didn't come together as smoothly as I had hoped, though the story overall kept me entertained enough during a three hour plane flight. The action moves quickly and you are in for a few surprises that will keep you guessing.However, if you are new to discover Dr. Gerritsen's works, I recommend not starting with Life Support....try Body Double, The Apprentice or The Sinner (these are five star books, in my opinion!). These truly showcase the author proficiency for weaving a scary, suspenseful medical thriller with \\"you won't see it coming\\" twists that will make it hard for you to NOT finish the book in one sitting!"},{"Title":"LifeSupport","review":"Gerritsen's books are pretty good and creative the first time, and possibly the second, but after the third book they become very formulaic. Intellegent damsel, overworked, over tired, put upon by evil doers, and oh by the way, there is a handsome rescuer in there somewhere. Yuck!!"},{"Title":"LifeSupport","review":"When I began reading this novel, I thought to myself, &quot;Oh yay, another sophisticated big-worded medical story,&quot; but after about ten pages I could not put it down! The novel keeps you on the edge of your seat, wanting to know what comes next. I really liked how Tess Gerritsen made seperate stories through-out the whole novel, then combined them in the end. It added on to the wonderment of the novel, mostly because you wondered what was going on with other characters while reading about another. I havn't read any of Gerritsen's other books, but now after reading &quot;Life Support&quot; I am going to read them."},{"Title":"LifeSupport","review":"Gerritsen explores the area of longevity and how desperate some people are to prolong their lives; the risks they will take, and the horrifying consequences when that desire exceeds safety and caution. What make this book work so well is Gerritsen's ability to create individual scenes that ring of truth, particuarly in the relationship between Toby, her sister, and her mother. Some of the dialogue is biting, harsh, yet with an underlying compassion and confusion that accompanies the anguish of Alzheimer's. Tess also establishes a great deal of sympathy for a supporting character, Molly Picker, whose life as a prostitute leads her into an unbelievably cruel outcome. Her phone call home to her mother, begging her to let her come home, is gut-wrenching in its realism and her mother's cruelty. The story builds well, and Toby's romance with Dan Dvorak is well-done, although the curtain of doom that hangs over Dan at the end does leave a little bitter taste.All in all, Tess continues to be a master of the medical thriller; check out her excellent &quot;The Surgeon,&quot; &quot;Harvest,&quot; and &quot;Bloodstream.&quot; She makes you wonder just how safe we are in a hospital!"},{"Title":"LifeSupport","review":"Tess Gerritsen doesn't fall victim to the sophomore slump with her second medical thriller, Life Support. A peaceful evening in the ER is broken by the arrival of a delirious elderly man. Dr. Toby Harper does her best to treat the patient, but he mysteriously disappears from the hospital when left unattended. Toby searches for her lost patient and tries to determine the cause of his behavior when another patient with similar symptoms dies under her care. Her concern is deepened when the cause of the patient's death is determined to be Creutzfeldt- Jakob, or mad cow disease. Following this disclosure, Toby is beset by personal tragedies as someone is trying to prevent her from discovering the evil truth and unthinkable research responsible for this outbreak.Life Support is a fast-paced medical mystery full of intrigue and suspense. The plot-driven story grabs the reader and never lets go. I couldn't put this book down. Gerritsen effectively uses medical terminology that's not over the average reader's"},{"Title":"LifeSupport","review":"Tess Gerritsen's LIFE SUPPORT is a disappointing medical thriller. While the medical jargon lends authenticity to the read, it quickly overwhelms the very thin story. It's easy to guess who done it and why and since the lead doesn't get into any real jeopardy along the way, the ride isn't even particularly interesting. If you're looking for a good mystery writer, try Lisa Gardner instead. She understands pacing, character development, and her stories will get your heart pumping."},{"Title":"LifeSupport","review":"There are many reviews ofLife Support, so I'll be brief. This is a gripping medical thriller with a clever thesis. I recommend it to readers who like the genre. However, there are a couple of plot glitches worth noting.The author's \\"spoiler\\" introduction mentioned in other reviews was not included at the beginning of the Kindle edition (good decision). However, without some preparation, the initial events seem to be preposterous. This almost caused me to stop reading. My advice: have faith. The bizarre beginning will become somewhat more believable as you read on, although it remains a credibility weakness.The heroine, Toby, makes an absolutely stupid decision near the end. She fails to consider her own safety in a situation that obviously poses a mortal threat. This all-too-common glitch detracts from a book that is otherwise superbly written and plotted."},{"Title":"LifeSupport","review":"Just finished Life Support by Tess Gerritsen this evening. I read my first Tess Gerritsen 4 years back and reviewed it here. It was book # 2 in her Jane Rizzoli-series and it was called The Apprentice. I wasn't impressed. Later on I picked up a couple of other Gerritsen-books and found that I enjoyed them. So it didn't take long to pick up Life Support and get reading. The story is about ER doc Toby Harper and about how a normal and perhaps a little boring life can deteriorate in a matter of weeks, which is was happens to Toby when she stumbles across a conspiracy involving a luxurious retirement home, young prostitutes and her own mother, suffering from Alzherimer's. One slow night in the ER, Toby receives an elderly man who is naked and confused and found wandering the streets of Boston. Before Toby can diagnose him, he has disappeared into thin air and no matter what Toby and her staff do, he remains missing. Toby cannot get him out of her head and finds out that he was a resident in the luxurious retirement home Brant Hill. Soon she smells something fishy going on in the Brant Hill retirement home and she begins her own investigations, going against the wish of several colleagues and doctors from Brant Hill. Then unpleasant things begin to happen to Toby herself, and in a matter of a few weeks, she doesn't know whom to trust and whom not to trust. All in all this is a pretty good plot and the book is also relatively well written. BUT! I like a medical thriller as much as the next girl, but this one wasn't fast paced at all. It was also too easy to guess the plot and the character development was lacking. It was hard to find any sympathy with the main characters who just felt one-dimensional and slightly annoying. Still, Life Support is an easily read and entertaining little medical thriller, but I am sure Tess Gerritsen can do much better than this."},{"Title":"LifeSupport","review":"First, a warning. My copy of this book originally published in 1997 includes an \`introduction' by the author written in 2006. If yours does too, do not read it until after you have finished the story! In my case I was unaware how much it could spoil my enjoyment, which it did for hundreds of pages because before the tale begins Tess has kind of told you what it's about. Maybe it wasn't her idea to add this piece of information but to be blunt it's a pretty dumb idea to put it at the beginning when it would have done no harm at all at the end.You see, this story starts off in fascinating fashion in the form of a prologue involving a surgeon about to perform a major operation on an anaesthetised female patient. What happens as he opens up her body is a mixture of horror and hilarity in equal measure, but the reasons for his bizarre actions are almost completely neutralised because thanks to the unwanted introduction, we now know exactly why he did it. What a shame, because this could have been a first-rate thriller if not for that. It's like reading the last chapter of a whodunit mystery FIRST. Where are the thrills once you know what's going on?Otherwise this story reminded me of the superior HARVEST by the same author. Attractive female thirty-something doctor in a Boston hospital unearths ghoulish medical conspiracy and fights to deliver justice against all the odds. It's pretty good, to be fair, well worth reading before or after any of the Rizzoli/Isles episodes for which Tess Gerritsen has found fame and fortune. Quite a few names in that series, however, appear in this novel - for example there's a Jane, a cop called Moore, a love-interest called Daniel.....any of these sound familiar to you Rizzoli/Isles fans? They're totally different people but it made me wonder why the writer chose to, in effect, resurrect these names in her crime thriller series of more recent years.Definitely worth buying whether you're a fan or not. Just make sure you give that intro a miss!"},{"Title":"LifeSupport","review":"Can't beat this author for putting out a great medical thriller/suspense story. ALL of her books are very good. I really love the way that she can take a fictional story and make it seem so real. It is a definite page turner.

Since then, I have read ALL of Gerritsen's novels. Each and every one is fantastic---lots of suspense, real page turners!!! I am now waiting for Gerritsen's current novel to become available in paperback. I suggest you read the books she's written in order---especiall the Risolli series."},{"Title":"LifeSupport","review":"Most books of this type are flat out silly. This had all the hallmarks of something that could happen in real life. The characters and the science were very convincing. The only part where it felt like the story advanced into the silly territory was right at the end. Some details were left out that would have made this a fabulous medical thriller."},{"Title":"LifeSupport","review":"Short but still a thriller, Life Support had my attention right away. Who was doing what to this teenaged prostitute? And why? What did it have to do with the sudden deaths of older people, including Dr. Harper's mother?Gerritsen's medical expertise is obvious in this chilling novel. What is killing these elderly but apparently healthy people? Is there more than one culprit involved in this coverup operation? Will Dr. Harper figure out who the bad guy is before it's too late? I missed Rizzoli and Isles in this book but knew there had to be a surprise ending in which things would work out for the good guy or gal with or without their assistance. I wasn't disappointed."},{"Title":"LifeSupport","review":"This is one of those books that I find hard to summarize without giving away spoilers or too much information, sometimes even the ending. So this time around, I will not try to write one.However, I can say that this is Tess Gerritsen's second medical thriller book. Tess Gerritsen is one of my favorite suspense/thriller authors, if not my ultimate favorite. This novel did not fail.If you have a faint-heart, can not stand even the slightest mention of blood, then this is probably not for you. Because just on the very first page, there is already a mention of these things; things that Gerritsen describes so well.I really love Gerritsen, as you, by now, can already see. She writes all the scary things that get to your head at night (not talking about ghosts though), and her books are fast-paced and has so much action that you can't dare miss.Life Support is not an exception. It was good. Read. it. =)"},{"Title":"LifeSupport","review":"Book arrived quickly, a real steal for the money! Great reading! I love Tess Gerritsen books! Thumbs up!"},{"Title":"LifeSupport","review":"I reallly love Tess Gerritsen's books. She writes wonderful stories that scare you to death and that are very fast paced. Aptly described as a page turner, they are very hard to put down.Where she shines in the genre is in character development. Somewhere on the roller-coster ride story, you come to know and care about her characters.This story is about a single, thirty-something ER doctor, who is also taking care of her vulnerable, alzeheimer's afflcited mom. The local ER is a small town type where there are ups and downs in activity, but usually on the low to mid area.Her life takes its first turn when in one night she loses a cardiac patient to death and loses a confused elderly patient to (well no one knows). He was in the ER strapped to a bed when the cardiac patient arrived, and then he was no where to be found.From there the pace revs up until Dr. Toby Harper is being attacked from all sides. She is being attacked at work for incompetence, and (well I won't give up the whole plot to you), leave it to say, she is even being accused of murder and the police have a warrent out for her arrest.I will tell you that Toby is a caring and tenacious lady. She is smart and not easily thwarted when she senses that something is very very wrong. This is why she is in trouble. The forces out to get her are real, rich, well respected in the community, and will do anything to shut her up. (Sort of reminds you of Coma).I would recommend this book for anyone intersted in a fast paced, well written medical thriller."},{"Title":"LifeSupport","review":"If you like her others, you will love this one, it reads fast, you wont be able to put it down"},{"Title":"LifeSupport","review":"Life Support see its author in medical thriller mode ,and regular readers will know what this portends -lots of surgical procedures complete with visceral detail ,heroines in peril ,and in this case ,a medical cover-up by powerful and over ambitious Doctors.The heroine is Boston ER doctor ,Toby Harper who is having personal and professional problems .She lives with her mom ,Ellen ,who is ravaged by Alzheimer's and is under pressure at work as the result of having clashed with an egotistical surgeon who wants her dismissed from her post as an act of petty revenge .So ,it is not good news when an elderly ,confused patient ,one Harry Slotkin simply disappears from the ER after being picked up by cops while wandering around Boston naked .He is one of several cases of elderly men ,all residents of an upscale treatment facility named Brant Clinic who have suddenly developed such symptoms -dementia and erratic ,even violent, behaviour.She supects Creutzfeld-Jakobs disease ,and that it is the result of treatments received at the facility under the auspices of the arrogant and financially ambitious Doctor Wallenburg.She joins forces with pathologist Doctor Dvorak and seeks to expose the malpractice .The clinic strikes back using her most vulnerable point -her ailing mother.The sub plot revolving around a teenage hooker,Molly ,aids pathos to the strongly driven and tightly plotted tale .The book is quite gory in parts ,especially the operating theatrs scenes and the tale build to an exciting ,sweaty palmed climax .It is slickly told and exciting ,with characters you can root for but beware-it is quiter bloody at times and should be avoided by those who dislike such things in a novel"},{"Title":"LifeSupport","review":"I really liked this book for a light read. It was exciting and the pace kept the reader's interest. I agree that the main character was a little shallow. She jumped to conclusions, was too hystrionic, and sometimes came across as a \\"blonde\\" (I wonder if she was) for me. I enjoy a story in which everyone spots the bad guy right from the first. That lets the reader in on the plot. There continued to be surprises, however, that enriched the experience through their unexpected appearances. The flavor of conspiracy kept everyone guessing. I agree with some critics that stated the ending was weak. It was fast and aburpt and did not tie up loose ends. When the reader knows the bad guy and waits for him to get his just desserts, there is some relish in prolonged revenge. It would also have been nice to know if the romance came to fruition and what happened to the corporate organization. Oh well, it's worth the reading."},{"Title":"LifeSupport","review":"This is more a science fiction mystery than a medical thriller. Good believable likable characters, interesting plot-twists, the bad guys a little too much but still, overall another book that satisties the reader, no loose ends or absurd explanations. I think Tess Gerritsen is at her best in these kind of novels rather than sociopolitical-themed thrillers like Vanish or Harvest (where honestly, the real news is often more chilling than any fictionalization)."},{"Title":"If You Believe","review":"The trouble with romance novels is that the women are all neurotic and weak willed and If You Believe's protagonist, Mariah, unfortunately, stands to form. She was hurt and betrayed by a drifter at age 15. When she's 35 another drifter enters her life. The thing is, if Maria was really serious about protecting herself and not allowing herself to ever get hurt again by a man, she could achieve this. It CAN be done. In real life and in fiction. Yet Mariah melts whenever she sees Mad Dog(the first man she has been subjected to in years) and obsesses over him like a mindless, giddy teenage girl. Really? Seriously? I can understand how crap romance novels offer bored, lonely women an escape from their painful reality but doesn't the fact that the main characters are so grossly fake ultimately disappoint? In If You Believe, Mad Dog is crude and vulgar with the protagonist. Maria struggles to maintain her prim and proper facade around him. I guess that's supposed to generate some type of sexual tension but it just comes off as forced and juvenile. It would be more sensual and effective if the 2 characters were intellectual equals instead of the woman always being some neurotic mess -- a woman who has spent her life waiting for some moron to show up and shake her life up a little. In these books why can't the female protagonist shake her own life up with the man being a surprise addition? Alas, with romance novels, the women are all ultimately victims in some form or fashion and the men are messiahs sent by God to save the women from a fate worse than death, which is loneliness. This lame novel is no different."},{"Title":"If You Believe","review":"This book was so different from what I have come to expect from Kristin Hannah.

Mariah on the other hand hasn't left the farm in many years, her heart being broken by another man who just up and left her.Mariah builds up a wall against Mad Dog but piece by piece it comes down. What I really loved in this story is the shadow following Mad Dog. I wasn't sure if it was a former fighter who was going to get revenge or what they could want.That part I really enjoyed, and the last 30 pages had me hook, line and sinker!

I believe that many books are given to authors as a means of healing or comfronting a situation that we are having a hard time making peace with and finding answers through the written word. Sometimes just writing out a problem and looking at it in a whole different way enables us to get a different perspective on things. The idea of the panic that Mariah has when she attemps to open the gate to the farm and leave it's safe confines is one that I have struggled with myself. Mariah is keeping a secret, one that has left her frozen in emotions and movement. A special man occupies her life (her father) and when another shows up she is very reluctant to let him in. Then a young man, Jake, joins them which brings out the mother in her for the child that she lost and is never spoken of.Her father's death and Jake removing the fence that keeps her issolated helps her to move forward.

Although very predictable, I enjoyed this book because of the issues Mariah and Mad Dog both had. Jake following his dad hoping for a happy reunion was heartwarming. Rass, Mariah's father, was my favorite character because of his concern for his daughter and his kindness toward Mad Dog and Jake. He kept seeking to improve his relationship with his daughter and help her let go of the past so she could enjoy the present and the future before he died. His love for his daughter was very sweet.

He had a devil-may-care, you haven't-hurt-me smile as he endured his lowlife of fights, the wrong kind of women, and hostile men scattered across the landscape. He loved them and left them, to see on his next time around. 'Miss Prim and Proper' whose father owned the farm felt free and, yet, she never left the farm. She felt that sometimes it hurt to be free, but she had nowhere else to go. Even through her eloquence, she didn't respond to him as a man, even after his appreciative whistle.The interior of her self-made prison was one of grandeur. The extravagant bathing room was Forest green and burgundy. Her late mother had enjoyed the elegance of beautiful things. Her father is a dreamer. Isolation meant safety to her, but this safety meant loneliness. That is, until Matt appeared on the scene with his arrogance and disdain for folks he did not know. As the weeks went by, he became intrigued about her past, that she has a secret which he was determined to discover before he moves on. He had red-hot floods of frustration, and she was full of frustration and anger. Stephen, her teen love, had left her deserted sixteen years earlier and she just could not face the world because of her shame.Relaxed, without that god-awful pinched expression on her face, she was almost beautiful with her shiny brown eyes. She was a woman as sensual and powerful as nature itself with a taste of innocence, freshness and surrender. She found Matt to be a good-looking man eventually and he made her feel alive again. She could even laugh, which delighted her old dad. But she was a woman with secrets. We all have our ill-begotten secrets and desires, whether real of imagined. She had lived in her own fantasy after Stephen left, but now she had grown up. With her strong will, strong mind, and a wagonload of grit and determination, all she wanted was to be left alone, for things to go back to the way they used to be, to feel safe in her own home again. He couldn't hurt her unless she gave her heart to him. But anything else would hurt too much.He had his own unhappy past full of mistakes, and one caught up with him, his most ardent admirer, Jacob William Vandersty, Loralee's son. Only the good die young. He was the wandering kind and so left to ride the rails again to venture to Albuquerque. He missed her more every day, and could think of nothing else. What is it when you missed someone so badly you ached. Wish I knew. He found his old, boozing life in saloons and in boxcars no good now. He'd had a taste of the good life. On Christmas, he realized that he had a place to go, a home in Lonesome Creek, and someone waiting there for him. Mariah had come to the conclusion that he would never return but now she could live with her past and go on. She was older, wiser, and strong enough to survive. She was just lonely again, she thought, and her feeling of loss was just 'a quiet sorrow at what might have been.' Jake was there to take his place, as he was Matt's son, but lo and behold! The man himself returned to them both, his own family to comfort and care for the 'drifter.'"},{"Title":"If You Believe","review":"I encountered Kristin Hannah a couple of months ago when I read the book, ANGEL FALLS: a nice book with a somewhat ... plot. I thought ANGLE FALLS was well-written with some beautiful prose, so I gave Kristin another shot with ON MYSTIC LAKE; it blew me away. ON MYSTIC LAKE is her best by far, but IF YOU BELIEVE comes mighty close. For those of you who are not familiar with Kristin Hannah, IF YOU BELIEVE is one of her earlier novels, and I can tell why she has been a productive writer and storyteller for the last ten years. IF YOU BELIEVE is a simple story about a woman, Mariah Throckmorton, who is hiding from a past that's filled with hurt, and her colorful, intelligent father. They live on a beautiful, secluded farm that happens to be graced with few visitors. Mad Dog Stone is a drifter who wanders by to find a meal and a place to sleep. Mad Dog becomes enthralled with Mariah, and wants to find out more about this simple, but beautiful woman. Lonely people are thrust together and the emotions fester until they become a full-blown hurricane. The plot works, the chemistry between the characters is wonderful, and couple that with the mystery of the landscape; you've got yourself an excellent book. Kristin Hannah will be a mainstay on my bookshelf for a long time. I only regret that I didn't discover this wonderful writer earlier. Blow the dust off your favorite book list, get your best pen out, and slowly write IF YOU BELIEVE at the top of the list; you won't be dissapointed."},{"Title":"If You Believe","review":"If you haven't read Kristen Hannah's IF YOU BELIEVE you are missing out on one of the best character driven, emotionally wrenching stories the genre has to offer. If the rest of her books are even half this good I'm rushing out to purchase them all!Mad Dog Stone is a fighter who works odd jobs in between bouts. He never stays in one place long enough to form any kind of emotional attachment and has broken many a heart along the way. His life is about to change when he answers an add for free room and board in exchange for a little work at the Throckmorton apple orchard. How hard can picking apples be after all?The last thing Mariah Throckmorton wants is change in her life, especially in the form of a big, shiftless male. She is living in a self imposed exile while hiding from a scandalous past and a tragedy she has never allowed herself to recover from. She does her darndest to get this lazy critter off of her farm, which tends to make him all the more determined to hang around and take whatever new torture disguised as work she dishes out. She intrigues him as no other woman has and her obliviousness to his charms makes her all the more alluring.The author writes with such emotional intensity I found myself either smiling or crying on nearly every page. She skillfully blends raucous wit with tender and heartbreakingly painful moments of emotion making IYB a powerful, not soon to be forgotten read. You won't find any fancy locales or wacky adventures in this book. What you will find is an honest down to earth book about two lonely people overcoming their fear of emotional intimacy and learning about the healing powers of love. What more could a reader ask for?A full box of Kleenex read and a definate keeper!"},{"Title":"If You Believe","review":"If You Believe is one great love story by Kristin Hannah. This is the fourth book of hers that I have read and I simply cannot read her books fast enough! This book is incredibly emotional and it pulls you right into the character's world with such intensity, that you will definitely need a box of Kleenex handy!Hannah has the talent of making her characters come alive with such depth and emotion. You feel their struggles, their losses and their loves. You feel their fear and you understand it all. Hannah writes with such emotion that you cannot but help becoming lost in the story line. She once again has you so connected to the characters, that you feel that you know them and this what endears readers to her. Hannah does not write your typical mush and gush romance novel - the love and romance is more real, down-earth and believable. Her heroines all seem to face reality-based challenges, which anyone can relate to, as well as to overcoming those challenges.Hannah's writing is laced not only with depth filled emotions, but also with a unique sensitivity that touches the reader at a level most other authors never come close to. She manages to weave her magic from the very beginning and the reader is gently released from that magic web at the very end, with a very deep sigh! But her story will linger with you for days. As with all of her books - you want a sequel!What more can I say? Kristin Hannah has fast become one of my favorite authors and her stories will leave you thinking, pondering and wondering as well as feeling good! This book is definitely a keeper and wish I could rate it with more than 5 stars! Angel Falls, On Mystic Lake and Home Again are others by Hannah, which I have read and fell in love with!This is a story of love and hope eternal which I could not put down until I finished it. On to the next Hannah book!"},{"Title":"If You Believe","review":"This was the first novel I had ever read by Kristin Hannah. I loved it from page one. Once I had finished this book, I ran to the book store and purchased everything she had published. This was 1993. Now it is 2001 and I look forward to each and every new book she puts forth."},{"Title":"If You Believe","review":"I believe Hannah is one of the best romance writers around today. &quot;If You Believe&quot; is the 3rd book by Kristin Hannah I've read in the past 2 weeks and she climbed to the top of my favorites list with the first one I read, &quot;Mystic Lake&quot;.Hannah wrings every emotion out of you by the time you've completed the last page. Her characters, Mad Dog, Mariah, Rass &amp; Jake spring to life and draw you right into the pages of the book to experience their happiness, pain, love and tears with them.So, go forth and read. If you aren't already grabbing up each Kristin Hannah book you can, you soon will be!"},{"Title":"If You Believe","review":"This is a book about finding, forgiving, loving and letting go. The characters aren't perfect, but all have good qualities. There isn't the usual falling into each others arms and living happily ever after. They work at theirs lives and fight for a chance to love. Ms.Hannah gives a good read."},{"Title":"If You Believe","review":"This story about Mad Dog (Matt) and Mariah is so touching and bittersweet. Although many tragic things occur throughout the book, Hannah expertly wove a story with humor, tragedy, and compassion. It is a love story between man and woman, father and daughter, and father and son. It is a story about family and fear. It made me laugh and cry and encourage all I know to read this book."},{"Title":"If You Believe","review":"I loved reading this book. I couldn't put it down. The relationships and feelings of the characters really makes you feel for them as you try to place yourself in their shoes. Mariah is such a loving, hurt person and all you want is to do is ug her and love her. I was really moved by this book. It made me think more about the impact of my life and love on others."},{"Title":"If You Believe","review":"&quot;If Your Believe&quot; is the first book that I have read by Kristin Hannah and I cannot wait to read another. This story was wonderful, filled with so much emotion, I laughed and I cryed and hated for it all to come to an end."},{"Title":"If You Believe","review":"This book is hard to read. Ever seen the movie 'The Blue Lagoon'? Especially late at night? It left me with a hollow feeling, a sadness that echoed into the depths of my very soul. This book is about 2 people in their mid-thirties who fall in love against their wills. Its painful to read because of the depth of emotion, the heroine's relationship with her father and Mad Dog, as well as his relationship with his son, whom he doesn't know is related. Make any sense? ...Anyway, if I could go back in time I wouldn't have read this book. It left me with a bittersweet taste in my mouth - a compelling tale, but I think I'll stick to lighter reads from now on."},{"Title":"The Case of the Ivory Arrow","review":"A very good Keeler novel from the early 1940s. Farmer Ezra Jenkins, in a typical Keeler situation, must quickly find his brother, whose legal name is X Y Z, who has gone missing in Wiscon City (suspiciously similar to Milwaukee), or go to jail for a mandatory 10 years on a false forgery charge. While hunting for his brother, Jenkins becomes involved with a beautiful blonde who falls in love with him at first sight precisely because he's dressed like a music hall hayseed; two hired killers named \\"The Farmer\\" and \\"Eggs\\" Wei; a black poetess and nurse; a female serial killer given to decapitating husbands with her axe; a good cop (MacGravrock) and a very bad cop (deSullivan); a cab driver with an evil past; a wronged husband wearing blue spectacles; a bogus \\"psychic\\" whose information is nonetheless uncannily accurate; a glass revolver full of candy; an arrow manufactured from priceless museum exhibits; and much, much more. As usual in such Keeler novels there's a murder to be solved--- who killed a man dressed in Jenkins' clothes, and did the killer intend to kill that man, or think he was killing Jenkins himself, and why? And as usual this crime is solved only in the last two pages. When Jenkins and his brother decide to write up their experiences as a novel, they hire Keeler himself, and there's a good deal of fun involving thumbnail descriptions of Keeler's American publisher, Phoenix Press, and individual members of its staff, as well as various reviewers of mystery novels.Whoever wrote the copy describing the novel that is found on the back cover of this trade paperback edition might not have ever read the book, since that blurb incorporates a vast number of errors in just three sentences."},{"Title":"Braude's Handbook of Stories for Toastmasters and Speakers","review":"I must admit, for the first time, I'm reviewing a book I have not actually read. I did, however, read Jacob M. Braude's \\"New Treasury of Stories for Every Speaking and Writing Occasion,\\" Prentice Hall, Inc., Englewood Cliffs, NJ, June 1961 obtainable used through Amazon but no longer published. So, I'm taking a leap of faith that this book is an update to the one I've read. I collect quotes as a hobby, and Braude provides the finest short, speaker's stories I've found in one place. Here are just a few examples:When Thomas Jefferson presented his credentials as U.S. minister to France, the French premier remarked, \\"I see that you have come to replace Benjamin Franklin.\\" \\"I have come to succeed him,\\" corrected Jefferson. \\"No one can replace him.\\" p. 336There is a monument in Gettysburg to honor the memory of a color-bearer who became isolated from his regiment after a charge. The regiment retired, but the color-bearer and several men held their ground. The Major sent a messenger through to the boy, \\"Bring the colors back to the regiment.\\" The boy replied, \\"Bring the regiment back to the colors.\\" George W. Olinger, p. 84After President Coolidge issued his famous \\"I do not choose to run\\" statement, he was besieged by reporters seeking a more detailed statement. One more persistent than his fellows followed Mr. Coolidge to the door of his library. \\"Exactly why don't you want to be President again, Mr. Coolidge?\\" he asked. Coolidge turned and looked him squarely in the eye, \\"Because,\\" he answered, \\"there's no chance for advancement,\\" p. 17Also, some humor mixed with wisdom:Once a week the road-sweeper came by with his brush. He was a friendly old fellow; and Miss Gidding at the Hollies, got into the habit all that summer of taking him a glass of lemonade and a slice of cake. He thanked her shyly, and that was all. But one evening there came a knock at the back door of the Hollies. The road-sweeper was there, a cauliflower in one hand and a bunch of sweet peas in the other. He seemed embarrassed as he said, \\"I've brought you these, ma'am, for your kindness.\\" \\"Oh, you shouldn't,\\" exclaimed Miss Gidding, \\"It was nothing.\\" And then, the road-sweeper said an odd thing. \\"Well, no,\\" he agreed, \\"maybe it wasn't much, really ma'am. But it was more than anybody else did.\\" (From 500 Tales to Tell Again, H. L. Gee, Ed., London Epworth Press), p. 161A professor who has taught for many years was counseling a young teacher. \\"You will discover,\\" he said, \\"that in nearly every class there is a youngster eager to argue. Your first impulse will be to silence him. I advise you to think carefully before doing so. He probably is the only one listening.\\" p. 382.)And ones that really make you think:In a talk to the graduating class at Smith College, Adlai Stevenson once told his listeners that the \\"self-adjusted\\" people who fit painlessly into the social pattern may not be the most valuable citizens. \\"While I am not in favor of maladjustment,\\" he added, \\"I view this cultivation of neutrality, this breeding of mental neuters, this hostility to eccentricity with grave misgiving. One looks back with dismay at the possibility of Shakespeare perfectly adjusted to bourgeois life in Stratford, Wesley contentedly administering a county parish, George Washington going to London to receive a barony from George III, or Abraham Lincoln prospering in Springfield with nary a concern for the preservation of the crumbling union. What is needed,\\" continued Mr. Stevenson, \\"is not just well-adjusted, well-balanced personalities, not just better groupies and conformers but more idiosyncratic, unpredictable characters; people who take open eyes and open minds out with them into the society which they will share and help to transform.\\" p. 281An old man was living with his son at an abandoned fort on the top of a hill, and one day he lost a horse. The neighbors came to express their sympathy for this misfortune, and the old man asked, \\"How do you know this is bad luck?\\" A few days afterwards, his horse returned with a number of wild horses, and his neighbors came again to congratulate him on this stroke of fortune, and the old man replied, \\"How do you know this is good luck?\\" With so many horses around, his son began to take to riding, and one day he broke his leg. Again the neighbors came around to express their sympathy, and the old man replied, \\"How do you know this is bad luck?\\" The next year there was a war, and because the old man's son was crippled, he did not have to go to the front. (George Kao, Chinese Wit & Humor, Coward-McCann, 1946, p. 224He also included a number of fine short quotations:A proverb is a short sentence based on long experience. Miguel de Cervantes, p. 315A man would do nothing, if he waited until he could do it so well that no one at all would find fault with what he has done. Cardinal Newman, p. 274Everybody thinks of changing humanity and nobody thinks of changing himself. Count Leo Tolstoy, p. 353Only a mediocre writer is always at his best. W. Somerset Maugham, p. 40If you cannot say what you have to say in 20 minutes, you should go away and write a book about it. Lord Brabazon, p. 320Good management consists of showing average people how to do the work of superior people. (John D. Rockefeller, p. 57And my favorite quotation in the book:Present suffering is not enjoyable, but life would be worth little without it. The difference between iron and steel is fire, but steel is worth all it costs. Iron ore may think itself senselessly tortured in the furnace, but when the watch spring looks back, it knows better. Rufus Babcock, p. 17And my very favorite story of all:Walking down a country lane, a man heard his little granddaughter from the other side of a large bush. She was repeating the alphabet-A, B, C, D, E, but in an oddly reverent sort of way. He waited until she was through and then walked around to find her. \\"What were you doing?\\" he asked. \\"I was praying,\\" she answered. \\"I couldn't think of the right words, so I just said the letters, and God will put them together into the words, because He knows what I was thinking.\\" (Robert E.

This one takes place in the very early 1800's, but his main character is still true to L'Amour form. Always great historical background and vivid topographical descriptions that enhance the story line. Just wish it didn't end so abruptly!"},{"Title":"Ferguson Rifle","review":"This was a very interesting story and followed L'Amours usual high standard of storytelling. It made excellent reading and I look forward to more."},{"Title":"Ferguson Rifle","review":"The Ferguson Rifle is about a young man who found himself in the wild west with nothing else to depend on but his gun. He had been given the rifle by it's maker and the interesting thing is that the rifle was ahead of it's time. Because of this, it got him out of many close calls. Since the main character was called \\"scholar\\" by his friends, it is easy to see that he was out of place in the wild west. But, with the help of his weapon, he managed to survive the onslaught of many outlaws, save the girl, and find the gold. The gold was not his, but he ended the story happy because of chivalry."},{"Title":"Ferguson Rifle","review":"The Ferguson Rifle is a decent book, as most of L'Amour's were. He kept them clean, with no sex, little swearing, and no graphic violence. He was also a pretty good writer. His only problem was that he had a deadline for three books a year, and this is another example of what happens when you write so fast. There is no emotional involvement with the character. Like the first reviewer said, there's no time to get to know anyone. But with L'AMour I guess that didn't matter, since most of his major characters were pretty much the same person with a different name. I've heard arguments to the contrary, but those readers obviously didn't pay much attention to what they read. 6 foot 4, black hair, broad shoulders, lean hips, fast on the draw, toughest fistfighter in the territory: sound familiar? It should. That was 85 percent of L'Amour's books. Now, if you want the good parts of L'AMour with a lot more emotion and character development, there's an author by the name of Kirby Jonas that critics are calling the New Louis L'Amour. When you read his books, you will quickly see why. Try him out. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED. Keep Louis, too. He's good, just not great."},{"Title":"Ferguson Rifle","review":"This was an enternaining story but it will never be a classic.

I was especially moved by (1) the Biblical references and (2) the description of the agonies of the slaves as pertaining to the separation of families: husband from wife, wife from husband, wife from children, the children from their parents...Highest in the number of all-time book sales (short of the Bible itself), President Lincoln himself credited Mrs. Stowe, by her writing of this outstanding work, with providing much of the impetus for the Civil War.

Stowe only implies the horrors of violence and rape without directly describing them, but I felt that took away from the honesty of the depiction. She did effectively illustrate the tragedy of families being torn apart for a profit and the unfairness of people being treated like objects instead of human beings. Between Stowe's compassionate Christian commentary, and Tom's unwavering devoutness, it was a little too pious for me. There were long stretches that lacked momentum, not to mention the tedium of translating the vernacular of the dialogue. There were aspects I did like about it, like Tom's stay with the St. Clare family (how could any reader not resist Eva's innocence and charm?). There were some very well-written, memorable characters and some incredibly moving scenes, but the book as a whole was a chore. As a piece of 19th Century American Literature, it is mediocre, but its endurance throughout the ages is a testament to the impact it made on society."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"WOW! is the best word I can come up with. It is not what I expected. At first it was difficult to read because I found the inhumanity towards our fellow humans very upsetting. It is recommended for 9-12 year-old age. I don't think so. Not with that age group in today's society.It is a fast moving story that covers several persons. I have always know slavery was harmful to the slave. I have come to realize that it is also harmful to the slave owner and to society as a whole. The effects on the slave are clearly apparent. The degrading, the separation of families, and the empty life of servitude. With the slave owner, it degrades them also but many never realized that they were degrading themselves by their brutality.The story also shows mans good side of human being. The story of Eliza, George and their son, run away slaves to Canada and those that helped along the way. The Quakers and many others in the states and Canada where called to do a service and they did, to give aid and comfort to fellow human beings at risk to themselves.Uncle Tom was a Christian. His cabin is where the slaves had their Sunday service. His first 2 owners were kind masters, but it was still slavery. His 3 owner was a brute of a man. Tom was whipped for not whipping a young slave girl that didn't pick enough cotton that day. Tom stood on his belief. At the end he is whipped to death for not revealing where 2 run away slave women where.A short time after finishing the story well it was still fresh in my mind, I listened to a Pastor talk about Obama and how the press had 'forced' Obama to turn on his long time friend, Pastor and spiritual leader the Rev. Wright. My thought, Obama could never be called an Uncle Tom, a man who died protecting to other people. Just a little bit of criticism and Obama rejected his friend.This book was not at all what I expected. I had heard about this book all my life. Many and frequent references to people being an 'Uncle Tom' as a degrading thing to be. Being a Christian is a good thing when one walks the talk as Tom did."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I had never read this book before (and I am a senior).

The edition was inexpensive and easily affordable for just about anyone."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"No work of fictional literature changed the path of American history more than Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin. It pleaded for our nation to face its demons and ultimately thrust it into the Civil War.It is unfathomable to think that a country capable of such horrors would one day elect a black man as President. But, it has. And without this piece of literature, it may not have been possible."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"This book makes you gasp, cry, and have occasional tearful smiles while you read this story that shows you the unjust of slavery.

A must-read."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I heard so much about this book when I was growing up and how it was so inflammatory, but I didn't find it anything of the kind. It really did paint a loving relationship between many masters and their slaves, and the cruel masters were not as prevalent as abolitionists would have you believe. It did discuss the viewpoint that many had that blacks were less than whites in intelligence and ability but also showed blacks who had remarkable abilities (like Uncle Tom). It wasn't a \\"must read until done book\\", but it was a \\"I really would like to know what's next so need to make a little time so I can finish this\\" book.

This was an important part of our history that everyone should learn about."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I read Uncle Tom's Cabin several years ago and now I am reading it again. I love classic books, but sometimes I find them difficult to understand. However, Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote in a way that is pretty much easy reading. While this is a long book, I am glad that it was not edited like a lot of modern books are. There is such a depth to this book that I believe will touch anyone's heart. Slavery is so cruel, and I am glad this book was written to bring to light many different sides of slavery. Since slavery is still going on today in many different countries, I suggest reading this. It is good to see different views. Different reactions. This book references Scripture a lot and sometimes the characters resemble those found in the Bible.

Having gone to an essentially all-white prep school in Florida in the 80s, I grew up with a whole lot very subtle and unexamined garbage in my head that I've had to intentionally de-program and re-program. If this book had been required reading then I would have gotten a huge head start in this process. We should all be so grateful for this book. It's a treasure of our heritage as human beings. Sure, Hawthorne and others may be better technicians when it comes to skillful prose, but criticism on this front totally misses the point. This a hugely consequential book that is still relevant and important."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"This book is truly unique. Being authentic, deep, and thoughtful, Stowe shows all sides of the various kinds of people who lived during the time that slavery was legal in this country. She is not formulaic nor trite. The characters are complex. Most characters are neither all good or all bad. Stowe is sarcastic and snarky, very tongue in cheek...a lot. Why is this book banned by the public school system these days? Is it because it contains \\"the N-word\\"? No. It is because that the true reason that slavery no longer exists: Stowe shined a light on the false reasoning for slavery and the true corrupting effect of slavery on the master and the slave. Stowe showed the way out of slavery by skillful using the Bible as the proof text...and THAT is why the public school has banned the book...it contains the biblical road to inner soul freedom and social freedom. This book moves people to action. Abraham Lincoln claimed that this was the book that started the Civil War. Many years later, it moved me to start an educational program that has changed the lives of teenagers. ([...]) I'm listening to it again in order to gain the courage and instructions to help the poor in a more tangible, personal way. I've read the book and listened to it multiple times... it's THAT good.This reader, Kathryn Yarman, in my opinion, does THE BEST job of making this story come alive. It is now only available on cassette tape and costs a small fortune. I searched a year for a cheaper copy without success. This needs to be shared. I wish someone would produce it on CD or mp3 so it can be purchased by others. If you're an audio book fan, you'll have to listen to another reader...well, ok, but just listen to it!Warning: This book has a history of changing people's lives and setting people in motion to lovingly and personally change the world they are in. If you read it, you will never be the same...I'm just sayin'!"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"First Published in 1852.Harriet Beecher Stowe (1811-1896) sat down to write a book that would show the United States the evils of slavery. She wrote Uncle Tom's Cabin; or, Life Among the Lowly in response to the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, at the urging of her sister-in-law. She succeeded in fueling the debate over slavery and she pointed a finger of shame at the slave owners and at America as a whole.It created a national sensation. Within ten years, it sold two million copies, making it the best-selling novel of all time in the United States, in proportion to population, according to noted Civil War historian James M. McPherson. The book was so controversial and so powerful that there were attempts to ban it in some parts of the South. Pro-slavery authors attempted to counter the book with their own books with titles like Uncle Robin in His Cabin in Virginia and Uncle Tom Without One in Boston in an attempt to show that African Americans were better off in slavery. Abraham Lincoln reportedly acknowledged the impact of her novel when he meet Harriett Beecher Stowe in 1862 and quipped, \\"So, you're the little woman who wrote the book that made this great war.\\"Stowe uses two plot devices to successfully make her case about the evils of slavery. The first is the theme of the splitting apart of slave families and the slave-owning families throughout the course of the book. The second is Uncle Tom's unwavering adherence to Christian principles. The book was written to persuade Christians of the Second Great Awakening that slavery was a great evil that should be eliminated. The reader is continually assaulted with images and exhortations designed to shame the heart of a nineteenth century Christian into action.Stowe chose to focus on the rending of slave families and the abuse heaped upon the devout Christian, Uncle Tom, for good reason. If she had focused on the hard, forced labor of slaves in the field there would have been little sympathy. This was an era in which nearly everyone worked long, hard hours and many people worked for others and felt that they were forced to work or starve. For example, historian Harry L. Watson noted that the famed \\"Lowell Girls\\" of New England were forced to live in company-owned boarding houses and worked an average of 73 hours per week.If she had made a straight argument about the basic immorality of one human being owning another, she probably would not have swayed many hearts. Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger Taney summed up the feelings of many people in the Dred Scott decision when he said that African Americans were \\"of an inferior order...so far inferior, that they had no rights which a white man was bound to respect.\\"I some states, it was even against the law for African Americans to reside within the state. In Indiana, for example, the 1851 state constitution made it illegal for African Americans to move into the state and fined anyone who hired them or encouraged them to remain in the state. The proceeds of those fines were put into a fund to re-settle African Americans to colonies in Africa.Rather than writing an essay or an editorial that lays out the antislavery argument, Stowe uses a much more effective method - she introduces her readers to the slaves themselves and inflicts the horrors of slavery upon these slaves. The reader is forced to get to know slaves as people (undoubtedly a rare occurrence for Northern whites) and then witness the rending of their families, their struggles for dignity, their flights for freedom and terrible physical abuse.From the very beginning of her novel, Stowe shows the fearful prospect that faced all slave families - the selling away of family members. The reader is shown, through these fictional characters, the impact of the selling away of a family member. The reader is witness to a slave auction in which a worn-out old woman begs to be sold along with her only remaining child.The fear of being sold away was not just restricted to cruel or greedy masters. Kindly masters could have financial troubles and be forced to break apart families. In what is probably the most famous scene in Uncle Tom's Cabin, the readers follows an escaping slave named Eliza as she flees a loving mistress in the middle of winter so that her only child will not be sold away to help cover family debts. Eliza is so desperate to escape the runaway slave hunters that she flees across ice flows of the Ohio River.The majority of the book deals with the title character, Uncle Tom, a slave sold away from his family and friends (including the master's son) in order to pay a debt. Uncle Tom's desire to return to his home in Kentucky is a constant throughout the book. The reader also knows that he would not have suffered his awful death if he had not been sold away from his home and family. By making fully developed characters of the slaves, Stowe shows that the reality of slave life was not like the comments of the white woman at the slave auction. She is asked,\\"'Suppose, ma'am, your two children, there, should be taken from you, and sold?'\\"and she answers:\\"'We can't reason from our feelings to those of this class of person.'\\"Stowe attacks that attitude by showing how \\"this class of person\\" would respond to forced separation from a child, and it was no different than the response of any other class of person.Stowe takes us on a tour of the South by way of the slave Uncle Tom. He sees good masters and bad ones. He lives in a mansion (as a slave, of course) and works in the most horrible conditions on a desolate plantation. Through it all, Uncle Tom is a perfect Christian. He is intended to be this way. He never deviates from the ideals of the Christian faith. He shares food while he is nearly starving. He rescues a drowning child while he is being shipped down the Mississippi to be auctioned and he does not complain when his hymn book is taken from him and his faith is ridiculed. Uncle Tom does not take freedom when it is offered by his master in New Orleans because he is concerned about the condition of his master's soul and wants to make sure he becomes a Christian. Tom even forgives the master who orders him beaten to death and the slaves who gladly comply with his commands. Stowe makes him an unbelievably perfect Christian, even a saint. She does this so that she can demonstrate the cruelty of slavery. If it can destroy this man who has done nothing wrong, how can anyone survive it? It screams at the consciences of the Christians who let this situation continue and questions the Christianity of the Slave-owning class.Harriett Beecher Stowe's goal was to reach out to touch the heart of America and demonstrate the evils of slavery. Coming from a family of evangelists, she created the character of Uncle Tom to reach out to Christians of the Second Great Awakening. He may have been a slave, but he was also a fellow Christian who lived the Christian ideals. If the readers could not sympathize with a slave or a black man, they could identify with his religious ideals and his faith. Suddenly, people who felt nothing for the plight of the slaves could see the evils of slavery.Truly an American classic."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I'm glad I read this. Oh, it wasn't all that fun to read- it dragged on quite a bit, and the author's style of writing was frustrating. The story was often slow. Stowe was a devout Christian, and she often preaches directly to the reader; hardly a page goes by when she is not invoking Christ's name or quoting from the bible. Her prose is sensationalized and overwrought. Still, I was drawn in by the story to a certain extent. Also, I feel I learned a lot about slavery and about what it was like to live in a society that held slaves.The story focuses not only on Tom, but also on many of the other people he came in contact with. Often the focus is taken entirely off Tom as we follow the stories of the more minor characters. The book seems to very accurately portray society in the years before the Civil War. Many of the incidents Stowe describes really happened and the characters were based on people she either knew or knew of. The book is pretty straightforward in its condemnation of slavery, but I liked how Stowe portrayed so many different groups of people and showed both the good and bad in each group. There are decent slaveholders and evil ones, there are bad Christians and good ones, and racists exist even in the North. No group of people is portrayed as perfect or ideal, although slavery as an institution is condemned in the strongest possible terms and Tom is a true Christ figure who never falters in his goodness and courage. Among the slaves themselves, there are some who are noble and some who are just as cruel and oppressive as their masters.This book should be read by everyone, not because it is enjoyable or well written (I feel that it isn't) but because it reveals so much about how our country once was and was so historically significant."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I decided to read this book with quite a bit of trepidation, maybe even with a sense of duty to get it \\"over with\\". My impression of the book prior to reading it was that it would show slavery in a bad light, but by doing so would portray Uncle Tom and others as subserviant, happy creatures and the purpose of ending slavery would be hardly different than to stop being mean to a dog. Well, I was certainly wrong about that! It's just a fantastic book. Sure, there are some nitpicks that could be made, such as the holy character of Eva (about as subtle as a sledgehammer), but on the whole it is a page turner. I also was expecting the language to be a barrier in that it was written 160 years ago, but that was not the case at all. There is some formality to the language, but that is often used to convey sarcasm by Stowe, something very familiar to modern readers.It is entirely understandable why Uncle Tom was a phenomenon for decades. It is a book that takes you to a different world than most readers (even then) had experienced. I'm surprised that this book hasn't been made into a movie--then again the scrutiny of the project would be overwhelming, so I guess I am not so surprised after all. One last thing, like many reviewers I had a completely different idea of what Uncle Tom the character would be like. It's odd how culture works sometimes. The term of (being an) \\"Uncle Tom\\" is almost the complete opposite of the actual character."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"This was such an amazing book! I can only imagine what black people of that day went thru, and because of Harriet Beecher Stowe's written account, though fictional, I was able to better realize some of their agony. It truly touched my heart in a wonderful way and I don't know how anyone reading it could fail to be touched as well."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I love reading historical fiction, and, especially, historical fiction surrounding the stories of slaves who either escape or make the attempt to escape to freedom. Their bravery and persistence and endurance beyond what any human should have to endure awes and inspires me. This book is interesting in that the author is able to write, it seems, in the diction from the time period, which adds to the authenticity and the reading experience. It can sometimes get hard to follow, though. The author also uses the \\"trick\\" of speaking directly to the reader at times when she wants to \\"instruct\\" or impress something upon the reader. At first it was impressive, then a little tiresome. Love the period details and the rich character development through mostly dialogue."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"It was interesting to reread this novel. As a teenager reading this many years ago, I didn't appreciate the strong anti-slavery stance. It showed the suffering of the slaves especially because of their separation from their families, and clearly described the beliefs of the slave owners, the slave sellers, and the anti-slavery movement.Though a bit preachy at times, it was a better read than most nonfictional accounts of slavery.Many of the characters make you want to root for them to get their freedom."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"How I ever got out of high school & college without being required to read this I will never know. But better late than never. It was perfect. Slavery is wrong no matter how kind the master. So amazing to see how people fooled themselves into believing they were practicing Christians while owning slaves. Some aspects of slavery you may never have considered like what happens when the master dies or goes into debt. All Americans should read it in order to know history."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"This book is very, very, very bad! I could not even believe it?Andrew is my name and I give this a D-!"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I really like this book. I tried to read it when I was real young but couldnt get into it. Its good on the kindle because the dictionary is so readially available for words that are not like our modern vocabulary."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"this book is amazing it will make even the most manly person shed a tear."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I just finished reading this book for school(8th grade) and didn't really enjoy it. It was extremely dry and just dragged on and on. Maybe I would have enjoyed it more if I wasn't forced to read it and could read at my own pace.There are a ton of different characters and storylines to keep track of. Also there is more than one character with the same name(uncle Tom &amp; tom loker) (george harris &amp; george shelby) which makes things a little more complicated. Characters are in are in the story one second, disappear, and then just pop back in chapters later.The botttom line is if you enjoy reading the classics you should give this book a try, if not look for something else"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I think Uncle Tom's Cabin is one of the best books ever written. It's a shame that this book isn't as popular any more. If it was, people would understand how things were during that time period. Some people doesn't realize how cruel slavery is and think it as no big deal. Those people would definitly feel differant after they read Uncle Tom's cabin. Plus, it's a wonderful book about Eliza, a slave that was treated well by her master had to run away with her little boy named Harry because her master was about to sell Harry and Uncle Tom to a mean slavetrader that had no respect. Uncle Tom on the other hand, had no choice but to be sold to the slavetrader. Then he was sold to Mr. St. Clare on a ship to somewheres. If it hadn't been for Mr. St. Clare's daughter Eva, Uncle Tom would of never been sold to such a nice family since Mr. St. Clare treats his slaves really well and let them where his clothes. If you want to find out what happened to Eliza and her child or about what happened to Uncle Tom, you can order the book from Amazon.com in the Internet."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I understand why this book is among the classics- it is extremely eye-opening. It avidly, and realistically, shows a side of slavery's emotional effects.However, the book went downhill in the middle. In the beginning was great; good story lines that were well told. Then the middle came. The book became religious blah blah blah that had nothing to do with pushing the storyline forward. The end is horrible. It's like HBS got tired of writing one day, so she wrote \\"And everyone lived happily ever after. Except him- he dies.\\"This book is a classic for a reason, and I do recommend it for that reason."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I purchased this book for my son. It was required reading for his 11th grade Honors English class. He needed this book ASAP because as usual, he waits until the very last minute to tell me he has something due at school. I went to Amazon.com and found this book. The price was well within what I wanted to pay for the book. The time between ordering and receiving the book was only a couple of days. I was very pleased with both the item purchased and the time it took to receive the item. The book was in great condition also. I would buy from this seller again and again. Thanks! Tina B. Memphis, TN"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Wow... what can I say?I did like this book, as far as the story goes. But I must admit, the style of writing was... well... let's say less than professional. I guess the style of writing back then was much different than today, but there was too much &quot;He said. She said.&quot; or &quot;Tom said. St. Claire said.&quot; There is no need to put &quot;[whatever] said.&quot; after each sentence of dialog.I think what I liked the most about this book is that it is TRUE and ACCURATE. It is noted that the characters are based on real people, the attitudes and way of speech are based on the reality of the time... since it was written by a person during that period of time, the accuracy cannot be matched. It was a nice story... but most of all... it was fiction based on non-fiction.It was a story you can believe in."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I had to read this book for school.

But not the way Stowe writes, I felt like I couldn't bear another page. Unbelievably flat characters in an unbelievably flat setting. Stowe wrote sophomorically about a place she had never been, and instead of creating a good book about the horrors and issues of slavery, she wrote characters who were exaggerated caricatures, from Eliza to Uncle Tom to Simon Legree. Little Eva? Please. I didn't shed a tear. Maybe it worked as propaganda then but I've read much better since."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Uncle Tom's Cabin was required reading when I was in high school about my junior year. Well, it seems I am getting around to catching up on my doing my homework some 51 years after the fact. I regret it has taken me so long to pick up a book that I would have thoroughly enjoyed. Ms. Stowe has a compelling story to tell of the period during slavery, and it brings to light the tragic abuses that went on at that time. This inhumanity to man I am glad we are beyond in our country, but then again look how long it has taken for us as a nation to mature to become a tolerant society. Oh yes, I am aware of what occurred at that time hearing and being exposed to slavery in movies and other readings. As I read about the key character, Uncle Tom I was pulling for him and hoping he would be able to reunite with his wife and family after their long separation. It just was not meant to be and his tragic ending. He was such a god fearing man and I hoped for such a better ending.

Harriet Beecher Stowe's \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" is a classic of American literature and according to Wikipedia, the second most popular (based on sales) book behind the Bible in the U.S. during the 19th century. Published in 1852, Ms. Stowe's by turns heartbreaking and inspirational story of the evils of slavery in the first half of the 1800s opened the eyes of many to the moral perversity of the institution and steeled resolve to end slavery sooner rather than later.Sometimes conflated to be the story of one African-American family (that of Tom) and evil slaveowner Simon Legree, the book actually follows two heroic leading characters from separate families - the title character of field slave Uncle Tom and house slave Eliza. As the book begins, both are property of relatively benign master George Shelby in Kentucky. Unspecified economic troubles force Shelby to sell some of his \\"stock\\" - he chooses his two most valuable properties - the reliable and loyal Tom and Eliza's young son Harry. The buyer has no interest in Eliza and Harry as a package. Eliza learns of the transaction and plans her and Harry's escape, a courageous journey along the Underground Railroad to Canada. Tom, a deeply spiritual man, accepts his sale as God's will and leaves his family for an almost certainly more difficult live further south.During the journey, Tom's decency improves his lot. After befriending and rescuing a young girl from drowning on a riverboat, he's resold to the girl's father - well-to-do gentleman Augustine St. Clare, from New Orleans. St. Clare accepts the practical \\"necessity\\" for slavery while being uncomfortable with its moral implications, a discomfort that he reflects in his hands off treatment of his slaves.Tom becomes a valued member of the St. Clare household and a Christian soulmate to the sickly daughter Eva, the embodiment of a \\"pure\\" Christian view of evils of slavery. She convinces her father (with a dying wish) to free Tom, but before the paperwork can be completed, St. Clare is killed in an accident. St. Clare's callous wife Marie takes control of his estate including the slaves and promptly sells Tom a short ways back up the river to the dreaded Legree, a cotton planter in north Louisiana.As St. Clare is probably about the most benign slaveowner imaginable, Legree is the most wicked, in fact, probably one of the most infamous villains in literary history, though he only appears in about the last quarter of the book. He envisions Tom as a potential overseer, but Tom's inherent kindness of spirit won't permit him to perform some of the key duties of that position, most importantly whipping the other slaves. The reluctance eventually costs Tom his life, but his nobility and strong Christian faith allow him to accept his fate with his usual dignity, believing that he's being delivered into a better life with Jesus in heaven.In recent years, the character of Tom has drawn criticism, especially in the young African-American community, as a so-called collaborator with slaveowners. I see him as a more heroic and noble character along the lines of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who maintained his soul and refused to resort to violence. The strength of Tom's spirit, while costing him his earthly life, rescues his soul, and ultimately conquers Legree's soul. As a counterpart to Tom, Stowe also includes the character of George, husband of Eliza, who engineers his family's escape and emigration. While Stowe glories in Tom's moral courage, she in no way denigrates George's approach to his predicament.Stowe often steps back from the story to preach on a particular evil of slavery (the breaking up of African-American families being foremost), the hypocrisy of white Christians, who find justification for slavery in the Bible of all places, and on the true Christian message that all human beings are equal in God's sight and deserving to pursue their own destinies freely. She also rebuts anticipated criticism of the story that \\"very few\\" slaveowners acted like Legree, asking how many owners who treat their mechanical farm equipment better than their human slaves are \\"too many.\\" Of course, her answer is \\"one\\".As well as being an unrelenting condemnation of slavery, \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" is to this non-Christian one of the most compelling arguments for Christianity, at least the version practiced by Eva and Tom, I've ever read. For each, their faith provides a moral basis for kind action and the strength to deal with adversity. Many of Jesus' teachings about treatment of our fellow men are put into understandable contexts.Stowe has been criticized for the romantic and somewhat melodramatic tone of the book, but she knew for whom she was writing - the white women of 19th century America, for whom the stories of families torn asunder - husbands and wives separated; children taken from their mothers - would resonate at a deep level - deep enough for them to convince their husbands to reject the status quo and do something about abolishing the heinous institution of slavery.Uneven progress over the last 150 years has thoroughly discredited slavery as a sad chapter in American history, though we are left with vestiges of racial prejudice and the ongoing struggle for equal rights for African-Americans. That said, \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" still has great value for modern readers as it replaces the idea of slavery as an abstract historical evil with vivid evidence of its human dimensions and costs.Five epic stars for all readers."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I grabbed this book, figuring I would try some of the classics. Figuiring, what would be better than the book that assisted in breaking our country (US) in two.This classic was simply put amazing and well worth the hype. Mrs Stowe has created great characters in this novel and even though most readers know she was an abolitionist she did a very good job at being unbiased, showing both sides as equal as possible, pro-south, pro abolitionist and those people in between.

Buck Schirner does an excellent job of reading the story, getting the dialect and conveying the characters. I would and have already recommended this CD. Stowe's story is a classic and this CD is one I'm keeping!"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"When Harriet Beecher-Stowe published Uncle Tom's Cabin in 1852 it sold more copies than any book before, other than the Bible. It became a significant catalyst in the social movements of the time: abolition of slavery, and States' rights. It could be argued that her book was a major cause of the Civil War and Emancipation Proclamation. That's one powerful book--especially for fiction.While the book was intended as an illustration of the evils of slavery, it ends up as more--specifically a study in racism with the conclusion that prejudice comes in infinite degrees. Even Harriet herself was prejudice. She occasionally takes the unorthodox approach of interrupting her narrative to preach to the reader, clearly stating her opinion that Blacks were a &quot;degraded race,&quot; but still worthy of humane treatment. As she wends her way through the story and reveals her large and varied cast of characters, she exposes the many forms of discrimination, some more forgiving than her own.She portrays her hero, the old slave, Uncle Tom, as a likeable, caring, Christian man deserving compassion and freedom. She unwittingly coined the Uncle Tom clich&eacute;, that of a complacent and passive black man resigned to his low station in life, kowtowing to white men. But she also delivers us the more savory George Harris, a hot-blooded and intelligent young slave willing to die for his freedom, a man with true &quot;American&quot; virtue. She introduces the reprehensible slave traders and run-away trackers, the brutal plantation owners, Southern apologists and sympathizers, Northern indignation and apathy, and the only color-blind people in her book, the helpful Quakers on the Underground Railway. Most important, she shows the tragic result of slave child ripped from mother, and husband from wife to be &quot;sold down river.&quot; A century and a half later, it's hard to imagine how this could happen.Uncle Tom's Cabin is a prime example of the power of the written word. It divided a nation and changed an institution. Its message remains relevant even today, and still manages to ignite passions. Beyond all that, it's actually one heck of an entertaining story. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I am glad I finally read this novel. It reads well on the Kindle; I mainly used the iTouch app and did not have any problems with the format or text.Of the story: sure, it sounds preachy sometimes. Sure, it has characters that are stereotypes. But the simple language and the occasional melodrama keep the narrative moving forward to include episodes that are very human and very believable. One disappointment was the theme of the angelic white child being cared for by Uncle Tom with little mention of how he might also care deeply for all of the children around him, regardless of race. Despite entreaties to treat all humans equally, there was still an undercurrent of whiter people having greater value and worth than people of color; however, I also understand the novel was directed at a white audience with the intention of changing attitudes and ending slavery. Knowing the history that followed its being published, I am glad the story was written and I feel I have benefitted from reading it. Human beings have far to go in race relations; this novel still has something to offer and should be read if you haven't already done so."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I just want to take a chance to recommend this book to all Americans-it's an integral part of our history and I think it would help any reader better understand our country. We all know about the book and its author, have perhaps read a page or two in our highschool US history textbooks, and have undoubtedly heard the term \\"Uncle Tom\\". But how many of us have actually read it? This was what I was myself wondering when I came across it by chance and absentmindedly threw it into my bag when looking for new books to read at the library a few weeks ago.I'm not sure I have anything to say about this book that other reviewers haven't said, but I just wanted to share how I, like others who read this book, was floored to discover that this book did not consist of a parade of one-dimensional, insulting black stereotypes who were sychophantic and devoted to their unjust masters. That's what we all thought it was and that's because people base their interpretations on the book on popular representations of it-not the actual text.It was actually quite touching, revealing, and amazing in a number of ways. Before I go any further, I want to acknowledge that certainly, Stowe had adopted some of the beliefs of her time-she seemed to think that Anglo-Saxons were \\"naturally\\" colder and Africans \\"naturally\\" more loving and open to religion. Although I do think that is a form of racism, and I reject the idea of qualities \\"inherent\\" to any human group, I think it's important to distinguish that her black characters were not intellectually inferior or lazy or naturally criminal-the most common forms of racist imagining you will find. In fact, she would just as easily subject a mediterranean to the same sort of stereotyping-which is not to excuse it, simply to say it was not a black/white issue. All mainstream ethnography of the 19th century was quite off-track in just about every way and has been currently discredited. But Stowe was advanced beyond many who subscribed to it in a number of ways.Another charge is that her book is melodramatic, and although it is far more sentimental than books we are used to in our own time, there's nothing wrong with that. And there are few things as melodramatic as sons separated from fathers, mothers from daughters, husbands from wives, or as people being whipped and starved to death with no recourse to justice, or as young woman raped and powerless to stop it. Inserting personal emotional comments may not be the style of today, but I think we have a lot to learn from it.Parts of the book will always hold emotional weight and I think it's impossible not to imagine the insight, sensitivity, and bravery of the woman who wrote this book. In many ways she is surprisingly progressive-more so than many supposedly enlightened people today. Her heartrending and realistic descriptions of slave families being separated and put to auction will never lose their power or become dated because that's what really happened. Furthermore, she does a very skillful job of demonstrating time and time again that it doesn't matter if individual \\"masters\\" are benevolent-the fact of powerlessness and lack of independence means that the system itself will always result in vast injustice. Contrary to what some allege, she is not saying that slavery is the same thing as capitalism or \\"wage slavery\\". Although she thinks that the exploitation of impoverished workers (who have no rights) in industrializing England at that time is abhorrent, she has her spokespeople explain that slavery is yet worse because at least these cannot be separated from their family. In fact she is rejecting those-and it is always pro-slavery advocates who made this argument-that say that slavery is \\"no worse\\" and in some cases \\"better\\" than severe urban poverty in industralizing countries, or than the lot of impoverished peasantry in the rest of Europe.The hero himself, Tom, is not an \\"Uncle Tom\\" in our contemporary sense. In fact, he does continually stand up to an abusive \\"master\\"-at the greatest personal cost. What he is, in fact, is a true Christian. It isn't about him believing himself inferior to whites-he certainly does NOT think that they are worth more than him. He is simply a profoundly religious man who will turn the other cheek-but he will NOT compromise with his intensely held morals, either for personal gain or in response to the threats of a violent master. People have here confused a powerful and moving0 interpretation of Christianity with weakness. Tom is actually the strongest character in the book.In addition, the book is not simplistic. The \\"north\\" is not good and the \\"south\\" is not all bad. One of the aspects I really liked is that the north is taken to task for assuming moral superiority the South because of their treatment of blacks when, in fact, in many cases they were on an individual level more racist. St. Clare, one of Tom's \\"good owners\\", is a southern plantation owner who is conflicted because he knows slaveholding is wrong-and he feels no personal disgust toward blacks or any belief that they are inferior. Out of personal weakness he keeps his slaves.In contrast, his yankee cousin Ophelia condemns his slaveholding but has a personal aversion to those of African descent that St. Clare never demonstrates. St. Clare brings her an intelligent but desperately abused slave girl-who later became a racist cartoon in popular representations of the text-and Ophelia discovers that \\"topsy\\" is an incredibly fast learner and capable of anything as long as she's given some love and not treated with disgust.Also, the book's worst character, who sexually exploits his female slaves and drives the others to death, is a yankee. This is Simon Legree.Another interesting aspect of the book is that although Tom is uneducated and speaks in slang, Stowe presented educated, and articulate slaves who had gotten more opportunities than Tom and were able to describe their plight in eloquent and moving words. One of these, George Harris, gives a very strong speech about his right to individual freedom, and is presented as being smarter and more innovative than his master-in fact an inventor of considerable intelligence-who makes his master insecure precisely because he is black AND smarter than him.So it's not a book filled only with \\"simple, corn-bread eating\\" slaves as some would tell you.I think those are all the really important things in the book, except that I was incredibly surprised at how powerful it still is after all these years and what an amazing message of Christian love it carries. Stowe has so much hope that humanity will abandon hatred and distinctions based on color and class-and that message continues to be more important than ever. I'm proud an American wrote such a book."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"It will be found shocking to many African Americans (and educational for many Caucasians) to discover that Uncle Tom was the HERO of this classic novel, and not a \\"weakling\\" by any stretch of the imagination. \\"Uncle Tom\\", or its shorter form \\"Tom\\", has become a slanderous term within the African American community and implies a weak and Caucasian-controlled person, when in actuality Uncle Tom was a powerfully moral man who was willing to die for his convictions rather than succumb to the will of his worst oppressors. In fact, this book was credited by Abraham Lincoln himself as the catalyst that won his election on the abolition of slavery platform, and the resulting Civil War that followed. \\"Uncle Tom\\" became a negative slander one hundred years later only after Malcolm-X and the Black Muslims used it to slander Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. who exemplified similar characteristics of strength and courage--from a similarly peaceful perspective--in his approach to the Civil Rights issue.

I highly recommend this book to people of all colors and races because of the lessons of self-sacrifice and courage it contains.

The writing, the character development, the story are all absolutely great. It is too bad that the meaning of \\"uncle tom\\" has been twisted from other bastardized uses of this story. Tom is a hero in every sense."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Uncle Tom's Cabin by Harriet Beecher Stowe, is an intriguing, influential, and enlightening novel. This novel truly radiates the unfairness and injustice of slavery.The characters are very important to the theme and ideas of the novel. Most all of them, especially the main charcter, Uncle Tom, reaches moral reconciliation or a spiritual reassessment, at one point in their lives. Stowe's purpose and ideas presented in this novel inform the readers that slavery is wrong and immoral. Stowe's novel leaves us with a lasting impression, and the idea that God is the only one who can truly make right, the wrong of slavery."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"This book paints a clear picture of the forces behind slavery. It illuminates the way that the human race has justified slavery, not just the slavery of Africans in America. Part of what makes this book so wonderful, is that it fits most people. Stowe works on both the emotional and logical level to combat slavery. I believe that all Americans should read this book to not only get an insight into a gruesome part of American history, but to also realize how much we justify our actions without listening to our conscience."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"The views of the cult of True Womanhood began in the 1820s and 30s as an ideology to create a contentedness for the woman in her domestic sphere. Uncle Tom's Cabin provides a humorous, yet true, take on womanly conduct, both correct and incorrect. Stowe takes the reader through a delightfully accurate historical path that diagrams not only relations between the races, but between the sexes as well. A must have for any well-read library."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Our book club decided to read some old classics and we were all surprised to find that none of our members had read Uncle Tom's Cabin, except a French woman who had read it in school in French! A little hard to get into with the style of writing and the dialog, it soon became a real page-turner for me as I got caught up in the story and the characters. Stowe paints a very interesting picture of the times, and it provoked one of the best discussions that our book club has had. No wonder this book was a best seller, both in the US and Europe. Highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"When I picked up this book at my school library, I was a little worried that it would be boring and hard to follow. I'm a teenager: what do I know about classics? But we were studying the Civil War in history so I thought I'd give it a try.I was amazed at how gripping the plot was, and how awesome the characters were. True, there were some very 2-D people, but you've got to give Ms. Stowe credit for the angles she took on about slavery.People who aren't Biblical might think the book is too preachy and stale, but I thought it had wisdom that would still be considered wise today.For being an old book, it's really something."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"This book was incredible. Yes it can be racist, and extremist at times, but at it's core you're reading a piece of history. For a book to sell 300,000 copies during it's original publication in the mid 19th century is astounding. You're reading a book that had a part in the Civil War, the bloodiest war of our history. I did find while reading it that many parallels can be made between this book and \\"Black Beauty\\". Coincidence? Perhaps, but worth looking at in a review, or report. To read this and think that America permitted this slavery to go on for years, would be enough to disgust anyone. America's history is a bloody one, one that we need to remember, and reading this book will make you appriciate your freedom now, as an American. Please do keep in mind however, the slave trade is still going not to America, but places in Europe and Asia, even with the U.N outlawing it in 1953. I just cannot say how much this book made me think about the world past and present. Most highly recommended."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Uncle Toms Cabin was an interesting book discussing the hardships of slavery in the 1800s. It takes you through life in the eyes of a slave, Tom. Uncle Toms Cabin shows you the hardships slaves went through to not get a beating from their master, though many endured that anyway. It opened my eyes to the reality of slavery, and the severity of it all. The book not only talks about slavery, but it also addresses the issue of religion. Although I did not get a chance to read Uncle Toms Cabin carefully, I enjoyed what I could of it and would definitely re-read it so I could get a better understanding.i would also definitely recommend this book to anyone that is interested in reading about the slavery issues of the 1800s."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"The powerful novel that I have recently read, Uncle Tom's Cabin, has helped shaped in many ways my thoughts and beliefs of slavery. It helped me get past the thought of slavery as wrong, but showed real examples of how it really was wrong by things that happened in that time period. It went through the ups and downs of a slaves life, and everything Tom the slave had to endure. It starts off when Tom, like many slaves, had to leave his home along with Eliza and her son to be sold to Mr. Haley. Eliza heads towards Canada to meet up with her husband and to be on free land. Tom becomes dear friends with a young child named Eva, a young girl who he saved after she fell overboard. He was then bought by that family and learned to love them deeply. Eva and Tom would talk about everything, but soon their short time came to end when Eva became ill and passed away. Eva had made a deal with her father, that once she dies that Tom must be emancipated. St. Clare the father also dies before he finished freeing Tom. He is bought by a man named Legree who decides to teach him a lesson, and break him in. After letting another slave whip Tom, Tom is no longer able to work for a while. Tom's faith continues to be tested day by day and Tom tells his owner that he forgives him for what he had done. George, Elizas husband has come back like promised to free Tom and take him up to Canada, but it was too late. Tom had died a painful death. Through all the hardships that Tom went through, he remained a devout Christian and knew that God would save him, and that God would help him, and that God would love him. His faith was contagious, he helped almost everyone and anyone he could. All these slave owners claimed to be Christian, and would even use the bible to justify what they had done. This amazing novel must have helped change so many minds before and during the Civil War, just like it helped me want to put a complete end to prejudices everywhere. I would highly recommend this book to anyone in need of a historical, thought provoking, well written novel."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"When I started to read this book the only thing I knew about slavery was that it was appalling to the society, but towards the middle of this book I began to realize the hardships that the slaves had to go through back then. I couldn't imagine if I was split apart from my family in a slave trade. Harriet Beecher Stowe helps everyone reading this book understand what life would be like if we were slaves. During the time that I was reading this novel I couldn't believe all the hardships that Tom had to go through, going from master to master and having to leave all of his friends. Stowe does a superb job describing the charters and their personalities in this book. At the end of this read it helped me think of what life was like then, and to be glad that we live in the time period that we do. In conclusion, if you want a book that makes a difference in peoples' lives then Uncle Tom's Cabin is the right book for you."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"This is one of the greatest literary works that I have ever had the pleasure of reading. The many different view points that are brought into action cause the reader to partially understand reasons of how the evil came to be evil, and the deprived came upon their lowly state.The story begins on a Kentucky plantation, where the owner, Mr.Shelby, has to sell his two more valuable slaves, Uncle Tom and Harry. Harry is five years old and his mother has to save him from his doomed fate. Tom stays to pay for his masters debt. The story follows Uncle Tom's life after his sale, and Harry's mother, Eliza's, new lives after this life-changing event.The story of Uncle Tom's Cabin is truly remarkable. What makes the story so powerful is that the views presented are the real thoughts and questions once brought up by people of the era. The story includes all aspects of the slave trade. Everything from the trader himself to the feelings of separated families is explained in detail. If you want a non-history book view of what really happened before the Civil War, it is unthinkable to miss Uncle Tom's Cabin."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"For 30 years my only knowledge of &quot;Uncle Tom's Cabin&quot; came through the awkward filter of a brief scene in the movie, &quot;The King and I.&quot; In that movie from the 1950s, Siamese actors present a beautiful but caricatured version of Stowe's book- like the minstrel shows of the nineteenth century which made Uncle Tom into an obsequious cliche. These dramatizations have probably done much to obscure the true value of this narrative. Stowe's characters are richly drawn and highly complex. The characters of Uncle Tom, Ophelia, and Mr. St. Clare are some of the most vivid, precisely drawn characters in literature.The conversations between Ophelia and her cynical, slaveholding cousin from the South encapsulated perfectly the heated debate in this country about the &quot;peculiar institution&quot; of slavery. And, while Stowe attacks the South for its tolerance of this demonaical practice, she does not hesitate to point out the hypocrisy of the North. Northerners, she states, condemn the South for slavery, but they themselves want little or nothing to do with blacks or their rehabilitation. (Little Topsy becomes the perfect metaphor for the challenge of reconstruction.)This novel also reminds us of the dominance of faith and the Bible in the nineteenth century, making much of the text feel- to us in the twentieth century- preachy or overly didactic. It's an odd combination of story and moral jeremaid, but its ultimate purpose was to incite action, not to entertain. Utimately, it managed to do both."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"This Kindle edition is not accurately reproduced. Don't waste money on it.

I just finished it about half an hour ago and I don't think the impression it left on me will ever change. Being in a stage of adolescense, if ever-so early, I've got problems. And helping me through these is a person who constantly tries to help me look on the positive side and be thankful for what makes up my life. This book was an ideal aid. Here Harriet Beecher Stowe has put together a tale which is assumed to be based on stories of actual lives tortured by the cruelty of slavery. Legend has it that Abraham Lincoln referred to Mrs. Stowe as the &quot;little lady who started the big war&quot; upon meeting her, and the pages in this book are credible for having done so. Here a true view is given into the darkness of an American reality. Here we have to ask ourselves what we do to others directly and what we do by not doing anything in their defense. Here we have to ask ourselves, &quot;where are we going?&quot; For this nation, alive over a hundred years at the time, was betraying the very basis for which it was founded. And the life of Uncle Tom exposes it's cruelties clearly, as unwanted as they are. Tom is a strong faithed and God fearing man, a credit to man. What he endured has made my eyes moist and my mind churn over my values. But what sustained him was his faith in God. Upon reading this book, think about the nature of humans, and what will happen on God's day of judgement."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I had always intended to read this book and finally ordered a copy from Amazon. As I proceeded to read it, I was often amazed at the quality of its writing and perceptions. I find it hard to conceive how a woman with the constraints of her day, including those of family, travel, and research sources could have produced a book that still shines forth with freshness and articulation. I was prepared to find it rather stilted and time-worn but found it a compelling and most enjoyable read instead."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Most of the classics you read are long and boring and definitely not easy reading. Uncle Tom's Cabin is not one of those books! It is a book you can read before you go to sleep at night, without your brain hurting from trying to decipher what is going on (Wuthering Heights anyone?). Bottom line, I really enjoyed the book, and I know others will too."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I usually don't expect 150-year-old novels of ideas (and this is the quintessential novel of ideas) to be page turners, but Stowe is to be commended for writing what is first of all a great story. Never mind all the political sermonizing she does here -- and there's plenty of it -- this is above all a gripping story. Every time I expected a chapter to head into tedious territory, I was pleasantly surprised. Even though everyone knows what will happen to Uncle Tom -- this being a slave narrative written by a Northern abolitionist before the Civil War, after all, -- I couldn't help but continue wanting to read on. This was the second best selling book of the 19th century not only because it was highly controversial, but also because it's a well-told story, and I say \\"told\\" because Stowe herself often claimed that God dictated it to her. And it seems to be more spoken than written, especially with her frequent direct addresses to the reader.While there may be something to Stowe's claim of divine inspiration, given its impact on American history, the book is certainly not without its faults. The character of Eva, for instance, is unlike that of any normal living child. She's a saintly caricature. And her never-ending conclusion drips with maudlin sentiment exaggerated to Biblical proportions. Similarly, Uncle Tom doesn't bear resemblance to anyone I've ever met. But most troublesome is Stowe's romanticism of the black characters. She lumps them together and stereotypes them in one way or another. Clearly she means no harm; just the opposite is her desired effect. But it sometimes comes at the price of preachy condescension. They may be positive sterotypes, but they are stereotypes nonetheless, and they weaken her story.Having read and enjoyed the highly-acclaimed and abundantly-awarded \\"The Known World\\" by Edward P. Jones, it dawned on me that Stowe really had a more thorough understanding of even the most subtle effects that the institution of slavery had on blacks and whites both northern and southern alike even with ideal slave masters. She even appears to foresee the differences of opinion that would later crystallize in Martin Luther King's brand of civil disobediance and the more militant versions advocated by the Nation of Islam and Black Panthers, juxtaposed in the diverging paths of the quiet, pious and tolerant Tom with that of the more directly oppositional George. She criticizes neither, though she seems to favor Tom's path, knowing full well that Uncle Tom is unique, and his abundance of Christian tolerance isn't likely to be found in the general population -- nor is it a path she desires for most slaves. She would rather that slaves simply escaped. She also seems to advocate their creation of a country of their own, taking Liberia as a model.Still, further, Stowe is an early feminist, and as a result, the characters that are most interesting here are the women. Ophelia comes nearest of all the characters in the book to walking off the page. And Cassie, a finely complex creation, though introduced only in the last 120 pages or so, nearly steals the climax.And what of the villains? They, too, are caricatures to be sure. To me at least, Simon Legree left something to be desired. He occasionally comes off as more of a buffoon rather than the Satan you know him to be deep down. But Marie St. Claire -- again, the woman -- is as clear a picture of selfcenteredness as Scrooge is of miserliness.Hemingway said that all modern American literature dates back to Huckleberry Finn, but I think he needed to look about 30 years earlier than Twain to Stowe. Uncle Tom's Cabin is a masterpiece of American fiction; if it is not the Great American Novel, it is, at least in terms of sales, impact and literary merit, the Great American Novel of Ideas."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"HOW DID A CHARACTER WHO PREFERRED TO FACE DEATH RATHER THAN TORTURE AND BETRAY OTHER SLAVES BECOME THE SYMBOL OF 'JUDAS-HOOD' FOR BLACK AMERICA ? I wonder how many blacks --then or now-- would refrain from going against other blacks if they knew it could mean their being beaten or killed ? In view of all the black drug dealers willing to sell drugs to black children and run away dads and other betrayers, I don't think many.The original character was a hero of non-violent resistance. But, militants have often seen the such as a weakness; not a strength --attacking Martin and others. And, they are wrong.The name Uncle Tom should be used for blacks of great character and not for blacks of no character.

Still, this book was a hideous experience. Once you get past the first hundred and fifty pages the plot picks up enough to give the sheer boredom a minor respite, but the characters are about as flat as anything imaginable. Little Eva in particular I was ready to strangle, with hair or without, by the time she up and died. It's historically interesting as a spark to abolitionism and to the beginning of the Civil War, but as a novel it's dreadful. I would warn you not to read it, but you probably have already or will soon for a U.S. history class, in which case please accept my deepest condolences."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Uncle Tom is probably the most important single book written in the United States of America. No one is really familiar with American culture, literature, relgion, and history if she or he has not read Uncle Tom.To understand this book, I would urge people to consult Eric J. Sundquist's book New Essays on Uncle Tom's Cabin (The American Novel) and Jane Tompkin's Sensational Designs. The 19th Century world and reader that Stowe aimed at read and understood things so differently, that you will miss much without knowing how to look at this book the way Stowe wrote to them and the way they read.This book has a broad purpose: literary to decide what is wrong with the entire world and present an answer. If you follow the sweep of the book you will find Stowe takes on everything from whether the issues of the 1848 revolutions can be resolved on the side of Democracy, to the question of marital relations amogn the free and the white. The issue of slavery is not the book's only focus. It is, in fact, the solution.Stowe's real thesis here is that American Chattel slavery is the number one evil in the world, that this evil corrupts every institution in society North and South and corrupts far beyond the borders of the United States, and that no compromise with it or avoidance of it is possible.To Stowe, slavery is an abomination not just because of the cruelty, savagery, exploitation, and degradation involved, but above all, it is an abomination against God, the most unChrist-like behavior possible.Thus the relgious solution she offers is to become more Christlike in your opposition to slavery and to finally undergrow the Christic experience of dying for your sins and being reborn in Jesus Christ. That's right, in Stowe's time evangelical Christianity, rather than being a fob for right-wing politics, was practiced by some of the militant and serious opponents of slavery.Stowe creates figures that are Christlike who like Christ die rather than yield to sin and influence the others in their faith. The supreme figure is of course Uncle Tom. Uncle Tom, as a a pejorative, comes not from this novel, but from the Tom shows that blossomed in the late 19th century which were a presentation of a mock version of this story with racist minstrel like charicatures of the African American characters.In this book, Uncle Tom is a physically majestic, heroic, dignified person, whose faith and dignity are never corrupted, whose death is shown as a parallel to that of Christ in the resurrection of the souls of all around him required to eliminate Slavery. If he is passive, never disobeys his masters, and seems to have not much of a material interest of his own in life, it is because to Stowe this a reflection of his Christic nature.No doubt at best Stowe sees him as a \\"noble savage\\" at Best. There is no doubt if one reads this book and even more clearly STowe's Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin which provided documentation for this book's depiction of slavery, that it is clear that Stowe did not believe African Americans were equal to whites. Her then-current immigrationist views are expressed in the way the one intelligent independently acting Black couple presented here leave the US for Canada once they escape slavery.Yet, this book accomplished the purpose it had. It galvanized millions of Americans and more millions around the world to dramatically oppose slavery. Uncle Tom was one of the first true international best sellers. In a smaller country, where literacy was lower, and when many people bought books through private libraries where families shared books and the book was often read to family gatherings rather than by one person, Uncle Tom sold two hundred thousand copies in its first year and sold a million copies between its publication and the civil war.Stowe was honest in her afterward and in other writings to say that her description of slavery in Uncle Tom is much prettier and more nicer than slavery was. She believed an accurate depiction of slavery--Stowe had lived in Cincinatti on the board with slaving Kentucky and traveled through the South--would be so revolting that her target audience of Northern whites would not read this book.Her book launched a torrent of responses from white southerners as could be expected. However, the popularity of her book encouraged white authors, but especially Black authors to write antislavery books that responded to Stowe. Some of the foundations of Black American literature by authors like Frederick Douglass, William Wells Brown, Harriet Jacobs, and Martin Delany are essentially response to Uncle Tom.Perhaps the most dramatic is Delany's Blake or the Huts of America whose character is a double to Uncle Tom. However, Delany's hero does not submit to being sold \\"down the river.\\" He instead runs away and travels throughout the US following the same course as the travels in Uncle Tom showing how slave conditions are so much worse than Stowe showed. Finished with that business, Blake leaves the United States for Cuba where he becomes part of a group of Afro-Cubans unwilling to suffer like Christ and Uncle Tom. Like the current leaders of Cuba, they start to organize an international revolution of Slaves and the oppressed!"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I had to read this book for a class I took in college on the Civil War. Out of the whole class, reading this book was THE BEST experience. I rave about it to anyone who will listen and believe it is one of the best books ever written.

It is one of my favorite books although it does sadden me to know that people where treated badly. That African American families where torn appart for money. This book also talks of compassion and respect that some owners of slaves had for their slaves. It does make one reflect about how we all treat each other. A really sad and good book"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Uncle Tom's Cabin was written in 1850 when America was in the middle of a period of religious fervor with fire and brimstone preaching common. Among those leading this movement was Lyman Beecher, father of both Harriet Beecher Stowe and Henry Ward Beecher (see my review of his biography The Most Famous Man in America)Transcendentalism was in flower, telling Americans that there was truth to be found in an emotional relationship to the nature and the senses. Sentimentality was at a peak. The Civil War years dripped with it as much as they did with blood.Revivals were commonly held during which a Protestant Christian preacher would build up the emotional state of the crowd until it reached an almost orgasmic state. The kind of shallow effort at this that we see on TV these days gives no hint of the depth of passion experienced at these revivals when people could temporarily lose their minds in contemplation of the divine.Uncle Tom's Cabin is certainly an effort against slavery but reading it reminded me of a revival. The plot starts out on a farm in Kentucky where the slaves are well treated by the owner. Then as the novel develops, the emotional intensity does as well until, in the end, we have a Christ-like figure (Uncle Tom) offering up his soul and asking forgiveness for the evil Simon Legree even as Legree is beating him to death. Along the way, Biblical passages become more frequently inserted in the text. The reader is aroused to a peak of moral indignation - how could such a barbaric system exist! How could any Christian allow it to continue?This technique worked magic on the sensibilities of the time. This book was a huge bestseller that virtually everyone (in the North) had read within a year of publication. It is filled with characters that represent every point of view on the issue of slavery, pro and con. It frequently mentions the Fugitive Slave Act that required Northerners to help apprehend and return escaped slaves, a bitter pill for the North to swallow.Stowe is eager to promote Christianity as one would expect from someone with her upbringing. A repeated scene is of a character asking how God could be so cruel, absent or indifferent. In response a character will talk of the damnation that awaits those who do evil while paradise awaits the good. This fear of the Judgment Day is as central to the book as slavery and would appeal to religious readers while attempting to confound unbelievers.Stowe's characterizations range from the realistic, such as Augustine St. Clare and his wife Marie, to others who seem either simple-minded (almost all the black characters) or unbelievably righteous as is Eva, the fair haired and frail child who embodies virtue, self-effacement and goodness, played against the willful black Topsy who has no known relatives and claims she was never born.To a modern reader some of the dialog is almost nauseating in self-righteousness and piety but the plot is carried along seamlessly with the single exception of a short chapter near the end that serves to quickly jump to Canada to bring the reader up to date on escaped slaves Eliza and George, otherwise almost forgotten after being left in limbo early in the book.Black characters are almost cartoons and racial characterizations abound - \\"wooly headed\\", \\"sons of Afric\\", etc. It's clear that though Stowe believes blacks are just as human as whites, they are on a lower level mentally. For her time, even this was a big advance. It's easy to see how African-Americans can use the name \\"uncle tom\\" in a derogatory way - since Tom turns the other cheek with a regularity and predictability that meekly accepts the way things are.The book, like Christianity, is riven in this way. If Heaven is the only thing that matters then why should anyone care how people treat each other in this world? Why not just take things on the chin and smile until your time is up?Uncle Tom's Cabin is a good read. Though almost as verbose as the novels of Dickens, it should be no problem for modern readers. Like most classics, everyone has heard of it but too few have read it."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I have a love / hate relationship with the novel. Some days, I think that Stowe is unforgivably racist and cares only about preserving the souls of white people who are forfeiting their place in heaven by owning slaves. On other days, I am really impressed by the way that Stowe is working within many of the discourses of her time and creating a radical message about why slavery is unchristian, unpatriotic and unwomanly.Of course, everyone knows that Uncle Tom's Cabin was the best-selling book of its time, outselling even the Bible. It sold over 1,000,000 copies, and, for every copy sold, about 10 people read the book. For every person who read the book, about 50 saw a dramatic adaptation (possibly one of the versions by Aiken or Conway, which took away much of Stowe's message and retained mostly the melodrama and racial stereotypes). Nineteenth century America was steeped in Uncle Tom's Cabin. It was the first book to have spin-off products that are common for films today - actions figures, tea sets, dolls, board games, card games, sheet music. Uncle Tom's Cabin permeated American culture. It is speciously reported that, upon meeting Stowe during the Civil War, President Lincoln said, \\"So you're the little woman who wrote the book that caused this great war.\\"There are so many things to fault Stowe for. In our politically correct culture, all of the faults of Stowe's novel are incredibly salient: she co-opts many racial stereotypes from the minstrel stage. Influenced by romantic racialism, she sees all blacks as simple, docile, childlike, and innately Christian. She sees people who are bi-racial, on the other hand, as intelligent and discontent with their position in slavery because of the \\"Anglo-Saxon blood\\" that is flowing through their veins.But I think that what is important to focus on in Uncle Tom's Cabin is the way that Stowe created an inherently domestic attack on slavery by associating slavery with the public sphere of economy and capitalism and slaves with the domestic sphere of womanhood and Christianity.Stowe was writing during the time of the cult of true womanhood. In the nineteenth century, women were supposed to be (sexually) pure, (religiously) pious, domestic (staying in the house / kitchen), and submissive (to men). Stowe believed in these prescriptive categories for women (as you can see through the characters of Mrs. Shelby and Mrs. Bird). To her, the best people in the world are mothers and Christians, and Christ himself is a mother-figure; he is pure, pious, domestic, and submissive. In Uncle Tom's Cabin, Eva and Uncle Tom are both Christ figures and mother figures because mother and Christ are interchangeable. They are the best type of people in the world. The Quaker Settlement, where Rachel Halliday gentle nudges her family to work in harmony in a Christian matriarchy is Stowe's vision of a millennial utopia.Slavery is evil for Stowe because it is the opposite of Christianity. Christianity is domestic and spiritual, and slavery is a part of the public sphere; it is mundane. Appealing to white Northern women, Stowe shows how slavery creates problems for women: it separates mothers from their children and wives from their husbands. It is bad for the slaveholders because it corrupts them morally. Stowe also attacks the North for their culpability in Slavery. Through the character of Miss Ophelia, she shows that Northerners, while the want slaves to be free, do not want to come near black people with a ten foot pole. They have a visceral reaction to blackness. Through the Fugitive Slave Law, Northerners are helping Southerners to return blacks to slavery.Lobbying for the inclusion of Uncle Tom's Cabin in the literary canon, Jane Tompkins says of the novel in Sensational Design, that it \\"retells the culture's central religious myth - the story of the crucifixion - in terms of the nation's greatest political conflict - slavery - and of its most cherished social beliefs - the sanctity of motherhood and the family.\\"I have read several editions of this novel, and I would highly recommend the Norton Critical edition, edited by Elizabeth Ammons (Tufts University) or the new Annotated edition, edited and annotated by Henry Lewis Gates, Jr. (Harvard University). Like all Norton editions, Ammons's version includes important contextual information as well as some of the seminal scholarly essays about the novel. In the annotated version, Gates gives two lengthy introductions and useful annotations. One thing that he mentions throughout the annotations is the way that Stowe depicts Tom's relationship with Chloe. According to Gates he seem not to be very affected by their separation; when he reminisces about the past, he thinks about the white children that he misses, George Shelby and Eva St. Clare."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"By the time I had got to page 47 I was hooked!I found the language a little slower to read than normal, having to get used to the speech of the slaves being written as it sounded, but I actually got to quite like that.Harriet Beecher Stowe writes as if she's the narrator and I could almost see her at the side of the stage inviting us to see the next scene.As we follow the lives of Uncle Tom, Eliza and George, the many people they encounter and whose lives they touch, and whose lives touched them, I cried and I smiled and I felt very humble. This is a very moving book yet oddly without being sentimental and that is to the author's credit. She writes well and makes every character very real and their situations both heartwrenching yet uplifting. A book that not only gives a valuble insight into life at the time in 'Kentuck' and what it was like to be 'sold down the river'....but one that gave me a hope and uplifting that I'd like to stay with me for some time to come."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"This is the best book I have read during the first 34 years of my life. Tom, the symbolic messiah, manifests hope, love, patience and perseverance. He shares his soul unselfishly with all who will receive. He is quite possibly the strongest person of character I have encountered. In regards to the books commentary on slavery: it was a strong abolitionist paper in the 1850s, but now it is considered racist by some. However, I believer the characterization of African Americans was much kinder in this book than by the media and society as a whole now."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"A truly inspiring story, told with humour, with keen insight, and passionate indignation at the plight of slaves in the United States. Earnestly demonstrating the evils of slavery, Stowe introduces us to a plethora of characters, all powerfully and humanly realized. Uncle Tom, Eliza, Topsey, Miss Ophelia, George, Simon Legree all come alive for us, and their triumphs and sufferings are all the more poignant for it. Stowe approaches the subject realistically. She never once makes clumsy generalizations - every situation between slave and master, and between environment and slave is evaluated according to its individual circumstances. One uniform idea emerges, however, and that is the slavery is morally wrong, and is therefore destructive, not only to the dignity, the integrity, and the very soul of the slaves themselves, but also to those who own them. The argument Stowe makes for this idea is as intelligent as it is powerful.The book has its flaws. The plot clearly indicates its origins as a serial, and Stowe does tend to belabour her point needlessly in some passages. Still, these flaws do little to hinder the flow of this powerful narrative. (5/5)"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Uncle Tom's Cabin is one of the best American novels written to date. It is a wonderful fictional tale about two slaves, Eliza and Tom, who follow two very different paths during their lives as slaves. They both live in Kentucky under the same master. As their master goes in to debt, he is forced to sell them to a slave trader. Fearful of loosing her child, Eliza takes the very dangerous path and runs away with fellow slaves leading to a bloody skirmish with a group of drunken bounty hunters. Tom on the other hand, chooses to follow his master's orders and get sold into the Deep South. By following his faith in God he believes God will guide hi through his life as a slave. Harriet Beecher Stowe uses her descriptive style of writing to capture the reader's imagination, and show them the horrors of slavery. One interesting topic the author brings up all throughout the novel is the idea of how can a southern slave holder feel right even after they have read the bible and how their slaves know passages that describe their right to freedom. Another great thing the author does in this novel is give a great ending by telling what happened to each of the different characters after they have ended their lives as slaves. I think this book is a classic American novel, however I believe its message is shallow and cannot compare to that of the Jungle's or even or some of Jack London's or John Steinbeck's works. For these reasons I giving Uncle Tom's Cabin a 4.5, but it still deserves five stars. This book is a must buy for every American."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Never has a fiction book brought me to anger, laughter, sadness, joy and tears as this book did when I first read it 10 years ago. 10 years later, I am still feeling the emotional impact of the story.This book is not only about slavery; it's about the relationships between people, the psychological mind of a person who has been taught that they cannot think, the innocent wisdom of children.The novel is an easy read. The themes are not simple nor are they easy to digest for some but the emotional power of the story truly carries the reader through a historical whirlwind of justice and ethics."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I wasn't going to read it because of the bad reviews I read about it.

You must remember that Mrs. Stowe uses the language that was common at the time. It is part of the story and how one group of people viewed another group of people.This story highlights the humanity of all people, regardless of race, creed, or culture. For me, the brutality of the bad owners really came alive. The fact that a slave owner could do anything he wanted with a female slave was brought home to me. I never really thought about it before.

As someone else mentioned, the misnomer of \\"Uncle Tom\\" being a bad thing is totally incorrect. Uncle Tom is a hero. I wish I had not waited until I was 50 years old to read this.

It gives you an insight into the plight of the slaves.You cant help wanting a happy ending for each of the characters"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Uncle Tom's Cabin, or, Life among the Lowly is an 1852 anti-slavery sentimental novel by Harriet Beecher Stowe, which she wrote as a response to the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. This novel is sometimes considered a contributing factor to the start of the American Civil War, as it brought many unpleasant aspects of slave life and the slave trade into the public awareness.The novel's events center around two slaves: Eliza, who attempts to flee to Canada with her son, who has just been sold, and Tom, who has also been sold, but who goes along subserviently. And while Uncle Tom's Cabin certainly is about Tom, it is much less about Eliza than it is about the responses of the other characters she comes in contact with.One of Uncle Tom's Cabin's main themes is the triumph of Christian love over evil, and for overtness, power and sincerity, the novel's Christian message can scarcely be topped. Eva is an obvious Christ figure, and Tom becomes one as well, but Tom is particularly noteworthy because he's one of the most eternity-minded characters in all of literature. He endures everything, as Saint Paul said, for the sake of the gospel (which he is always quick to share) - his stated reason for remaining in cruel bondage when presented with a chance of escape is to minister to the other slaves. Because of his selfless love and inner strength, he is the book's most admirable character.(It's interesting (and too bad) how the term \\"Uncle Tom\\" - now used to negatively describe a black who is subservient to whites - has become so pejorative. Stowe's Tom is a loving, strong-willed, eternity-minded character. But lax copyright laws in the nineteenth century allowed for unauthorized diluted and altered stage versions of the story (called \\"Tom shows,\\" some of which were even pro-slavery), and many people came to know Tom as a stereotypical minstrel buffoon - certainly a great number more people saw the stage dramas than read the books.)Uncle Tom's Cabin is a sentimental novel (in the literary sense), and Stowe goes for the heartstrings at every opportunity. Though the reader may not at any time, many of Stowe's characters burst into tears at the slightest provocation. Stowe herself is a preachily-involved narrator, and nothing the author has to say is handled subtlely. While Stowe's many characters debate various \\"biblical\\" perspectives on slavery, the narrator's (and the author's) views are never in doubt, and she laments to an even greater extent America's burgeoning disregard for the Bible.From a literary standpoint, Uncle Tom's Cabin is largely unimpressive, and sometimes it's a downright mess. If the novel wasn't so socially and politically relevant, it would have been lost in the mists of time with countless other sappy, mediocre novels.In the first place, there are about twice as many characters as there need to be, far too many of whom are named Tom, Henry, or George. And it isn't always easy to pin down just who the main characters are, because conscientiously-developed characters leave after a few chapters, others arrive, and some characters who are obviously key to Stowe's tale (Eliza, in particular), vanish for a hundred pages at a time, while others don't debut until halfway through the book. Many characters are flat, one-dimensional caricatures, present only to offer a particular point of view on a topic. In doing so, Stowe brings the reader into contact with every conceivable position on slavery and human rights, but it doesn't make for a particularly believable story.Secondly, the book's goings-on are equally contrived. The reader can see the hand of Stowe on every major plot point, particularly at the end, where she attempts to tie up matters with a series of heartwarming but preposterous coincidences.But this doesn't mean that Uncle Tom's Cabin is horribly written; that's simply not the case. Sometimes Stowe produces a very fine turn of phrase, and certain scenes are well done and do produce the intended emotional response. And many of the book's moral and philosophical debates hold the reader's interest because Stowe has clearly thought through the issues and educated herself on the various arguments and viewpoints.So while Uncle Tom's Cabin is not very impressive as literature, it remains important (and worth reading) because of its message and the role it played in a key era of American history."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I admit it, I got this because it was free and I had a brand new Kindle.

You're probably thinking - what? How can a mere 544 pages help cause something that big?Before we talk about the actual book we have to take into consideration the time period. 1852 - two years after the Compromise of 1850 and the dreadful Fugitive Slave Act which forbade Northerner's to help runaway slaves from the South. Of course, the Northerner's saw the inhumanity in the act and, as shown in the novel, most refused to abide. One argument the Southern states made were that their own slave institution was not as bad as the Notherner's \\"wage slave\\" laborers in factory systems.The Second Great Awakening had recently swept through the nation, and religion played a big part in people's lives in that era. Harriett Beecher Stowe knew the big impact of religion and incorporated it into her works - there's almost no page in the book where God isn't invoked. Throughout the book, I even felt my own slightly agnostic views wavering in the hands of Stowe's pious characters and inspiring dialogues.The book shows two very different aspects of slavery - through the lives of Uncle Tom Eliza Harris. They both start off as slaves for the Shelby's, kind owners who have unfortunately fallen into debt and must sell some of their slaves. Eliza's beautiful and talented five year old son Harry and the pious, honest Uncle Tom are sold to a slave trader. This is where the two part ways - Uncle Tom bids a tearful goodbye to his loving wife and kids and leaves with the slave trader, while Eliza decides she'd rather risk it and run away with her son rather than let him be sold. The Shelby's, as they are very fond of their slaves, promise they'll buy Uncle Tom back when they can.We follow Eliza and Harry as she journeys up North to Canada where she can be free. Eliza's husband George, is also on the run from his abusive master. Now, they're both fugitives. Her journey is both physically and mentally challenging, as she struggles to keep her son alive while hiding from the authorities. With the help of many Northerners who refuse to comply to the Fugitive Slave Act, Eliza is on her way to freedom.Uncle Tom is first sold to a rich gentleman who treats his slaves kindly. His daughter, Evangeline, is the perfect emblem of an angel, a sweet, caring child who understands the plight of the slaves, but doesn't understand the evil in the world. She turns out to be too good to stay in this world, and she falls victim to a deadly disease, along with her father. Eva's death brings the end of Uncle Tom's luck - and he's sold once again, but this time it's down South - and the deeper South, the worse the slave life. Even through all his hardships, Uncle Tom remains Christian at heart, never losing faith.After reading the book, it wasn't hard for me to understand why it caused such a riot. Stowe shows how Southern slavery could never be a better system than a Northern \\"wage slave\\" - Northerner's aren't split apart from their families like Uncle Tom; nor are their futures dependent on luck or the whims of a master, but mainly, wage slaves can still try to reach the prospect of the \\"American Dream,\\" while Uncle Tom and Eliza never could.I've read many books concerning slavery and the 19th century, including Huckleberry Finn, and I've read many books that are so obsolete they seem irrelevant, like Ivanhoe. Uncle Tom's Cabin, on the other hand, struck a nerve in me; because, although we all haven't experienced the type of slavery mentioned in Uncle Tom's Cabin, we all go through hard times, and we have all been slaves to something at some point in our lives. Whether you're a Christian or an atheist, whether you read for pleasure or for the grade, whether you're a Northerner in the 1850s, or a tired, stressed teenager in the 21st century...this book is worth the 544 pages."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Excellent classic which take us to the core of the slavery in the US at that time.

The vocabulary is a little difficult at times but if you have a dictionary handy then your all good."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I recently read Uncle Tom's Cabin for the first time after hearing remarks in passing on NPR that Uncle Tom was a very different character from the stereotype that currently exists. Harriet Beecher Stowe is an excellent writer. She is vehemently anti-slavery and sprinkles her story with editorial pleas to the reader. But I tried to understand who Uncle Tom was, and found my thoughts evolving as I went along. The book contained characters who were \\"Uncle Toms\\" but he was not one of them. At first I thought he was just a simple minded person who \\"went with the flow.\\" But as the story evolved, I could see that he was more than that. He was kind and thoughtful to whites, and tried to see the best in them. But he was also kind and thoughtful to blacks, and tried to see the best in them as well. He was, I realized, kind and thoughtful to other human beings in general.But as I read further, I came to see that the key to Uncle Tom was his powerful faith in redemption through Christ. He believed that whites, blacks, slaveholders and slaves should reach out and accept the Grace of God through Christ. Interestingly, although Uncle Tom's Cabin is an anti-slavery philippic, Uncle Tom himself does not denounce slavery. He would like to be free, but even more important is the embrace of Christ. Once Christ has been truly embraced, slavery becomes a non-sequitur that fades like mist before Christ's shining light.My view of \\"Uncle Tom\\" had undergone quite an interesting conceptual evolution. However, the transfiguration was not yet complete. Thinking further about the course of events, I realized that Uncle Tom was worthy of beatification, if not canonization. His profound faith converted and saved unrepentant sinners who were on the tortuous road to Hell. At the end of the novel, he fell into the clutches of a slaveholder who was the devil incarnate. The devil tempted him as he had tempted Christ in the desert, but here, rather than mastery of the world, the promise was of better treatment (if you become my overseer you can drink whiskey with me and lord over the other slaves.) As with Christ in the wilderness, Uncle Tom replied, \\"Get thee behind me, Satan!\\" For this, he was delivered up to Satan's minions where he suffered abuse, torture and death.In death, Uncle Tom imparts his final grace. His injuries were cared for by a slave woman who had been horribly abused by Satan, lost all faith and turned to the path of darkness. She risked her life to do this and in the process rediscovered her faith and her salvation. In effect, she was reborn. The minions who delivered the blows cowered before his grace and were converted, like the Roman soldiers at the foot of the Cross. Finally, Uncle Tom was found on death's door by the son of the kind master who was forced to sell him \\"down the river\\" at the beginning of the book. He had come to purchase Uncle Tom back and return him to his slave wife and children, back at home. In Uncle Tom's dying words, this young man came to see that even kindly treatment in slavery is wrong. He freed all the remaining slaves on his return home, and set upon a new path of Christian righteousness.Uncle Tom's Cabin is a remarkable book that can be read and interpreted on many different levels. The book should serve as an important touchstone for discussions of race and religion even today."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I started this book slowly because it was definately more of an intense read than the usual sci-fi, fantasy or romance I enjoy, but soon I could not put it down!

I enjoyed the story plot of this book. I especially loved the chapters on Eliza and her boy and how they ran away from their master. I actually thought this book might be boring but it was very interesting and shows one what slavery was really like and what happened in those days. The story plot is that Eliza and her boy, Harry, are running from their master and the trader because their master sold Harry to the trader. Eliza is just trying to save Harry from the trader taking him away from her. Eliza's husband, a slave for another master, is also running away from his master.

I wanted to have a better understanding of the term &quot;UNCLE TOM&quot; which is used so freely in my culture. I have mixed feelings about this book. Notabley, the time in which it was written and the message the author is trying to convey. I will say that I have a better understanding of life for the slaves and their owner back then. I have even seen some comparative situations in this day in age. I don't know if I would recommend this book to anyone, I would suggest to the next reader to prepared to understand the dialect of the characters.

What an amazing and well-written book! This book is very powerful. It made me cry. I also enjoy writing and I realize what an amazing story it was and still is. It is also a lasting controvery. Many people feel that teachers should not make their students read this book. Much like &quot;Huck Finn,&quot; people feel that it is unreasonable to put a child through emotional stress and to put emphasis on race in a classroom. They feel it is belittling the child and I suppose it is. Despite this, it is truly a classic novel. Unlike &quot;Huck Finn,&quot; this novel puts emphasis on the good in people, no matter what their race or beliefs. This is what I got out of it.

So many of the characters' names are a part of our vocabulary, but, too often, with a distorted meaning.

I personally am one to search for good in the world in all that I do, as I feel without good there is nothing. This book is good. It describes the feelings and opinions of the people during the times of slavery, both Northern and Southern white, and the slaves themselves. The characters are great, from the christlike Evangeline to the devil sold soul Legree. And the messages of the book are so simple, as the messages of the Bible itself.

No doubt, Stowe was unable to write free of the influence of her own racism. But, this book deserves to be read--especially now, at this time of year, when Christians celebrate Easter and Jews Passover. Personally, it has given me an idea, in as much as a white woman living in 1999 may have, of the pure montstrosity of slavery. As a Jew, I am gratful to have finished this book in time for my Passover Seder. I do not think I will ever think of the Exodus story in the same way again. I think the entire country should be reading and discusing this amazing book. I'll be talking about it at my Seder. I would welcome e-mail from other readers.

I can't say enough about Uncle Tom's Cabin. At times, it is difficult to continue reading due to the long winded conversations.

I would recommend it to anyone. The plot is genius."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Uncle Tom's Cabin was written in an empathetic tone, forcing the American public to view black slaves as human beings, at least for reading the novel. A Southern slave owner who read the book would be compelled to slip into the lives of his slaves, perhaps unwillingly, and view the institution of slavery from the viewpoint of a slave. In this respect, Stowe was successful. She appealed to the maternal emotions of her readers and characterized the blacks with qualities that were similar to those of innocent children. Black characters were also portrayed as being overwhelming loyal, clever and pious. For the most part, many of the white women in the novel act as a moral authority, compensating for the &quot;sins&quot; of their husbands, fathers, and brothers. Both sets of characters were exaggerated which helped to arouse the emotions of the novels readers. Characters were either exceedingly virtuous or awfully depraved. Paragons of Christian values can be found in Uncle Tom and the angel-like Little Eva. While the moral opposite of these characters can be found in the less agreeable characters of Simon Legree and Mr. Haley. These characterizations made for a powerful argument against slavery as Stowe had created a tone of victimization. The novels tone was important because at the time many people did consider slaves to be an inferior race, most readers had never before realized that these plantation hands were actually victims of a primarily white society."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I read this book originally to understand what was meant by the statement: &quot;He's an Uncle Tom.&quot; This was usually said as a derogatoy statement. After reading the book I don't think this statement has been used correctly. As a Christian who loves the Lord I have to rate it as one of the best books that every Christian should read. I guess the derogatory statement comes from what looks like a black man being in willing submission to his master. From a Christian's point of view it is actually a man of God being in submission to His God.As it was originally written to expose the life of slavery the book obviously does that very well. I heard that Abraham Lincoln said to Harriett Beecher Stowe upon meeting her, &quot;So, you're the women responsible for starting the Civil War.&quot; Her account of slavery is vividally brutal.With these two aspects in mind I can say that this book has a tremendous affect on my thinking. The horrors of slavery along w/the reality of God working in the lives of both 'slave &amp; free' are what remain in my thoughts. After reading Uncle Tom's Cabin I'm reminded that we Christians are to have the heart of a servant following Jesus' example."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"This is one book that I just never got around to reading during my younger years. This is an incredibly good Christian novel, which it is never described by anyone as. But that is what it is; a novel lessons in what it is to be a strong Christian. It is ironic the the term, \\"Uncle Tom\\" has been fixed in our American stereotype as an African American that is a traitor to their own culture. But the term is anything but that, Tom was a man that had strong Christian values. If anything, it should be considered a complement to be called an \\"Uncle Tom\\", there just is no other conclusion to come to after reading this book. And I am African American. Harriet Beecher Stowe did an excellent job of writing this novel, it has multiple plots; each having their own consistent Christian values described. Once you start reading this novel it is hard to put it down. Some times the dialect used is a little difficult to understand the meaning ...so I also purchased the children's version to read as a reference (both where free Kindle versions). This is a book that every person should read, it helped to start the Civil War and was translated in a number of different languages and read across the globe. It is a very, very good book!"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"It is one of the most interesting books that I've ever read.

From sympathy, to ire, to joy. This opened my naive eyes to what evils humans are capable of, but at the same time proved to me what spiritual and god-like creatures we have the potential to be. The plot follows several lives, all affected by slavery. The hero of the story is a simple minded Uncle Tom who sticks to his righteous christian ways through all the adversity he encounters as a slave. The symbolism and satire in this book make it all the more interesting and meaningful. I am only sorry I don't know more about the politics and characters at the time because Stowe makes reference to incidences in her time period. Stowe's views on the issue of slavery are excellently expressed. She doesn't come off as preaching, or arguing, merely objectively stating the facts.(Yeah right) By using sarcasm, satire, symbolism, and religious teachings, she kept the book interesting and to the point. Every word she wrote further supports her beliefs. In the end the overall mood gets a bit gloomy, but the finale is magnificent."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Tolstoy said that, I didn't. And I don't give stars away lightly. This book is a real humdinger! A sort of primer on slavery in the modern age with a lot of Christian moralizing thrown in, the book is nonetheless powerful, at least as involving and occasionally as violent as &quot;Wuthering Heights,&quot; and every bit as unrelenting. Besides a ripping good story, what can today's reader find? A haunting case made for never assuming you are in the right. Just look at all those people back then who said slavery was a natural thing. How wrong they were. That much is obvious to us now. But what about today's controversies? To future generations how obviously wrong can we be (1) about abortion, (2) about Clinton's impeachment, or (3, my favorite) how we are turning our back on injustices in Rwanda, Kosovo, and Chechniya. What will history say about us if we turn out to be on the wrong side of any of these issues? Oh, and please meet the real Uncle Tom -- what nobility, and not a shuffle in sight. And find out where &quot;shiftless&quot; really came from. Another reader suggested this book be required reading for all American citizens. Really not a bad idea..."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"This book was recommended to me and it did not disappoint.

However, from a literary standpoint, the novel is merely average. Stowe is to be admired for her boldness and willingness to write a novel that deals so honestly with the evils of slavery. My critique here is that Stowe's mechanics and style are weak and make for clumsy reading. This book is one that I recommend, but don't expect a masterpiece in terms of literary prowess--do expect a moving depiction of the reprehensible abuse and mistreatment of slaves that will stay with you."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"A central text in American Literature and History, January 7, 2005Reviewer: Tony Thomas (North Miami, FL USA) - See all my reviewsUncle Tom is probably the most important single book written in the United States of America. No one is really familiar with American culture, literature, relgion, and history if she or he has not read Uncle Tom.To understand this book, I would urge people to consult Eric J. Sundquist's book New Essays on Uncle Tom's Cabin (The American Novel) and Jane Tompkin's Sensational Designs. The 19th Century world and reader that Stowe aimed at read and understood things so differently, that you will miss much without knowing how to look at this book the way Stowe wrote to them and the way they read.This book has a broad purpose: literary to decide what is wrong with the entire world and present an answer. If you follow the sweep of the book you will find Stowe takes on everything from whether the issues of the 1848 revolutions can be resolved on the side of Democracy, to the question of marital relations amogn the free and the white. The issue of slavery is not the book's only focus. It is, in fact, the solution.Stowe's real thesis here is that American Chattel slavery is the number one evil in the world, that this evil corrupts every institution in society North and South and corrupts far beyond the borders of the United States, and that no compromise with it or avoidance of it is possible.To Stowe, slavery is an abomination not just because of the cruelty, savagery, exploitation, and degradation involved, but above all, it is an abomination against God, the most unChrist-like behavior possible.Thus the relgious solution she offers is to become more Christlike in your opposition to slavery and to finally undergrow the Christic experience of dying for your sins and being reborn in Jesus Christ. That's right, in Stowe's time evangelical Christianity, rather than being a fob for right-wing politics, was practiced by some of the militant and serious opponents of slavery.Stowe creates figures that are Christlike who like Christ die rather than yield to sin and influence the others in their faith. The supreme figure is of course Uncle Tom. Uncle Tom, as a a pejorative, comes not from this novel, but from the Tom shows that blossomed in the late 19th century which were a presentation of a mock version of this story with racist minstrel like charicatures of the African American characters.In this book, Uncle Tom is a physically majestic, heroic, dignified person, whose faith and dignity are never corrupted, whose death is shown as a parallel to that of Christ in the resurrection of the souls of all around him required to eliminate Slavery. If he is passive, never disobeys his masters, and seems to have not much of a material interest of his own in life, it is because to Stowe this a reflection of his Christic nature.No doubt at best Stowe sees him as a \\"noble savage\\" at Best. There is no doubt if one reads this book and even more clearly STowe's Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin which provided documentation for this book's depiction of slavery, that it is clear that Stowe did not believe African Americans were equal to whites. Her then-current immigrationist views are expressed in the way the one intelligent independently acting Black couple presented here leave the US for Canada once they escape slavery.Yet, this book accomplished the purpose it had. It galvanized millions of Americans and more millions around the world to dramatically oppose slavery. Uncle Tom was one of the first true international best sellers. In a smaller country, where literacy was lower, and when many people bought books through private libraries where families shared books and the book was often read to family gatherings rather than by one person, Uncle Tom sold two hundred thousand copies in its first year and sold a million copies between its publication and the civil war.Stowe was honest in her afterward and in other writings to say that her description of slavery in Uncle Tom is much prettier and more nicer than slavery was. She believed an accurate depiction of slavery--Stowe had lived in Cincinatti on the board with slaving Kentucky and traveled through the South--would be so revolting that her target audience of Northern whites would not read this book.Her book launched a torrent of responses from white southerners as could be expected. However, the popularity of her book encouraged white authors, but especially Black authors to write antislavery books that responded to Stowe. Some of the foundations of Black American literature by authors like Frederick Douglass, William Wells Brown, Harriet Jacobs, and Martin Delany are essentially response to Uncle Tom.Perhaps the most dramatic is Delany's Blake or the Huts of America whose character is a double to Uncle Tom. However, Delany's hero does not submit to being sold \\"down the river.\\" He instead runs away and travels throughout the US following the same course as the travels in Uncle Tom showing how slave conditions are so much worse than Stowe showed. Finished with that business, Blake leaves the United States for Cuba where he becomes part of a group of Afro-Cubans unwilling to suffer like Christ and Uncle Tom. Like the current leaders of Cuba, they start to organize an international revolution of Slaves and the oppressed!"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Simply put, this book is unforgetable.I must have read it more than 12 years ago and I still rate it as one of the BEST books I've ever read.I've read more than 100 books in my life-time.This book is ..........life personified.Love it or hate it, u can't ignore it.America and the world should be proud of this work."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"This novel opens up on the Shelby plantation in Kentucky, before the Civil War. In the beginning of the novel, Mr.Shelby, a plantation owner, goes through some financial problems and goes into debt. The only way to get out of the debt is to sell some of his slaves. He's left with no other choice but to sell his most faithful and hardest working slave, Tom, and a little boy named Harry. While Mr.Haley, a slave trader, talks to Mr.Shelby at the Shelby plantation, Eliza, Harry's mother, overhears the fate of her son. Not wanting to be separated from her family, she decides to leave the plantation and runs away. Like many other slaves at this time, Eliza is determined to reach Canada. Along the way, she's reunited with her husband George and the family reaches their destination. Fortunately for Tom, he is bought by a nice man by the name of Mr. St. Clare. Unfortunately, Eva and Mr. St. Clare die and all the slaves are left in the hands of Maria, the wife. She always hated slaves and thought her husband was treating them too nicely. She ends up selling them down the river and Tom is bought by an evil man. He prides himself in being able to \\"break\\" his slaves and beats Tom from head to toe. Just before Tom's death, Master George, rescues him and brings him back home. Tom finally gets to return to the Shelby's, but cannot escape the death that's awaiting him. Before Tom dies, George grants Tom's final wish and emancipates all the Shelby's slaves.This novel talks about some cultural issues like religion, treatment of women, and of course slave trade. The book also uses a lot of Black Dialect, which is interesting to read because that's how the slaves talked during that time.I would definitely recommend this book for high school and up. This book is exciting, interesting, and fun to read. It's a little over 600 pages in length, but the pages seem to fly by quickly because you're so emerged in the book. It is a little difficult to understand at the beginning because the book mostly uses Black English. \\" \`Mose done, Mas'r George,' said Aunt Chloe, lifting the lid and peeping in,-\`browning beautiful-a real lovely brown. Ah! Let me alone for dat. Missis let Sally try to make some cake, t' other day, jes to larn her, she said. \`O, go away, Missis,' said I; \`it really hurts my feelin's, now, to see good vittles split data r way! Cake ris all to one side-no shape at all; no more than my shoe; go way!\\" (69) But once you get used to the language, it's very easy to comprehend and understand what the characters are saying. This novel opened up my eyes as a reader to many of the cultural and historical issues during the Civil War. Since many Black slaves could not read or write, there were many historical documents thatare not written down in history books. I feel that this novel helped me to see a lot of the things that went on during those times and it really feels like an important part of history that was not written down."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I don't like this book at all it's very boring and there's not much entertainment in the book to keep me wanting to read it more."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Had to read it for a class called American Women Writers. There is a lot of sentimentality in this book, which was effective for Stowe's anti-slavery agenda of the time. However, as an English major, I don't particularly enjoy sentimentality...I do think this is an important book that needs to be read, but that doesn't mean I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Sorry, I know this is a classic, but the writing, grammar, spelling, typos, etc forced me to do something I rarely ever do-I stopped after chapter two and did not finish this book. Sadly disappointed."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"There can hardly be an American who does not know Uncle Tom's Cabin's historical importance, and the same goes for millions worldwide. It did much to solidify Northern anti-slavery sentiment and has been seriously credited with making the Civil War inevitable - supposedly even by Lincoln himself. However, though America's greatest bestseller ever on release, it now seems as if fewer and fewer people actually read it. This is unfortunate, because its significance alone makes it essential, but it is also an incredible story and well worth reading in itself.Those reading for historical perspective will have many assumptions confirmed but also be very surprised. Most obviously and importantly, it is easy to see why the book moved so many and emboldened abolitionists. It is easily one of the most profoundly emotional and pathos-drenched works ever; only the truly inhuman will not be moved, and many will cry. The characters seem supremely real, and we care for them as if they are our intimates. Harriet Beecher Stowe writes accurately and precisely of slavery's many evils. Much of what she says is so gut-wrenching as to be near-unbearable. Reading it is emotionally distressing and even at times almost physically painful; when something is this hard to even read, we simply cannot imagine what it must have been like to live. To think such suffering and inhumanity existed in America barely a century and a half ago truly astounds. There are many accounts of American slavery, from ones written by slaves to meticulously researched historical accounts, but perhaps no other is as deeply stirring. Even now we cannot read Uncle without being strongly moved; how much stronger must the effect have been when the evils described were current! I re-read it shortly after Barack Obama was elected, as many others doubtless did, and was affected more strongly and deeply than ever, moved almost to tears by the striking contrast and how far America has come.All this is if anything even more moving than inevitably high expectations would suggest, yet much of the book surprises because it is rarely or never mentioned in popular accounts. The biggest revelation may be that the story itself is excellent - not only moving but deftly plotted, superbly executed, and often thought-provoking. There is even a surprising amount of humor amid all the tragedy, St. Clare's wife being one of American literature's greatest comic creations. Deeply engrossing, Uncle pulls us in immediately and never lets go despite being a long, winding tale with a plethora of characters and many substantial subplots. Stowe's ability to handle and tie them together in a well-executed conclusion is truly stunning, especially in that this was her first novel. Indeed, inconceivable as it is, Stowe was no artist in the usual sense but an activist writing for practical ends. Such works of course almost never have any real literary or even entertainment value and are inevitably short-lived; this is why virtually everything else she wrote has been forgotten. However, Uncle is an astounding exception; unlike nearly all other such works, it does not come off as a hopelessly dated, artless tract. Though written without an eye to literature - nay, many would say, without literary skill - and for no purpose other than to reach everyday people, it remains an immense literary monument that has earned the admiration of uber-literary writers like Leo Tolstoy and Henry James. It has had many critics, quite a few of them scathing, but survived them all. Its many admirers still cannot pinpoint just what makes it so successful, but successful it certainly is.I submit that its greatest virtue is moving verisimilitude. Characterization is a big part; even minor characters - indeed even evil ones - are drawn so well, with such individuality and lifelikeness, that we will remember them long after reading. Many - Tom, Simon Legree, Little Eva - have long been archetypes. However, the realism is stunning throughout; Stowe made the Southern slavery system that few Northerners had seen come alive as if they had known it all their lives, and the same is still remarkably true for us though such a world cannot now be even imagined. She is very visceral, sparing no pains to show just how hard and demeaning slavery was mentally as well as physically; much of Uncle's immediacy comes from this central fact. However, she goes considerably beyond this to vividly convey all aspects of the Old South; everything from landscape to dialect is detailed believably and memorably. This is all the more incredible in that Stowe saw very little of this herself, and it gives Uncle great historical value even aside from the perversely fascinating slavery peek.This last, though, is certainly noteworthy. Popular slavery depictions now imply that slavery was homogenous in the South, but there were great differences - generally speaking, the farther South, the harsher and more ubiquitous. Many works focus on only one or a few aspects, but Stowe made sure to include all. Uncle begins in Kentucky, where slavery was most mild, and shows everything from its darkest Deep South facets to its New Orleans base where millions of slaves were brought and sold. We see the great diversity that existed in how slaves were treated and thought of as well as how they worked and interacted among themselves. Almost as importantly, Stowe makes clear that those directly involved in slavery were far from identical. Some truly thought of themselves as humane and even pious, generally treating slaves relatively well, others thought them subhuman and treated them accordingly, and most fell somewhere between them. St. Clare symbolizes this last; such a person probably never existed, as Stowe surely knew, but he is important for showing how one could have slaves while being as aware as anyone of slavery's evils and treating slaves as well as conditions allowed - could indeed even have them for a basically philanthropic purpose. Very few actually did this, but St. Clare is extremely valuable because he in many ways sees slavery more fully than anyone else in Uncle and criticizes accordingly.Here we get a good idea of just how thought-provoking the book is. It of course has many anti-slavery arguments - from theological to philosophical to political, a nuanced depiction of slavery's varying effect on politicians being one of its many overlooked strengths -, but they are now thankfully moot in America. However, though almost never credited for it, the book goes far deeper. For instance, St. Clare's critique goes well beyond slavery to include capitalism itself; so diverse is Uncle that Marx could easily be added to its long, varied admirers list. More fundamentally, very few works are so fully aware of human evil. Stowe believed all acts were forgivable and should be forgiven but was as starkly cognizant of humanity's inhumanity as any existential pessimist. Uncle presents human life as a near-unbroken series of miseries brought on mainly by avoidable cruelty and lack of empathy. Stoe indeed thought this force so strong that it could not be overcome; all one could do was piously submit. Death is the only escape and heaven the only redemption; this seems distinctly unfair on earth but is worth it in the end, as the latter is eternal, the former but a passing phase. This was the main Christian strand until the Renaissance, and it is all too easy to see how a sensitive, pious soul in a slaveowning country could turn to it. Thus, though somewhat paradoxical in that it looked to the past, Uncle was very far ahead of its time philosophically - far more so than in regard to slavery, where it only fanned flames. Such a bleak view of human life was not even remotely common in art or philosophy for several decades, becoming standard only after World War I. Stowe essentially saw worldly existence just as existentialists, nihilists, and other despair agents later saw it, but firm Christianity allowed her to bear it. This faith of course disappeared, opening a vast, gaping abyss that she managed to keep closed - an abyss that shows no sign of closing, leaving millions pining for a relative tranquility that seems nearly as unimaginable as American slavery. The character of St. Clare himself is also extremely forward-looking, seeming to step out of a Wilde or Shaw play forty years before one existed.As this suggests, though the fact is otherwise perhaps most stunning of all, Uncle has no hint of anything like a Civil War. Stowe of course wanted slavery ended but was Christian in the true and rare sense and had no taste for violence, whether it a Civil War or a slave uprising. She in fact wanted slaves to freely, piously, and - as much as was possible - uncomplainingly submit to slavery's evils and wanted abolitionists to appeal to Southerners' hearts and minds rather than attack or even force them to end slavery. Though clearly an unflinching realist in that she saw slavery for what it was and was unafraid to say so, she was startlingly optimistic and had a very positive view of human nature. This is clear even in the Preface, where she boldly states that she has no hard feelings toward those who uphold slavery, even saying they are often some of the best people she knows. She actually thought they were simply misled and did not see their unintended evil and that, if they could be made to, they would voluntarily end slavery.All this is clear in many ways - not least in the ending, where she allows the young, quick-tempered George a short act of violence that nearly everyone will find justified but in which she closes with an appeal to end slavery non-violently. Indeed, she does not even seem to conceive of violence as a solution. This is also present in innumerable references to God's Providence, Christian piety, eternal reward in heaven, forgiveness, refusal to judge, etc.; though rarely noted, Uncle is perhaps the most truly Christian of all novels. In contrast to the Apocalyptic, fire and brimstone streak that has sometimes flared up in Christianity and has now reached a fever pitch, Stowe and like-minded abolitionists focused on Jesus' essential message of mercy, pity, peace, and love. Conservatives have of course monopolized Christianity, especially in political terms, but Uncle is a stunning reminder that it was until very recently American liberalism's driving force. Jesus constantly said that the poor, weak, meek, etc. are blessed and under God's special protection, that they will be rewarded eternally for earthly trials, and that they should endure such trials peacefully - resisting not evil, turning the other check, etc. Very few Christians now point such things out, or even seem aware of them, but they epitomized Christianity for Stowe and her ilk and are Uncle's very essence. World wars, genocide, biological terrorism, and a host of other horrors have made such thinking seem near-laughably nave, and other parts of the book - especially the Victorian sentimentalism of which Little Eva is the apotheosis - also seem somewhat dated. Even so, Uncle remains of immense importance for showing how strict Christianity was not only the underpinning that let the book speak so powerfully to so many but also the prime mover of liberalism itself.Uncle Tom himself of course epitomizes this gap between expectations, the book's reality, and later history. He is Stowe's ideal slave; that he is also a master's ideal slave - at least in theory - may be ironic, and Stowe's treatment of blacks throughout is perhaps best described as condescending. Perhaps most offensive of all is that she thought it impossible for blacks to integrate into American society, assuming that a Christian republic should be made for them in Africa if they were freed. This comes across in the novel, though more subtly than other beliefs. All this infuriated many twentieth century black authors and intellectuals, and \\"Uncle Tom\\" became a byword for blacks thought to have sold out to whites. This in many ways makes Uncle more worth reading than ever and certainly more interesting. Needless to say, such reaction was absolutely unthinkable at the time; the book was almost liberalism's height, and anyone told it would some day be condemned as conservative would have likely been too shocked to laugh. This issue is far too complex to even outline, much less decide, in a review. Suffice it to say that these later views have great legitimacy, whether or not one agrees; this is the kind of thing all must decide for themselves. However, it is important to realize a few things. First, Tom was a genuine hero to Stowe; she certainly did not mean to be degrading or stereotypical but made Tom the exemplar in a book with many white characters. Many others thought the same. That later blacks would prefer a Malcolm X-like revolutionary is very understandable, but precious few whites of the era - certainly not Stowe - could have even conceived of one. It is also worth noting that the book would not have had the success and impact it did - and may even have backfired - if Tom were otherwise portrayed. There may be much to regret in his depiction and Uncle's presentation of blacks overall, but this is arguably best seen as proof of society's liberalizing rather than a fault of the book or Stowe.Stowe's Preface looks forward to a time when \\"sketches similar to these shall be valuable only as memorials of what has long ceased to be.\\" Uncle is certainly that, invaluable historically both for what it shows of a thankfully long-past era and for its own significance. In addition, it has achieved a transcendent importance that probably no one else could have foreseen; more than just a literary landmark, it is a towering Americana monument - socially, culturally, politically, and otherwise priceless. Every American should read it, as should anyone anywhere who is at all interested in slavery's dark history, Americana, or the few books that have quite literally changed the world."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Obviously, the text will be the same regardless of which publication you buy.

Should be as acclaimed as the novel &#34;Roots&#34; by Alex Haley. The only difficulty with the way it reads is following the contracted language spoken by the slaves. I very much liked Ms. Stoews strong Christian values in relation to the abomination of slavery. She was very much ahead of her time. It impresses me that as a woman, she was able to get her book into print during that era. Would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in knowing what slavery was really like.

Stephanie, South Africa"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Uncle Tom's Cabin is a classic which is essential to an understanding of the controversy over the slave issue in nineteenth century pre-Civil War America.It author is the famous Harriet Beecher Stowe who was the most notable member of the famous Beecher family of preachers and educators. Stowe wrote the book in the wake of the Compromise of 1850 which called for northerners to return slaves to the South ascaptured fugitives. Slaves were considered as property and thought to be inferior mentally and spiritually to Anglos. Stowe, the sibling and wife of a clergyman was outraged! She poured her heart, soul and considerable literary talents into making slavery real to many Americans who had no understanding or experience of the \\"peculiar institution.\\" Abraham Lincoln upon meeting her at the White House remarked, \\"Mrs Stowe you are the little lady whose book started this big war.\\" (or words to that effect). The novel was published in 1852 becoming the runaway bestseller of all Americans novels published in that century.The story begins in Kentucky where Uncle Tom lives in amity with his wife Aunt Chloe and their three children. He is sold down river because his benevolent owner Mr. Shelby has got himself into debt. Tom rescues little Eva on a steamboat and is purchased by the wealthy Augustine St. Clare who is her father. Uncle Tom is treated well by the St. Clare family but the saintly little Eva dies (a poignant death reminiscent of the death of Little Nell in Dickens \\"The Old Curiosity Shop and other Victorian fictional deaths). In his scenes with Little Eva and everyone he encounters Uncle Tom is a Christlike man of strength, faith and charity.St Clare's wife is a cold, egotistical woman so enamored of her own illnesses she care nothing for Eva. Miss Ophelia is a New England relative visiting the St. Clares who see slavery up close for the first time. She loves little Topsy an abused girl who is owned by the St Clares. Ophelia will eventually adopt Topsy taking her back home to New England. Topsy eventually becomes a Christian missionary in Africa.Uncle Tom is sold to the infamous Simon Legree a Vermont born slave owner who is one of the cruelest characters in all of fiction. He beats Uncle Tom to death but not before the Christian martyr has converted many of his fellow slaves to Christ. It is telling that Stowe made her villian Legree a New Englander. The curse of slavery was nationwide.An ancillary story features the escape of Eliza and Tom Harris to freedom in Canada. We see Eliza fleeing with her baby Harry across the icy Ohio river where she is befriended by Quakers enabling her escape to freedom. Tom and Eliza settle in Montreal and he travels to France with his family graduating from a university in that land. Stowe insists that Africa-Americans should have the right to read and learn as do whites.Mrs. Stowe indicts both North and South for the nation's culpability in the cruel slave system. Her great novel still has power today in a time when racisim and injustice still exist in our land. Who reading Uncle Tom's Cabin would have ever believed that a fine African-American gentleman named Barack Obama would sit in the White House as the President of the United States?Some will accuse Stowe of sentimentality but her storytelling abilities are profound and keep the attention of the reader throughout her sad and moving story. This book is an essential for every American."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I realize it is very easy to paint with a broad brush, but there is plenty of guilt to go around. From Southerners who justified their attitudes by appealing to the Bible, to Northerners who were opposed to slavery while keeping freed slaves at arm's length, to everyone who claimed to hate slavery but refused to do anything about it. This book has made me stop and think about the ways I might bend Scripture to fit my preferences and how my sins of omission are just a grievous as my sins of commission. This book moved me to tears at times and gave me a greater appreciation for the gospel. And like other reviewers, it left me scratching my head over why the term \\"Uncle Tom\\" has come to mean what it does in our culture. For me, Tom was a beautiful illustration of the Sermon on the Mount. I wish I would have read this book years ago."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Definitely a worthwhile read.In my opinion, Uncle Tom's Cabin by Harriet Beerch Stowe was a religious tract rather than a story. Her writing relied heavily on faith as interpreted by slaves, Quakers, and the mainstream population.This was an abolitionist view of the slave issue by a writer living in the era close to the problem. The story line was somewhat complex and at times convoluted, yet stayed true to the author's objective. It's not a novel meant to entertain, but to change the culture of the American south."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"There are some books which one gets to know by reputation before one actually reads them. \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin (or, Life Among the Lowly)\\" by Harriet Beecher Stowe is one of them. Whether from studying American History and slavery, and hearing the pejorative term \\"Uncle Tom\\", one gets a strong sense for certain aspects of the book. For whatever reason, I had not read the book until recently, when studying in more detail the history of slavery in the U.S. made this a necessity in my view.The history of how this book came about is important to the overall experience as well. The 1850 Compromise had seemed to settle the slavery question, before Stephen A. Douglas used its existence as a justification for his argument that the Missouri Compromise had been overturned. However, part of the Compromise included a slave-catching bill which created outcries from the abolitionist movement, and led a thirty-nine year old Harriet Beecher Stowe to write what would become perhaps the most important publication in the history of the Untied States.The change in public sentiment after its publication was dramatic. Its initial publication in the \\"National Era\\" as a 40 part serial, starting with the June 5, 1851 issue, did not draw a lot of notice outside of the abolitionist movement, but its publication as a complete book on March 20th of 1852 resulted in it being the most successful novel ever written up to that point. It was called by one critic at the time \\"The most valuable addition that America has made to English literature\\", and it has become a piece of history itself, as well as a classic piece of literature.In the initial part of the story there are three key slave characters to this story: the title character, Uncle Tom, Eliza (there is also her young son Harry), and George Harris. George is Eliza's husband and Harry's father, and is owned by Mr. Harris, who abuses George, mainly due to his being jealous of George's talents. Eliza, Harry, and Tom are owned by Mr. and Mrs. Shelby. The Shelby's are good to their slaves, yet due to some financial mishaps, Arthur Shelby decides that he is forced to sell off Tom, and is then talked into selling Harry as well to fully clear his debt. This is the opening scene of the novel, and it sets the tone for the rest of the book.Eliza learns of the sale of Harry and flees with her son in order to save him. She is also aware of her husband's intent to flee from his brutal master. George does also flee and both of them make their way into Ohio where they manage to unite. Tom, learns the reason for his sale, and decides that it is best for his master and the rest of the slaves owned by the Shelby's, and thus he obediently goes along with the sale. The fleeing slaves go north, while Tom is taken south.The three characters are very distinct and important. Stowe uses Eliza to show the perspective of a female slave. Her family kept apart by slavery, and threatened to be parted from her son, she flees in fear and in do so gains freedom and her family reunited. George is equally important, as by defying an abusive owner, he too gains his freedom and his family by not following the law. In his words we hear the echo of Patrick Henry when he says \\"I'll be free, or I'll die!\\" Stowe uses these characters to show the fallacy of the common belief of the time that slaves don't have the same sense of family. She also defies common belief by portraying George as smart and talented and passionate about his thirst for freedom. Of course, the comparison between the dire conditions for George in slavery as well as the broken family situation verses that which they have once they flee is significant. Stowe leaves George, Eliza, and Harry for a long period in the middle of the book, but she does return to them in a chapter near the end to finish their story.The other character, Uncle Tom, is the most controversial. His almost infuriating obedience and subservience to his masters in the story resulted in the creation of the derisive term \\"Uncle Tom\\". His character today reads as one who is not intelligent, and someone who blindly follows his master and his religion. In my opinion, it was important to have him as the central hero of the story and important that he act as the \\"ideal slave\\" would act. One key point is the contrast between what happens to an \\"ideal\\" slave who does what the master tells him to do, and the \\"bad\\" slaves who run away. Unlike Eliza and George, Tom loses his wife and children when his master sells him.Another important aspect of Tom is that he is always, by far, more moral than those that supposedly \\"own\\" him. Even the relatively benign Arthur Shelby allows his personal needs to not only sell Tom, but in doing so breaking his promise to free him, and beyond that, he fails to make a real effort to regain Tom, which he also promises to do. This contrast serves its purpose well. Tom is not dumb, and his faith is pure and true, unlike the faith of the slave-owners which they have had to twist to convince themselves that slavery is a moral good.Tom's second master is Augustine St. Clare, who inherited a plantation in Louisiana, and though he feels slavery is a sin, it is a sin he is unable to abstain from. His cousin, Miss Ophelia St. Clare, is from New England and argues with him to try to get him to give up his slaves. His response is to have her try to raise and educate a wild young slave girl called Topsy. Though separated from his family, Tom is still able to correspond through an exchange of letters, which gives both himself and his loved ones hope of being reunited. Tom's obedience again earns his master's trust, good treatment, and promise of freedom, but a tragedy results in Tom being sold again.Tom's third master is the infamous Simon Legree, a brutal master who trusts no slave, and who finds Tom too soft. At this point, Tom's separation from his family is complete, there is no communication at all. It is here where Tom refuses to do as his new master acts, and the reader learns that Tom has never really been a slave, that his actions have always been carried out because he believed they were the best course of action. He will not let Legree turn him into a Slave Driver, and he will readily sacrifice himself for others, as he has done throughout.Though the slang can be difficult to navigate, and there are certainly other weaknesses as well, such as a wrap-up which is a bit too neat and some ideas on Liberia which demonstrate the racism which was even there in those that were against slavery, this is a book which every American ought to read and experience. When initially published, the book did well not only in the Northern part of the United States, but in Europe as well. Stowe makes use of the current events of the time in her narrative. For example, in one of the narrative comments, Stowe makes a comparison to a runaway slave and a Hungarian defying the law and making his way to America, which is a clear reference to the Hungarian, Louis Kossuth, fleeing Austria and the hero's welcome he received when he came to the United States.The edition I am reviewing is the Penguin Classics which includes an introduction titled \\"The Art of Controversy\\" by Ann Douglas. It provides some good insight into Harriet Beecher Stowe's life and her writing of this novel, but I did think she somewhat oversimplified some of the historical context. Nevertheless, I would definitely highly recommend the novel."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Due to time constraints and long drive to and from work/other places, I opted to listen to the audio instead of reading the book. This turned out to be a great decision! The audio was clear with deeply enriching array of voices for different characters that served to deepen entertainment and enrich vocabulary and pronunciation.While the tracks are multiple [about 90 per CD]; they are short and easy to follow.I would recommend this audio book for anyone who would benefit from auditory language stimulation, vocabulary enrichment and a good old entertainment. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"For whatever reasons, I'm one of those who, over the years, never gave \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" much thought. I'm afraid I dismissed the book based on the derogatory cliche of describing a complacent black man as an Uncle Tom. What a pleasure to find how wrong I was.Although the style of narration, the punctuation style of the day and the evolution of contractions, compound words and other bits of syntax show this book to be from the mid 1800s, \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" is a modern novel. It is largely without the stifling level of detail offered in other books of the time, and it pushes the concept of omniscient narrator (perhaps along the lines of Vonnegut in \\"Breakfast of Champions\\") to a level that would likely be absurd in another story and purpose.And Harriet Beecher Stowe did have a purpose - a daring, countervailing, completely forward-thinking challenge to the complacency of the day. The action of the story concludes in the second-to-last chapter. In the last chapter, called simply \\"Concluding Remarks,\\" Stowe, referring to herself in third person, explains how she came to write the book, and in so doing pulls the reader beyond the realm of fiction in order to cap off her sermon. And a 500-page sermon is exactly what \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" was and is.To quote Stowe from the last chapter, \\"For many years of her life, the author avoided all reading upon or allusion to the subject of slavery, considering it as too painful to be inquired into, and one which advancing light and civilization would certainly live down. But, since the legislative act of 1850, when she heard, with perfect surprise and consternation, Christian and humane people actually recommending the remanding escaped fugitives into slavery, as a duty binding on good citizens,- when she heard, on all hands, from kind compassionate and estimable people, in the free states of the North, deliberation and discussions as to what Christian duty could be on his head,- she could only think, These men and Christians cannot know what slavery is; if they did, such a question could never be open for discussion. And from this arose a desire to exhibit it in a LIVING DRAMATIC REALITY [emphasis the author's]. She has endeavored to show it fairly, in the best and worst phases. In its BEST [emphasis the author's] aspect, she has, perhaps, been successful; but, oh! Who shall say what yet remains untold in that valley and shadow of death, that lies the other side?\\"Within the narrative arts can be found a gray area between complete fiction and straightforwrad documenting. Within this area itself is a fine line of storytelling that sheds the fluff factor of fiction and the yawn factor of documentation. A story told along this line is not only compelling but offers to the receiver of the story a glimpse of what a life in the world depicted by the story must have been like. Or at the very least might have been like. This glimpse, whatever else it is, will be visceral, allowing the reader an actual emotional link. Finding this line is hard, staying on it harder and pulling off a finished work while remaining true to the line harder still. This is what Stowe did, a century before such a point of view emerged again in Americam media.As such, Stowe explains that many of the characters are based on real people - yes, there really was a man as horrible as Simon Legree - and that most of the events in the book were based on true events known to her personally or through trusted reporting. This novelizing of reality was so compelling the book would be translated into twenty-two languages.It would be relatively easy to take sentences and paragraphs out of context and reach the conclusion that Stowe decried slavery while holding the black race paternalistically. It's very possible to find any number of passages and label them as apologetic and paternalistic. There is, in fact, paternalism throughout the story, but this is a reflection of America ten years before the Civil War; and by the end of Stowe's \\"Concluding Remarks\\" this paternalism is gone.I would describe the main apologist, St. Clare, who is keenly aware of the state of his own culture, as more of a rationalist. By making this character so, Stowe is able to open our eyes, as she opened many eyes of the day, to the subtler forms of defacto slavry - not at all to excuse slavery in general as some kind of natural order, but to bear witness to those toiling in other forms of captured work.In 1851 the scullery maid of an English country home was not a slave, of course. Her employment was voluntary, after all, and at the end of a year she would have a few schillings to her name. But economically, perhaps even geographically, her freedom was largely unavailable to her, and so while not a slave under the law, the other side of her employment was the delivery of herself to twelve- or fifteen-hour days of scrubbing pots and pans. The delivery of herself to, at the end of any of those days, climbing three or four flights of a rear stairs to a garret; to a social life limited to the kitchen staff, which itself was a hierarchy that lorded over her; to little hope of marriage, if that's what she wanted, or to any sort of a life she might call her own. Why? To keep from starving to death.And think about this today. Are you watching a 27\\" color TV with full remote that cost $199? Do you honestly think that set could have been made, boxed, shipped to a port in Asia, shipped by boat to the US, shipped by train and truck to your local StuffMart and sold to you profitably for one or two day's wages while every worker along the way was treated fairly? Do you care?For the vast majority of those reading this review slavery is an abstracted and distant topic. It is a practice from a long ago past that might be given two meetings in a high school American History class, a cursory survey from which students might understand the concept of the economics of buying, selling and breeding human beings, from which they might be encouraged to imagine the suffering implicit to such practices.Stowe's great achievment in writing \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" was to belie the nuts and bolts, the mere logistics and schematics of slavery. She established for the reader the point of view of the slave, of a human life set against the legally sanctioned bureaucracy of slavery. She successfully depicted a person - an individual, a human being - sold as a product, warehoused as a product, transported as a product, and then set to use as an organic machine that was discarded and replaced when it broke. More to the point, she allows us glimpses into the inner lives, thoughts and prayers of those sold, warehoused, transported and used up while their ties to family and place, while their smallest hopes, are given credence only as an afterthought that may never coalesce. Only if, after having purchased a brother or a mother, there should be enough money remaining to buy the sister or the child. Only if it should be convenient and expedient for the planter to do so, only if it should strike that planter's fancy one particular afternoon butnot another.This book is as meaningful today, in new ways, as it was in 1851, and that is wholly remarkable."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I decided I should finally read this book.

First published in serial form in 1851 and 1852, UTC is, to a large degree, a book of its time. But it has a compelling power that makes it, in my opinion, an authentic classic that deserves the attention of today's readers, and of future generations.Yes, there are many valid criticisms that can be leveled against Stowe and her book. Is it sentimental? Emotionally manipulative? Is Uncle Tom a problematic character? &quot;Yes&quot; to all these questions. But Stowe also achieves a remarkable sense of balance in the book as a whole. The too-good-to-be-true, long-suffering Tom is complemented by the more militant George. And Stowe achieves some truly incisive cultural criticism. Particularly resonant is her analysis (often through the dialogue of her characters) of the use of both Christianity and the law as tools by which the oppressive slave system was supported.Stowe is up front with her anti-slavery beliefs. UTC is notable for Stowe's many asides to her readers; her omniscient narrator seems to be maintaining a continual &quot;conversation&quot; with the reader. Despite the book's flaws, I found it to be a gripping read, filled with some truly memorable characters. Despite its length, the novel is a very fluid read.I fear that UTC is regarded by many as more of a cultural monument -- a literary &quot;museum piece,&quot; if you will -- then as living literature that one would actually read. That's a pity; I think that Stowe's compassion, keen intelligence, and remarkable writerly skill make UTC a classic that is actually worth reading.Like James Fenimore Cooper's &quot;The Last of the Mohicans,&quot; UTC is a flawed but monumental novel that represents a serious and thoughtful attempt to portray non-white American characters. And as with Cooper's book, I think that UTC should be read in connection with 18th and 19th century books by ethnic Americans themselves: as companion texts to UTC, I particularly recommend &quot;Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass&quot; and Harriet Jacobs' &quot;Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl.&quot;One other note: a number of authors adapted UTC for the stage in the 19th century. One such adaptation, by George L. Aiken, can be found in the excellent anthology &quot;Early American Drama,&quot; edited by Jeffrey H. Richards. My final comment: If you haven't read this novel, toss away any preconceptions you may have, and read it with an open mind. &quot;Uncle Tom's Cabin&quot; is an extraordinary achievement."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"At 59-years old, I've crossed paths with this book my entire life. This year, I finally decided to sit down and read it. Harriet Beecher Stowe's writing style is typical of her era and might be considered awkward over 150 years after she wrote this book. Still, the story is powerful and its message will continue to endure the test of time. Closer to the horrors of the holocaust, we are apt to associate the phrase \\"Lest We Forget\\" with that horribly inhuman experience in mankind's history. I am compelled to tell you -- the potential reader -- those same words, \\"Read this book Lest We Forget.\\" Certainly relevant mid-century in 1850, today, it makes no difference whether the subject of Stowe's books were African slaves, European Jews, or Cheyenne Indians. This is a story of how the human mind can wander to places where it justifies its undignified acts, even to the nth degree, yet still one man triumphs, and it only takes one to move the world in the right direction. Read this book \\"Lest We Forget.\\""},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"This book is genius. It is moving. It is so convincing that it can move even hardened hearts, like mine, to want to believe in Tom's loving God. There cannot be too much said for this story, for which I find absolutely nothing negative to report.Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote her first installment of the book in 1851, a year after the Fugitive Slave Law was passed (which is another free Kindle book that I recommend highly.) Not only did she write the truth about slavery, she took action against it by writing this book and by helping fugitive slaves in the Underground Railroad.If you need more evidence that everyone should read this book, remember too that it sparked great debate in the United States and that Abraham Lincoln himself is said to have thought the book started a war.Please do read this book."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Being very interested in the abolitionist movement, and knowing how influential Harriet Beecher Stowe's novel was, I was really looking forward to reading it. However, it turned out to be something of a disappointment.The story is rather engaging, following two sets of slaves: Uncle Tom, and Eliza and her son Harry, all three owned by Arthur Shelby (as well as Eliza's husband George, owned by a neighboring planter). Shelby is a rather benevolent slave-holder, but when he's forced to sell Tom and Harry to cancel his debts, Eliza decides to take Harry and run away rather than be separated from her son. Meanwhile, Eliza's husband George also resolves to escape north to Canada because of the malevolent cruelty of his own master. But Tom decides to allow himself to be sold south down the river rather than betray his beloved master Shelby.Uncle Tom's Cabin is half anti-slavery propaganda and half Christian allegory. As propaganda, it is quite well-done, and in the service of a good cause, but artistically it is somewhat lacking. The author breaks the narrative to address the reader directly, a common practice through the nineteenth century as the novel was still a relatively new art form, but with a frequency I've never encountered in other novels of the period. This has the effect of destroying the continuity of the story. Her method is to write about something horrible that happens to the slave characters in her story, then put it to the reader directly how they'd feel if such a thing were done to them--an effective propaganda technique, but not exactly subtle. This is especially prevalant during the first half of the novel, which focuses on the story of Eliza, George, and Harry.The second half of the novel turns into Christian allegory, as Uncle Tom, our trusty Jesus figure, allows himself to be flogged to death rather than revenge or even defend himself by killing his cruel new master and escaping, for the purpose of redeeming his fellow slaves by covering for two who *are* trying to escape and setting a Christian example of love and forgiveness for the rest.So the message basically seems to be for slaves, if they're to be fully Christian and virtuous, to let themselves be treated as horribly as their master whims, and take it meekly. How is this abolitionist? It was certainly a shock after being used to reading the much more intellectual and more passionate writings of Frederick Douglass, who advised his fellow slaves not only to escape, but to kill their masters in self-defense first if possible.The most interesting character, Eliza's husband George, at first sets out for Canada with a brilliant and daring scheme and the full intention of defending himself if anyone tries to capture him and take him back. Luckily, he's taken in by the Quakers before he has to seriously hurt anyone, but Stowe's emphasis on Christian submission makes for less dramatic material, since she won't allow the conflict to be expressed in terms of physical violence, or rather, she will, but only one-sidedly. But perhaps all this is precisely what one might have expected from a sister of the Reverend Henry Ward Beecher.Buck Schirner, whom I had heard before reading Terry Goodkind's Blood of the Fold, is excellent here, bringing a lot of emotion to the characters through his rendering of their dialogue. If you want to read mid-nineteenth century abolitionist material, read Frederick Douglass, but if you do decide to read this too, this audiobook version narrated by Buck Schirner will help it go down easier."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"A sellout . . . A traitor to your people . . . Eager to do the white man's bidding. These are some of the modern connotations of an \\"Uncle Tom.\\" Yet, if you were to read the book from which the term originated, you cannot help but come to an entirely different conclusion.\\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" tells the story of a middle-aged slave, Tom, and his exploits in 1850s America. A staunch abolitionist, Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote this novel as an illustration of the inherent evils of the system of slavery, not just in the actual practice of it, but also in the passive condoning of it by Northerners. The book was so effective that it swayed public opinion and helped bring forth the Civil War, as implied by Abraham Lincoln.The book is divided into three parts: The Shelby farm in Kentucky; The St. Clares' home in New Orleans; and wicked Simon Legree's plantation in rural Louisiana. The first two slaveowners are benevolent toward Tom, yet Stowe makes a powerful argument of the evils of slavery even when the slaveowner is upright and kind. Stowe portrays slaves as humans with real feelings and strong family ties - a bold pronouncement for that era. For even if they are in a kind environment, they are just one bad business deal or one untimely death away from being sold \\"down river\\" and being separated from all they love forever.Since the target audience was Christian, Stowe makes illustrious use of religious passages and uses flowery language at times, which may seem a bit too much for the modern reader. Yet, she uses these references effectively in an appeal to Christian love to all people, regardless of race. Furthermore, she condemns the Southern Christians of the time for twisting their belief to rationalize slavery.As for modern criticisms of the book, it is true that Tom is a loyal servant and wants to please his masters. However, he is no \\"Uncle Tom,\\" in that he never sells out his fellow slaves and would rather die than betray his brethren. He is treated as a martyr, a near Christ-like figure who will die if others can become free. I doubt Stowe could have portrayed Tom otherwise and still have been as effective. If Tom was rebellious toward his master rather than loyal and loving, the book would have lost its edge.Overall, this is a great read and provides a window into the thinking of an abolitionist. I'd highly recommend this for anyone who wants to know about the real Uncle Tom."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"This novel is notorious in American culture because of its reputation as a stereotypical novel. This novel is much more than that. Her original character of Uncle Tom is much more complex than what is seen in adaptations and subsequent productions of this book. Ms. Stowe portrays him as a young Southern black involved in non-violent activism, not as the downtrodden frightened black as most people think he was. The book is extremely well-written. Ms. Stowe can really tell a story. Her prose and her characterizations are flawless. The book was written in 1852, but the message that it gives is just as relevant today as it was then. This book should be included in a bibliography of important works that outline the ongoing civil rights movement in the United States. Not only that, it's a really good story."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Uncle Tom is probably the most important single book written in the United States of America. No one is really familiar with American culture, literature, relgion, and history if she or he has not read Uncle Tom.To understand this book, I would urge people to consult Eric J. Sundquist's book New Essays on Uncle Tom's Cabin (The American Novel) and Jane Tompkin's Sensational Designs. The 19th Century world and reader that Stowe aimed at read and understood things so differently, that you will miss much without knowing how to look at this book the way Stowe wrote to them and the way they read.This book has a broad purpose: literary to decide what is wrong with the entire world and present an answer. If you follow the sweep of the book you will find Stowe takes on everything from whether the issues of the 1848 revolutions can be resolved on the side of Democracy, to the question of marital relations amogn the free and the white. The issue of slavery is not the book's only focus. It is, in fact, the solution.Stowe's real thesis here is that American Chattel slavery is the number one evil in the world, that this evil corrupts every institution in society North and South and corrupts far beyond the borders of the United States, and that no compromise with it or avoidance of it is possible.To Stowe, slavery is an abomination not just because of the cruelty, savagery, exploitation, and degradation involved, but above all, it is an abomination against God, the most unChrist-like behavior possible.Thus the relgious solution she offers is to become more Christlike in your opposition to slavery and to finally undergrow the Christic experience of dying for your sins and being reborn in Jesus Christ. That's right, in Stowe's time evangelical Christianity, rather than being a fob for right-wing politics, was practiced by some of the militant and serious opponents of slavery.Stowe creates figures that are Christlike who like Christ die rather than yield to sin and influence the others in their faith. The supreme figure is of course Uncle Tom. Uncle Tom, as a a pejorative, comes not from this novel, but from the Tom shows that blossomed in the late 19th century which were a presentation of a mock version of this story with racist minstrel like charicatures of the African American characters.In this book, Uncle Tom is a physically majestic, heroic, dignified person, whose faith and dignity are never corrupted, whose death is shown as a parallel to that of Christ in the resurrection of the souls of all around him required to eliminate Slavery. If he is passive, never disobeys his masters, and seems to have not much of a material interest of his own in life, it is because to Stowe this a reflection of his Christic nature.No doubt at best Stowe sees him as a \\"noble savage\\" at Best. There is no doubt if one reads this book and even more clearly STowe's Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin which provided documentation for this book's depiction of slavery, that it is clear that Stowe did not believe African Americans were equal to whites. Her then-current immigrationist views are expressed in the way the one intelligent independently acting Black couple presented here leave the US for Canada once they escape slavery.Yet, this book accomplished the purpose it had. It galvanized millions of Americans and more millions around the world to dramatically oppose slavery. Uncle Tom was one of the first true international best sellers. In a smaller country, where literacy was lower, and when many people bought books through private libraries where families shared books and the book was often read to family gatherings rather than by one person, Uncle Tom sold two hundred thousand copies in its first year and sold a million copies between its publication and the civil war.Stowe was honest in her afterward and in other writings to say that her description of slavery in Uncle Tom is much prettier and more nicer than slavery was. She believed an accurate depiction of slavery--Stowe had lived in Cincinatti on the board with slaving Kentucky and traveled through the South--would be so revolting that her target audience of Northern whites would not read this book.Her book launched a torrent of responses from white southerners as could be expected. However, the popularity of her book encouraged white authors, but especially Black authors to write antislavery books that responded to Stowe. Some of the foundations of Black American literature by authors like Frederick Douglass, William Wells Brown, Harriet Jacobs, and Martin Delany are essentially response to Uncle Tom.Perhaps the most dramatic is Delany's Blake or the Huts of America whose character is a double to Uncle Tom. However, Delany's hero does not submit to being sold \\"down the river.\\" He instead runs away and travels throughout the US following the same course as the travels in Uncle Tom showing how slave conditions are so much worse than Stowe showed. Finished with that business, Blake leaves the United States for Cuba where he becomes part of a group of Afro-Cubans unwilling to suffer like Christ and Uncle Tom. Like the current leaders of Cuba, they start to organize an international revolution of Slaves and the oppressed!"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"A notorious anecdote about \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" relates that Abraham Lincoln, upon greeting Harriet Beecher Stowe at a White House reception, jokingly referred to her as the lady who wrote the book that started the Civil War. Sardonic as it is, the implication does some basis; appearing in 1852, eleven years before the Emancipation Proclamation, this novel forcefully decrying the institution of slavery and helping to stir the nation towards abolition was probably the most incendiary of the century. That it is often crude and quaintly primitive compared to contemporaneous works by Hawthorne and Melville only seems to increase the sense of its mission, oddly enough.Simply put, \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" dramatizes the conditions of American slavery. Stowe bases her characters and their stories on actual accounts of which she had known or heard, but more notably her imagination is fostered by an ethical conscience whose predominant source is the Bible. (It is not surprising to learn that she came from a family of preachers; there are passages in this novel that read like \\"The Pilgrim's Progress.\\") She tries awkwardly to maintain a balance in the novel between high melodrama, low comedy, tales of adventure and suspense, and noble but obtrusive exhortations about the inhumanity and unchristianity of slavery.The hero is \\"Uncle\\" Tom, a religious patriarch and evangelist among everyone he meets, who is separated from his family and is sold from owner to owner--the kind but dissolute Augustine St. Clare, and the nasty and cruel Simon Legree--in an odyssey that parallels the bondage of the Israelites in Egypt, a sort of journey to redemption. In addition to Tom's travails, the novel tells the story of a married couple of fugitive slaves named George and Eliza who have escaped from their respective owners to save their baby son from being sold to a trader and to flee to freedom in Canada, aided by Quakers and other sympathetic northerners.In his introduction to the Bantam Classics edition, the critic Alfred Kazin defends \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" with hand placed firmly on hilt, equating its artistry to its honorable abolitionist sentiments and its historical importance. I respectfully differ with Kazin in this case. I don't consider moral outrage to be solid ground on which to build a work of fiction. Dickens does it best, though that is the least of what makes him a great writer. Stowe, whose overbearing piety outshines her attention to language and narration, is not so skillful.Stylistically, \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" is uncannily similar to Upton Sinclair's \\"The Jungle\\" (1906), a book written for a very different reason but with the same magnitude of passionate indignation--both are novels of sloppily overwrought prose intertwining drab narratives of two-dimensional characters and heavy-handed pathos with finger-wagging social commentary. The atrocity of slavery and the problem of unnecessarily unhealthy, dangerous working conditions are too serious to be represented by shabby fictionalizations. Should Stowe and Sinclair be regarded as bad novelists or competent pamphleteers? If the latter, then those who somehow are not already convinced that slavery is blatantly evil should by all means read \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin.\\""},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"This book changed my life. \\"Uncle Tom\\" used to be tossed about as a term of derision, but that reveals a complete misunderstanding of Stowe's passionate and prophetic novel. Uncle Tom is the man we should all want to be. He is the true Christian model of life. What a glorious, thrilling, and delightfully melo-dramatic book. As a work of literature it has elements of the melodrama and elements of the Gothic as well as moments of out and out preaching, all of which may superficially seem dated to the cynical modernist or post-modernist (though they aren't at all). But as a work of prophetic and inspirational literature it is unparralleled in power and tender beauty. Who would have imagined that America had produced its own Tolstoy, and that we allowed her to drift into disregard simply through our obsession with the new and the anatomical and the fearfully, dreadfully, ironic."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Didn't care for it. Literature from another time that does not hold up. More of a moral pamphlet than literature. I had not read this before and was disappointed after giving it a chance."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"This book was on the banned books list for my schools while growing up. It was not until the book was discusses on a Stuff You Should Know podcast that it entered my mind to pick up this book. I downloaded the Kindle edition and began reading before my Kindle even arrived. And I am glad I did.Stowe gives a different insight into slavery than what is taught in schools. It is not overly romanticized nor demonized. It is simply put as matter of fact in a way that prods the reader to use their own reasoning to understand this important period in American history. However, you do come away with an emotional investment in the characters. I found myself gaining a better perspective and compassion through reading this masterpiece.To those who state this book is racist, you obviously have not read it. This book should be required reading in all schools whether as a course on American Literature or on American History."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"This is on the top 10 list of favorite books--I couldn't put it down--I was staying up until 2 a.m. to read it. Stowe is brilliant in her dialogue, as if she was listening to the conversations, the various dialects are amazing and the variety of characters she creates. At times you do have to read over, especially some of the slave dialect, but once you get used to it, it becomes easy. I can't imagine anyone condemning this brave woman (who had seven children by the way when she wrote this book) who spoke out against slavery and uncovered the ugliness and horror of it and vehementally condemned those, especially Christians in the South who condoned it by twisting the meaning of the Bible. Yes, it is written from a Christian perspective and don't all of us view the world from our own perspective? And that was hers; people need to remember that the majority of abolitionist were Christians. When I opened the book somewhere in the middle and read a bit to see if I was going to like the book--I felt I wanted to drop to my knees when she gave her description of Miss Ophelia--this is genius! I couldn't wait to begin reading. My only complaint was that there were places in the book that she was overly sentimental and it was an odd contrast to the tone of the book; a realism, which gave just enough details for you to see clearly with your own minds eye exactly what was happening--this is a definite read. She is no docile woman and another review I read I wondered at--as she has several strong women characters in the book."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Uncle Tom's Cabin was mentioned so often in various Civil War era history books I've been reading that I'd decided to order it from Amazon! I was very surprised at how good it was, a page-turner and a tear jerker. I could see the historical importance of it and said that to me anyway, what Common Sense was to the Revolutionary War; Uncle Tom's Cabin was to the Civil War. It brought something important into the homes of people who had their own problems and thought little about slavery and awakened them. It is an easy read even by modern standards and I recommend it to everyone. Moviemaniac"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"This novel delivers the truth of the horrifying effects of slavery on both the slave and the master; delivering the message that slavery is damaging to society as a whole. 'Uncle Tom's Cabin' is a historic classic but it is also very relevant for today. I believe this novel should be read by everyone so that slavery will always be understood as a terrible and frightening condition that affects entire societies. Also, 'Uncle Tom's Cabin' is not a difficult read; the writing feels fresh and it is truly a page-turner."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I realized recently that I had never read this important novel in my younger years, so I took it up as an adult.This book should not be judged as a work of literature, but as an intensely political novel, a polemic against slavery. Stowe steps out of the novel from time to time, for example, to express her hatred of slavery and of the slave trade, and to call upon all Christians to act to abolish slavery. As a polemic, it is masterful, and its shortcomings as a novel (too many coincidences, excessive sentimentality, some fairly wooden characters) fade away in the reader's mind.This is a period piece, a work of its time, and Stowe is not free from attitudes that we would term racist today. She holds many stereotypes of black people -- they are more emotional, more susceptible to religious belief, less cultured -- while at the same time declaring that slavery is the worst evil known to man. Interestingly, Stowe is as tough on Northerners who tolerate slavery or benefit from it as she is on Southerners who keep slaves.Highly recommended to Americans of all ages and ethnic backgrounds."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Uncle Tom is probably the most important single book written in the United States of America.

Never mind all the political sermonizing she does here -- and there's plenty of it -- this is above all a gripping story. Every time I expected a chapter to head into tedious territory, I was pleasantly surprised. Even though everyone knows what will happen to Uncle Tom -- this being a slave narrative written before the Civil War, after all, -- I couldn't help but continue wanting to read on. This was the second best selling book of the 19th century not only because it was highly controversial, but also because it's a well-told story, and I say &quot;told&quot; because Stowe herself often claimed that God dictated it to her. And it seems to be more spoken than written, especially with her frequent direct addresses to the reader.While there may be something to Stowe's claim of divine inspiration given its impact, the book is certainly not without its faults. The character of Eva, for instance, is unlike that of any normal living child. She's a saintly caricature. And her neverending conclusion drips with maudlin sentiment exaggerated to Biblical proportions. Similarly, Uncle Tom doesn't bear resemblance to anyone I've ever met. But most troublesome is Stowe's romanticism of the black characters. She lumps them together and stereotypes them in one way or another. Clearly she means no harm; just the opposite is her desired effect. But it sometimes comes at the price of preachy condescension. They may be positive sterotypes, but they are stereotypes nonetheless, and they weaken her story.Having read and enjoyed the highly-acclaimed and abundantly-awarded &quot;The Known World&quot; by Edward P. Jones, it dawned on me that Stowe really had a more thorough understanding of even the most subtle effects that the institution of slavery had on blacks and whites both northern and southern alike even with ideal slave masters. She even appears to foresee the differences of opinion that would later crystallize in Martin Luther King's brand of civil disobediance and the more militant versions advocated by the Nation of Islam and Black Panthers, juxtaposed in the diverging paths of the quiet, pious and tolerant Tom with that of the more directly oppositional George. She criticizes neither, though she seems to favor Tom's path, knowing full well that Uncle Tom is unique, and his abundance of Christian tolerance isn't likely to be found in the general population -- nor is it a path she desires for most slaves. She would rather that slaves simply escaped. She also seems to advocate their creation of a country of their own, taking Liberia as a model.Still, further, Stowe is an early feminist, and as a result, the characters that are most interesting here are the women. Ophelia comes nearest of all the characters in the book to walking off the page. And Cassie, a finely complex creation, though introduced only in the last 120 pages or so, nearly steals the climax.And what of the villains? They, too, are caricatures to be sure. To me at least, Simon Legree left something to be desired. He occasionally comes off as more of a buffoon rather than the Satan you know him to be deep down. But Marie St. Claire -- again, the woman -- is as clear a picture of selfcenteredness as Scrooge is of miserliness.Hemingway said that all modern American literature dates back to Huckleberry Finn, but I think he needed to look about 30 years earlier than Twain to Stowe. Uncle Tom's Cabin is a masterpiece of American fiction; if it is not the Great American Novel, it is, at least in terms of sales, impact and literary merit, the Great American Novel of Ideas."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Often credited to helping start the American Civil War, Stowe's novel became influential for all Americans, whether willingly or not. She may not have wanted absolute war, but she made it clear that \\"The object of these sketches is to awaken sympathy and feeling for the African race...\\" (Stowe xviii). She made a brilliant attempt to fulfill this goal and the result was a novel that changed the course of history.The actual story is just one way that Stowe created compassion in her audience. The story starts with a gracious slave-owner, Shelby, and how debts have forced this kindhearted man to separate two families, one of them mother and child. The mother, Eliza, and child, Harry, flee to the north were abolitionists help them make their way to Canada and reunite with the husband and father. The escape is dramatic and moving and the people that help the family along the way are appropriately labeled as righteous humans. In contras, Loker, the slave hunter that hindered them, is deemed unethical. The conversion of Loker is a turning point for that part of the story and he is altered into a character favorable to the reader.As for Tom, he is sent to the St. Clare family where the master is moral man and he has a religious and flawless daughter, Eva. Because of her perfection, Eva cannot see the difference between blacks and whites. Soon afterwards, Tom is sold to a malicious slave owner, Legree. Tom helps two fellow slaves escape but is therefore severely beaten and then dies. In his memory, Shelby's son frees all of his slaves and Tom becomes a martyr. The seemingly real lives of Stowe's characters raise emotions and sway the reader to be sympathetic towards blacks.An important person who was the prime example to support Stowe's thesis was St. Clare's cousin Ophelia. She is a northerner who hates blacks but is opposed to slavery. She represents the intended audience that Stowe was writing for. What Stowe wants for the North is what happens to Ophelia: through contact with a suffering slave, she overcomes her racism. Ophelia insists that St. Clare legally give her the slave that she grew fond of and states that \\"\`Nobody but God has a right to give her to me; but I can protect her now'\\" (308).Uncle Tom's Cabin also happens to be incredibly biased. From cover to cover, there are narrations with reasons and opinions that Stowe created to draw the reader to a certain belief. One speaks of how the pleasant and caring masters in Kentucky were the best a slave could get but even there they were still sold, worked hard, and separated from family. Others told of why the immoral masters were so atrocious. The author described the characters with different types of attitudes based on how she wanted the reader to feel about them. For example, a Quaker named Ruth \\"...was decidedly a wholesome, wholehearted, chirruping little woman...\\" and therefore the first impression of this woman was positive (133). This worked for Stowe because the Quakers were placed into an optimistic atmosphere. On the other hand, the people that were created to be the \\"enemy\\" were portrayed as abhorrent creatures who weren't truly gentlemen. For instance, Tom's master Legree was said to be \\"...like some ferocious beast, that plays with its victim before he devours it, he kept back his strong impulse to proceed to immediate violence...\\" (355).Religion played an enormous part in story as well. The characters that the reader would grow fond of were tremendously religious. For example, Tom \\"...would climb to a nook... and busy himself in studying over his Bible...\\" (141). In addition, Eva is perfect and extremely pious. The devout characters are also the ones opposed to slavery. The more religious a person grows, the more moral they become. For example, Loker is healed by Quakers and consequently found religion with them. Through this he is transformed into a man who is completely concerned with the well-being of blacks. In opposition, Legree was the true evil of the story and he is also the opposite of any religious person, especially Tom and Eva. At one point, Tom hears a voice that seems to come from the religious scroll that tells him not to be afraid. On the other hand, \\"...Simon Legree heard no voice. That voice is one he never shall hear\\" (336). The significance behind her strong use of religion is that Stowe was trying to create a hidden message in the story: that no genuine Christian would support slavery.Through the above types of communicating her argument, Stowe was tremendously successful in convincing any reader of the evils of slavery. The readers will most likely feel moved, emotional, and supportive toward any slave, which was the author's objective.The actual sources and research that Stowe used are unclear. From some research of my own I learned that much of her information came from her servants who were former slaves. While she never actually visited a \\"deep-south\\" plantation such as Legree's, she did experience some mild slavery around her. The last chapter of her book is basically her defense for her research. Unable to get an actual comparison between her version and others, it is hard to determine the accuracy. I believe that her research was very good for what was available at the time and generally accurate. There may have been some stretches from the truth, but she was overall fairly factual.On the whole, the novel was virtuous. As a piece of fictional literature, it is excellent and it is difficult to find a better story. As a historical book, it could be improved, especially in accuracy, but of course the historian reader has to keep in mind that that was not her intention. She set out to make an emotional story to convert people in the North to be compassionate and that was accomplished.I would highly recommend this book to anybody old enough to comprehend the meaning behind it. For AP students, the book can help them to understand the social situations before the Civil War. At the same time, it is not the best for a historical book review of this sort because it argues for something irrelevant today and does not look upon the topic from a historical point of view."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I shall not attempt to compete with the comprehensive reviews already here, but wanted to add my opinion. I read this book after reading a discussion of UTC and Huckleberry Finn in Harper's magazine. All of us are aware of such epithets as &quot;he's such an Uncle Tom&quot;, but I am astounded now at the ignorance and prejudices that abound about this book and the legacy it left. Not only is Uncle Tom not a mindless yes-man to the whites, he actually is beaten to death because he will not beat the other slaves in his appointed position as overseer. Reading this book was an incredibly enjoyable eyeopener. Yes the language and some of the attitudes are dated, but it is only the richer for this... it lets us into the mindset of the era and in a way that is passionate and compelling. I was completely swept up in the narrative whereas I was expecting to read for my literary and historic edification.It was also news to me that this book was such a runaway bestseller of the times, selling I believe millions of copies when such a thing was unheard of. It apparently swayed millions of households, and especially women, who of course did not have the vote, in favor of abolition. So it is a sort of prefeminist achievement as well as a political coup, which led to the civil war and the end of slavery. We can look down all we like on the supposed &quot;women's hyperbola&quot; of this book, but any novelist of this day wouldnt dare dream of writing such an influential book.Next to this book, Huckleberry Finn, which I read about the same time, is merely a boyish adventure novel, incredibly racist to boot, and completely falling apart plotwise at the end.Read this, for sheer pleasure as a novel, to counteract all the misconceptions, or to delve into history. But do read it, you won't be sorry."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Although a slow beginning make's Uncle Tom's Cabin seem boring, the story soon picks up when Tom's kind-hearted owner is forced to separate him from the only home he has ever know to fulfill a debt to a cruel slave driver. As you follow Tom through his travels, the horrors of slavery are revealed: Tom is seldom allowed to be out of sight of his new &quot;owner&quot; with out shackles. Stowe has written a wonderful book with real, believable characters. This is a definite must-read!"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"The copy I received of the Norton Critical Edition was missing pages 111-142. Instead, pages 79-110 were repeated. I contacted Amazon but they said it was too late to get my money back. My advice is to count all the pages in all books your order from Amazon, and don't buy the Norton Critical Edition of Uncle Tom's cabin. Buy the book from another publisher instead."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"What can I say..Uncle Tom's Cabin is the most important and influential book ever written by an American. It should be a part of every serious reader's library."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"After reading Uncle Tom's Cabin, I think that i now have seen slavery in a totally different way. the hardships that Uncle Tom faced were awful, and I can see why a Civil War was started after people read this novel. I give Uncle Tom's Cabin a four, because it clearly showed the difference between the fate of someome who rebels against the system, and someone who sits back and goes through the system. It is not a five however, because i believe this book is severely flawed. Little Eva, is about five or six when she is introduced, and then later passes away. She seemes to look on death as a good thing, which is totally unrealistic for a child of that age. Eva says things like \\"the time will come soon, when i will have to leave you, I will leave, never to return.\\" and \\"I am not nervous- I am not low-spirited, and I know I am going, before long. If it were not for you Papa, and my friends, I should be perfectly happy. I want to go- I long to go\\" Now these are not things that come out of a childs mouth, so this part of the book is not believable. Also, I think a good book should have well rounded characters. Characters who are flawed. Uncle Tom is too good, he is whipped tourtured, and beaten and all he thinks about is wanting to save Simon Legree's soul. I believe that every person has a little bit of good in them. This is not shown in Simon legree which makes him also, an unbelievable character. The book was by no doubt a well writen book, and I look up to Harriet Beecher-Stowe for having so much courage, that ever when she recieved death threats from slavery supporters, she went along and kept writing this book."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"When I had to choose a historical fiction book for class, Uncle Tom's Cabin came to mind. I had started the book before, but I had gotten bored with it and abandoned it after the first chapter or two. This time, when I put down the book, it was after I had finished it. There are not many books that can move me to tears, laughter, fear, and satisfaction. This book has combined all of these qualities and made me experience a broad range of emotions. The story follows the life of Eliza and Tom, two religious slaves. One day, their master being in debt, a slave trader comes to take Tom and Eliza's child away. Eliza chooses to run away, while Tom chooses to stay and meet his fate. From there, the paths of the two heores diverge into two emotional stories. Eliza is ever pursued by slave catchers on the run to Canada, and Tom learns more about life and Christianity as he is sold to different owners. The most striking aspect of this book is the surge of emotion behind the words. Vivid images take you back in time, and inside each character is a beautifully-portrayed soul. Uncle Tom's Cabin is, overall, a tale of sin and redemption, prejudice, faith, and love, woven intricately in the lives of many during the pre-Civil War era."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I wasn't sure about reading this book and initially found it very difficult. After finishing the book I found it to be very moving, informative. It is amazing that this book was written so long ago and by a woman."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I always heard my mother talk about \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" when I was a child and wanted to finally experience the book. It was written in the old south slang when starting the book and a little hard to follow. However, I got used to the slang and got into the book big time. The story was based on true characters and gave me a much better understanding of how slavery worked, the limitations and abuse placed on women as well as men. The information told about compassionate plantation owners and ones that were in it strictly for profit with no feeling for an individual needs. I finished the book with a much better understanding and more compassion for the black people.I still do believe the black individual has been given many opportunities to achieve a better life in America, that it is time for them to step up and stop using the \\"race card\\" whenever something happens. I do not believe many people have prejudices against them anymore, but I do believe American people experience much abuse from the blacks due to the \\"race card\\" being used."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"EVERYONE should read this book.I love that these are classics are available for Kindle free on Amazon. That is primarily why I bought the kindle for my son--to give him a fun new way to get all of the timeless classics. Thanks Amazon"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I knew this was a very important book; apocryphally the book written by the little lady who started a big war. I knew it was a response to the (dreadful) Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 and that it sparked increased abolitionist feeling in the North. I knew about Eliza crossing the frozen river (shown in The King and I) and about the evil Simon Legree. But there were still some surprises.Firstly this is a melodramatic novel featuring very cardboard characters who represent specific types of the period. For example there is the evil slave owner (Legree); there is an angelic little girl (who made me think of Nell from The Old Curiosity Shop which I've never read but I've seen an adaptation); there is a slave owner who is conflicted about the system of slavery; there are Northern anti-slavery people who have slavery brought to their doorstep. Nothing that happens is particularly surprising and none of the characters have any depth or growth.Secondly I just realized a plot might be helpful. Uncle Tom is a slave on a farm where he is about to be sold because his owner is profligate. A little boy named Harry is also about to be sold away from his mother Eliza. She is terrified about this prospect and so runs away, accumulating family and escaping to Canada along the way. Uncle Tom however submits to his fate and is first bought by an ambivalent slave owner who ends up dying before freeing him, leaving him to be sold to the vile Legree which leads to his death.Some of the major parts of this book are evangelical fervor; pretty much every page has Christianity references and it can be overwhelming because even modern Christian novels I've read are not so steeped in my opinion. The morality of women and their ability to influence their husbands from their proper domestic sphere also occurs. Stowe's solution for post-abolition seems to be colonization of Liberia using ex-slaves as missionaries to spread Christianity which seems impractical to me and obviously did not end up happening. It is also interesting to look at her racial attitudes which are awful in our times but were actually among the most liberal for the 1850s! I read this for class and my professor called it \\"romantic racism\\" where Africans are recognized to have a soul but aren't as good as Anglo-Saxons.It is also interesting how the use of Uncle Tom has changed. Now he is considered a subservient simpleminded slave but here he is actually very responsible and devoted to his Christian faith. When Legree demands Uncle Tom betray his slaves who have escaped, he refuses and is protected by his faith so that he dies secure and protected by God. Actually the representation of Uncle Tom as bowing and scraping comes from ministrel shows where Stowe's story was twisted to actually promote slavery.Overall: I'm very pleased that I've read this very important book now. While there are some crazy coincidences a la Dickens, they come together rather well. The only bad thing was the flowery language which meant I usually could only read one chapter at a time with lots of breaks. So I will rate this 4/5 and recommend it."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Like Falconhurst the story of the way slavery was.

It was hard to put down, and while thankfully there is no more slavery in the US, still the lessons in this story do apply in many different ways today, and I think that every person 10th grade and up she read this book. (It would be fine for younger readers, but I think it would make a deeper impact on someone a little older.)While slavery was still alive and well in the US, the author used her story to provid insightful perspectives and arguments to the people of her time, north and south, regarding the various issues surrounding slavery. She makes an amazing, logical, unbiased and indisputable case for why slavery was wrong and had to stop, as well as effectively showing that people of color were no different or less human than white people.Through stories of triumph and beauty, horror and tragedy, she brings to life all the facets of slavery and through these stories, based on real life experiences of people she knew, she is able to confront and address views, attitudes, ideologies and practices regarding slavery in a very fair and pointed way. In her story not all slave owners were cruel, and not all Northerner's who proclaimed to be against slavery did anything to help them, in fact she points out that many didn't want to be around people of color at all. She shows that Christian's themselves were also divided among those who believed it was God's will for them to own slaves, and those who believed Christianity forbade slavery, and shows the different beliefs among white people as to whether or not people of color were animals or humans just like them. This story does a beautiful job of showing just how human the slaves were and how wrong slavery was, she does a wonderful job of bringing her characters to life so that you laugh and cry with them and you don't want the story to end."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"This book is interesting in that it does not tell what often happens, but of what could happen.

Anyone who appriciates a good book should definintley read this. And believe me, DO NOT judge this book by it's cover or by the southern accent that is hard to understand at first.

This will be a book that you will remember for the rest of your life."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I have wanted to read this book for several years and I'm glad that I now have. It was the very first book I downloaded to my new kindle. Harriet Beecher was many decades ahead of her time in her thinking. In her book she not only advocates the abolition of slavery, which many others did as well, but actually calls for equal rights for negroes, such as negroes eating at the same table and on equal term with whites, something that did not come to fruition till more than a century later. I expect many whites of the time, even northerners would have considered her ideas blasphemous.While she points out the evils of slavery in the South, she is remarkably restrained in placing blame and maintains that the entire nation is responsible in one way another for allowing the abhorrent institution of slavery to thrive. She repeatedly points out the ways in which Christian teachings were being perverted to legitimize slavery and talks often of what it means to truly be Christian. The book is also replete with several strong and memorable female characters. In shocking detail she describes how desensitized people were to the very real sufferings of the slaves and how they were treated as mere objects with no regard to breaking up families if that were convenient or expedient, even the relatively 'kind' masters. It is hard to grasp that such unimaginable atrocities occurred in this very country and so recently, in this country that has now voted in a black president!Shocking, revealing, moving, heart-breaking. A must read for anyone with the slighest interest in the history of America. I now intend to read 'Gone with the wind' to get another perspective on the American South during that same epoch.I must mention, however, that I was very disappointed to find several typos and spelling errors in the ebook. I did not expect that. The ebook is also hard to navigate because it lacks an active table of contents. These drawbacks are there probably because it is a free book. Hopefully, the paid versions of the classics will be more faithful copies."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I purchased this book to use as research for a book I'm reading.

I did have the vague idea that most people do of what it is about, but would of been hard pressed to really give any serious detail of the story before hand. So after a little research i jumped in, and this was my experience.While the novel overall was good, i must admit that I was very glad when it was finally finished. The tale follows several different characters and the different fates that they have according to the choices they have made. The characters are very well drawn out, although today many would be considered somewhat stock. I think it will be a long time before I forget Tom, Eva, or St.Clare for instance. The tale does set up a brillant bit of emotional drama, and brings forth a moral tale in such a way i'm almost shocked that it was so popular. In today's society I can't imagine that a story with such strong overtone's would be successful. The writing today is still clear and fairly easy to read. The quality of the prose and the sentances to have their moments as well. Sometimes the religion and the moralizing does come on very strongly, but along with the sentimentalness one can forgive the author when realizing the massive evil insitution she was facing.This is probably not a book that the average reader will read for kicks. However, from a literary and historical perspective it is quite great. It is slightly scary to imagine where the world would have been without it as well."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I have so enjoyed this book.

Harriet Beecher Stowe would be amazed with the improvements America has made. There is still a tremendous amount of hatred, racism and prejudice occurring today. Tom's morality gave strength to those around him. Close to one hundred years later Dr. King's anti-violent moral deliverance gave strength to those around him! The novel is pivotal for self reflection. If you're white and you lived in the 1700's; what would be your stance on slavery? What is your stance on racial hatred and prejudice today?

As a bit of a history buff, I was somewhat surprised at how radical this book must have seemed when first published. I could not put it down. Delving into an often forgotten aspect of that embarrasing chapter of American history, Ms. Stowe forcefully reminds the reador of the horrors associated with the break up of families under the institution of slavery. The courage and faith exhibited by Uncle Tom is diametrically opposed to the action oriented Charles.

One of Chamberlain's mentors was Harriet's Beacher Stowe's husband. The Wikipedia article said Chamberlain joined the Union army because of \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\".

Dialogue written in vernacular drove me nuts."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Uncle Tom's Cabin is written through the eyes of a religiousfanatic abolitionist whose father is a minister and president ofa college of theology where her husband is a professor. Ms. Stowe tries to tell about slavery in the South from tails she has heard. The book was written nine years before the War Between the States and sold 300,000 copies the first year. The book hurt the South and caused people from the North and Mid-west to believe every word she wrote eventhough Ms. Stowe had never been to the South. Even President Lincoln when meeting her said,&quot; So you're the little lady who started this war&quot;.All of Uncle Tom's Masters treated him better than most of the slaves were treated with the exception of one Master. The book takes you from one Master to another with you wondering what will happen next. The book is chocked full of colorful and interesting characters. It's a book that will make you laugh and also make you cry.I think this is a book everyone should read and it will make you ask yourself what's wrong with being called an &quot;Uncle Tom.&quot;"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"1. SLAVERY WASN'T SO BAD AFTER ALL. I was surprised to find out that this book supported slavery. Of course, you have to wade through the melodrama and Christian speechifying (which is to say about 95% of the book's content) to get at Ms. Stowe's thesis, but once you do it becomes clear. To Ms. Stowe, slavery and capitalism are just different manifestations of evil human greed (St. Clare's speech on pp 239-241, chapter 19). It's good news to old slavers who could whip their charges to death, to be compared to Rockafellers, Carnegies, and Bill Gates.Ms. Stowe deems many factors that separate capitalism and slavery to be irrelevant. The fact that under capitalism families weren't separated is irrelevant. The fact that people could emigrate freely is also irrelevant. The fact that people were not forced off their farms and into the cities is irrelevant. The fact that proletariat, even in Ms. Stowe's day, were protected by labor laws is irrelevant. The fact that life expectancy increased vis &agrave; vis the pastoral lifestyle is irrelevant. The fact that the proletariat were not chosen for racist reasons is irrelevant. The fact that a worker could become an entrepreneur and eventually a capitalist is also irrelevant.2. CHRISTIANITY DOESN'T CONDEMN SLAVERY. Ms. Stowe does a fine job (inadvertently) of showing that Christianity contains doctrine that supports slavery, and no doctrine that outright condemns it.3. AMERICA IS FOR AMERICAN INDIANS. Ms. Stowe states at the end of chapter 43 that Topsy, after receiving a decent Christian upbringing, became a teacher in &quot;her own country&quot; -- Africa. Ms. Stowe believes that Africa is Topsy's country because she is descended from Africans, and conversely that the United States is not Topsy's country. Of course, if one were to apply the same logic to everyone in the U.S., only native Americans would pass the test."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Very fast shipping, which was necessary for my daughter's college class. Great condition!"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"This book was the most popular protest novel against slavery of its time and the play adaption lived on for almost a century after its writing. It is the only work of fiction that Malcolm X read when he was educating himself. African American Studies professors will use motiffs from this book as a common understanding.It's still not a very good book. Stereotypical characterizations, badly drawn characters and an overall melodrama are good points. I will give some credence to the fact that a modern reader will be spoiled by today's literature and look for it in classic literature.However, the main weakness is what is always considered the strength of this book. It's preachiness had its place in the history of our country and there are many other books saying the same thing, but why should I have to read over 400 pages to learn that slavery is bad. It's kind of a given in this day and age - especially the slavery that happened in the American South which had that extra racism dimension.The only reason why I am giving this book 3 stars is because I didn't finish it (skimmed it after the first 100 pages) and there might be something worthwhile later on the book. But as Shaw said &quot;you don't have to eat the whole egg to know it's rotten&quot;."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Throughout history, few books have garnered more controversy than Harriet Beecher Stowe's UNCLE TOM'S CABIN. When he met Mrs. Stowe in 1861, President Lincoln proclaimed, \\"So you're the little woman that wrote the book started this great war.\\" That may be a bit of an overstatement, but the book certainly had enormous social and political consequences.In the social structure that has evolved since the emancipation of slaves in this country, few labels have a more derogatory intent to the black person than being called an \\"Uncle Tom\\". We hear it repeatedly used to indicate a black person who chooses not to follow in lockstep with the direction of radical black anarchist leaders. For the life of me, I can't grasp that concept. What greater compliment than to be referred to as a man who faced such immense adversity yet who remained steadfast in his faith.I realize the argument is that Tom did as he was told and refused to stand up for himself, but that argument only portrays the shallowness of a society that has been more and more anti-Christian as time goes by. Those who would make that argument fail to see the strength and courage it takes for a true Christian to resist temptation and consistently put personal challenge into the Lord's hands.This book, today, receives a tremendous amount of criticism for Stowe's constant Christian \\"preaching\\" throughout the book. Stowe, born in 1811, is of the founding daughter generation. Her strong portrayal of Christian virtue is yet another reminder that America was founded on Christian principles. People today, in our society where Christianity is under constant criticism, hate to admit that America once was, and was intended to be, a Christian nation. At the time of its publishing, Stowe's work was criticized for being biased towards anti-slavery, but was never criticized for its expression of Christian virtues.For me, and I'm sure others, the book does have one great flaw. Mrs. Stowe was well known for accurately depicting the vernacular of a particular region. While that may add authenticity to a story, it also creates a painfully tedious read. That is the case here. This is not a book that most people could pick up and read at once. For me, it was a long daily process of 10-20 pages at a time.Here is an example of what I'm referring to;\\"I'm thinkin' my old man won't know de boys and de baby. Lor'! she's de biggest gal, now, -good she is, too, and peart, Polly is. She's out to the house, now, watchin' de hoe-cake. I's got jist de very patern my old man liked so much a bakin'. Jist sich as I gin him the mornin' he was took off. Lord bless us! How I felt, dat ar mornin'!\\"I'm sure there are readers who appreciate such authenticity, but for me, and I'm sure untold masses of high-school students who once found this on their \\"required reading\\" list, that is just plain tedious. My only other knock on the book is the \\"happily ever after\\" ending which Stowe gave to several of the main characters. For those once trapped in the bondage of slavery, I don't believe too many of them lived out that kind of scenario.That said, if you've not read this book, do so. Find a way struggle through it. Stowe gives portrayals of both sides of the slavery coin. By that I mean, she managed to portray that many slave owners considered their slaves as family members and treated them with respect and kindness, while there were also other owners who viewed slaves as mere possessions to be abused and defiled.This book may not have started the Civil War, but it most certainly had a profound effect upon society like few books in history have ever had. That fact, in and of itself, makes this book a must read for everyone.Monty Raineywww.juntosociety.com"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"It's very good if you want to go back on history."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Harriet Beecher Stowe was born in Connecticut in 1811 and four years later her mother died leaving hear older sister, Catherine, to raise her. Catherine founded a college in Hartford, where Stowe received her education, and later became a teacher at the school. Stowe married Calvin Stowe, a minister at her father's seminary college, in Cincinnati, Ohio. Living there for eighteen years, Stowe was unconsciously gathering data and impressions about slavery. This information was the main influence for Uncle Tom's Cabin. This book is historical fiction, based on Stowe's real life experiences with slavery. &quot;The portrayal of slavery and its effects on families and on individuals is gut-wrenching - when Uncle Tom has to leave his family, and when Eliza may lose little Harry, one feels utterly desolate.&quot; . The way you feel when you finally realize, after straightening out all the details in your mind, that Uncle Tom has to leave his family and that Eliza may lose her son. This was the best part of the book, as you can see illustrated in two lines. Uncle Tom's Cabin has been deemed unbearably boring by many of its readers including myself. &quot;...absolutely tedious, over-wrought--morality tale one of those books they make you analyze to death in English class. not worth the money.&quot; That is not to say that it is a bad book, or that the reason for writing it is unjust and that it doesn't make any sense, I am just referring to the extensive detail used in creating, the sometimes, overly vivid scenes. The book could have been two-hundred pages long and still gotten it's point across just as well, or maybe even better. I didn't like the book, it was too long and drawn out, personally I like a writer to just say what they mean and not try to make you think something when they refer to something else. This book had a lot of religious reference, but it wasn't necessary for you to understand all of them because it was part of Uncle Tom's character to be somewhat of a preacher. One review I read stated that from reading this book, the reviewer discovered that this book supported slavery. I didn't get this impression at all. What I saw was that many slave owners were actually very nice to their slaves. The only reason for slavery was cheap labor, many plantations couldn't have survived without slavery, but for the slave owners to keep their slaves in line and from running away they had to develop a friendly relationship just as many managers do with their employees today. I saw this friendly relationship in almost all of the slave owners in the novel. You will see this specifically when Uncle Tom finds out he has to leave the Shelby plantation, he says he wants to be loyal to his &quot;Mas'r&quot;. So this book is not supporting slavery, it is just saying that all the slave owners weren't bad. All in all Uncle Tom's Cabin was not my favorite book and I wouldn't tell anyone to read it, but you may like it. It was too long and had too much detail much like a Charles Dickens novel except not quite as bad. The rating I would give this book on a scale of one to ten on the plot of the book is an eight maybe even as far as a nine. However, if I rated it on how well it kept my interest I would probably say a one or two, any Charles Dickens books being in the negative numbers. So in all finality, the book has its ups and downs, but it is still not as bad as a Charles Dickens novel."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I read this from a sense of obligation ... and probably 40 years too late to appreciate it fully.

The end result is almost embarassing.UCT's heart is bigger than its brain, and that's a dangerous thing for an intended instrument of social change. If you want the real story, read Fredrick Douglas' autobiography.On another note, this book is so sugary it made my teeth itch. It should be read and reviled."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Everyone should read this again as adults.

They should be read by school children and then discussed! Slavery is over but we still see the scars left by this evil institution.

I could understand how publishing this book hardened the battle lines regarding slavery in this country. Stowe carefully outlined the circumstances of slave families torn apart, and how the practice hurt the owners as well as their \\"property.\\" But once the war was over, and the slaves were freed, what happened? Stowe brought a wonderful proposal to the table, in the novel itself and in its epilog: educate the freed blacks, but not in their home South, where the white population had grown so lazy due to the institution of slavery, but in towns of the North, where churches Christian families could sponsor individuals so that they could be educated, learn to read and write, learn how to develop a civilized, free character, and then learn a trade. Yet Stowe was totally ignored, apparently, and the alternate, leaving the freed blacks to their own devices and protected by Northern soldiers, could not last forever. President Grant was the last president that kept Union soldiers in the South. When Rutherford Hayes became president, the Union soldiers were withdrawn and the blacks were \\"kept in their place\\" by new, repressive state legislation.

Mistakes made by ancestors are revisited and Americans find the way to knowing and correcting the fact which the book portray about the inhumane cruelty of the early 1800s. Mrs. Stowe has the influence of Christian religion and saw the religion as universal religion and others should embrace it. Slavery made them cling to it as a source of comfort and the black slaves were purposely taught by the slave holders, through various means, the full scope of Christian redemption. This and other melodrama writing and approach may not be accepted. A classic, the book touches the heart with the title character, Uncle Tom, who enlightens the reader to true spiritual conversion and self-sacrifice, as he followed the example of His Lord, Jesus Christ. Reading the book makes one realize the inside turmoil and the anger for abolishing the Slavery. Indeed, a classic read and should be on shelf of every Library."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"A book that everyone should read! very touching, Tells us what horrors, we can get through with the strength of God"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I did not read this book until I was 25 and now I absolutely love it.

It also was written by an abolutionist woman that took most of her information from other accounts of slavery in the South and the North.

Please read it for YOUR sake."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Many times, one can find themselves not reading a book because they have heard so much about it over the years that they feel like they have already read it. That was the case with me and Uncle Tom's Cabin. I had never read it but felt like I had from everything I had heard. In my History of the English Language class, I had a chance to really read it. Did I learn a lot!Much of what I had heard over the years about the Harriet Beecher Stowe's book was close to accurate, but the picture in my mind that had not read it conjured up something way different. I finally got to read the work itself and found myself glued to the book until I was done.This is not a book that shows only the horror of slavery. Yes, there is much that is horrific in these pages. The treatment that many slaves met with is beyond anything a human being should ever encounter. Ms. Stowe describes the beatings, starvations, and cruel deaths while not getting into the worst of descriptions. She alludes to them while not getting too graphic. But the author does more than recount horrendous treatment of slaves. She looks into the heart of the slaves, the owners, and those around them.I think this is what impressed me the most. Not all slaves had a good heart. Some of them were greedy and as mean as their owners. They would rat out each other in an attempt to look good to a master. Others just tried to keep their heads down and make it alive to another day.The slaves were very interesting in their varied personalities. Uncle Tom is, of course, a main character whose heart is so pure that anything and anyone held up against him seems dirty and dingy. Despite being sold from his family and good master, he keeps up hope and his faith in God. Even death facing him does not have him giving up hope.The lives of the other main slave characters show the struggle within them for freedom and the ability to feel like a true man. A woman is willing to give up everything she has as a slave which is a very good life for her to keep her child by her side. Even being treated kindly is not enough to make a person feel like....a person. It takes the love of their family and the sense of independence.I couldn't help being drawn to the each of the slaves who sought their freedom through escape or through just simple faith. I kept putting myself into their shoes and wondered if I could have the strength to do what they did and survive. I honestly couldn't answer that. It's a situation that few in America find themselves in today.Another aspect that really stuck out was the various white people in the book. There were the kind slave owners who knew that the slaves they owned were their property but were treated as part of the family. They were up against an institution that they alone could not fight. Instead, they loved their slaves and gave them more than many slaves ever had. Yet, it was not enough when death entered the scene before the slave owner could free them. They typically found themselves facing much of the hell that many slaves lived in.The torture found in those that used slaves yet found the act repulsive was something I had not expected to find. There were many who tried in their hearts to reconcile the act and the accepted practices to what they felt in their souls.Looking at the act of slavery from today's eyes seems so easy. We have a view of it being wrong, period. Yet, when one reads this book that helped bring the topic of slavery to the forefront of America, you can't help but see how it was not so easy during this time. Slavery was something that was accepted as part of life by the white man and the black for so long that the voices that stood out against it were getting lost in the wind. It took life changes events and the perfect opportunity for many to see the error of the institution and the logical way out. Just freeing the slaves could have been more harmful than preparing them for a life of freedom. It was a situation that really had no perfect ending.If you think you know what Uncle Tom's Cabin is really about but have never read it. I highly suggest that you pick up the book and read it for yourself. Never make assumptions or take anyone else's view as the gospel. I did read the free Kindle version which has many formatting problems, but the text is accurate.This is one book that I think you should read. It will give you a new perspective of slave-holding America and give you a little more depth into the lives that were affected by it. Let Harriet Beecher Stowe take you into a world you only thought you knew.Note: I purchased this book on my own for a class."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I read \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" for the first time a few months ago and was amazed at its powerful message. I had learned about the book in school as a kid, but only as the short answer to a simple question such as, \\"What book written by Harriet Beecher Stowe had a dramatic impact on the public regarding slaver?\\", or maybe, \\"Who wrote Uncle Tom's Cabin?\\" Too bad I wasn't encouraged to READ the book and understand why it was so influential in the the time leading up to the Civil War!The reasons the book is not read directly are plain. Some of them are: frequent use of the N-word, very heavy evangelical Christian message(as a reason that slavery is evil), and a few generalizations about the black race that would not be politically correct today (as if generalizations and anyone who makes them are evil and dangerous to society! rather than simply what they are: one person's generalized view of a group.)Harriet Beecher Stowe was like a fearless biblical prophet, using plausible (and no doubt frequently actual) storylines to expose the dreadful evil that slavery was, regardless of the relative morality or immorality of the slave holder. Unexpected and uncontrollable events like death or debt could remove slaves from a good and kind master to a harsh and cruel one. This trading of slaves due to the death or debt of their masters would inevitably separate husbands and wives, parents and children forever. Stowe shows the effect that these events could have on these HUMAN BEINGS. She appeals to the white mother's affection for her children or husband, showing that slavery often breaks these bonds between families.But Stowe doesn't stop there, but also exposes the hypocrisy of northern abolitionists, who railed about the evil of slavery, but would not begin to agree to take those dirty black slaves into their communities, to live and work among them and their children, or to be patient with the dehumanizing effects that slavery had produced in the blacks.In the end she pleads with both north and south to see these people as human beings with no less feeling or value than their own white children. She uses Christianity, which all of these slaveholders and abolitionists professed, to convince them that if Christ died for these people, how can we possibly place so little value on them? If Jesus would take them into His arms and receive them to heaven forever, how could those who love Jesus abuse and oppress them, separating mother and baby, husband and wife?"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Reading about the horrible experiences of the slaves in this book makes my heart beat fast.

Of course, everyone knew it was a publishing phenomenon with, arguably, an enormous historical and cultural impact. But the smart or fashionable assumption was that it was an artless piece of melodramatic propaganda with only historic importance. Eventually, moved by Edmund Wilson's Patriotic Gore and the Library of America copy sitting unopened on my shelf, I was moved to give it a try and amazed to find that it is a fascinating novel that far exceeded my (admittedly) low expectations and was well worth the time and effort.First, it should be understood that it is not a perfect or even great work of art. It is melodramatic; it certainly has an \\"agenda,\\" though I'm not sure it is propaganda; it is often long-winded and Stowe delivers a few too many sermons (Christianity is doled out rather heavy-handedly here), rather than allowing the actions to speak for themselves; it is hard for a modern reader to believe some of the characters, at least some of the time (like Tom's incredible Christian forgiveness in the face of Legree's evil); it is somewhat awkwardly shaped and the two main story lines diverge for so long that one is almost forgotten, only to reconnect and culminate in a virtual miracle of coincidence; Ms. Stowe indulges in some well-intentioned but curious (and non-PC) racial stereotypes, and so on. That being said, however, UTC is an entertaining book, written with a remarkable amount of verve, that reveals much about its time, develops some memorable and believable characters, provides some pretty believable dialect, and, most surprisingly, through its characters expresses a number of varied, intelligent and well developed theories or even justifications for slavery that prevent it from being an out and out diatribe against the south and slaveowners.UTC has been widely reviewed here and elsewhere, so I will only comment upon this latter characteristic--the various viewpoints about slavery. Make no mistake, we are NEVER uncertain where Ms. Stowe stands: Slavery is an evil institution. But it is the institution, not the people involved who are really at fault, north and south. For example, the book begins when the Shelbys are forced, through dire financial straights and the total lack of business sense of Mr. Shelby, to sell two slaves. The Shelbys are not evil. They are in fact benign masters. However, they appear to have no choice in the matter and are almost appalled at what they must do. Through this circumstance, Ms. Stowe emphasizes that it is the system itself that is evil because it can compel even the good and thoughtful to sell off their chattel, separate families, and possibly condemn even their most valued servants to a living hell. Similarly, Tom's subsequent master, St. Clare, is intelligent, thoughtful, kind to his slaves and highly critical of the institution itself, albeit unable to see what one slaveowner can do to work societal change. Again, however, when he dies, the same points are made: his frivolous, spoiled and hateful wife (the St Clares are quite excellently drawn and two of the best characters in the book) sells everyone off and Tom falls to the loathsome Simon Legree, the most odious slaveowner imaginable, who is, in fact, a northerner. Through the Shelbys and St. Clares and Legree, Stowe does a remarkable job of developing and contrasting various attitudes to slaves and slavery, and this alone makes the book worthwhile.All in all, UTC is enormously better than one might expect--which is not intended to damn with faint praise. If you have any interest in America of the mid 1850s, the institution of slavery. the Civil War, or even what constituted an enormously popular novel at the time (albeit more inspired than artful), I would highly recommend UTC.The LoA volume is typically well done and contains two of Ms. Stowe's other novels should you be captivated by this one."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I don't think I have ever \\"felt\\" so much during a reading of a book!!

It deals with the tragedy and emotion of slavery in America in the 1800's. This book is famous throughout the world, dealing with political, emotional, moral, and spiritual opinions on conflicts throughout Earth's history.It begins with a slave named Uncle Tom, who is under the rule of a kind and gracious master who treats him very well. Due to his master's debt, Tom must be sold down-river to a heartless trader named Haley. Also sold is Harry, the only son of a woman on Tom's plantation named Eliza. She takes her son and runs north to keep the slave traders from taking her child from her. Tom is a very loyal and righteous man who trusts that his master will buy him back as soon as he can raise the money, even as he is being sold down-river. Tom finds himself under the care of St. Clare, a secular, yet moral man. St. Clare has a young daughter named Eva, with whom Tom builds a strong friendship. However, Eva is constantly weakening, due to an unknown disease, and slowly succumbs until death claims her precious, loving heart. Tom is again sold down-river to a stricter master who puts him in charge as overseer. When Tom is ordered to discipline another slave through whipping, Tom refuses and is whipped to death by his unmerciful master.This book is exceptionally written, dealing realistically with a cruel system of one group of humans enslaving and demoralizing another group. This book deserves its standing as a classic, having been instrumental in ending slavery itself. This book so deeply analyzes aspects of slavery that I loved every minute of its intellectually-challenging text. This is a great read for anyone wishing to know more about history, while at the same time challenging the mind and watching a breathtaking story come to life."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Uncle Tom's Cabin by Harriet Beecher Stowe is a powerful antislavery novel written in the late 1800's. The novel helps the reader understand what it was like being a typical slave in the pre-Civil War south. Slaves were treated like they were less than human; had cruel \\"masters;\\" and were often beaten and whipped, sometimes to death, for the slightest mistake. They had absolutely no rights, and many slaves wished that they were dead, rather than be the \\"property\\" of a cruel monster who called himself better than them. It also conveys how unconstitutional the slave system was, since the Constitution clearly states that \\"All men are created equal.\\" Family members were often split up and never saw each other again. The main character in Uncle Tom's Cabin, a slave named Tom, is separated from his family and friends but he is able to somehow maintain his religious faith even after witnessing and experiencing the brutalities of slavery. The novel had a huge impact on many people's lives when it was first published, and it stills does today. I believe the book is well-written and has great character descriptions. It is very thought-provoking and I enjoyed reading it."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I had always heard of the controversy surrounding this book. I really could not imagine that it would also be a good story. I picked up the book to satisfy my curiosity - Could it really have been that controversial to have a remark from Abe Lincoln about Harriet Beecher Stowe starting the civil war?Yes you will see why this was the case. I am amazed that this book was written at the time that it was. I can not get over that. The book is easy to understand - Has excellent plot, characters - and kept me thinking about it long after I had finished reading it.You feel Harriet Beecher Stowe's strong feelings on slavery. She used her talent for story telling - to share this important message.One of My Favorite Books! Would actually reread it - and I have never read the same book over again :)"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"While Harriet Beecher Stowe set out to tell a tale of the evils of slavery, we find in the modern world, her story remains as compelling as it was 150 years ago. Through rich characterizations (Tom, St. Clare, Eva, Topsy, Ophelia, Cassy, Legree, etc), we discover a book about people. Beecher Stowe examines slavery by making it very much a human issue, not only through the main characters, but also the stories told by those who pop up for a page or two. At times, the book is formulaic. You can bet each time, for example, that a mother and child face being sold, they will be separated, despite pleas to stay together. And another way this book may seem out-of-place today, is the accidentally patronizing view the author may present of Africans. \\"The Negro is inherently\\" she'll say from time to time; a flaw that is difficult to forgive for a book that otherwise does such a moving and successful job of creating real people for the reader to know. These flaws aside, the book is compelling in its case by showing how despite the best wishes of people (two of Tom's three owners are good people who want him to be be freed), slavery was inherently evil, and that free states were duplicitous for allowing laws to permit slavery and to prosecute those helping slaves seeking freedom. And while the phrase \\"Uncle Tom\\" has taken on a different meaning, a stereotypical \\"yes man,\\" don't overlook the strength in the actual character, or the strength and richness of Eliza and George Harris, surely two of the most non-stereotypical African-Americans to ever grace the pages of literature."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I am quite convinced that I can write nothing about this book which has not already been written. However, I would like to leave subsequent readers with a couple of impressions which may be valuable. First, if you read most books cover to cover as I do, I urge that you make an exception here. If you have never read this book before, the introduction by Ann Douglas is a bit too revealing and can spoil the story for a first time reader. In my strong opinion the introduction, in striving to be poignant and intellectual, underplays a monumentally important and simple message of the book: true strength and dignity are found in self-sacrificial love. Reading the introduction after reading the book (or skipping it altogether) would be a more profitable use of time. Second, it is a sad commentary indeed that the term &quot;Uncle Tom&quot; has become a derogatory one, according to Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary: &quot;a black who is overeager to win the approval of whites&quot; or someone who is &quot;overly subservient&quot;. To accept this usage in our own daily parlance is to deny another central and not at all subtle message of Uncle Tom's Cabin: Tom is subservient above all else to God, through his faith in Christ. His faith and relationship with God guide his life, not his earthly masters. To the extent that he cannot exhibit God's love by doing the bidding of his master, he kindly but firmly refuses to cooperate. I see in this sort of Uncle Tom a man of integrity, strength, courage, love, and tenderness. If this is what it truly means to be an Uncle Tom, &quot;to do justice, to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God&quot; (Micah 6:8, the Bible), then I would humbly and gratefully accept the label."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"This is a book that I have read numerous times and with each reading come away with something new. It is written in a plain style, the story is very easy to follow, and the message Stowe wants to relate is very simplistic, but the novel is such an emotional and powerful portrayal of antebellum life that it is a must read. I would not necessarily rate Stowe as one of the great writers in American literature, but she certainly is one of the best at developing characters and emotional scenes, which more than makes up for any of her shortcomings. If you have not read this book before or may have once years ago, it is certainly worth reading again."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"....about her being the woman who started the Civil War; she did not, of course, but her vivid storytelling and character portrayals, whatever the controversies in her handling of the pain of people she did not know, began to get the country imagining at least some of the horrors of slavery. She cracked the complacency of a people who preferred to go about their business in ignorance of the price paid for their comfort and luxury; and yet, to quote her own view of what she'd written, &quot;Nothing of tragedy can be written, can be spoken, can be conceived, that equals the frightful reality of scenes daily and hourly acting on our shores, beneath the shadow of American law, and the shadow of the cross of Christ.&quot;"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I'm a bit late in reading this classic as my high school and college English classes were probably too afraid to have us read it. I think reading it now, in my twenties, that I have a better understanding of the content. I am aware of all the criticisms for this book, but I think that the essence of its story is all too true. I think the aspect of the story that deals with interactions and treatment is probably true. After reading this book it's apparent why, at least in America, we have such social strife today. I believe how we treat each other is handed down from generation to generation, and if we treat certain people a certain way then they begin to have no choice but to behave in a certain way. This book is a strong, but sad testament to this theory. I would definitely recommend reading this book."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I read this book with a group of other eigth graders at my school this spring. At first I was very skeptical because I thought that it would just be another boring history book. It turned out to be one of the best books I have read.

I would recommend it for anyone who enjoys reading and likes to read GREAT historical fiction books, of a unique variety."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"For anyone who is picking this book up in the interest of learning about lives and conflict during the times of slavery, you'd be better advised to read &quot;Roots&quot; if you haven't already done so, or perhaps some historical non-fiction. That said, it's a moving story and grips the reader with its pain and anguish. But it's also rather poorly written, and were it not for its subject and the time period it came out in, no one would dare call this a &quot;classic.&quot; The author's tone and perspective is muddled and the &quot;Christian&quot; themes she promotes in her characters seem rather ludicrous to me. &quot;Good&quot; slaveholders are warped into demigods filled with &quot;virtue&quot; and &quot;refinement,&quot; and it's easy to see why the title character has become such a source of resentment for many people. But, on the other hand, it is what it is and has influenced a great deal of readers and our society in general, and that alone makes it a necessary read. But it can't compare to something like Alex Haley's novel, because she simply isn't on the same par as a writer."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Everything was great except for the cover was different than what they have shown here. Still the same great book though."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"....Being a child of the 60's and the civil rights movement, for many years I held the prejudiced view of this book as being one that cast the main character, Uncle Tom, in a negative kowtowing role to his white slave owners. When I finally actually read the book in my late 20's I discovered that despite what I had been told, Uncle Tom was a character to be loved for holding onto his gentleness and humanity in the most difficult of circumstances. It is well written, and you will love it if you have even a scrap of empathy in your soul.....The book I read in my twenties contained a foreword that talked about Harriet Beecher-Stowe's meeting with President Lincoln sometime around the start of the Civil War. He took her hand and said something to the effect of \\"So this is the little lady who has started this great war\\", which brought the book completely into perspective for me. The author hadn't written a book that was trying to show the slaves as animals who should held in a permanently subservient position (as I had been led to believe). She wrote a book that was used to inform the people of the nation, and especially those in the non-slave states many of whom had never seen a slave, of the tragic plight of the southern slave. She chronicled their day to day struggles all while emphasizing their humanity and highlighting their intelligence and dignity.....In the Civil War days of our nation, books were basically the only way to influence people on a large scale. This was a time when there was no TV or radio, and articles in newspapers and magazines were regularly falsified to suit the publishers' purposes. Books were shared by many and would go even into the wilderness with travelers after being passed around by the people in towns. The role books had in influencing public perceptions cannot be overemphasized for this time period. This book was probably the only way people in non-slave states could connect emotionally to plight of the slave. It went a long way towards helping to show people why the slaves had to be freed; even at such a terrible cost as waging war against other Americans. I believe this book truly influenced the development of our nation's soul in a way that no other book has or probably ever will again.....This book is truly a must read if only for gaining understanding of it's influence on the development of our country's unique identity, that of seeking to provide equality for all. Be sure to keep in mind the political landscape when the book was written as you read and you will find it enlightening."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I thought I knew everything I needed to know about Uncle Tom's Cabin. I've read the history books. I know it first appeared as a serial story in an abolitionist magazine in 1851. I know it appeared as a novel in 1852. I know it is credited by many with having pushed the nation into the Civil War. I know that it is the best selling American Novel of the 19th century. I know it is the 2nd best selling book in America in the 19th century, second only to the Bible. I know it is recognized as one of the most influential works of literature in America and set the stage for many political works that followed for quite some time. I know many of its images and terms have since served to themselves become stereotypes over the years seen very differently today, than they were in the days before and even shortly following the Civil War.So, when I saw that the novel was available on the Kindle as a free download, I wasn't sure I needed to read it. But I went ahead and I'm glad I did.There's always a temptation in reviewing a book critically, that the more popular a book is, the more tempting it is to adopt an elitist attitude that serves to further, not the value of the book, but rather the size of the ego of the reviewer. I was tempted while reading this to adopt some of this attitude.The book plays out as a Victorian morality play and it sermonizes in true Puritan and Calvinist form to seek to bring shame on both the North and the South for their direct and indirect support of the institution of slavery in America. Many of the characters are, from the perspective of a 21st century reader, contrived representations which seem very unrealistic and are designed to tug at the emotions of the reader.However, the measure of a book is not how it is read by those removed from its time, but rather those of its time. In spite of myself, as I progressed through the book, I found myself grudgingly in places, entering into the story and spirit of the book. In some ways, the effectiveness of the book, even with the elements mentioned comes from Stowe not painting things as negatively as might have been her temptation. With the notable exception of Simon Legree the main characters of the book, in the South of the slaveholder class, are presented in a somewhat sympathetic light. \\"Good\\" masters are shown for their benevolence and care for their slaves and in come cases it could be argued that these servants are better off than they might otherwise have been as free. But this works its way clearly to the conclusion that even with good masters the system itself is evil and there is no guarantee that benevolent circumstances will continue. Good masters can fall on hard times and be pressed to sell their property.I found myself, despite resisting and recognizing the in places heavy handed methods used in the book to appeal to emotions, entering often into and sensing the humanity and emotions of the characters. There is in places almost a Dickensian appeal to social justice that works quite well and makes it evident why the book had the impact that it did.In short, I enjoyed the book and feel now that I know, not only about the book but have entered into the book and seen America as it was before the Civil War. The final afterword of the author that appeals for action of all Christians (the primary target of the book) is quite effective and the arguments presented against some of the common defenses of slavery of that age are laid out and shown for the rationalizations they were.5 stars. It not only shows history, it is history.bart breen"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"After avoiding all the classic novels in my youth, I have a new interest in reading the \\"proper\\" printed story.

Read it for yourself and decide for yourself."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I checked this book out from my local library and just started to read when i got my kindle for christmas, needless to say i returned it to the library and downloaded it to my kindle for **free**.

Really shook me up. I think everyone should read it at least once in their lifetime."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Uncle Tom's Cabin, or, Life among the Lowly is an 1852 anti-slavery sentimental novel by Harriet Beecher Stowe, which she wrote as a response to the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. This novel is sometimes considered a contributing factor to the start of the American Civil War, as it brought many unpleasant aspects of slave life and the slave trade into the public awareness.The novel's events center around two slaves: Eliza, who attempts to flee to Canada with her son, who has just been sold, and Tom, who has also been sold, but who goes along subserviently. And while Uncle Tom's Cabin certainly is about Tom, it is much less about Eliza than it is about the responses of the other characters she comes in contact with.One of Uncle Tom's Cabin's main themes is the triumph of Christian love over evil, and for overtness, power and sincerity, the novel's Christian message can scarcely be topped. Eva is an obvious Christ figure, and Tom becomes one as well, but Tom is particularly noteworthy because he's one of the most eternity-minded characters in all of literature. He endures everything, as Saint Paul said, for the sake of the gospel (which he is always quick to share) - his stated reason for remaining in cruel bondage when presented with a chance of escape is to minister to the other slaves. Because of his selfless love and inner strength, he is the book's most admirable character.(It's interesting (and too bad) how the term \\"Uncle Tom\\" - now used to negatively describe a black who is subservient to whites - has become so pejorative. Stowe's Tom is a loving, strong-willed, eternity-minded character. But lax copyright laws in the nineteenth century allowed for unauthorized diluted and altered stage versions of the story (called \\"Tom shows,\\" some of which were even pro-slavery), and many people came to know Tom as a stereotypical minstrel buffoon - certainly a great number more people saw the stage dramas than read the books.)Uncle Tom's Cabin is a sentimental novel (in the literary sense), and Stowe goes for the heartstrings at every opportunity. Though the reader may not at any time, many of Stowe's characters burst into tears at the slightest provocation. Stowe herself is a preachily-involved narrator, and nothing the author has to say is handled subtlely. While Stowe's many characters debate various \\"biblical\\" perspectives on slavery, the narrator's (and the author's) views are never in doubt, and she laments to an even greater extent America's burgeoning disregard for the Bible.From a literary standpoint, Uncle Tom's Cabin is largely unimpressive, and sometimes it's a downright mess. If the novel wasn't so socially and politically relevant, it would have been lost in the mists of time with countless other sappy, mediocre novels.In the first place, there are about twice as many characters as there need to be, far too many of whom are named Tom, Henry, or George. And it isn't always easy to pin down just who the main characters are, because conscientiously-developed characters leave after a few chapters, others arrive, and some characters who are obviously key to Stowe's tale (Eliza, in particular), vanish for a hundred pages at a time, while others don't debut until halfway through the book. Many characters are flat, one-dimensional caricatures, present only to offer a particular point of view on a topic. In doing so, Stowe brings the reader into contact with every conceivable position on slavery and human rights, but it doesn't make for a particularly believable story.Secondly, the book's goings-on are equally contrived. The reader can see the hand of Stowe on every major plot point, particularly at the end, where she attempts to tie up matters with a series of heartwarming but preposterous coincidences.But this doesn't mean that Uncle Tom's Cabin is horribly written; that's simply not the case. Sometimes Stowe produces a very fine turn of phrase, and certain scenes are well done and do produce the intended emotional response. And many of the book's moral and philosophical debates hold the reader's interest because Stowe has clearly thought through the issues and educated herself on the various arguments and viewpoints.So while Uncle Tom's Cabin is not very impressive as literature, it remains important (and worth reading) because of its message and the role it played in a key era of American history."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"There can hardly be an American who does not know Uncle Tom's Cabin's historical importance, and the same goes for millions worldwide. It did much to solidify Northern anti-slavery sentiment and has been seriously credited with making the Civil War inevitable - supposedly even by Lincoln himself. However, though America's greatest bestseller ever on release, it now seems as if fewer and fewer people actually read it. This is unfortunate, because its significance alone makes it essential, but it is also an incredible story and well worth reading in itself.Those reading for historical perspective will have many assumptions confirmed but also be very surprised. Most obviously and importantly, it is easy to see why the book moved so many and emboldened abolitionists. It is easily one of the most profoundly emotional and pathos-drenched works ever; only the truly inhuman will not be moved, and many will cry. The characters seem supremely real, and we care for them as if they are our intimates. Harriet Beecher Stowe writes accurately and precisely of slavery's many evils. Much of what she says is so gut-wrenching as to be near-unbearable. Reading it is emotionally distressing and even at times almost physically painful; when something is this hard to even read, we simply cannot imagine what it must have been like to live. To think such suffering and inhumanity existed in America barely a century and a half ago truly astounds. There are many accounts of American slavery, from ones written by slaves to meticulously researched historical accounts, but perhaps no other is as deeply stirring. Even now we cannot read Uncle without being strongly moved; how much stronger must the effect have been when the evils described were current! I re-read it shortly after Barack Obama was elected, as many others doubtless did, and was affected more strongly and deeply than ever, moved almost to tears by the striking contrast and how far America has come.All this is if anything even more moving than inevitably high expectations would suggest, yet much of the book surprises because it is rarely or never mentioned in popular accounts. The biggest revelation may be that the story itself is excellent - not only moving but deftly plotted, superbly executed, and often thought-provoking. There is even a surprising amount of humor amid all the tragedy, St. Clare's wife being one of American literature's greatest comic creations. Deeply engrossing, Uncle pulls us in immediately and never lets go despite being a long, winding tale with a plethora of characters and many substantial subplots. Stowe's ability to handle and tie them together in a well-executed conclusion is truly stunning, especially in that this was her first novel. Indeed, inconceivable as it is, Stowe was no artist in the usual sense but an activist writing for practical ends. Such works of course almost never have any real literary or even entertainment value and are inevitably short-lived; this is why virtually everything else she wrote has been forgotten. However, Uncle is an astounding exception; unlike nearly all other such works, it does not come off as a hopelessly dated, artless tract. Though written without an eye to literature - nay, many would say, without literary skill - and for no purpose other than to reach everyday people, it remains an immense literary monument that has earned the admiration of uber-literary writers like Leo Tolstoy and Henry James. It has had many critics, quite a few of them scathing, but survived them all. Its many admirers still cannot pinpoint just what makes it so successful, but successful it certainly is.I submit that its greatest virtue is moving verisimilitude. Characterization is a big part; even minor characters - indeed even evil ones - are drawn so well, with such individuality and lifelikeness, that we will remember them long after reading. Many - Tom, Simon Legree, Little Eva - have long been archetypes. However, the realism is stunning throughout; Stowe made the Southern slavery system that few Northerners had seen come alive as if they had known it all their lives, and the same is still remarkably true for us though such a world cannot now be even imagined. She is very visceral, sparing no pains to show just how hard and demeaning slavery was mentally as well as physically; much of Uncle's immediacy comes from this central fact. However, she goes considerably beyond this to vividly convey all aspects of the Old South; everything from landscape to dialect is detailed believably and memorably. This is all the more incredible in that Stowe saw very little of this herself, and it gives Uncle great historical value even aside from the perversely fascinating slavery peek.This last, though, is certainly noteworthy. Popular slavery depictions now imply that slavery was homogenous in the South, but there were great differences - generally speaking, the farther South, the harsher and more ubiquitous. Many works focus on only one or a few aspects, but Stowe made sure to include all. Uncle begins in Kentucky, where slavery was most mild, and shows everything from its darkest Deep South facets to its New Orleans base where millions of slaves were brought and sold. We see the great diversity that existed in how slaves were treated and thought of as well as how they worked and interacted among themselves. Almost as importantly, Stowe makes clear that those directly involved in slavery were far from identical. Some truly thought of themselves as humane and even pious, generally treating slaves relatively well, others thought them subhuman and treated them accordingly, and most fell somewhere between them. St. Clare symbolizes this last; such a person probably never existed, as Stowe surely knew, but he is important for showing how one could have slaves while being as aware as anyone of slavery's evils and treating slaves as well as conditions allowed - could indeed even have them for a basically philanthropic purpose. Very few actually did this, but St. Clare is extremely valuable because he in many ways sees slavery more fully than anyone else in Uncle and criticizes accordingly.Here we get a good idea of just how thought-provoking the book is. It of course has many anti-slavery arguments - from theological to philosophical to political, a nuanced depiction of slavery's varying effect on politicians being one of its many overlooked strengths -, but they are now thankfully moot in America. However, though almost never credited for it, the book goes far deeper. For instance, St. Clare's critique goes well beyond slavery to include capitalism itself; so diverse is Uncle that Marx could easily be added to its long, varied admirers list. More fundamentally, very few works are so fully aware of human evil. Stowe believed all acts were forgivable and should be forgiven but was as starkly cognizant of humanity's inhumanity as any existential pessimist. Uncle presents human life as a near-unbroken series of miseries brought on mainly by avoidable cruelty and lack of empathy. Stoe indeed thought this force so strong that it could not be overcome; all one could do was piously submit. Death is the only escape and heaven the only redemption; this seems distinctly unfair on earth but is worth it in the end, as the latter is eternal, the former but a passing phase. This was the main Christian strand until the Renaissance, and it is all too easy to see how a sensitive, pious soul in a slaveowning country could turn to it. Thus, though somewhat paradoxical in that it looked to the past, Uncle was very far ahead of its time philosophically - far more so than in regard to slavery, where it only fanned flames. Such a bleak view of human life was not even remotely common in art or philosophy for several decades, becoming standard only after World War I. Stowe essentially saw worldly existence just as existentialists, nihilists, and other despair agents later saw it, but firm Christianity allowed her to bear it. This faith of course disappeared, opening a vast, gaping abyss that she managed to keep closed - an abyss that shows no sign of closing, leaving millions pining for a relative tranquility that seems nearly as unimaginable as American slavery. The character of St. Clare himself is also extremely forward-looking, seeming to step out of a Wilde or Shaw play forty years before one existed.As this suggests, though the fact is otherwise perhaps most stunning of all, Uncle has no hint of anything like a Civil War. Stowe of course wanted slavery ended but was Christian in the true and rare sense and had no taste for violence, whether it a Civil War or a slave uprising. She in fact wanted slaves to freely, piously, and - as much as was possible - uncomplainingly submit to slavery's evils and wanted abolitionists to appeal to Southerners' hearts and minds rather than attack or even force them to end slavery. Though clearly an unflinching realist in that she saw slavery for what it was and was unafraid to say so, she was startlingly optimistic and had a very positive view of human nature. This is clear even in the Preface, where she boldly states that she has no hard feelings toward those who uphold slavery, even saying they are often some of the best people she knows. She actually thought they were simply misled and did not see their unintended evil and that, if they could be made to, they would voluntarily end slavery.All this is clear in many ways - not least in the ending, where she allows the young, quick-tempered George a short act of violence that nearly everyone will find justified but in which she closes with an appeal to end slavery non-violently. Indeed, she does not even seem to conceive of violence as a solution. This is also present in innumerable references to God's Providence, Christian piety, eternal reward in heaven, forgiveness, refusal to judge, etc.; though rarely noted, Uncle is perhaps the most truly Christian of all novels. In contrast to the Apocalyptic, fire and brimstone streak that has sometimes flared up in Christianity and has now reached a fever pitch, Stowe and like-minded abolitionists focused on Jesus' essential message of mercy, pity, peace, and love. Conservatives have of course monopolized Christianity, especially in political terms, but Uncle is a stunning reminder that it was until very recently American liberalism's driving force. Jesus constantly said that the poor, weak, meek, etc. are blessed and under God's special protection, that they will be rewarded eternally for earthly trials, and that they should endure such trials peacefully - resisting not evil, turning the other check, etc. Very few Christians now point such things out, or even seem aware of them, but they epitomized Christianity for Stowe and her ilk and are Uncle's very essence. World wars, genocide, biological terrorism, and a host of other horrors have made such thinking seem near-laughably nave, and other parts of the book - especially the Victorian sentimentalism of which Little Eva is the apotheosis - also seem somewhat dated. Even so, Uncle remains of immense importance for showing how strict Christianity was not only the underpinning that let the book speak so powerfully to so many but also the prime mover of liberalism itself.Uncle Tom himself of course epitomizes this gap between expectations, the book's reality, and later history. He is Stowe's ideal slave; that he is also a master's ideal slave - at least in theory - may be ironic, and Stowe's treatment of blacks throughout is perhaps best described as condescending. Perhaps most offensive of all is that she thought it impossible for blacks to integrate into American society, assuming that a Christian republic should be made for them in Africa if they were freed. This comes across in the novel, though more subtly than other beliefs. All this infuriated many twentieth century black authors and intellectuals, and \\"Uncle Tom\\" became a byword for blacks thought to have sold out to whites. This in many ways makes Uncle more worth reading than ever and certainly more interesting. Needless to say, such reaction was absolutely unthinkable at the time; the book was almost liberalism's height, and anyone told it would some day be condemned as conservative would have likely been too shocked to laugh. This issue is far too complex to even outline, much less decide, in a review. Suffice it to say that these later views have great legitimacy, whether or not one agrees; this is the kind of thing all must decide for themselves. However, it is important to realize a few things. First, Tom was a genuine hero to Stowe; she certainly did not mean to be degrading or stereotypical but made Tom the exemplar in a book with many white characters. Many others thought the same. That later blacks would prefer a Malcolm X-like revolutionary is very understandable, but precious few whites of the era - certainly not Stowe - could have even conceived of one. It is also worth noting that the book would not have had the success and impact it did - and may even have backfired - if Tom were otherwise portrayed. There may be much to regret in his depiction and Uncle's presentation of blacks overall, but this is arguably best seen as proof of society's liberalizing rather than a fault of the book or Stowe.Stowe's Preface looks forward to a time when \\"sketches similar to these shall be valuable only as memorials of what has long ceased to be.\\" Uncle is certainly that, invaluable historically both for what it shows of a thankfully long-past era and for its own significance. In addition, it has achieved a transcendent importance that probably no one else could have foreseen; more than just a literary landmark, it is a towering Americana monument - socially, culturally, politically, and otherwise priceless. Every American should read it, as should anyone anywhere who is at all interested in slavery's dark history, Americana, or the few books that have quite literally changed the world.As for this edition, it has Stowe's Preface, a short bibliography, and a scholarly Afterword. This last is particularly excellent and all the more valuable for being written in the 1960s at the civil rights movement's height. It gives substantial background on Stowe, the novel, and the historical context but also examines Uncle in terms of current events, which makes it all the more interesting a century later. Other quality versions exist, but anyone who comes across this will have a great one."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Uncle Tom's cabin is frequently criticized by people who have never read the work, myself included. I decided I finally needed to read it and judge it for myself. And I have to say, that for all its shortcomings (and it does have them), it is really a remarkable book. The standout characteristics of this book are the narrative drive (it's a very exciting, hard to put down book), the vivid characters (I don't know what other reviewers were reading, but I found the characters extremely vivid and mostly believable - exceptions to follow), the sprawling cast, the several completely different worlds that were masterfully portrayed, and the strong female characters in the book. The portrayal of slavery and its effects on families and on individuals is gut-wrenching - when Uncle Tom has to leave his family, and when Eliza may lose little Harry, one feels utterly desolate.As for flaws, yes, Mrs. Stowe does sermonize a fair bit, and her sentences and pronouncements can be smug. Yes, if you're not a Christian, you may find all her Christian references a bit much. (But the majority of her readers claimed to be Christian, and it was her appeal to the spirit of Christ that was her most powerful tug at the emotions of her readers). Yes, she still had some stereotypical views of African-Americans (frankly, I think most people have stereotypical views of races other than their own, they just don't state them as clearly today). But in her time, she went far beyond the efforts of most of her contemporaries to both see and portray her African-American brothers and sisters are equal to her. The best way she did this was in her multi-dimensional portrayal of her Negro characters -- they are, in fact, more believable and more diverse than her white characters. Yes, at times her portrayal of Little Eva and Uncle Tom is overdone at times -- they are a little cardboard in places -- but both, Uncle Tom especially, are overall believable, and very inspiring. The rest of the Negro characters - George Harris, Eliza, Topsy, Cassie, Emmeline, Chloe, Jane and Sara, Mammy, Alphonse, Prue, and others, span the whole spectrum of humanity -- they are vivid and real.The comments of a previous reviewer that the book actually justifies slavery (because \\"it says it's no worse than capitalism\\") and that it shows that Christianity defends slavery are due to sloppy reading of the book. No one reading the book could possibly come to the conclusion that it does anything but condemn slavery in the strongest and most indubitable terms. This was the point of the book. The aside about capitalism was just that, an aside on the evils of capitalism. It did not and does not negate the attack on slavery. Secondly, another major point of the book is that TRUE Christianity does not and could not ever support slavery. Stowe points out the Biblical references used to claim that Christianity defended slavery merely to show how the Bible can be misused by those who wish to defend their own indefensible viewpoint. It's ridiculous to say that the book \\"shows that Christianity supported slavery\\". It shows that some misguided preachers abused certain Bible passages and ignored other ones to support their view of slavery.There is an overlay of the tired \\"Victorian women's novel\\" to this piece - that must be granted. For literary perfection, it will never take its place beside Tolstoy, Dickens and Austen. But it is a piece entirely of its own category. Nothing before or after it has been anything like it, and it IS a great, if flawed, novel. I highly recommend it. I give it 5 stars despite its flaws because it's utterly unique, and its greatness is in some ways is related to its flaws."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Since this was a free Kindle download, I was prompted to finally read this classic book.

One nice thing about the Kindle is the ability to download so many classics for free. I doubt I would go to the library and check out Uncle Tom's Cabin, but I would and did read it as a free Kindle download. I am glad that I did!"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I too was surprised by &quot;Uncle Tom's Cabin.&quot; I'd expected a poorly written melodrama with (at best) a tepid commitment to abolition and a strong undercurrent of racism. I was wrong. As a novel, I consider it to be better than many of its rough contemporaries (including &quot;A Tale of Two Cities,&quot; &quot;Vanity Fair,&quot; and &quot;Sartor Resartus&quot;). As an attack on slavery, it is uncompromising, well informed, logically sophisticated, and morally unassailable. It's also exciting, educational, and often funny.The book has flaws, of course. The quality of the writing is variable, as it is in the works of many greater talents than Stowe. Herman Melville is one of my favorite writers, but I'd be hard-pressed to defend some of his sentences--or even some of his books--on purely literary grounds! There are indeed sentimental passages in &quot;UTC.&quot; So what? There are plenty in Hawthorne, Dickens, Ruskin, and the Brontes, too...and lord knows our age has its own garish pieties. There are also a couple (only a couple!) of unfortunate remarks on the &quot;childlike&quot; character of slaves, but nothing so offensive as to render suspect Stowe's passionate belief that blacks are equal to whites in the eyes of God and must not be enslaved. (She also says that differences between blacks and whites do not result from a difference in innate ability, and argues that a white person raised to be a slave would show all the characteristics of one). By contrast, Plato wrote reams in defense of slavery and racialism, and yet people who point this out are considered spoilsports, if not philistines.The reviewer who claimed to have learned from Stowe that &quot;slavery is no worse than capitalism&quot; has totally misunderstood Stowe, who says that slavery is AS terrible as capitalism. To be precise, Stowe equates the horrors of wage slavery under Victorian Britain's capitalist system of production with those of chattel slavery in the American South. Her definition of capitalism agrees perfectly with that of Karl Marx, who was a pro-abolitionist correspondent for the New York Daily Tribune (and was familiar enough with Stowe to have written a piece on her). Marx said that true capitalism is defined by &quot;the annihilation of self-earned private property; in other words, the expropriation of the labourer.&quot; Marx did not consider America a capitalist state, because American workers had at least theoretical upward mobility and could acquire property. This was not at all true of the British working class when &quot;Uncle Tom's Cabin&quot; was written, as Stowe well knew. And there was nothing idiosyncratic about her opinion; contemporaneous books such as &quot;The White Slaves of England&quot; made the same connection between American chattel slavery and British wage slavery. The cruelty of both systems is what led Stowe to claim in an essay that the Civil War was not merely a war against slavery, but &quot;a war for the rights of the working class of society as against the usurpation of privileged aristocracies.&quot;As for the claim that Stowe says Christianity justifies slavery, this is either willful misreading or wishful thinking...she says the opposite so many times, and at such length, that to remove every expression of it would probably shorten the book by half (to the delight, apparently, of most of our nation's English students).Not sure who to believe? If you're interested enough in \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" to have slogged through this meandering review, why not read it and see for yourself what Stowe does, and doesn't, say?"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"This version of Stowe's classic text includes reproductions of orginal historical documents at the back, literary criticism of the text, and some of the original illustrations. The book is well-made, stands up to the stress of reading (paper is thin but not too thin, like some anthologies).As for the text-- this is the book that some say caused Abraham Lincoln to write the Emancipation Proclamation. An \\"Uncle Tom\\" has come to mean a black person who sells out to the white system-- but in so many ways, that is not at all what Uncle Tom does in the book. Stowe wrote the book to change what she saw as an unjust system, an evil system-- and at times, the text is very didactic (teacherly) and very preachy about religion. It's a fine \\"sentimental\\" book-- and a fine historical document. It's also a pretty good story. Yes, there are some places where we could just get a tooth ache from the syrup of the overly dramatized scenes (you'll see when you read about Little Eva). But it's a certain style of writing that accomplished Stowe's goal of getting the women who may not have owned slaves but who benefitted from the system (white, northern, wealthy ones) to realize the problems and move to CHANGE them.Much of what people think about Uncle Tom's Cabin actually comes from the later \\"Tom shows\\" that travelled the country-- the minstrel reviews that were not very flattering either to blacks or to Stowe's original texts. Read the book that has everyone all stirred up and make your own judgements. You might not like it-- but don't let someone else make the decision for you."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"(This is a review of the print edition, not the e-book version. I cannot comment on the electronic formatting of this edition.)A few coworkers and I started an informal book discussion group, where we'd read a couple chapters then meet over breakfast or lunch to discuss. None of us had ever been in a discussion group before. We had a quite diverse set of viewpoints and backgrounds among us, and were looking for something that would be enjoyable to read, but also provide material for discussion and debate.After a lot of searching and voting, we settled on Uncle Tom's Cabin as our first book. It ended up filling the bill perfectly.Knowing that it's taught in many schools, I expected a heavy literary \\"masterpiece\\" full of symbolism and arcane references. Instead I found it to be a fast-moving, easy to read page turner, and almost all of us in the club tended to read far ahead of the \\"assignments\\" for our meetings because we couldn't put it down. Yet it also prompted some great discussion about morality, social and personal responsibility, identity, religion, etc. Mrs. Stowe does not simply convey that \\"slavery is bad.\\" She explores the ways in which all Americans were complicit in the institution by \\"turning the other cheek;\\" by claiming not to approve yet investing financially in companies that relied on slavery for profit; simply by not speaking out against it or supporting those who did. Again, great topics for group discussion.As a group we've read a half dozen other books since Uncle Tom's Cabin, but none have provided the same combination of simple enjoyment and fodder for good discussion."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Uncle Tom's Cabin, which is set between 1840 and 1850, is a novel that brought the cruelties of slavery into American homes. It unveils how slaves, like Uncle Tom and Eliza, were treated by slave owners, like Simon Legree. Throughout the novel there's a strong contrast between good and evil, which is personified by the different slave owners. First, Tom and Eliza serve a Christian family. Tom embraces Christianity through his compassion for others, honesty, evangelism, humbleness and his obedience without compromising his beliefs. Eliza, a beautiful Christian mulatto, shows her courage and love for her son. This love becomes strongest when she escapes with him to Canada after he's sold to pay debts. In the meantime, Tom is sold to Simon Legree. Simon displays evilness in his strength, greed and brutality. After Tom's friend escapes the plantation, Tom is blamed. The plot thickens when in Eliza's journey to Canada, she literally skates over thin ice as her son's master is close behind. Overall, the book was well written and the introduction omitted need for further research. Ms. Stowe is outstanding at exposing the severity of the slavery atmosphere without today's Hollywood gore. The historical accuracy is shown throughout the novel as The Fugitive Slave Law is mentioned and Harriet provides parallels between actual people and the story's characters. However, as the introduction states, Stowe claims both that slavery is evil for exaggerating differences between races and denying similarities. Overall Stowe is noteworthy and her book should be read because it influenced attitudes towards slavery, and embeds historical events interestingly."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Uncle Tom's Cabin is one of those books that I had always heard about since I was a child but had never read. I finally read it in my 60's and am glad that I did. It was not only interesting from an historical perspective but also from a Christian perspective. You can see by what the author says at the end of the book that it was written primarily to the Christian Church to inspire them to do something about the deplorable condition of slavery in the United States. I checked to see if there was a movie made from the book but found out that there was only one silent one from the 1920's. I can understand why this is the case because of the heavy emphasis on Christianity. As a born again reformed believer I would highly recommend this book but would also understand if not everyone enjoyed it because of the religious emphasis."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"im a 14 year old girl and this was one option for a summer reading assignment i have to do for high school. history being one of my favorite subjects, i chose this book. in knowng the US's history before the civil war it gives a more indepth and disturbing look at slavery in the south. harriet beecher stowe took a chance to try to show people a new look at the brutality and cruelty behind slavery. after reading this book, i was courious is to what inspired her to write this book. it turns out she witnessed a slave named tom being beaten to death nad ran home to write about it. its a great book and i believe its a must read.enjoy!*keep in mind it was written before the civil war so its language is sometimes difficult to understand*"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"The legend goes that when Abraham Lincoln met Harriett Beecher Stowe, he said to her, &quot;So you're the little lady who started this great big war.&quot; The impact of this book cannot be overstated. By showing the kind and compassionate slaveholding families, as well as the horrors inflicted upon Uncle Tom by Simon Legree, Stowe illustrates that the institution, by its very nature, can never be kind or compassionate despite the actions of the individual slaveholders.The book begins as Uncle Tom is sold to a slave trader. Though Mr. Shelby, his master, hates to sell him because he has been loyal and Christian, he recognizes that he has no choice based on large debts he has accumulated. Simultaneously, Mr. Shelby decides to sell a three-year-old boy, Harry. Learning this, Harry's mother, Eliza, escapes with this boy and heads north for Canada. Stowe continues to outline the diverging fates of Eliza and Tom throughout the novel.Tom is sold to a kind family with a nearly divine daughter, named, aptly, Evangeline, who convinces her father to free his slaves. Before this can happen, her father is killed and Tom is sold to the brutal Simon Legree.Stowe has been criticized for her racism, which does come through in her storytelling. She often refers to the steadfast faith common to people of African decent and makes other sweeping generalities. However, this story cannot be taken out of context and one cannot disregard the era during which it was written. Stowe was heroic to depict the gamut of possible treatments of slaves, and portray slavery as nearly equally cruel no matter how kind the master. The fact remains that no matter how kind an individual slave holder was, slaves were still subjected to having their families ripped apart when dictated by economic need or by death of their masters. By not depicting all masters as ogres, Stowe's abolitionist message rings more truthfully and convincingly. Lest we ever forget just what it meant to own another person, in all its various vestiges, every high school student in America should be required to read this novel."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"The book Uncle Tom's Cabin by Harriet Beecher Stowe was written for a purpose; it was not meant to be merely entertaining for its readers. Stowe wrote it in order to show its readers how awful and degrading slavery is to people and mankind. Harriet Beecher Stowe hated the &quot;peculiar institution,&quot; and she wanted others to see why she hated it. It is an entertaining and exciting book that causes readers to feel as if they are a part of the story. The way it is written allows readers almost be able to relate to the slaves and feel the torture and pain that they felt in the story. The slave owners were portrayed as heartless devilish men, and the slaves were portrayed as their victims. Readers are able to feel emotions towards many of the characters. For instance, readers end up hating Simon Legree, the cruel slave owner. They feel pity and sadness when he treats Tom, the good, unfortunate slave, cruelly. Another example is of the feeling of love and pity that readers tend to feel towards the saintlike child, Eva. Though Stowe's writing came across as preachy at times, I found the book to be very well written with a clever plot. It is educational to its readers by helping them to see the way life was for different people in the time period in which the book took place. The book was a bestseller when it was first released to the public. It caused much conflict and uproar over the subject of slavery. In many cases Stowe's reason for writing the book served its purpose. Many people became supporters of abolition because of this book. It was interesting for me to read it knowing that it was one of the causes of our country's Civil War. I could understand why it caused so much controversy between the North and the South when I read it. Uncle Tom's Cabin is definately interesting and worth reading."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"This is an epic novel about the horrors of slavery as an institution and as a destructive element to the body, soul, family and faith of the individual being held bound.It has been said that Abraham Lincoln once met Harriet Beecher Stowe and said: \\"So you're the little woman who wrote the book that started this great war.\\" After reading this book, I believe \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" did more than nudge this great nation into taking action against such an inhumane institution.This book should be mandatory reading for all children in our great public schools. But, alas, we no longer have the guts to teach our children the truths and the horrors so well described in this book."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I don't give this book five stars, only because of three things: 1)It is rather overtly preachy, which is understandable, given the subject matter, but is still a source of potential improvement; if there were fewer asides to the reader, overtly making the point that the story makes quite adequately on its own, it would have been better; 2)the typical nineteenth-century style is occasionally ponderous, although less extremely so than most novels from that era, and 3)the author does, occasionally, reveal herself to be a woman not unaffected by the prejudices of her time, in spite of her good intentions; there are occasional references, offensive to modern ears, to &quot;inborn traits of the African race&quot;, which are actually the author's comment, not that of a character. Admittedly, the traits in question are never negative ones; still, any suggestion that there are personality traits inborn and shared by an entire race ought to be an idea of the past, even if it isn't.In spite of all that, this is a very impressive work on many levels: purely as a story, it is a fine, compelling story peopled with many compelling characters, and if some of those characters are too one-dimensional to be true, either purely good or purely evil, that is understandable in a novel that intends to be a tale of good and evil, and at any rate, not all or even most of the characters can be said to be so. Most are surprisingly well-balanced for a novel of that time period, particularly one with the sole purpose of teaching a moral lesson.Further, the novel is important as a historical piece; it is extremely worthwhile for everyone who is in any way affected by the &quot;race issue&quot; (which is to say, just about everyone) to be reminded of just WHY we still have a race issue in this country, 150 years later. Granted, no white person alive today has ever owned a slave (as a friend of mine comments, &quot;You've obviously mistaken me for someone much older&quot;,) but it is useful to be reminded of just how much hatred was sown for white, mainstream society by the institution of slavery, and just how understandable it is that those who are still, generations later, at a disadvantage from the criminal treatment of their ancestors would be resentful and bitter. At the same time, while it would do little to lessen that bitterness for blacks to read this book and be reminded of just how brutal that institution was, it might be a worthwhile reminder for those who exaggerate the current level of racism as to just how much HAS changed in those 150 years. Society may be far from just, but it would be a mistake and an insult to those who suffered slavery to suggest that &quot;nothing has really changed&quot;, an idea which the more vehement occasionally suggest.All in all, this is a very important historical novel of a time that we as a country should never be allowed to forget, and the fact that it manages to do so while still being a remarkably readable book is merely icing on the cake."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"This is a horrible Kindle edition.

This novel is sometimes considered a contributing factor to the start of the American Civil War, as it brought many unpleasant aspects of slave life and the slave trade into the public awareness.The novel's events center around two slaves: Eliza, who attempts to flee to Canada with her son, who has just been sold, and Tom, who has also been sold, but who goes along subserviently. And while Uncle Tom's Cabin certainly is about Tom, it is much less about Eliza than it is about the responses of the other characters she comes in contact with.One of Uncle Tom's Cabin's main themes is the triumph of Christian love over evil, and for overtness, power and sincerity, the novel's Christian message can scarcely be topped. Eva is an obvious Christ figure, and Tom becomes one as well, but Tom is particularly noteworthy because he's one of the most eternity-minded characters in all of literature. He endures everything, as Saint Paul said, for the sake of the gospel (which he is always quick to share) - his stated reason for remaining in cruel bondage when presented with a chance of escape is to minister to the other slaves. Because of his selfless love and inner strength, he is the book's most admirable character.(It's interesting (and too bad) how the term \\"Uncle Tom\\" - now used to negatively describe a black who is subservient to whites - has become so pejorative. Stowe's Tom is a loving, strong-willed, eternity-minded character. But lax copyright laws in the nineteenth century allowed for unauthorized diluted and altered stage versions of the story (called \\"Tom shows,\\" some of which were even pro-slavery), and many people came to know Tom as a stereotypical minstrel buffoon - certainly a great number more people saw the stage dramas than read the books.)Uncle Tom's Cabin is a sentimental novel (in the literary sense), and Stowe goes for the heartstrings at every opportunity. Though the reader may not at any time, many of Stowe's characters burst into tears at the slightest provocation. Stowe herself is a preachily-involved narrator, and nothing the author has to say is handled subtlely. While Stowe's many characters debate various \\"biblical\\" perspectives on slavery, the narrator's (and the author's) views are never in doubt, and she laments to an even greater extent America's burgeoning disregard for the Bible.From a literary standpoint, Uncle Tom's Cabin is largely unimpressive, and sometimes it's a downright mess. If the novel wasn't so socially and politically relevant, it would have been lost in the mists of time with countless other sappy, mediocre novels.In the first place, there are about twice as many characters as there need to be, far too many of whom are named Tom, Henry, or George. And it isn't always easy to pin down just who the main characters are, because conscientiously-developed characters leave after a few chapters, others arrive, and some characters who are obviously key to Stowe's tale (Eliza, in particular), vanish for a hundred pages at a time, while others don't debut until halfway through the book. Many characters are flat, one-dimensional caricatures, present only to offer a particular point of view on a topic. In doing so, Stowe brings the reader into contact with every conceivable position on slavery and human rights, but it doesn't make for a particularly believable story.Secondly, the book's goings-on are equally contrived. The reader can see the hand of Stowe on every major plot point, particularly at the end, where she attempts to tie up matters with a series of heartwarming but preposterous coincidences.But this doesn't mean that Uncle Tom's Cabin is horribly written; that's simply not the case. Sometimes Stowe produces a very fine turn of phrase, and certain scenes are well done and do produce the intended emotional response. And many of the book's moral and philosophical debates hold the reader's interest because Stowe has clearly thought through the issues and educated herself on the various arguments and viewpoints.So while Uncle Tom's Cabin is not very impressive as literature, it remains important (and worth reading) because of its message and the role it played in a key era of American history."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Of course, as a junior high school student, I found endless ways to avoid reading the classics...What a waste! Since getting my Kindle as a present (by the way, one of the best gifts ever received!!!)I've began to read and re-read many of the books that make reading worth while..This is no exception. I am about half way through the book and Stowe is absolutely amazing! She boldly creates and expertly displays her unique point of view. She takes the time to reveal the many facets of her characters. I'm in love!"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I have a love / hate relationship with the novel. Some days, I think that Stowe is unforgivably racist and cares only about preserving the souls of white people who are forfeiting their place in heaven by owning slaves. On other days, I am really impressed by the way that Stowe is working within many of the discourses of her time and creating a radical message about why slavery is unchristian, unpatriotic and unwomanly.Of course, everyone knows that Uncle Tom's Cabin was the best-selling book of its time, outselling even the Bible. It sold over 1,000,000 copies, and, for every copy sold, about 10 people read the book. For every person who read the book, about 50 saw a dramatic adaptation (possibly one of the versions by Aiken or Conway, which took away much of Stowe's message and retained mostly the melodrama and racial stereotypes). Nineteenth century America was steeped in Uncle Tom's Cabin. It was the first book to have spin-off products that are common for films today - actions figures, tea sets, dolls, board games, card games, sheet music. Uncle Tom's Cabin permeated American culture. It is speciously reported that, upon meeting Stowe during the Civil War, President Lincoln said, \\"So you're the little woman who wrote the book that caused this great war.\\"There are so many things to fault Stowe for. In our politically correct culture, all of the faults of Stowe's novel are incredibly salient: she co-opts many racial stereotypes from the minstrel stage. Influenced by romantic racialism, she sees all blacks as simple, docile, childlike, and innately Christian. She sees people who are bi-racial, on the other hand, as intelligent and discontent with their position in slavery because of the \\"Anglo-Saxon blood\\" that is flowing through their veins.But I think that what is important to focus on in Uncle Tom's Cabin is the way that Stowe created an inherently domestic attack on slavery by associating slavery with the public sphere of economy and capitalism and slaves with the domestic sphere of womanhood and Christianity.Stowe was writing during the time of the cult of true womanhood. In the nineteenth century, women were supposed to be (sexually) pure, (religiously) pious, domestic (staying in the house / kitchen), and submissive (to men). Stowe believed in these prescriptive categories for women (as you can see through the characters of Mrs. Shelby and Mrs. Bird). To her, the best people in the world are mothers and Christians, and Christ himself is a mother-figure; he is pure, pious, domestic, and submissive. In Uncle Tom's Cabin, Eva and Uncle Tom are both Christ figures and mother figures because mother and Christ are interchangeable. They are the best type of people in the world. The Quaker Settlement, where Rachel Halliday gentle nudges her family to work in harmony in a Christian matriarchy is Stowe's vision of a millennial utopia.Slavery is evil for Stowe because it is the opposite of Christianity. Christianity is domestic and spiritual, and slavery is a part of the public sphere; it is mundane. Appealing to white Northern women, Stowe shows how slavery creates problems for women: it separates mothers from their children and wives from their husbands. It is bad for the slaveholders because it corrupts them morally. Stowe also attacks the North for their culpability in Slavery. Through the character of Miss Ophelia, she shows that Northerners, while the want slaves to be free, do not want to come near black people with a ten foot pole. They have a visceral reaction to blackness. Through the Fugitive Slave Law, Northerners are helping Southerners to return blacks to slavery.Lobbying for the inclusion of Uncle Tom's Cabin in the literary canon, Jane Tompkins says of the novel in Sensational Design, that it \\"retells the culture's central religious myth - the story of the crucifixion - in terms of the nation's greatest political conflict - slavery - and of its most cherished social beliefs - the sanctity of motherhood and the family.\\"I have read several editions of this novel, and I would highly recommend the Norton Critical edition, edited by Elizabeth Ammons (Tufts University) or the new Annotated edition, edited and annotated by Henry Lewis Gates, Jr. (Harvard University). Like all Norton editions, Ammons's version includes important contextual information as well as some of the seminal scholarly essays about the novel. In the annotated version, Gates gives two lengthy introductions and useful annotations. One thing that he mentions throughout the annotations is the way that Stowe depicts Tom's relationship with Chloe. According to Gates he seem not to be very affected by their separation; when he reminisces about the past, he thinks about the white children that he misses, George Shelby and Eva St. Clare."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"This book touched my heart. I loved it! Uncle Tom was such a strong character. After all he went through, he managed to keep his faith andknow that God had bigger plans for him. I give this book my highest score and wish that I could give it more. It's definitely one of the best books I've ever read."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Uncle Tom's Cabin was written by Harriet Beecher Stowe in 1850 after the Fugitive Slave Law was passed. Stowe was very well aware of the plight of these people and she wanted to make a change. She wanted to make her feelings about the evils of slavery known to the public. She wouldn't allow people to ignore the tragedies surrounding them because it was socially acceptable at the time. Although this novel is a work of fiction it accurately displays the lives of American slaves in the 1800's. In fact, the main character, Uncle Tom, is based upon the autobiography of Josiah Henson, and other slave narratives. She also appeals to the reader through emotional pulls that are easy to identify with, as if you were experiencing what the characters were. In all, I enjoyed reading this book and I think that Stowe created a very impressive message that is still important for us to look at today."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I recently finished the novel Uncle Tom's Cabin and I thought it was a great book. It was a bit confusing at times however I still enjoyed it because it had a great message. It is a great book even today because even though the main message of the story was slavery it still shows us now how horrible it is to discriminate against any race of people.Uncle Tom's Cabin is the story of a slave named Tom. The story follows Tom through his life as he is bought and sold from master to master. In the beginning he is sold from the Shelby's because they need the money. He is separated from his wife and other people who love him. He is sold to Master St. Clare after he saves the life of St. Clare's daughter Eva. He grows very close to Eva over the years until Eva dies. St. Clare begins to free Tom however he is killed in a fight and so Tom is sold to a horrible new master named Simon Legree. Tom has to suffer through many difficulties with his new master...The book also has many small stories of slaves that add to the effect of the novel. For instance, the story of the run away slaves Eliza and George Harris. They run away to escape the terrible idea of their son Harry being sold to a different master. There are many other stories of slaves being treated horribly or running away.Stowe's novel is an amazing tale that was one of the causes of the Civil War. It showed how horrible slavery was. It showed that Negroes were humans that had feelings and were also deeply religious. Many people at the time viewed slaves as objects that were good only for labor. Uncle Tom's Cabin is an amazing novel that everyone should read."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I began this book thinking that I would just breeze through it in a few weeks. Instead, it took we a few months to complete. This book is compelling and absolutely astounding! It made me think about that time period and how it must have affected the people in the United States who read this book. This compelling story is about a pious and strong-willed man named Tom and his journey in the slave trade. He goes through immeasurable pain and suffering yet he still tries to see the best in people. As he travels from master to master his faith never waivers. Harriet Beecher Stowe's characters completely amazed me and swept me off my feet. If you are interested in reading all the perspectives about the slave trade I highly recommend \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin.\\" This story will inspire and have you analyzing the behavior of our ancestors. Go and read this book!"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"* \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin might make you a little nostalgic for the old United States. A place where the masters of commerce and the workers were right there together, each keeping an eye on the other, over the shoulders of middle management. A time when the ruling class was within grasping space of the oppressed. Stowe might make you wonder what happened to a people that could create communities in the slave quarters. Places where horror reigned absolute. How these devastated people were able to birth such a person as Uncle Tom. A character who refuses to harm another black person no matter how much the evil slaver tries to force him. This is a work of fiction, but these types did exist. To be called an Uncle Tom is negative in the black communities, but if we had Uncle Toms in the institutions of the U. S. today, black people would not suffer so. Reading Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin may make you long for another time. Of course books are supposed to make you feel. -"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Yes slavery was wrong, but it is still going on today, even here in America the greatest country in the world.

She neglects to expound about the many slave owners that were themselves Black.

I am not a strong reader, so I found it difficult at times. But, to me, it was worth every minute of my time. The story is filled with unforgettable characters that you will teach you a lesson about how to live life as you read about them. Harriet Beecher Stowe is an amazing author and makes each and every event mesmerizing and unique.I have never read a book of this genre that kept me intrigued throughout the whole novel. I normally find historical novels boring, but the author pulled me into the story and really made me realize the horror and cruelty of the treatment of slaves at that time. The message of this novel by a true abolitionist, Harriet Beecher Stowe, was clear to see...Slaves needed to be free, treated equally, and able to live their own lives!Uncle Tom's Cabin starts off with Eliza (a slave-mother) overhearing her master and a slave trader talking about selling Uncle Tom (one of the most loyal and reliable slaves on the plantation) for a large sum of money. The trader is reluctant to the deal because he doesn't believe that any slave is worth the amount of money that was offered. But when a slave boy comes in (Eliza's son) he asks if he can buy both Uncle Tom, and the little boy. The plantation owner agrees, and Eliza is very worried.When the plantation owner tells his wife that he sold their best slaves, she is not at all happy. She even suggests telling the trader that he had changed his mind and no longer needed to sell two slaves......but he assures her that she is wrong, and that even though Uncle Tom is the best slave that they have on the whole plantation, he needs the money to pay off the debt he owns to the trader. She informs him that the little boy has a loving mother but, he just acts as if he doesn't care and assures her once again that he needs the money.That same night Eliza, tells her son that they are running away and finding Canada, because the plantation owner is trying to sell him. He quickly agrees and they run off, hours after their escape when they are reported missing, a search is sent out for them, and they are seen for a few minutes but then are lost again. This is just the beginning of an amazing adventure with a life changing impact. Uncle Tom's Cabin is one of the best novels I have ever read in my entire life! I encourage you to read this thrilling and fascinating story."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Uncle Tom's cabin is a famous work of American literature, because of its historical context and its political importance as a piece of anti-slavery propoganda as much as for the story and quality of the writing. The phrase &quot;Uncle Tom&quot; has even gained some currency as a derogatory term in modern usage. The book captures and condences much of the worst elements of slavery in the south as it recounts the trials of several slaves, their owners and their families. The story is enthralling and the crossing of the ice flow remains one of the more famous scenes in literature. The story unashamedly promotes the anti-slavery position and promotes its activists Apparently this book had considerable impact in its day and although to some extent some of the thunder has since been stolen by blockbusters such as Roots, is still a powerful book."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I do respect and embrace the historical significance and effect of this novel in it's place and time. I applaud the author's goal, courage and tenacity. I loved the main character, Tom.That said, the writing style is not for me. I'm too spoiled by modern authors' constraints of being direct and succinct.I understand that in the culture of the time, a female author would find it necessary to obviate, to beat around the bush in making her (socially activist) point in order to comply with expectations of politeness and humility, to include occasional flattery of the opposition to make the novel more palatable to a wider audience and thus further her underlying goal. Unfortunately, these elements also make it very hard for \\"modern-me\\" to endure the book.All-in-all, a profitable read for the historical relevance."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"This classic is a must read.

Not so. Uncle Tom is the honest hard-working slaves of two kind 'owners', Mr. Shelby and Mr St.Clare. It is not until Tom is sold to Mr Legree that his life is filled with cruelty and ultimately death. The majority of the book, I feel, is an observation of how Christianity is a proponent or opponent of slavery depending on who is doing the interpretation. Although, Stowe's admits dramatizing (fictionalizing)the story lines off of 'real' events, I find it hard to believe the \\"happy ending\\". PBS had a great show called \\"Slavery and the Making of America\\", their website also gives a list on NON-fiction books on slavery. The truth is far more compelling than fiction."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I had no problems with delivery of the book.

Do y'all know that it was predicted by white society in the late 19th century that we would naturally die out. We fooled them. We are still here. Like a phoenix from the ashes, we rise!I recommend this book. I think it is good to remember the pain of the ancestors, and how we benefits from it today."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Throughout history, few books have garnered more controversy than Harriet Beecher Stowe's UNCLE TOM'S CABIN. When he met Mrs. Stowe in 1861, President Lincoln proclaimed, \\"So you're the little woman that wrote the book started this great war.\\" That may be a bit of an overstatement, but the book certainly had enormous social and political consequences.In the social structure that has evolved since the emancipation of slaves in this country, few labels have a more derogatory intent to the black person than being called an \\"Uncle Tom\\". We hear it repeatedly used to indicate a black person who chooses not to follow in lockstep with the direction of radical black anarchist leaders. For the life of me, I can't grasp that concept. What greater compliment than to be referred to as a man who faced such immense adversity yet who remained steadfast in his faith.I realize the argument is that Tom did as he was told and refused to stand up for himself, but that argument only portrays the shallowness of a society that has been more and more anti-Christian as time goes by. Those who would make that argument fail to see the strength and courage it takes for a true Christian to resist temptation and consistently put personal challenge into the Lord's hands.This book, today, receives a tremendous amount of criticism for Stowe's constant Christian \\"preaching\\" throughout the book. Stowe, born in 1811, is of the founding daughter generation. Her strong portrayal of Christian virtue is yet another reminder that America was founded on Christian principles. People today, in our society where Christianity is under constant criticism, hate to admit that America once was, and was intended to be, a Christian nation. At the time of its publishing, Stowe's work was criticized for being biased towards anti-slavery, but was never criticized for its expression of Christian virtues.For me, and I'm sure others, the book does have one great flaw. Mrs. Stowe was well known for accurately depicting the vernacular of a particular region. While that may add authenticity to a story, it also creates a painfully tedious read. That is the case here. This is not a book that most people could pick up and read at once. For me, it was a long daily process of 10-20 pages at a time.Here is an example of what I'm referring to;\\"I'm thinkin' my old man won't know de boys and de baby. Lor'! she's de biggest gal, now, -good she is, too, and peart, Polly is. She's out to the house, now, watchin' de hoe-cake. I's got jist de very patern my old man liked so much a bakin'. Jist sich as I gin him the mornin' he was took off. Lord bless us! How I felt, dat ar mornin'!\\"I'm sure there are readers who appreciate such authenticity, but for me, and I'm sure untold masses of high-school students who once found this on their \\"required reading\\" list, that is just plain tedious. My only other knock on the book is the \\"happily ever after\\" ending which Stowe gave to several of the main characters. For those once trapped in the bondage of slavery, I don't believe too many of them lived out that kind of scenario.That said, if you've not read this book, do so. Find a way struggle through it. Stowe gives portrayals of both sides of the slavery coin. By that I mean, she managed to portray that many slave owners considered their slaves as family members and treated them with respect and kindness, while there were also other owners who viewed slaves as mere possessions to be abused and defiled.This book may not have started the Civil War, but it most certainly had a profound effect upon society like few books in history have ever had. That fact, in and of itself, makes this book a must read for everyone.Monty Raineywww.juntosociety.com"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Uncle Tom's Cabin is a great inspiring book that shows true events in U.S. History. It is a book that shows how evil and cruel slavery really was. After Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote the book during slavery, it helped everyone understand what was happening in their world and this book turned more people towards antislavery which fueled the Civil War. Uncle Tom's Cabin shows people to be kind towards others. This is a great book about the slave days and was enjoyable to read."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I found this book very well written. It is interesting that the author chose not only to show the terrible suffering that came from slavery, but also she revealed how slavery extracts a toll on the master. Personally it exemplifies how religion can (as in many cases throughout history) support and justify cruelty and violence. This book should stir everyone at the gut level. I don't want to forget to add that I like the Modern Library Classics format. At the end of the book is discussion questions and commentary by other famous authors."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"The book is a good story, not one I would choose if I were picking on my own. My son had to read it for school, however, the book on CD was a huge help."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"This book seems quite modern in its style and content. I have heard that it was the best selling novel by an American author in the 19th century. The book was written and distributed before the civil war occurred and was read by Northerners and Southerners alike, also by Europeans. Many of the characters seem like stereotypes but It is written for the thinking person. Many of the problems of families of undocumented workers and the people that help them are being faced or ignored by society and government today. Today it is hard to imagine a slave child being sold and separated from his mother, but it is not so hard to imagine the desperate mother going to extraordinary measures to protect her child."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Uncle Tom is probably the most important single book written in the United States of America. No one is really familiar with American culture, literature, relgion, and history if she or he has not read Uncle Tom.To understand this book, I would urge people to consult Eric J. Sundquist's book New Essays on Uncle Tom's Cabin (The American Novel) and Jane Tompkin's Sensational Designs. The 19th Century world and reader that Stowe aimed at read and understood things so differently, that you will miss much without knowing how to look at this book the way Stowe wrote to them and the way they read.This book has a broad purpose: literary to decide what is wrong with the entire world and present an answer. If you follow the sweep of the book you will find Stowe takes on everything from whether the issues of the 1848 revolutions can be resolved on the side of Democracy, to the question of marital relations amogn the free and the white. The issue of slavery is not the book's only focus. It is, in fact, the solution.Stowe's real thesis here is that American Chattel slavery is the number one evil in the world, that this evil corrupts every institution in society North and South and corrupts far beyond the borders of the United States, and that no compromise with it or avoidance of it is possible.To Stowe, slavery is an abomination not just because of the cruelty, savagery, exploitation, and degradation involved, but above all, it is an abomination against God, the most unChrist-like behavior possible.Thus the relgious solution she offers is to become more Christlike in your opposition to slavery and to finally undergrow the Christic experience of dying for your sins and being reborn in Jesus Christ. That's right, in Stowe's time evangelical Christianity, rather than being a fob for right-wing politics, was practiced by some of the militant and serious opponents of slavery.Stowe creates figures that are Christlike who like Christ die rather than yield to sin and influence the others in their faith. The supreme figure is of course Uncle Tom. Uncle Tom, as a a pejorative, comes not from this novel, but from the Tom shows that blossomed in the late 19th century which were a presentation of a mock version of this story with racist minstrel like charicatures of the African American characters.In this book, Uncle Tom is a physically majestic, heroic, dignified person, whose faith and dignity are never corrupted, whose death is shown as a parallel to that of Christ in the resurrection of the souls of all around him required to eliminate Slavery. If he is passive, never disobeys his masters, and seems to have not much of a material interest of his own in life, it is because to Stowe this a reflection of his Christic nature.No doubt at best Stowe sees him as a \\"noble savage\\" at Best. There is no doubt if one reads this book and even more clearly STowe's Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin which provided documentation for this book's depiction of slavery, that it is clear that Stowe did not believe African Americans were equal to whites. Her then-current immigrationist views are expressed in the way the one intelligent independently acting Black couple presented here leave the US for Canada once they escape slavery.Yet, this book accomplished the purpose it had. It galvanized millions of Americans and more millions around the world to dramatically oppose slavery. Uncle Tom was one of the first true international best sellers. In a smaller country, where literacy was lower, and when many people bought books through private libraries where families shared books and the book was often read to family gatherings rather than by one person, Uncle Tom sold two hundred thousand copies in its first year and sold a million copies between its publication and the civil war.Stowe was honest in her afterward and in other writings to say that her description of slavery in Uncle Tom is much prettier and more nicer than slavery was. She believed an accurate depiction of slavery--Stowe had lived in Cincinatti on the board with slaving Kentucky and traveled through the South--would be so revolting that her target audience of Northern whites would not read this book.Her book launched a torrent of responses from white southerners as could be expected. However, the popularity of her book encouraged white authors, but especially Black authors to write antislavery books that responded to Stowe. Some of the foundations of Black American literature by authors like Frederick Douglass, William Wells Brown, Harriet Jacobs, and Martin Delany are essentially response to Uncle Tom.Perhaps the most dramatic is Delany's Blake or the Huts of America whose character is a double to Uncle Tom. However, Delany's hero does not submit to being sold \\"down the river.\\" He instead runs away and travels throughout the US following the same course as the travels in Uncle Tom showing how slave conditions are so much worse than Stowe showed. Finished with that business, Blake leaves the United States for Cuba where he becomes part of a group of Afro-Cubans unwilling to suffer like Christ and Uncle Tom. Like the current leaders of Cuba, they start to organize an international revolution of Slaves and the oppressed!"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"The reason why Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote Uncle Tom's Cabin was to let the North know what was going on in the South with slavery . Black families were broken apart and sold, young girls and women were taken advantage of by white owners, some were beaten to death by their owners and slaves could be treated anyway the owner wanted because they were not citizens. The white women characters cared more about the slaves than the white men. They didn't want to sell or break up families.Uncle Tom was an uncommonly good and honest man and devouted Christian. He was sold when his owner needed money. At first he was sold to a man who was ok, but then he was sold to Simon Legree. Legree was a mean man. When Tom was a slave for Legree he was beaten to the point of death. Everyone should read this book because it gives you an idea of what happened at the time of slavery."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Wow! I must say this book is just...really amazing. I would reccomend it to anyone especially anyone who is studying the civil war or slavery in school."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Uncle Tom's Cabin is a powerful novel that vividly illustrates the cruelties of slavery. The book tells of how the slaves in the pre-Civil War South, were often treated like they were less than human, and were taken away fom their loved ones and then bought and sold to be someone's property. It also tells of the gruesome and sometimes shocking treatment most slaves received. While telling of the many inhumane things endured by the slaves, Uncle Tom's Cabin also tells of some of the few slaves that had good masters and were treated kindly. But the novel goes on to explain that even a slave whom was fortunate enough to be \\"purchased\\" by a kind \\"master,\\" still prayed for his or her freedom; because just knowing what it felt like to be free, was in the hopes and dreams of every slave.The main caracter in Uncle Tom's cabin is a slave named Tom. Tom is sold and taken away from his family and friends. In the posession of his new master, Tom, for the first time, is subject to some of the worst brutalities of slavery. His religious faith is his only consolation. Tom is able to have faith through even the toughest times. The presentation of Tom in the book helps give it its meaningful influence. This well-written antislavery novel has had a huge impact on readers everywhere and will never be forgotten."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Uncle Tom's Cabin is a compelling novel of the powerful thoughts and feelings of Harriet Beecher Stowe during a time when slavery was the main aspect of life for many and the intolerable and unaccepted thoughts of others. This story is a true American classic delving deep into the hearts of citizens and challenging the authority and government of the United States in the mid-1800's. Telling of a kind, elderly slave by the name of Tom, this tale told of Tom's adventure through slavery and the cruel people involved with the practice. Concluding the novel, Tom comes to a devastating end.I thought that in this book, Harriet Beecher Stowe explained slavery in America better than anyone could have. This is partly because she lived during the time period and the war and conflicts that followed the publication of her timeless account."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Uncle Tom's Cabin is a touching book about the evils of slavery. In the story Tom, a slave, is sold to various masters who have very different personalities. One master is a very nice person who cares about his slaves. Another is a horrible man who beats his slaves and doesn't care about anyone but himself. Even though Tom goes through many hardships, he is still forgiving and follows the word of God. The novel also talks about a runaway slave named Eliza and her son. She tries to escape when she finds out that her son is being sold and desperately flees.Uncle Tom's Cabin is a great book that tells how horrible slavery is by examples of a few slaves. It showed me how hard it was for slaves to live back in times of slavery. This is a great book, but it was a little hard to follow. Harriet Beecher Stowe sometimes gets a little too descriptive and it is easy to become confused. Even so, I still think that Uncle Tom's Cabin was a terrific book."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Uncle Tom's Cabin (Tantor Unabridged Classics), book first published in 1852, is a novel every American should read and reread. Harriet Beecher Stowe, author and abolitionist, depicted life for African-Americans under slavery vividly in the characters and events of this story. I was especially moved by the heart of the true Believer in Jesus Christ even though the humiliations, hardships, and trials the people experienced during these years. I was indeed humbled reflecting on my own miserable faith compared to that they had to have had to be overcomers. Even though Stowe was an abolitionist, you could still hear her own prejudice in some of the descriptors used to move the story along.

The tremendous influence of this book on Anti-Slavery attitudes are considered to be a very real factor in leading to atmosphere which helped bring about the Civil War.

I would recomend this book for 15 or over ages, because some words are HARD for younger ages( unless your an advanced reader!"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"As a classic, Harriet Beecher Stowe's \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" deserves its status as a powerful indictment against the history of black slavery in America. With courage and insight unprecedented in her time, Stowe uses moving family tales of a number of black and white families to pillory the violence and hatred to which blacks were subjected prior to the American Civil War and thrills the reader with convincing philosophical debates that reveal the astonishing hypocrisy and weak-willed rationalizations that the white population used to justify their actions.But, as a novel, \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" is unsatisfying, overly long and poorly edited. Stowe's insistence on writing her dialogue in a faux black English dialect is unconvincing at best and is actually often irritating and distracting as it becomes more and more difficult to decipher what her characters are actually trying to say.Her insistence on preaching and using Christian church teachings and the bible as the primary basis for criticizing prejudice, racism and slavery frankly grated my sensibilities. There is plenty enough wrong with slavery and its history in America from a purely humanist point of view without resorting to what would be categorized as \\"bible thumping\\" today. (That said, I will admit that it may have been an appropriate approach to convince what she saw as her potential audience at the time).The white characters she uses to support and convey her message of understanding, compassion and her political agenda of abolition are so sugary sweet as to be positively cloying. A scene in which her primary white character, Evangeline St Clare, gathers her family and her family's slaves around her death bed in order to distribute locks of her hair to one and all was so melodramatic and pointless as to approach the level of bizarre.I would never say to any potential future reader that I enjoyed \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\". I didn't! In fact, at times, it was even a struggle to finish it. But the message, the history, the overwhelming importance and the power of the arguments conveyed by the story are more than enough reason to read it anyway. If enough people take the message to heart then perhaps the world has a possibility of avoiding repetition of events like the Holocaust, the Rwandan genocide, the rape of Nanking or the slaughter of the Muslims in Bosnia by the Serbs.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Uncle Tom's Cabin is an OK book. There are several reasons why I did or did not like this book. First of all, I liked it because it showed details of what a real slave life was like. It had an interesting plot too. On the other hand, it was disturbing to read some people's views about slavery. Also, there was some hard vocabulary in this novel, making it hard to read. Another reason why it was hard to read is because it was written over one hundred years ago. The dialect is confusing and takes a while to process. The end of Uncle Tom's Cabin is very surprising. I won't spoil it for anyone, but I didn't like the ending of the book. You would never expect it. This book, in my opinion, is very sad and disturbing, but it teaches me how lucky I am to be living in this time period. If I was asked to read this book again, I probably wouldn't. Even though it is one of the more interesting history books I have ever read, it is depressing, and I hate depression. If you're looking for an interesting history novel, read Uncle Tom's Cabin. But, if you are looking for a book to read for fun or pleasure, I would not suggest this novel."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Harriet Beecher Stowe had the wonderful luck of writing this book when she did- at the peak of American antebellum dissent. The book was obviously intended to reach a very wide audience as it is very easy to read. I give the book a low rating because the reader can predict every next step in the book, and at times it seems that Mrs. Stowe was trying too hard to evoke emotion from the reader-audience. The plot is quite simply too far fetched (with many fantastical reunions and unreal characters). The characters are portrayed as either positively saintly (Uncle Tom), or absolutely demonic (Mr. Legree), with no median. Good story for a soap opera. Bad for a classic historical novel."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"This fictional story was claimed to be of divine inspiration and was used to justify the shedding of blood...this is a prejudiced view against Southerners, who, Library of Congress Records show paid their servants better wages/profit sharing, and provided better housing than the average industrial New York worker of 1900.Mrs. Stowe, and her husband, both shared a very high view of mankind, and a very low view of God.

There is an element of fantasy to the young, blonde, child who dies, and as is with many, many current television shows, the \\"gifted\\" are always Caucasian. That fact, in and of itself, doesn't allow for the development of most of the black characters in the book. However, on the positive side, Ms. Beecher-Stowe seems a steadfast abolitionist, of sorts, and the messages of Love, and Hope, and Equality (fairness), ring loudly, and she takes great pain to \\"detail\\" the negativity that prevents the Declaration Of Independence from meeting it's mission. As a side note: It was unfortunately that Abraham Lincoln died shortly after the end of the Civil War, as the decision as to what to do with Blacks had not been fully thought out, with no chance of actualization! ere in 2012, the decision as to what to do with Blacks, still has not been made!"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I have'nt read this book yet but i am really looking forward to it. i will probobaly type more stuff later when i finish this book. i hope i will like it. :)"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I had heard of this book all my life, but never saw it anywhere and always wondered about it.

Yes, Miss Stowe did portray the inhumane cruelty of the early 1800s and, yes, she provided a quality storyline to bring these concepts to life. But, that being said, I strongly feel that her depiction of the slave holders tilted to both polar extremes. One the humanistic side she showed two sets of slave owners who, for the most part, treated their charges as nearly being part of the \`family'. In some instances the attention and care that they received even outstripped family members. This, I am sure, is the manner in which the author would have treated slaves if, indeed, they were in her charge. On the other extreme Miss Stowe depicts Simon Legree as the incarnate projection of pure evil. A cotton farmer, who by all accounts is monetarily quite successful, treating his slaves as a few steps below that of mere disposable waste. If such were the case, Mr. Legree would be forced to take most (if not all) of his profits and use them for the continual repurchase of replacement slaves for the ones he presently is mistreating. For they will soon be dead either through his own direct hand or by his continual abuse. Yes, I understand that the author did have a statement to make that literally screamed against the recent passage of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. She, likewise, felt it her mission to embolden the Northern States to take action against the dehumanizing actions of the Southern plantation owners. By using these extremes and ignoring the norm, her mission was successful. Reality, on the other hand, was slightly different. Yes, the African race were treated as mere chattel and, yes, they were subjected to a fully dehumanizing set of circumstances. But, no they would not normally be treated such that their adult life span was reduced to a few years. Regardless of the location and output of the plantation, they would not be treated to the demonized actions shown by Mr. Legree. They were simply too expensive to replace if the owner placed any value on his profits! And by being so they had little chance of being killed on the arrogant whims that are shown in this novel.The other interesting concept that is shown in this 1852 publication is the overwhelming influence that the Christian religion had on Miss Stowe's life. While I am certain that the slave population did cling to this religion as a source of comfort due of their circumstances, I doubt if it had the strong influence on other non-blacks that it had on the author. The black slaves were purposely taught by the slave holders, through various means, the full scope of Christian redemption. But they did so not for the slaves salvation but, rather, for their own selfish purposes. It provided for them a more placid, yet hopeful, group of indentured workers that would neither rebel nor disobey their owners. Without concept of an existence of a continued life after death from this horrendous existence, where all things would be completely rectified, slave owners could not have controlled such large mass of people. Rebellion and revolution would have been the rule and not the exception. Miss Stowe, on the other hand, made no mention of this form of manipulation on the owners part and, instead, saw Christianity as being a universal religion that all persons should embrace as she did.Please, for your own sake, pick up this important work and actually read it instead of merely remembering the slight reference made to it while sitting through 5th grade American history class........"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I had read this book as a teen.

Stowe enthralls readers with her vivid depictions of various scenarios relating to the wretched, corrupt establishment. Her knowledge and application of Biblical Scripture is refreshingly interwoven throughout the story, and serves to expose and convict the hypocrisy of human merchandising. Amongst the plethora of characters is my personal favorite, Augustine St. Claire, who ultimately succumbs to the crushing realization that even a \\"good\\" master is plagued with the inherent wickedness of the horrific business. Of course, the novel's title character, Uncle Tom, is a gem; enlightening the reader to true spiritual conversion and self-sacrifice, as he followed the example of His Lord and ours, Jesus Christ. Though this \\"fictional\\" work stands brilliantly on its own, it is imperative to mention that one year later, in 1853, Stowe released a non-fiction explanation, through her publisher, entitled \\"A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin - Presenting the Original Facts and Documents upon Which the Story Is Founded, Together with Corroborative Statements Verifying the Truth of the Work.\\" It seems to me an absolute necessity for posterity to own this companion piece, lest we ever forget the veracity & relevence of the original."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"This was one of those books that I didn't end up having to read in school, so once I got my Kindle and saw it was free, I figured \\"eh, I'll download it\\" and didn't think on it much after that.One day, I randomly decided to read it, and I am so glad I did.Some of it gets a little preachy--and I mean that literally, there is a LOT of Christianity in this book--but that's understandable in context, both story-wise and because of the period in history this was written.Some typos in the Kindle version, but nothing I couldn't get past."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Growing up I became aware of the atrocities that mankind can visit upon his brethren because of Harriet Beecher Stowe's book.

I think it would make an excellent movie or mini-series, if done correctly. This edition is the unabridged text, and it still resonates today as it did when first written in 1852. Sure, the N-word might be offensive, but no work of literature needs to be edited to conform to people's tastes, let alone a monumental achievement such as this 695-page novel.

This book was published in 1852. The word usage and the 'black' talk would have made the story difficult to fully grasp . So I downloaded the audio from Librivox and then read the words while listening to the audio. The book and the audio were perfectly synchronized. This made the book very enjoyable and a real treasure. This was an important book used to awaken the folks in the North and the South to the slavery issues. Quite dramatic at times, but it fit in to the scope of the book. A great way to understand our history is to visit it as close to the source as possible using books written at the time. If you can find it, I suggest you read &#34;The Land They Fought For&#34; by Clifford Dowdey.

Powerful and enjoyable."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"&quot;Uncle Tom's Cabin&quot; is not an uplifting book to read; however, it is very interesting. The book is an historically accurate look of what conditions could have been like for the slaves during the 1850's. The characters are not embellished and the plot is somewhat believeable. The slaves are portyared as people, unlike what they could have been described as during this time period. The story also describes how the South and the North had some different ways of treating people whether they were slaves or not.The points I found not enjoyable took me out of my comfort zone and showed me a darker side of how slavery could have been. Stories of families being broken up and seeing a person beat another for little reason did not give me pleasure in reading. The book gives both sides in just about everything: good slave owner vs. bad slave owner, North vs. South, black girl vs. white girl, black family vs. white family. The whole story has a deeper, darker meaning of American history.&quot;Uncle Tom's Cabin&quot; is a very good book because of its examination of America's dark secret of pain and suffering. When it was first published, this book was a wake up call for the country. By reading it at the millennium, we are helping keep the memory alive, so that slavery does not happen again in the U.S. I highly recomend this book to anyone who hasn't read it, and if you have the chance, study it."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I had heard of Uncle Tom's Cabin all my life and finally decided to read it.

All the things I'd heard about it over the years - nothing seemed to apply. The actual book itself is much more evangelistic than I expected. Uncle Tom is NOTHING like I thought he'd be. The writing is much more - idk, but it was better than I expected. She made almost all the characters sympathetic, played on the use of the omnicient narrator in such a way that sometimes it seemed she was telling secrets, other times teaching, and often just described the events and people, leaving it to you to decide what you thought.

SLAVERY WASN'T SO BAD AFTER ALL. I was surprised to find out that this book supported slavery. Of course, you have to wade through the melodrama and Christian speechifying -- about 95% of the book -- to get at Ms Stowe's thesis, but once you do it becomes clear. To Ms Stowe, slavery and capitalism are just different manifestations of evil human greed (St. Claire's speech, pp 239-241 in my edition). Old slavers who whipped their charges to death must be smiling now, knowing that they're being compared to the Rockefellers, Carnegies, and Bill Gates.Ms Stowe deems many factors that separate capitalism and slavery to be irrelevant. The fact that under capitalism families weren't separated is irrelevant. The fact that people could emigrate freely is also irrelevant. The fact that people were not forced off their farms and into the cities is irrelevant. The fact that proletariat, even in Ms Stowe's day, were protected by labor laws is irrelevant. The fact that life expectancy for the proletariat increased vis &agrave; vis farmers is irrelevant. The fact that the proletariat were not chosen for racist reasons is irrelevant. The fact that a worker could become an entrepreneur and eventually a capitalist is also irrelevant.2. CHRISTIANITY DOESN'T CONDEMN SLAVERY. Ms Stowe does a fine job (inadvertently) of showing that Christianity contains doctrine that supports slavery, and no doctrine that outright condemns it.3. AMERICA IS FOR AMERICAN INDIANS. Ms Stowe states at the end of chapter 43 that Topsy, after receiving a decent Christian upbringing, became a teacher in \\"her own country\\" -- Africa. Ms Stowe believes that Africa is Topsy's country because she is descended from Africans, and conversely that the United States is not Topsy's country. Of course, if one were to apply the same logic to everyone in the U.S., only native Americans would pass the test. Pack your bags everyone!"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"absolutely tedious, over-wrought--morality tale one of those books they make you analyze to death in english class. not worth the money"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"This has to be one of the most poorly written books I've ever read.

So far I have found myself in tears while reading. I recommend everybody read UTC, it's a chilling look at the world our ancestors dealt with. Truly an eye opening book."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Written in response to the Fugitive Slave Act, Harriet Beecher Stowe never imagined that her book would be as popular as it became and continues to be. She plays the part of an omniscient narrator who serves as story teller most of the time and preacher during lulled moments of deep thought. She provides a rather complete view of slavery, involving bounty hunters, true work climates of different kinds, acquiring and selling of slaves, and the trials and tribulations that had to be suffered during this period of American history. Her outspoken ways are seen in more than just her denouncement towards slavery. She, very cleverly, allows females (or feminine-like men) to be the heroes of the book. Powerful females such as Mrs. Shelby, Aunt Chloe, and Cassy riddle the pages with solutions and decisive steps towards a better tomorrow. Eliza Harris leaps chasms to save her son and Eva gives the ultimate sacrifice in a Christ-like death to emphasize the choking conditions of slavery upon the pure. Even Tom, although he is male, has his feminine traits. He is the caretaker for little Eva, he does not engage in conversations of male regard, drink, or have aggressive male tendencies. He lives his life in his Bible and watches over children.Similar to this above point, Stowe has, effectively, created caricatures out of all of her characters. To cover the extent of slavery through her eyes she had to force traits that are not always found in individuals (rather in groups) into a singular entity. So, for example, Simon Legree is the harsh example of a cruel master. His sympathies do not exist and he only wishes for larger hoards of cotton to further his campaign of sin through life. He lives in a home that reflects his black heart and is generally presented as a man that could be despised by all. This is adversely reflected by the heavenly and angelic Eva who is the epitome of Christian goodness and hope. Her life is full of clean white linen only stained by her thoughts of the \\"peculiar institution\\". Even the wild Topsy is tamed under her gentle touch and love. Her father, St. Clare, and characters like Mr. Shelby are somewhere in between. They don't like the idea of slavery, but they do very little about it because they are stuck within it. Their benevolence is only tainted by their ownership of men and women.Uncle Tom is our main character and Stowe-declares him the \\"hero\\" of the story. He is child-like, simple, and as Christian as you can get. Even on the Legree plantation he gets the title of \\"Father Tom\\" towards the end of the novel. He gives thanks to the simple facts of life that he is alive and well and relatively happy even if he is separated from his family and those he has known all his life. He never has a poor word to say about anybody and he is so mild that we cannot help but feel for him when he is sent to Legree's plantation. We celebrate his crowning victories of Christian living and regret that they do little to change the world. He is the reminder that individuals cannot change things easily, but groups of people can. His message was carried on the wings of Stowe's novel to a million readers not only in America, but swiftly around the world.When the book first appeared in serialized form and then was received upon the world as a novel there was much criticism and upset. Southerners raved that Stowe was a liar. Unfortunately it has become a stark fact that a lot of what she spoke of in her novel was true. Whether she received it from a direct source (like Josiah Henson's narrative) or was assumed from stories of helping slaves with the Underground Railroad, she was not a liar. Her characters might have been extremes, but she was not lying about the most important fact of the novel itself: that slavery is and always will be wrong and inappropriate. Even during the terrible years of slavery, Americans have always been uneasy about the contradictory nature of slavery. Here is the country of freedom and liberty and we hold men and women inside the confines of chains, brutality, and removal of certain inalienable rights. Our shame shows in the criticism that follows the novel in this edition. More modern criticism is also provided that investigates the literature more so than just the time period.My main concern is Stowe's closing comments to her novel where she emphasizes that the slaves should return to Africa, to make it a better land, more civilized and just instead of staying in America and proving to the world that enslaved them that they are better than what they thought. How many slaves could still speak Nigerian? How many would be able to eke a living in any of the multitude of countries in Africa? Stowe's 'shoving off' of the prior slaves is indicative of a Northern attitude at that time. They would help the slaves, but it would seem that that was their limit. After it was the desire to get them off their land. It's a curious ending to the book considering how firm she was on the subject of emancipation and freedom for all."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I realized recently that I needed to read this book. I was woefully ignorant of its role in the U.S. anti-slavery movement until I attended a talk last summer by filmmaker James LaVeck, who recounted the tremendous influence this book had when it was published. Hundreds of thousands of readers in 1852 got the clear message that better conditions for slaves would not suffice--rather, that slavery itself was inherently wrong.Cruelty and family separation and compassion and sacrifice...Uncle Tom's Cabin is a tear-jerker, even though I'm not Christian. Or perhaps *because* I'm not. (There's a lot of talk by the protagonists of the comfort of the promise of heaven...)I see now how unfair it is that \\"Uncle Tom\\" came to be an accusation of subservience. To the contrary, Stowe's hero, Uncle Tom, refused his cruel master's orders to harm other slaves.I wish I'd been assigned to read this book when I was in school, and taught about its role in history! Can parallels be drawn between the idea, back then, of \\"Christian slavery,\\" and the idea, today, of \\"happy meat\\"?At the time when Beecher Stowe was writing Uncle Tom's Cabin, people calling for slavery's abolition were few in number, and were considered radicals. Extremists. Today, people who boycott meat and animal products are viewed similarly. But I take heart from the fact that attitudes change...and now, our society looks back upon the institution of human slavery with horror. Future generations may look back at our institution of raising animals for food in a similar way."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Reading this book opened my eyes and heart.

It also gave me a glance of the way the Underground Railroad worked. It was truly amazing. Don't wait until you reach my age to read this book."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I was a history major, an avid reader of American fiction and yet I turned fifty without ever reading \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin.\\" Since I'm now engaged in a review of American literature, I thought it was time to right this wrong.This is not a literary review. If I were to look at this book from a writerly perspective, I would find much that is wanting. The narration is wobbly and strangely third and occasionally first person, the sentence often poorly crafted, the tone changeable - overheated one moment and listless another. Yet or maybe because of these writerly problems, the novel comes across as a historic document, the story of a white northern woman who ached to convey the horror that the American white nation had denied, ignored or excused. And here the novel succeeds masterfully, making the reader feel the suffering of families torn apart, lifelong relationships shattered and a people degraded, humiliated and disregarded.These aren't great, deep literary characters but they convey an often subtle understanding of how slavery was so damaging to everyone it touched and that was all of America at that time. There is Mr. Shelby a kindly slave-owner forced to sell his long-time slave and butler, a man he grew up with and in the sales transaction with slave trader Haley, you see that the way slavery turned humanity into cold, calculating profiteering. We get a portrait of northern arrogance and racism with Miss Ophelia. She overcomes it but we understand that while many in the North abhorred the institution of slavery, they didn't necessarily want to come in contact with black folk. George, Eliza's husband who escapes before she does, articulates a black pride and a courageous sense that his life as a slave isn't worth the risk of dying escaping to freedom.But the character who occupies the heart and soul of the book is Tom, the Christ-like slave. He is a noble, dignified, spiritual figure who does accomodate his white masters but only up to a point. Tom refuses to obey Simon Legree's call for him to whip fellow slaves. He loses his life in that refusal and yet that character's inheritance is one of spineless accomodation. Blace men who don't stand up to whites are characterized as Uncle Toms and yet he lost his life standing up to a white man. Was that revolutionary message too much for people to bear?"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"The book is in great condition, but it's not the same edition as the one in the picture. This isn't really a problem for the class that I'm using for though. Thank you and sorry about the late review."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I now know why our public schools only talk about this book, instead of requiring students to read it! Although it measures up to its anti-slavery theme, it has another major theme which is, \\"No matter what circumstances you find yourself, the important things in life are knowing Jesus and treating other people properly.\\" Uncle Tom reflects his faith in good times and in bad, even when facing death. Although the book is fiction, Harriet Beecher Stowe reveals in her closing remarks, that all of the story-lines are true accounts of real people that she learned either 1st or 2nd hand. Uncle Tom's Cabin is a wonderful treasure."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"This classic is a great read for everyone from classic literature enthusiasts to those who strictly read for pleasure.

I am very satisfied with it. I certainly got a very good deal. I am a happy camper!!!"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I had never read this book as I always assumed it was just too \\"classic\\" to appeal to me, I have applied this logic to several other classics and am now realizing I am completely wrong.Several of the reviewers have listed the Christian views put forth within this book by Mrs. Stowe and the fact that she does get a tad preachy at times. They also mentioned the character generation and the depth she created. I'd like to delve into a different aspect of the book though.Why is this book continually on the \\"banned\\" book lists? Written 5 years before the Civil War, Mrs. Stowe puts to paper the life and treatment of slaves during that time. In the biography of the book she states that while the character names are fictitious, the situations and events are real as witnessed by her, her husband and others of that time. Uncle Tom is an amalgamation of several slaves she had known. So why is this book \\"banned\\"? The only reason I can think of is the abundant use of a now socially unacceptable word, in news media it is only referred to as \\"the N word\\". If that is the sole reason for banning this book then, I put forth that whomever is \\"banning\\" this book has not actually read this book with any attempt at looking beyond the words. The spiritual message is obvious, as is the notion of hope carrying one through life. But, should the reader look just a bit deeper one will find the contrast of human nature, black and white.Uncle Tom carries himself through each owner as a proud family man. His thoughts are never far from his wife and family he was forced to leave behind at the beginning of the book. His treatment of others, regardless of age, race, color or social standing is a testament to the goodness in his heart. Throughout the book it is the black slave that is portrayed as the more humane than the white owner. The black slave that identifies the truth behind the egocentric behavior of his master. The black slave who perseveres when all others would give up hope. Even during his time with Simon Legree (who is without a doubt the template for evil characterization), Uncle Tom is able to hold to his beliefs, defy Simon, instill hope and humanity in his fellow slaves and assist in the escape of two slaves. Uncle Tom is so solid in his belief it even effects Simon Legree and the reader is left to decide if it was enough to soften his position, even if just a little.In contrast, it is the white owner that believes the slave cannot attain any higher place in life than what they are so graciously supplying. The white owner who believes that educating the slave is pointless as they would not know what to do with the knowledge or that they would just parrot back the information to please their masters. The white owner who believes the means of the economy and standard of living justifies the end result of slavery. Throughout much of the book Uncle Tom is treated fairly well but the white owners cannot see past their own socially accepted idea that the black race is meant to be owned and they are doing them a favor. The horrors of a slaves life is only lightly touched on until Uncle Tom is sold to Simon Legree. From this point, Mrs. Stowe hold nothing back in description of Legree's opinion and treatment of the slave. His true belief the slave is no more than an animal destined to perform manual labor for his master. And in the case of female slaves, of course Legree believes the more attractive females are for his personal pleasure as well.Uncle Tom's Cabin should be read by everyone as a great piece of literature, a source of inspiration, and an example of what humanity was and what it should be. The reader must flick the switch to turn on his/her brain and capacity for thought before reading this book, if that is done then the reader will find an enjoyable first rate story to read and share with others."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"This book took WAY longer to finish than it should have simply because the first half was terrible reading. Mrs. Stowe held to the conventions of 19th century popular reading by making everything overly melodramatic (half the time I was asking myself what all the crying was about) and making dialogue incomprehensible by trying to imitate southern accents in her writing, which flopped horribly. Not to mention that some passages and characterizations regarding slaves were so offensive that I honestly thought about not finishing this book. But around page 200 or so, things began to change. I started to pierce through the dialogue and characters started to become interesting and tragic. Truly, the fulcrum by which this book turned from bad to good was in the tragedy of the little girl Eva, who dies at such a young age, but is so Christ-like in those pages that I challenge anyone not to get even a little misty-eyed once she passes on. After that, things began to pick up, characters, like Uncle Tom, began to take on a nobility of character that made the uphill climb through the first pages worth the effort. This certainly won't be a favorite book of mine anytime soon, but I now see how this book had such a huge impact on the thoughts and deeds of the Northern U.S. prior to the Civil War. In short, get past drudgery of the first 200 pages and you will find a gem of a book."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Uncle Tom's Cabin was not a good read for me.

This can be overcome while reading with the use of highlights."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"In her abolitionist novel Uncle Tom's Cabin, Harriet Beecher Stowe appeals to the humanity and faith of her audience in order to communicate the appalling nature of a slavery-reliant nation and advise opposition to such a system. She frequently departs from describing her characters' plights to comment directly to the reader on her intended moral message of the particular passage. Over the years Uncle Tom's Cabin has remained an extremely popular and controversial work due in no small part to Stowe's unique writing style, although the readers she addresses in her heartstring-pulling asides have changed.The primary message of Uncle Tom's Cabin is a heavy-handed suggestion that the enslavement of another race goes against Christian ideals, constituting a vehement reprimand of the entire system of slavery. This system included not only the plantation owners of the deep South and the domestic slave-owners of the more northern slave states, but also the whole of the nation supporting the slave trade. She appeals to everyone from political proponents of the new Fugitive Slave Act to northerners claiming abolitionist sentiments who failed to actively oppose the institution subjugating their fellow Americans. Her rebuke is reiterated throughout the text, varying in tone and candor. Secondary moral pronouncements appear with lesser frequency in the course of the novel, augmenting Stowe's anti-slavery campaign with implications of a need for fair treatment of blacks whether slaves or not, as well as consternation for those who do not share the religious sentiments of the author. However, these supplementary assertions cannot compete for the reader's attention with the omnipresent call to end slavery, recapitulated in nearly every scene and with every character pondering the morality of slavery or bemoaning the conditions of a slave-based society. Her call to arms to combat slavery rallied thousands of her compatriots to join abolitionist societies, vote against pro-slavery measures locally, and even name their daughters after the book's young heroine of the slaves' cause. International readers were similarly enthralled by this hard-hitting personal account of the evils of slavery in any form.The author's tendency to break away from her story to lecture her audience directly constituted an explicit moral compass pointing towards a proper course of action in efforts against a terrible system of which they were supporters, whether it was through participation or inaction. She deliberately plays on the emotional weaknesses of her intended readership as if \\"it were your Harry, mother, or your Willie\\" (page 46), and in another case reminds a different segment of her audience that \\"good brother of the Southern States... we have some inklings that many of you, under similar circumstances, would not do much better\\" than an Ohio senator who purportedly supports the Fugitive Slave Act but cannot help assisting a fugitive mother and her son (page 81). Her use of the second person is nonstandard for a work of fiction, and introduces a form of politically charged literature that retains a gripping narrative alongside its activist agenda. She mobilized readers who would have otherwise ignored abolitionist writings by appealing to them on a personal level, inciting a desire to take action against slavery rather than tacitly accept it as a necessary evil. Evidence of the work's persistent significance in today's society is abundant in the many thousands of high schools where it is now assigned reading and the fact that it has been translated into thirty-seven languages since its publication in 1852 (according to W.W. Norton and Company).Harriet Beecher Stowe's novel has affected its readers deeply from the time of its appearance, first contributing to the instigation of a massive change of popular opinion on slavery and as the years have passed serving as a reminder of where we have come from as a nation. Her unique style of blatantly instructing empathy and preaching morality have added to both the work's widespread impact and the controversy surrounding it."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"The story flows well thoughout this book.

Having recently visited the home of Harriet Beecher Stowe, I became interested in why she wrote such a book, and the more I read, the more I understood the terrible conditions of slavery that our country allowed in the years leading up to the Civil War. I can see why this book incensed so many people to rebel against the practice of slavery and why they fought so hard to rid this country of it. According to something I read in her home, it is said that President Lincoln, upon meeting her, said: \\"so you're the little lady that caused this great war...\\" After reading this book, I can agree - it surely upset and angered many people to fight for the abolition of slavery."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"MY 6TH GRADE TEACHER READ THIS TO THE CLASS BACK IN THE DAY.

I am enjoying it thoroughly."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Uncle Tom's Cabin is a very good portrayal of America in its pre-Civil War Slave Days. Stowe writes her characters to be believable and covers each archetype of thought/attitude toward slavery that existed. There are those today who read her book and call is racist and prejudiced, but this controversy is unfounded. I came across a letter penned to Stowe by Charles Dickens in which he tells her his regard for the book but that she possibly \\"seeks to prove too much\\". Read IN CONTEXT, it is not racist at all, but a VERY good eye opener to general thought and sentiment during a dark part of American history....Stowe writes her characters well, in all their humanity, makes you love them, hate them, feel for them.... There will be times when the reader may laugh, and times when the reader will cry, but it is a VERY worthy book of reading time, no matter what your penchant is for reading.....This version is good.

The storyline depicts the lives of plantation farmers and their slaves during the Antebellum Period.Mr. Shelby, a Kentucky farmer has accumulated a large sum of debt and is in jeopardy of losing most of his assets. He and his wife have a very good relationship with their slaves, but are forced to sell both Uncle Tom, their loyal servant, and Eliza's son, Harry. Eliza decides to runaway with Harry northward using the Underground Railroad and tries to convince Uncle Tom to join them. Uncle Tom instead remains and subsequently is taken to a boat on the Mississippi River heading to a slave market to be sold. While traveling down the river, Tom meets up with a man and his daughter, who befriend him, and the daughter persuades her father to purchase him. When they return to their home, Tom becomes a priceless addition to the household. When the little girl dies, Tom is sold to an evil plantation owner, Simon Legree. Tom's faith is constantly being tested and a surprising turn of events finishes out the remainder of the story.The book displays many of the hardships of slavery. The author was able to show the humanity of the African American as well as the inhumanity of the slave owners. The narrative captures the brutality of human enslavement during that period in our country's history, while reinforcing the belief that faith will overcome these travesties. I would recommend this book for anyone who enjoys a sense of adventure as well as an interest in the Antebellum Period leading up to the Civil War.By: Connor Miles1-13-10"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"This is a vivid, extremely moving, dramatic adventure story based on accounts the author heard from escaped slaves and the missionaries who helped them. Unfortunately, it was written by a white woman and has a lot of references to Christianity in it, so you sure as heck will NOT be given it to read in a college classroom, at least, not in my state (California). On the contrary, the book has been branded as racist, as the other reviewers note. So avoid being excommunicated from the intelligentsia! Don't even pick it up!....But if you haven't been scared away yet, let me tell you a little to whet your curiosity: the story begins when a Kentucky plantation owner, who has speculated unwisely, finds he must sell two of his slaves to pay off debts he owes to an unscrupulous (obviously) slave trader. One of the slaves is Uncle Tom, the plantation's highly competent and honest overseer, and the other is a handsome, clever little boy who will make a good house servant. The plantation owner's wife, a good woman who has taught the slaves to read, can't believe this is happening - didn't her husband promise never to sell any of them? - and when the little boy and his mother escape, the wife and everyone on the plantation cooperate to slow the trader's chance of catching his prey. But the slave trader is on horseback and the woman and her boy are on foot. Ahead of them also is the wide river, half-choked with ice. How will they cross?Meanwhile, Uncle Tom has decided not to flee: if his being sold will prevent the sale of the other slaves on the plantation, then it's his Christian duty to go along quietly, he feels. The plantation owner's wife makes a solemn promise to find Uncle Tom again and buy him back, and her young son, galloping in at the last minute, even more vehemently promises the same. Will they ever make good on their promises?Luckily, on his trip down river to the place where the slave auction is to be held, Uncle Tom meets up with another plantation owner and his little girl, who takes a liking to Tom and asks her daddy to buy Tom. And so Tom ends up, for a while, with this family. This plantation owner is a highly sensitive, honest man, who nonetheless owns slaves. How is this possible? We learn about it, and his rationalizations, as time goes on. He is bringing home with him his sensible Methodist northern cousin, who of course abhors slavery but who, nonetheless, is in some ways more prejudiced against blacks than the southern slave-owners are. She has taken on the task of getting the plantation's household in order, because the man's wife, a spoiled, selfish beauty, has no time for anyone other than herself. How will the Puritanical northern lady cope with a household of \\"shiftless\\" southerners? And whose - northern or southern - way of doing things is really better? This is one of the more amusing parts of the story.I don't want to go too farther and give any spoilers. Suffice it to say there is lots of excitement, including shoot-outs and (supposedly) haunted mansions. The characters are NOT two-dimensional but are quite satisfyingly lifelike, and there are many more than I've mentioned here, including the infamous Simon Legree, the brave but tragic Cassy, teetering toward insanity, and perhaps the most attractive to anyone who loves children, little Topsy. The plot may seem extreme and melodramatic, but the most of the incidents, such as the crossing of the river hinted at above, are taken from true life. Stowe gives us an exhaustive, contemporary survey of the institution of slavery, describing the laws of various states at the time, how the auctions were conducted, and what life in the Antebellum South and North was like. I found her depiction of the Quaker settlement especially interesting.Stowe lists all the arguments not only of those who favored slavery but also of those who thought it must be tolerated for the sake of the Union, and she rebuts these arguments without insults but with moral truths based on Christian law. She does not spare the Christian pro-slavery faction: on the contrary, they are her primary target. This is religion in one of its finest uses.Uncle Tom is not a dupe or a character written to encourage black people to submission: his reasons for submitting, when he does submit, are morally admirable. Towards the end, he means to escape from Legree's plantation but, after having a vision of Jesus on the cross, is so transformed that he chooses not to abandon the other slaves, but to stay and offer what aid he can to them. He is, as many have said, a martyr or \\"Christ figure.\\" This implies that we are to see him symbolically and I'm sure there are many who don't think such people really exist. This is not true, as history shows. I myself know two people who might very well die for their ideals the way Uncle Tom did: one is a Christian and the other follows the principles of ahimsa as taught by Gandhiji. And, unless we a cynics, don't we all in our hearts wish that, in similar circumstances, we would die bravely for our fellow man?Stowe is not a racist. She makes many of the observations that appear later on in 20th century black literature: that it's foolish to call grown black men \\"boys\\" and that black and white southerners lived together and were codependent in a way that northerners can't really understand. It's true, she makes many quaint references to the differences between the races - she contends that Africans are morally superior and better Christians while whites are more active and assertive - but that was a common way of looking at things in those days, and who among us doesn't still compare, for instance, the French character with that of the English, or red-heads with blonds? Although the mulatto slaves were described as better-looking, this was given as the reason they were sold at a higher price. Stowe in no way suggests that the fully African characters are stupider. Uncle Tom is, once again, the plantation's overseer, and Topsy, the little, abused, fully-African girl, learns to read very quickly, and can memorize with near-perfect recall.And may I say, it really is unreasonable to apply modern standards of political correctness to all of past history. Who among us has lived through anything comparable to what these people lived through? They were familiar with hardship, and death, and grief, to an extent few of our pill-popping, screen-mesmerized generation are. Who are we to so lightly dismiss what they held to be a work worthy of great love and respect?(Actually, this is a review of the Books on Tape version of Uncle Tom's Cabin, read by Rebecca Nicholas - a really excellent reading.)"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I know this story has gotten a bad reputation recently but it should be viewed in the context in which it was written. It was really a brilliant idea by Harriet Beecher Stowe because she came up with a setting and characters that people could easily relate to. At this time caucasians couldn't even acknowledge that African Americans were human. The author showed the humanity of the African Americans and the inhumanity of the slave owners in such a deeply moving way. I found it so touching that I cried through half of the book. Give this story a chance and decide for yourself."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I read Uncle Tom's Cabin a few years ago, and was genuinely touched. I saw immediately why it became one of the most influential books in the history of our country, and possibly the world. The story of Uncle Tom is sure to leave you changed, whether you are black or white, racist or humanitarian. It really explains how different people viewed the institution of slavery. After reading this book, many die-hard proponents of slavery gave up defending it. And abollitionists were fired up more than ever before. If you read only 5 books this year, let Uncle Tom's Cabin be one of them. You'll never look at slavery, US history, or the plight of black people the same!"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I bought this book on CD for my son who is reading it in class. It really helps to comprehend the book when you have a really good reader like on these CDs. They had a good idea in cutting the chapters into 1 or 2 minute tracks, so you can easily skip ahead. Unfortunately, when you're trying to find the beginning of a chapter, it's almost impossible because they weren't careful to put the beginnings of chapters at the beginnings of tracks."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"This book was a refreshing antidote to modern day bias. During a time when ideology and mechanics take precedence over truth and objectivity, it is refreshing to read about slavery's impact on various levels of society; from clergy with political agendas to blacks who also profited. Few today would disagree that slavery is a terrible blot on American History, but Mrs. Stowe's book does a great job of portraying people as \\"people\\". Black or white, clergy or not, humanity has inherent weaknesses - and strengths - that are not confined to any one culture or society."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I wasn't ready to enjoy this novel and the first 60 pp reinforced this prejudice. The beginning is filled with Stowe's rendition of slave's speech--\\"ah's gwyne ter make corn pone fer Mas'r\\"--which most modern readers will find demeaning. Fortunately this tones down.As a non-religious person I have a low tolerance for preachifyin, but it bothered me less as the novel progressed, as it became obvious that the most effective argument against slavery at the time was righteous Christianity. The issue was not the equality of the races, though Stowe does allow for that (not bad for 1850!), but that a Christian should not own humans, period. Whether the slaves were happy-go-lucky, sentimental, childlike, superstitious--all these supposed attributes of one race or another--all these were irrelevant to her.Through the character of St Clare she argues that the greater sin of slave owners was their hypocrisy rather than the ownership per se. That owners might claim justification from some obscure passage in the Bible was an outrage. Better to simply admit that you hold slaves because you have the power to do so, and it makes your life easier. If you are to be wicked, admit it at least--don't hide behind some nonsensical religious rationalization. If the slave owners could be honest about their reasons, then there might be hope of winning the moral argument.The characters are one-dimensional--pure good, pure evil, not much in between. Most are what we now see as stereotypes. They merely function as tools of the plot and the point. What I didn't expect was that the story itself would be as exciting as it was. It moves right along. This overcomes the preachiness and the simplicity of the characters, and is the reason so many read the book. Even for all its patronizin and preachifyin, it's a page-turner.As others have noted it is amazing to see how \\"Uncle Tom\\", portrayed as noble and saintly, has become such a term of derision.Finally, if you are going to read this, don't read the Introduction until after you've read the novel, as it gives away several plot points that you are better off encountering for yourself in the novel."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"This particular book was recommended by a past professor that I consider my mentor. As I am studying to be a Professor of Literature, I thought surely this book would satisfy some of the historical questions I had about the plight of the negro slave. While the book can connect contemporary readers with knowledge of the antebellum south, the writing itself was way too pious. Stowe was the daughter, wife, and sister of preachers and it is easily seen in her writing. While the book has many redeeming qualities, it seems too much like a 700 page church sermon...NO THANKS. While it was good enough to finish it was still TOO tedious."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Uncle Tom's Cabin, or Life Among the Lowly was a profound fictional, yet real account of slavery in the deep South. I thought I knew the horrors of slavery, but I was sorely mistaken in that regard. After reading Uncle Tom's Cabin, I felt I had a new knowledge of the Pre-Civil War South.Not only was the story both uplifting and heart-wrenching all at once, it was extremely well-written. I thought I would have an immensely hard time reading and comprehending this nineteenth-century best-seller. Much to my surprise, however, I got into the writing without much difficulty. Because of this, I was able to fully understand (without totally believing) what pains were inflicted upon those of African American blood in the days of slavery.Stowe's characters are almost implausibly good or evil. This extremity helps to make her point more clear to the reader, and helps them to relate to Tom, Eliza, Harry, George, and all the others all the more. I also thought interesting the way that Stowe speaks to the reader directly, asking them what they would do in such a situation. The fact that the author would express her passions in such a time of national turmoil makes me respet her tremendously. It is one thing for one to write a book on the tragedy of slavery today, when all is said and done, but quite another for one to tell such a tale when friends are fighting friends, families even dividing over the very same issue.Uncle Tom's Cabin, or Life Among the Lowly is a novel that is most definitely not novel. I would highly reccomend it to anyone with the capacity to feel for the poor people, who, had their lives not been chronicled, may still be enslaved and part of such a terrible system. I don't think anyone's collection of knowledge of slavery or that era in general would be complete without knowing of the triumph of Eliza, George, and Harry and the story of Tom's physical defeat, and spiritual prevail."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Uncle Tom's Cabin is about the evils of slavery from many different sides of the issue. The main character (Uncle Tom) is a good, always obedient, Christian slave that's master has to sell to pay off a debt. He has several masters, one very kind, one just normal, and one very brutal. It reallly shows how horrible slavery was. After reading it, it became obvious to me why there was a war to put an end to this terrible atrocity. Uncle Tom shows us how it is possible to do the right thing, face horrible punishments (being beaten almost to death), and still love everyone, including his evil master which he also forgave. It was one of the most memorable books I have read. I recommend it to everyone and I think it should be required reading for all schools. I think this book definitely deserves five out of five stars."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I had never read this before.

Excellent."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I decided to get more perspective on the Abolitionist movement. This book had been on my &#34;to read list&#34; for years but I never got around to it. As a &#34;free&#34; choice on Prime, I had no excuse. What a timeless read! Stowe draws the reader in, convincing them of their rightiousness, then juxtaposes a convincing argument to humble the most arrogant. No wonder it was such a runaway best seller! I read this as a companion to Twelve Years a Slave by Solomon Northrup and Team of Rivals by Doris Goodwin Kearns. Loved all three!"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"An eye-opening book about a time that we did not live in but should know about. Perhaps too many sermons and extra words but the important points are there and brought out for all to see."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Uncle Tom's Cabin was a book I KNEW about, but only as a historical artifact--a story that helped ignite the Civil War....but little else. The trivial fact that it was the first American novel to sell 1,000,000 copies was tucked away in my mind, and the disparaging label of someone being called an \\"Uncle Tom\\" was about the extent of my knowledge of Stowe's masterpiece.Now, having read the entire book, I am ashamed at having never taken the time before. The power in the narrative and the characters in the story is enough to keep you turning the pages to see what happens next! To my surprise, even though it is more than 150 years old, it was not difficult to understand...UTC essentially tells two stories at once--two slaves are set to be sold from a Kentucky plantation/farm they have lived all their lives. One is the older, well-respected Uncle Tom, and the other is the young, pretty Eliza. Tom accepts his fate, confident in his faith that God will protect him. Eliza, fearful of losing her child (with good reason) decides to run away to Ohio, where she hopes to find freedom.Along the way, both of these good souls have trials and tribulations...times of fear, hope, friendships and pain. Nothing is guaranteed for them....and sometimes their travels through life are blessed, and sometimes they are shook by sudden, unexpected pain.Tom's journey from Kentucky is primarily south; to a land where generally slaves are subject to much rougher conditions than in his native border state. Eliza, of course, is going north to Ohio, and eventually, she hopes, to Canada. But fugitive slaves are still hunted in Ohio, so there are no guarantees.The most difficult part of the reading for me was getting acclimated to the style in which Stowe portrays the conversation of the slaves. Because the language is more coarse, uneducated and casual, it took a little while to completely understand what a slave was saying. At times, I had to stop and \\"sound out\\" what the words were, just to get the jist of what was meant. After a little while, though, this became easier.The most surprising aspect of the story...and perhaps this explains the current absence of Stowe's novel in the modern mind...was the unambiguous and unapologetic Christian timber replete throughout the pages. Stowe rightfully believed that true Christianity did not endorse the idea of one man being the property of another. In her day, some religious leaders excused slavery in the states by creating contrived arguments supposedly developed from the Bible. Stowe challenges those preposterous notions headon!UTC is filled with direct references to Scripture and Christian hymns. Even one of the most irreligious characters, a one-time owner of Tom, Augustine St. Clare, is able to see how the slave trade is altogether UN-Christian, though he also finds it difficult to give up his \\"servants\\".The deeply religious Quakers, who help run the fugitive slaves to freedom, are also portrayed as true followers of Jesus. Most touching is how they even tend to the injuries of an evil bounty hunter--a man who would have killed them if it meant recapturing a slave.Uncle Tom's faith is described in great detail, and his ability to endure in times of want reminds one of the Old Testament story of Job. He strives to maintain trust in his Savior.My review ends here; to give away the ending might discourage someone from picking up the story and reading it for themselves. The time spent absorbing Stowe's novel is well-spent. One can fully understand how it shook the conscience of the nation in the 1850s."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

It is worth your time to take a break from the more current writings and read this classic."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I've heard from many people since I was a kid that this was a book worth reading. Turns out that was an understatement. I wonder, however, if I'd have gotten as much out of it when I was fifteen as I did now that I'm forty. I'd like to believe if I'd read it before I joined the Army and left my sleepy little hometown, I'd have gotten a clearer picture of why slavery was such a tragic part of our history. I'd always been told it was, but this book demonstrates why with so many vivid details. I don't know if I'd been mature enough as a kid to really grasp it all as well as I did now, though. The book is beautifully written, flourishing with descriptions often lovely and occasionally horrible in detail. The few slow parts are more than made up for by the overall greatness of the work. I sometimes found the text a little difficult to read in the places where a heavy Southern dialect is written. That, to me, is always more easily understood spoken than on paper. Excellent book. I will gently insist my young children tackle it when I judge they are ready."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"everybody interested in the US Civil War should read this book that some believe help start the US Civil War"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"a great re read for me. this should be required reading for everyone. a great insight to an institution (slavery) that should be abhored by everyone. uncle tom in my estimation is a real hero."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"'Uncle Tom's Cabin' is a wonderful, involving work, though the some of the characters are a little exaggerated. It is melodramatic, and though I knew Ms. Stowe had written it to open up the eyes of the world to how wrong slavery was, it is sometimes more like a propaganda piece than I even expected, with some characters \\"preaching\\" in ordinary conversation, but overall the book is something to be reread; many of the characters are lovable (as far as a fictional person can) and have unique personalities, and ms. Stowe is good at conveying emotions; this book is fast paced and does not bog down often. Definitely worth at least one read."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Spoiler Alert. Important details from the story are given.Uncle Tom's Example of \\"Christ-like\\" CharacterUncle Tom showed exceptional \\"Christ-like\\" Character by being willing to sacrifice himself for the benefit of others. He follows Christ's perfect example of laying down his life for others, as seen in John 15:13: \\"Greater love has no one than this that one lay down his life for his friends,\\" and we see this manifested in Uncle Tom's life in four ways. First, he said he'd rather be sold individually than to risk the security of all the plantation slaves. Also, when Uncle Tom was offered his freedom, he surprisingly turned it down out of spiritual concern for his master. Third, he also showed great self sacrifice by helping a slave named Lucy although he risked punishment in the process. Lastly, he gave his life to protect two slaves named Cassy and Emmaline who were being mistreated by his master. Let's look at each of these examples individually.First, Tom showed Christ like character by being willing to be sold instead of all the slaves on the plantation. His master, Mr. Shelby, made some bad investments and incurred some debt. In order to pay off this debt, Master Shelby had to sell his best slave. Uncle Tom had been with him since Mr. Shelby was a baby and throughout that time Tom had been a very faithful slave. Mr. Shelby had given him a large amount of responsibility on the plantation. Because of this, Tom was more valuable than all the other slaves and was the only single slave of enough worth to pay off the debt. Although master had promised not to sell him, Tom responded in a self-sacrificial way: \\"Mas'r always found me on the spot-he always will. I never have broke trust... and I never will. It's better for me alone to go, than to break up the place and sell all.\\" Uncle Tom was sold and sent away from his wife and children.He was purchased by a man named St. Augustine who promised as well to free Tom. Tom showed his Christ-like character by not taking his freedom unless his master Saint Augustine got saved. St. Augustine's daughter, Evangeline, had just died. St. Augustine wanted Tom to follow him wherever he went, because Tom and his daughter had been close friends, and St. Augustine was reminded of his daughter when he was around Tom. The benefit to this particular situation was that Tom had more close contact with St. Augustine, and he was able to talk to him at a much closer level. It even got to the point where St. Augustine almost thought aloud to Tom. Tom was, therefore, able to speak much easier to his master about spiritual things. When St. Augustine told Tom would be set free in a few weeks, Tom replied, \\"Not while Mas'r is in trouble, I'll stay with Mas'r as long as he wants me, so as I can be of any use.\\" Earlier Tom had shared how valuable being free was to him; nevertheless, he was devoted to his master and cared about his spiritual condition more than his own comfort. Sadly, Saint Augustine died suddenly and Uncle Tom lost his opportunity to be freed. He was sold again except this time his master, Simon Legree, was a cruel and harsh man.When Tom was at Simon Legree's place, he showed tremendous character in a number of ways towards a slave named Lucy. While picking cotton, Tom helped Lucy, a feeble slave who was bought at the same time as Tom, by putting extra cotton in her bag while harvesting. Simon Legree gave orders for Tom to beat Lucy even though she had enough cotton in her sack. Simon Legree planned to teach Tom to be a slave driver. Tom refused to beat Lucy, saying \\"I beg Mas'r's pardon, hopes Mas'r won't set me at that. It's what I an't used to, - never did, - and can't do, no way possible.\\" In reply his master beat him several times, then he asked if he would do it again. Once again Tom replied \\"This yer thing, I can't feel it right to do'; - and, Mas'r, I never shall do it, -never!\\" Tom was severely beaten for his refusal.The final way that Uncle Tom was able to show his \\"Christ-like\\" character was by giving his life to protect two slaves who were being mistreated by his master. The slave named Cassy came very close to killing her master because she was being mistreated. She asked Uncle to escape with her. He refused to escape, but he told Cassy and Emmaline to do so if they had a chance. They needed to make an escape, if possible, because they couldn't handle the oppression in a Godly way. In a sense, Tom was protecting his master. A chance for Emmaline and Cassy to escape eventually did come. It was not easy for Uncle Tom now that Cassy was gone because she was the only one that was keeping Simon from killing Tom. When Simon Legree asked Tom to give information about Cassy and Emmaline's escape, Tom would not speak. As a consequence, Simon became very angry and beat Tom to death. This shows Godly character by Tom; for he followed Jesus' perfect example of remaining Godly even to his martyrdom.Through these examples we see exceptional \\"Christ-like\\" character by Tom. I think Tom's character in this book really shows the benefits and peace that a true Christian takes part of in his walk with Christ. This really motivates me to take the Bible seriously, and to follow its commands, to grow stronger every day, as well as to follow Christ's perfect example as Uncle Tom did."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"If you haven't taken the time to read Uncle Tom's Cabin, then you have missed out on a compelling book about the horrific events that took place regarding slavery in America.

Written as a response to the fugitive slave law, the book brought the institution of slavery into the parlors of the Northern reading public. The book is critical not only of the Southern institution of slavery but also, surprisingly, of Northern racism. Only the Quakers are treated favorably due to their commitment to help their fellow man when he is in need, regardless of laws to the contrary. The strong Christian orientation of the book will seem strange to many today, but it is important to understanding the reality of American culture in the 19th century."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I have a love / hate relationship with the novel. Some days, I think that Stowe is unforgivably racist and cares only about preserving the souls of white people who are forfeiting their place in heaven by owning slaves. On other days, I am really impressed by the way that Stowe is working within many of the discourses of her time and creating a radical message about why slavery is unchristian, unpatriotic and unwomanly.Of course, everyone knows that Uncle Tom's Cabin was the best-selling book of its time, outselling even the Bible. It sold over 1,000,000 copies, and, for every copy sold, about 10 people read the book. For every person who read the book, about 50 saw a dramatic adaptation (possibly one of the versions by Aiken or Conway, which took away much of Stowe's message and retained mostly the melodrama and racial stereotypes). Nineteenth century America was steeped in Uncle Tom's Cabin. It was the first book to have spin-off products that are common for films today - actions figures, tea sets, dolls, board games, card games, sheet music. Uncle Tom's Cabin permeated American culture. It is speciously reported that, upon meeting Stowe during the Civil War, President Lincoln said, \\"So you're the little woman who wrote the book that caused this great war.\\"There are so many things to fault Stowe for. In our politically correct culture, all of the faults of Stowe's novel are incredibly salient: she co-opts many racial stereotypes from the minstrel stage. Influenced by romantic racialism, she sees all blacks as simple, docile, childlike, and innately Christian. She sees people who are bi-racial, on the other hand, as intelligent and discontent with their position in slavery because of the \\"Anglo-Saxon blood\\" that is flowing through their veins.But I think that what is important to focus on in Uncle Tom's Cabin is the way that Stowe created an inherently domestic attack on slavery by associating slavery with the public sphere of economy and capitalism and slaves with the domestic sphere of womanhood and Christianity.Stowe was writing during the time of the cult of true womanhood. In the nineteenth century, women were supposed to be (sexually) pure, (religiously) pious, domestic (staying in the house / kitchen), and submissive (to men). Stowe believed in these prescriptive categories for women (as you can see through the characters of Mrs. Shelby and Mrs. Bird). To her, the best people in the world are mothers and Christians, and Christ himself is a mother-figure; he is pure, pious, domestic, and submissive. In Uncle Tom's Cabin, Eva and Uncle Tom are both Christ figures and mother figures because mother and Christ are interchangeable. They are the best type of people in the world. The Quaker Settlement, where Rachel Halliday gentle nudges her family to work in harmony in a Christian matriarchy is Stowe's vision of a millennial utopia.Slavery is evil for Stowe because it is the opposite of Christianity. Christianity is domestic and spiritual, and slavery is a part of the public sphere; it is mundane. Appealing to white Northern women, Stowe shows how slavery creates problems for women: it separates mothers from their children and wives from their husbands. It is bad for the slaveholders because it corrupts them morally. Stowe also attacks the North for their culpability in Slavery. Through the character of Miss Ophelia, she shows that Northerners, while the want slaves to be free, do not want to come near black people with a ten foot pole. They have a visceral reaction to blackness. Through the Fugitive Slave Law, Northerners are helping Southerners to return blacks to slavery.Lobbying for the inclusion of Uncle Tom's Cabin in the literary canon, Jane Tompkins says of the novel in Sensational Design, that it \\"retells the culture's central religious myth - the story of the crucifixion - in terms of the nation's greatest political conflict - slavery - and of its most cherished social beliefs - the sanctity of motherhood and the family.\\"I have read several editions of this novel, and I would highly recommend the Norton Critical edition, edited by Elizabeth Ammons (Tufts University) or the new Annotated edition, edited and annotated by Henry Lewis Gates, Jr. (Harvard University). Like all Norton editions, Ammons's version includes important contextual information as well as some of the seminal scholarly essays about the novel. In the annotated version, Gates gives two lengthy introductions and useful annotations. One thing that he mentions throughout the annotations is the way that Stowe depicts Tom's relationship with Chloe. According to Gates he seem not to be very affected by their separation; when he reminisces about the past, he thinks about the white children that he misses, George Shelby and Eva St. Clare."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Uncle Tom's Cabin, or, Life among the Lowly is an 1852 anti-slavery sentimental novel by Harriet Beecher Stowe, which she wrote as a response to the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. This novel is sometimes considered a contributing factor to the start of the American Civil War, as it brought many unpleasant aspects of slave life and the slave trade into the public awareness.The novel's events center around two slaves: Eliza, who attempts to flee to Canada with her son, who has just been sold, and Tom, who has also been sold, but who goes along subserviently. And while Uncle Tom's Cabin certainly is about Tom, it is much less about Eliza than it is about the responses of the other characters she comes in contact with.One of Uncle Tom's Cabin's main themes is the triumph of Christian love over evil, and for overtness, power and sincerity, the novel's Christian message can scarcely be topped. Eva is an obvious Christ figure, and Tom becomes one as well, but Tom is particularly noteworthy because he's one of the most eternity-minded characters in all of literature. He endures everything, as Saint Paul said, for the sake of the gospel (which he is always quick to share) - his stated reason for remaining in cruel bondage when presented with a chance of escape is to minister to the other slaves. Because of his selfless love and inner strength, he is the book's most admirable character.(It's interesting (and too bad) how the term \\"Uncle Tom\\" - now used to negatively describe a black who is subservient to whites - has become so pejorative. Stowe's Tom is a loving, strong-willed, eternity-minded character. But lax copyright laws in the nineteenth century allowed for unauthorized diluted and altered stage versions of the story (called \\"Tom shows,\\" some of which were even pro-slavery), and many people came to know Tom as a stereotypical minstrel buffoon - certainly a great number more people saw the stage dramas than read the books.)Uncle Tom's Cabin is a sentimental novel (in the literary sense), and Stowe goes for the heartstrings at every opportunity. Though the reader may not at any time, many of Stowe's characters burst into tears at the slightest provocation. Stowe herself is a preachily-involved narrator, and nothing the author has to say is handled subtlely. While Stowe's many characters debate various \\"biblical\\" perspectives on slavery, the narrator's (and the author's) views are never in doubt, and she laments to an even greater extent America's burgeoning disregard for the Bible.From a literary standpoint, Uncle Tom's Cabin is largely unimpressive, and sometimes it's a downright mess. If the novel wasn't so socially and politically relevant, it would have been lost in the mists of time with countless other sappy, mediocre novels.In the first place, there are about twice as many characters as there need to be, far too many of whom are named Tom, Henry, or George. And it isn't always easy to pin down just who the main characters are, because conscientiously-developed characters leave after a few chapters, others arrive, and some characters who are obviously key to Stowe's tale (Eliza, in particular), vanish for a hundred pages at a time, while others don't debut until halfway through the book. Many characters are flat, one-dimensional caricatures, present only to offer a particular point of view on a topic. In doing so, Stowe brings the reader into contact with every conceivable position on slavery and human rights, but it doesn't make for a particularly believable story.Secondly, the book's goings-on are equally contrived. The reader can see the hand of Stowe on every major plot point, particularly at the end, where she attempts to tie up matters with a series of heartwarming but preposterous coincidences.But this doesn't mean that Uncle Tom's Cabin is horribly written; that's simply not the case. Sometimes Stowe produces a very fine turn of phrase, and certain scenes are well done and do produce the intended emotional response. And many of the book's moral and philosophical debates hold the reader's interest because Stowe has clearly thought through the issues and educated herself on the various arguments and viewpoints.So while Uncle Tom's Cabin is not very impressive as literature, it remains important (and worth reading) because of its message and the role it played in a key era of American history."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Harriet Beecher Stowe's classic novel about Uncle Tom and the evils of slavery in the United States is perhaps the greatest novel ever written. It is superb in every way. Stowe's storytelling abilities are simply unbelievable. Obviously, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Its intense emotional impact on the reader is simply unbelievable: it can make you cry, laugh, and feel every emotion that the characters do. I urge every single person alive to read this book. I was not forced to read it; I thought it might be interesting. Well, I was beyond delighted. If you haven't read it and you're not sure about buying it, then go check it out of the library so that you can read the most emotional book ever written."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"As a grown woman who missed out on reading many of the classics in american literature during my youth, I decided to download the free kindle version and give it a try. This is a wonderfully written book about slavery in the U.S., during the time it occured. At first I thought it was historical fiction but the author's end notes detail the true stories that were included in the work. The story was really an education for me on the history of slavery in the mid 1800's, filled with dramatic story lines and events. I laughed, I cried, and in the end came away with a better feel for the difficulty of bringing about emancipation. The author has written this book as an appeal to Americans (from North and South) to take responsibility for allowing the horrors and tragedies brought on by slavery to continue. I absolutely loved this book. I wish I would have read it years ago. It has a strong thread of christianity throughout which is maybe why I was not required to read it in my public high school literature classes 25 years ago."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"After hearing about this book for decades, finally read it on Kindle. The book is WAY more than I expected, and would suggest that it be recommened reading. It is an eye opener."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"This story is the most personal account of living in the time of slavery that I have ever read, and I thought it was phenomenal. It was poignant and well written, and it really tugged at the heart strings. What I enjoyed most about the story was how it looked at the point of view of so many players during the slave owning era (Northern compassionates, Southern slave owners with and without guilt, slaves, mothers, husbands, families, etc.). Since I am not from the South, I had a little trouble with the southern dialog, but it didn't keep me from understanding the flow of the story.I am very glad that I read this book considering history classes don't really delve into the emotional and personal history of slavery in the South. School just treats this period of time as a \\"stain\\" on our history and doesn't like to confront it for what it was.When I look back at the time this book was written, it must've blown people's hair back. For those people of the 1800's to see that slaves were not merely \\"property,\\" but had the capability of having the same family values, religious beliefs, and sense of social insight as themselves must've made them think twice about the way they treated these people. No wonder why this book was one of the catalysts to spark the Civil War.If you don't look at this story from the point it was written, you'll lose something in the translation. But if you imagine someone reading this before the Civil War and imagine what they are learning about the human soul, the equality of it whether it is white or not, you'll feel enriched.I recommend that everyone read this story. It is full of so many valuable life lessons (content of character, faith, compassion, loyalty) that you shouldn't pass it up."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"In trying to get a perspective on today's racial issues, I felt it a good idea to get a fresh look at the institution of slavery in America, and so I read Uncle Tom's Cabin, a book written by Harriet Beecher Stowe that helped foment the Civil War. She was a daughter of a famous mid-19th century preacher, and she was an abolitionist who was very familiar with the personal stories of many slaves. I wanted to see slavery on a very personal level through the day-to-day lives and philosophies of the willing and unwilling participants. What were the kind masters like, the cruel masters, the various types of slaves, the bystanders, the North, the South? I wanted to see the motives and the rationales for slavery from these various perspectives and how Christianity fit into the picture.I thought that the book delivered. It had a flowing, elegant style. The characters were well-drawn and seemed real, the stories were intricate and believable, and the plots fascinating, especially regarding the attempted escapes. It was a painful to read, at times, when you saw the slaves up close, their plight, their dreams, their families broken-up, as well as the astounding depravity of some of the owners. Some of characters were noble in the face of extreme suffering, such as Uncle Tom, and some were cruel beyond measure, like Simon Legree, the slave owner. Others tolerated slavery and rationalized it as a service to a race not prepared to take care of itself (because of what slavery made them into). All aspects of slavery and slave-owning were addressed and rationales explored in fascinating stories that were composites of corresponding real-life dramas. It was clear that all but the most wretched of owners had a troubled conscience about the state of affairs, and well they should. It was also clear that slavery was so settled-in and ingrained that the culture was taken for granted by most people. From the perspective of our time, it seems unbelievable that it ever took root.Christianity, of course, was also a major theme in the book. The verses of Scripture are directly and indirectly woven into the fabric of the book throughout, in direct quotes, partial quotes, and paraphrases. Also, the power of Scripture is shown in the noble witness of Uncle Tom who was after the character of Christ, one \\"of whom the world was not worthy\\" according to the Book of Hebrews. He was painted as a patient and loving \\"suffering servant\\" whose testimony was love and the spread of the Gospel even towards his enemies in the midst of his misery. Scriptures are also referred to in defense of slavery, but the case was not strong at all. How could God be in favor of slavery when much of the Old Treatment is about freeing His people from physical bondage in Egypt and much of the New Testament is about freeing God's people from their sin? A rhetorical question for sure!Uncle Tom's Cabin was haunting to say the least, and should be convicting for our present society in general that it took a book like this and the subsequent Civil War to end slavery."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"This is an outstanding book of penetrating insight into the evils of the \\"peculiar institution\\" of slavery. It is very moving and educational.

The dialogue that takes place in Uncle Tom's Cabin was a little more difficult to understand than what I am normally used too.

Overall, I think that this book is a book that everyone should have the opportunity to read. I am very glad that I read this book."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"This is a classic book. It is very well written but because of the language used it is at times very hard to read."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I can't imagine that I have never read this book, even though it's been on my to-be-read list for years. I thought I had a pretty good idea about what it was about, but I wanted to read it because of its historical significance--Abraham Lincoln credited it with leading to the Civil War. However, I didn't expect it to have the powerful impact on me that it did.Since \\"Uncle Tom\\" today refers to a subservient, obsequious person with no courage to stand up to evil, I was surprised to read about the character of Uncle Tom. He was no weak-willed, servile person, but a devout Christian who lived the way he understood the Bible said. He didn't rebel against his earthly masters because he believed in turning the other cheek, as Jesus preached and practiced. However, when ordered to whip another slave, Uncle Tom sacrificed his own life by refusing to carry out the evil order. He would not take part in violence against another person even though his refusal lead to violence against him. Uncle Tom is an example of how Christians should live and die. I would consider the highest of honors if I were called an Uncle Tom!The other thing that really struck me about the book was how people who considered themselves good Christians owned slaves and/or approved of slavery. They felt that if they treated their slaves well, they were doing their Christian duty. They didn't see that the enslaved people were created by God in His image, just as they were, that the slaves deserved to live their lives in freedom, just as the slave owners did. From today's perspective, it's easy to see how evil slavery was and how much those Christians who participated in it were violating God's will.As a society, we pride ourselves on being so much better than the generations before us that perpetuated such an evil institution as slavery. Yet today, we have a class of human beings who are, like slaves, considered less than human; a class of human beings who have no right to freedom, indeed no right to life.Those who are denied the right to life are the unborn, the most innocent and most vulnerable of God's people. A mother can murder her baby legally, just as the slave owner could murder his slave legally.Ending slavery meant that thousands of uneducated men and women with no experience at making the simplest of decisions were suddenly responsible for themselves and their families. The whole structure of society had to change, and that process has taken more than a century.Ending abortion is much simpler. Pregnant women simply carry their babies to term rather than discard them like garbage. The mother may find that a temporary hardship, but killing the baby results in permanent death. If the mother is not able or willing to raise the child, the baby can be adopted by a loving family. Because of the huge number of abortions each year, it will probably take time to have enough adoptive parents for all the new babies. However, today many families are unable to adopt a baby as they would love to do because there simply aren't enough babies. Finding loving homes for babies will be much easier than changing the whole structure of society after the elimination of slavery.I can see why Uncle Tom's Cabin awoke the conscience of the country regarding slavery. Thanks be to God for the advocacy of abolitionists who believed that every human being is made in the image of God and deserves life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. I'm praying that the advocacy of Christians who believe in the sanctity of all human life will bring about an end to abortion."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Uncle Tom's Cabin is a very melodramatic book. I have read it several times over the past twenty years and must say that it has something new for every decade or even for every generation. When considered for our time, Uncle Tom's stands out as a classic prose that hits directly at those turbulent times before the Civil War, and reflects issues of war and principles today. Harriet Beecher Stowe had a great cause to write about and wrote a work that still is as relevant today as it was during his time.The author's masterful story summarizes the conflicting attitudes of a nation on the brink of civil war. It comes with the depth of stories like Of Mice and Men, Disciples of Fortune.Melodramatic though it is, it was written in the style of the times and for a situation that required it. This is a highly recommended book."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I think the saddest thing about this book is that everybody remembers Uncle Tom, even if only as a particularly ugly byword, but nobody remembers George Harris.\\"I am George Harris. A Mr. Harris, of Kentucky, did call me his property. But now I'm a free man, standing on God's free soil; and my wife and my child I claim as mine... You can come up, if you like, but the first one of you that comes within the range of our bullets is a dead man.\\"He is a hell of a character, and one of the few here that could exit the pages of this book and stand his own ground in the pages of another one.That's the difficulty with Uncle Tom's Cabin, at least for me: if you judge it by our modern sensibilities about what a novel should be and do, it doesn't hold up at all. The characters are mostly one- or two-dimensional figures, often exaggerated past all believability, who are sketched out to serve an obvious purpose: Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote every page of this book to rail against slavery, and although she skewers her subject from a hundred different ways and angles, that is really her only aim. For us in the 21st century, for whom slavery has melted away in all but a few of the darkest and most backward corners of the world, this is pretty much preaching to the choir.Let me tell you why it's still an amazing book.You might know that it was written in 1852 - a time in which the issue of slavery was boiling over in Congress and at dinner tables across the nation, but still almost ten years before the breakup of the United States and the start of the Civil War. In 2012, it is still FRIGHTENING to read this book, to listen to the author decry slavery by every means imaginable - from sarcastic narrative whispers to naked, screaming invective - and to almost hear the desperation in her voice as she throws herself bodily against this massive, monstrous evil, which for her *has no imaginable end*. In the last pages, she talks with faint hope about Liberia, where she imagines American slaves could go to construct a nation of their own, but that's it: at the time when she put pen to paper, she went to bed at night and rose in the morning knowing that human beings were still suffering and dying by the millions. 160 years later, we've long since ended slavery in America, but that fear and anger and almost-hopeless despair is still fresh on the page.So I guess what I'm saying is, absolutely do read this book - and when you do, read it less for the plot and more for the real, non-fiction people who inspired it.And also for George Harris, 19th-century action hero."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"This story shows how prejudice shapes peoples thinking. It moves one to think of how they view and treat others. You cannot read this with an honest and open heart and not see how God has made all men equally with the ability to love, fear, overcome predjudices and have faith and courage. It shows the good sides and bad sides of both blacks and whites. I love how this shows the hypocrisy of religion, and how the bible in the wrong hands is misinterpreted to justify wickedness. The first half of the book is riveting. The last half, while very imporatant in the aspects of the characters and showing the evil of slavery, is too preachy. It virtually saintizes Tom and Evangeline, with all its talk about heaven. The parts about superstition and \\"ghost talk\\" should make the reader realize, though, how ungodly and ignorant superstition and spiritism really is."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I'm going to read it to my 6 1/2 year old now.I read this book in norwegian when I was 8, sitting in a farm house kitchen in Soknedal, Norway.

This book figured prominently as it was responsible for opening the publics' eyes to the real conditions of slavery and, it could be argued, fanned the flames that led to the Civil War. Though there is a that certain amount of the melodrama that one would expect in a 19th Century political statement, it still makes as powerful a statement today as it did in the late 1850's. Do yourself a favor and read this book along with \\"Common Sense\\" by Thomas Paine.If you are a student of that era try \\"John Brown's Body,\\" an epic poem by Stephen Vincent Ben&eacute;t, that has to be read. It rivals Homer's \\"Iliad.\\" Another good, though not great, book is called \\"Alcoholic Republic,\\" by W. Rorabaugh, which I think may be available from Amazon (I don't work for Amazon but I do like books) in which it is stated that the average alcohol consumption per capita in the U.S. in 1820 was 9 gallons! The book explains why and how that fact took us from the Cult of Domesticity to the Cult of Temperance ultimately resulting in the corruption of Prohibition.Bill G"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Often heard about Uncle Tom's Cabin and was prompted recently to read it after watching \\"The King and I\\" where the book is briefly, if inaccurately, summarized in the play. So downloaded it free to our Kindle and was engrossed for two days. I found the book very insightful into life in the U.S. in the mid-ninetheenth century. Stowe had obviously done her homework regarding life in Kentucky, Ohio, Vermont and Louisiana. From the postlogue, she had verified stories of slavery from around the country that she brought together in the book, so that it was not just fanciful accounts. I found the writing sentimental, of course, but engrossing and I enjoyed very much how the author would comment directly to reader at various points in the book. Also, I found the argument and conflicts pro and con about slavery that Stowe imparts in the dialogue to be fascinating, giving us a glimpse as how men and women rationalized their actions and beliefs.The book was also inspiring to me as a Christian, for one of its tenants is not just to end slavery but to incorporate one's faith into every decision one makes. Uncle Tom is a hero in that he puts his faith before his situation. He doesn't sell out to the slave-owner as some accuse him, he sells out to Christ -- inspiring all of us. Eva too is an inspiring character and the book, while drenched in pathos around these two particularly, lifts up the ideals of Christian character.Considering that this book is reportedly the second-best selling book in the world in the 19th century (the first being the Bible), has never been out of print and may have influenced the start of the Civil War, it seems to behoove all who are interested in the history to enjoy the insight and inspiration that Stowe brings to us."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I think &quot;Uncle Tom's Cabin&quot; is a book that everyone should read. Unlike some other reviewers, I did not find the slaves' dialogue (as it is written in the dialogue of the times much like Mark Twain's novels) hard to read. The book covers the lives of two slaves: the pious and faithful Tom and the beautiful and loving Eliza. The descritions of the punishments slaves endured make the novel all the more important-- underscoring the inhumaity of such a system. This is a book that once read is not easily forgotten."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Uncle Tom's Cabin is a novel that touched many people's lives including my own. It made me realize just how lucky I am to be living like I am today. Harriet Beecher Stowe takes us through the lives of two slaves, Tom and Eliza. We read about their triumphs and hardships that they go through in order to get one thing. Freedom. There are just a few things that I didn't enjoy about this book. The dialogue that takes place in Uncle Tom's Cabin was a little more difficult to understand than what I am normally used too. Another thing that I didn't really like was all the details about the punishments that the slaves had to endure. Overall, I think that this book is a book that everyone should have the opportunity to read. I am very glad that I read this book."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"We can't forget WHY this book was written in the first place. It was a ...tool used by Stowe to light a fire in an apathetic society. Uncle Tom, Simon Legree, George Harris, Eliza, and etc were examples of all sorts of bits and pieces of stories and legends that Harriet Beecher Stowe had heard or experienced. Yes, Uncle Tom was too good to be realistic. But, Stowe chose to portray him as almost Christ-like. (and definitely a martyr.) A martyr for the black race in this novel. That is why Uncle Tom is so pious and so spiritual. He can die for the cause because he uses Christ and his crucification as his (Tom's) inspiration. Little Eva was almost like a biblical prophet. She certainly did not express herself as a normal 5 and 6 year old would. But in this case, Stowe uses Eva as a source of conscience for the white southerners. Each character was not just simply a name. Each character was a manifistation of eithor: 1.good 2.evil or 3.public perception at that time. Yes this book by todays standards is considered prejudiced or racist. I believe Stowe was doing her best to motivate the public and to cause an otherwise apathetic nation to overturn the common practice of slavery. This was not a novel that tried in any way to proove absolute equality between the two races. This may make the book racist to some readers, but we must remember the time and the reason this novel was written."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"This was the second best-selling book of the 19th Century (next to the Bible) and this is the book given the credit for turning the tide of public opinion against slavery in the United States. In fact, it could be argued that this book set in motion the events that eventually led to our Civil War - still the bloodiest conflict in U.S. History (including WW2). Those facts alone make this an important book to read and it should be a part of any serious library.In order to fully appreciate this book, you must try to view it from the standpoint of the average American in 1850. It is hard to believe today but back then, slavery was still an acceptable way of life for many. Even many of those who were morally opposed to the concept of slavery adopted a \\"live and let live\\" approach to the matter. This is because many viewed the black race as inferior and they did not understand that they were people just like us who were devastated by the evil institution. Imagine having your children and spouse ripped away from you and sold to others like they were heads of cattle. This was a fact of life for most slaves. This is a very powerful book that humanized the black race and exposed the evils of slavery to those in the North who otherwise turned a blind eye towards it.Critics of this book say that it is more about Christianity than it is about slavery. I did not get this impression. Granted, the heros of this book were pious Christians without exception, but viewed through the prism of the times in which the book was written, it is understandable. Religion was far more prevalent in those times than it is today and it was just assumed that good people had to be Christians (just as it was assumed that blacks were an inferior race).There is not much to say about this book that hasn't been said already. But I would like to mention about the main character in the book: Uncle Tom. In today's vernacular, the term \\"Uncle Tom\\" is a derisive term applied towards black people (by other blacks) who are perceived as being deferential and/or servile to white people. So when I read this book, I expected Tom to be this subserviant fellow who bowed down to his master and did his bidding. This was clearly not the case! Tom stood up to his evil master and refused to let him get the better of him, maintaining his dignity at all times. No matter how much his \\"owner\\" tried to break his spirit through enormous physical abuse, Tom remained strong and unbroken. On top of that, Tom frequently went against his master's wishes and helped make Christians out of his fellow slaves and even helped a couple of them escape to freedom. In the book, Tom is a credit to his race and is the strongest moral character in the book. So after reading the book, I have determined that the term \\"Uncle Tom\\" is very unappropriate as it is used today.This is truly a great book. The writing is superb, the dialogue is razor-sharp and the exposure of the evils of the slavery that once existed in America (not all that long ago)should be read by all."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Without a doubt, one of the GREATEST BOOKS I have ever read, and certainly one of the most historically significant literary works of this nation! In the beginning, we find a young Negro mother, Eliza, who learns that her son is to be sold the following day. So on that cold, winter night, she takes her infant son into her arms and runs away. She runs with her child into the darkness of the South, hoping to save her son from a horrible fate. She comes to a river and knows she must cross it. But the river is only partially frozen. So with her child in her desparate clutches, she leaps from ice patch to ice patch. Meanwhile, her attempt to escape has been discovered, and the &quot;trader&quot; to whom her son is to be sold is off to re-capture her. As Eliza struggles to bring herself and her child to the opposite side of the river, with the slave trader hot on her trail, your heart is pounding and your eyes are racing through Harriet Beecher Stowe's masterful prose. You can't help but cringe with each leap Eliza takes, as her battered, bare feet stain the ice with blood. From beginning to end, Ms. Stowe puts you in the old South, and you cannot help but feel for the characters, both good and bad, honorable and flawed. A true classic that holds a mirror to the human soul. You may not like what you see in the reflection, but you will be better off for having seen it!"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Uncle Tom's cabin is an excellent book! I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. I could identify with every character. I was uplifted by the strong faith of Tom. I believe that Tom's faith would be looked down upon, today, but I would like to look at people like Jesus does. I think that this book helped me to realize a small bit the struggle we as black people had to endure just to try to keep our families together. I think that everyone should read this book!"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"My one-star rating applies only to the Penguin edition of Uncle Tom's Cabin. The Penguin edition, edited by Ann Douglas, has a high rate of transcription error. So it is not suitable for serious study.I listed a selection (over 100) of the transcription errors in the Penguin edition for a presentation at the 2007 American Literature Association conference. For example, the Penguin edition on page 619 (in the 4 copies that I've examined) has the following line:\\"If the laws of New England were so arranged that a master could [it]now and then[/it] torture an apprentice to death, would it be received with equal composure?\\"In the 1852 Jewett edition (the first printing in book form), the sentence included an additional clause:\\"If the laws of New England were so arranged that a master could [it]now and then[/it] torture an apprentice to death, without a possibility of being brought to justice, would it be received with equal composure?\\"This error--the omission of \\"without a possibility of being brought to justice\\"--diminishes a key theme in Stowe's work. I encourage scholars, teachers, and students to purchase Ammons's or Sklar's editions of UTC. Among editions that I've examined, those editions have more reliable texts. I have not examined the new Bedford edition (Railton) or the new Norton edition (Gates and Robbins).If you choose to buy some other edition, perhaps your choice will encourage Penguin to publish a corrected edition. This edition was ranked 41,945 at Amazon when I wrote this review in July of 2007."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Hi friends and neighbors,I've recently had the most delightful pleasure of reading one of the best books ever -- Uncle Tom's Cabin: or, Life among the Lowly by Harriet Beecher Stowe.Recently I was in need of trying to understand a phrase I'd been hearing. My research on the Internet kept bringing me to a term \\"an Uncle Tom\\" which was always spoken with utter contempt and the alluded-to concept of a traitor. I was not satisfied with what I was finding and my dictionary afforded no relief.So I turned to the public library and checked out a copy of the book Uncle Tom's Cabin: or, Life among the Lowly. The library had numerous copies and I chose one with the original text and without the usual literary critic's additive and alterative remarks.Wow, what a treasure!This Tom character was not in the least what others had alluded to. I can only assume that those who spoke derisively about dear Tom had not actually read the book themselves but merely seen or heard some altered rendition of it which was misunderstood by the listener or the teller or both.I found Harriet Beecher Stowe to be an excellent author, carefully weaving her sentiments and historical matters into the various characters of her adventurous novel. As was probably the only way a woman could be heard broadly in the mid 1800s, she spoke passionately through her characters. I'm not surprised that her novel was a hit in its day, exposing to daylight the evils and regrets of a system that was entirely accepted and protected by law, along with the poignant moments of love and caring that existed amongst those same evils.The way Mrs. Stowe writes, it is easy to see and understand all the many aspects of that portion of American history devoted to the ownership of other humans as chattel. Also a delight was reading all the varied viewpoints that people held (pro and con) of such a system and even the enormous magnitude of what it would take to overcome that stubborn system. What foresight!If you've never read this book and would like a good read (keep the tissues handy because you'll need them), I highly recommend you read this book.What a delightful story it is!"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Being a suburban, male, upper-middle class WASP, educated in Kansas City's public school system I had never completely understood the conditions that surrounded legalized slavery in the middle 1800's. I had watched Gone with the Wind as a kid and that was my image of plantation life and slavery. Uncle Tom's Cabin gives the reader the whole story and Stowe does an excellent job of presenting arguments from all sides of the issue (brutal slave drivers, gentleman farmers, abolitionists, slaves accepting their lot in life, slaves longing to be free). I was so moved. Only Grapes of Wrath and To Kill a Mockingbird have had that same impact on me in the past. I would give this book 6 stars if that were an option. The U.S. History books always made reference to Uncle Tom's Cabin for its historical importance. It did open the eyes of so many who didn't realize what was happening in their country. Public education should go further though by making this required reading. It is so much more than a mere footnote. It is a slow-starter, it took me about 10 days to get through the first 100 pages adjusting to Stowe's mastery with dialects, but the last 350 pages moved 3 times as fast. Wow! The power of reading. It's amazing."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"This book is truly a FORGOTTEN CLASSIC! Harriet Beecher Stowe's mission in this book is to show that the black slaves are truly human, and consequently deserving of the freedom and equality that whites enjoy. She certainly does this! But it's her unique method that transforms this potential mid-1800s timepiece into a timeless classic! Stowe demonstrates what it means to love ALL people in 2 very powerful, moving, and complementary ways. One, she paints a picture of a black person who is able to unconditionally love his white enemies along with the blacks who suffer with him. And two, she illustrates how a few white people truly love and recognize the humanity of black people - society's powerless ones. The bottom line - she shows what it means to be a RADICAL follower of Jesus!Uncle Tom is a pre-civil war black slave, routinely trodden on due to his non-human status. Even with the luxuries he is given, he is continually reminded that his status before the law is only property-he has no rights, no freedom. Yet he always manages to unconditionally love his owners: the Shelbys, the St. Claires, and finally even Simon Legree. And in the course being sold and purchased, he changes the lives of many people around him. One moving example of Tom's love is toward Cassie. Once a beautiful and sophisticated woman, she is mercilessly abused as a slave and stripped of all her dignity. Through Tom's witness and sacrifice, her deep bitterness and hatred are melted away so she can love and be loved again.On the other side, some of the whites did understand that the enslaved blacks are worthy of love, dignity, and freedom. Emily Shelby, Augustine St. Claire, and Eva all show love to Tom by providing him education and limited freedom. The Quakers demonstrate love to Emily and George Harris while putting themselves in danger. And Ophelia learns how to love Topsy, a personal growth experience for both of them. All of these stories are different and intriguing, yet all show weaknesses in the white people who are in some way products of the slavery system they live in. Of these, the most moving example is little Eva, a child. No wonder Jesus calls us to become like children!There are a few stereotypes, and the book is somewhat long, but don't let these minor points deter you. The book will CHALLENGE you to love all people, of all cultures and colors, those who hurt or oppress you, and especially those who are oppressed, marginalized, and powerless. Indeed, that is what Jesus did! \\"Uncle Tom\\" shouldn't be a label used of a black person who willing accepts a white person's oppression, and I know I can't change the negative connotations that this label carries. But it SHOULD indicate a person who unconditionally accepts and loves all people - a TRUE saint. I know I would like to gladly accept that label.This book really deserves to be 6 stars! Read it (or listen to it); it will change your life and your sensitivity to oppression forever!"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"The unabridged audio of \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" is excellent in every way. This is a classic that should never be forgotten , and has more theology in it that most theology books. It also fairly portrays slavery and the arguments for and against. The real thing that makes this book so outstanding as in many audio editions, is the narrator, Buck Schinder. I don't believe I have ever heard a better reader who could make every character come alive with the correct personality. His mastery of the Negro dialect is amazing. This book is heartwarming as well as heartbreaking, and is full of truths, as Harriet Beecher Stowe did much research and many interviews with escaped slaves while writing it. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"An openly critical novel in respect to slavery in the US that stereotypes the main characters to provide an overview of the situation, Uncle Tom's Cabin provides insight into the definite cruelties and suffering involved with slavery, and surprisingly they not only affect the slaves themselves. Uncle Tom finds himself passed on from trader to trader, and indeed the only thing that keeps him safe is his master's character. His abrupt change from caring, respectable masters like Mr. Shelby and St. Clare, both of whom struggle with their consciences, to Simon Legree, the representation of all evils, play on the emotions of the reader. Even his two early masters are stereotypes of their age: one is a kind master who would treat his slaves well (unless, of course, money issues would press him into letting go of his most valuable possession--Tom). St. Clare, although both kind and fair, lets his slaves run free about his plantation because he does not want to begin controlling them, lest he will never know when to stop when the slave begin to build up resistance to the pain. Days before gaining his freedom, fateful circumstances lead to Tom's transfer to the perilous care of the reckless Simon Legree. But in spite of his experiences with the wrongs committed on the plantation, Tom finds a way to cling to his morals and follow his heart, eventually dying a martyr, but at the same time influencing his peers, (and \\"superiors\\"), in such a way that his spirit is kept alive through the positive outcomes that resulted. A poignant, inspiring novel that urges men and women all over the world to continue believing in the right through thick and thin, Uncle Tom's Cabin will forever keep the memory of the honest hearts of men and women all over the United States who suffered through such prejudice and overcame."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Each chapter has a number of words or phrases, usually obscure, noted with an asterisk.

The story telling is simple and easy to follow, and the characters are realistic.It took over 100 pages before I started to find the characters compelling, but once I did I breezed through the book. Also, the message against slavery is a tad heavy-handed, but I suppose it would have to be when the target audience is people who are ok with slavery or slave owners themselves.The book was an altogether enjoyable read, but not an entirely necessary one for someone trying to build their knowledge on the canon."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Uncle Tom's Cabin is a touching story about slavery in the mid 1800's and the influence of God on their faith in life. This novel is a graphic description of the horrid life of slaves and the strength it took for them to endure it. Many scenes in this book contain horrible gory things although I believe it takes a story with this kind of violence to really show what it was like to be a slave. The author does a good job at making the reader feel the pain of the victim and understand the things these people had to go through. Uncle Tom's Cabin is about a slave who uses his faith in God to help other slaves throughout their excruciating journey. This story portrays many different versions of attitudes towards slavery also. It contrasts the difference of treatment of the slaves in different areas. The story shows that in many parts of the United States slaves were treated with a lot of respect, but in the other half they were treated like animals who should be starved and beaten.Personally I really enjoyed this book in all aspects. This is a story that could change ones outlook on life completely. Some of the description in the scenes made me cringe at the thought, but it made me realize that if I am cringing at these words on a page of paper I could not possibly imagine what it must be like to actually be there experiencing it.I think this is a book that everyone should read at some point in his or her life.

Him, another slave Eliza and her son get sold to a slave trader, Haley. Eliza escapes to Canada with her husband and Tom gets sold to Augustine St. Clare. St. Clare's young daughter, Eva, forms a close bond with Tom. They become very good friends, but Tom and everyone else know that they will soon be losing her, and then the day comes. Tom is then sold to yet another master named Simon Legree. Simon is less merciful than St. Clare and makes Tom an overseer. Legree brings no good and Tom suffers. This book taught me so much about what it was really like for slaves in that time. It was not one of the easiest books, but it was worth it. Tom, Eva, Legree, and all the characters played a big role in informing everyone that slavery was not what some people may have thought it was. This is a perfect book for anyone who wants to learn about slavery and have a breathtaking story like this one to remember."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Uncle Tom's Cabin by Harriet Beecher Stowe is a mysterious, enchanting novel. As the main theme and purpose to the novel, it demonstrates the hardships of being a slave. In the book we follow the trading of slave Uncle Tom and his whereabouts. Tom goes through the hardest part of being a slave of beatings, and verbal abusement. I went into this book not knowing what to expect and I found cruel, interesting, loving, and delicate characters and evil and happy relationships. It took me about 7 weeks to complete the novel because of its challenging material. I definitely recommend this book to anyone and everyone who is interested in slave trade and the great guilt that follows it."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I have always wanted to read this book.

Wonderfully written, great characters, compelling tale. Everyone should read this book."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"After reading this book, I can see why it was so influential in promoting the abolition movement. The main story along with the side stories were compelling and heart-rending. This book masterfully encapsulates what slavery in 19th century American was like. The author does this in a way that is not heavy handed and overly accusatory towards the South. She even takes some shots at those in the North whose actions regarding slavery were not without guilt. Another key aspect of this book is its treatment of religious themes. Throughout the book, especially through the character of Uncle Tom, the Christian message is blatantly preached. Uncle Tom is partially a \\"type\\" of Christ in that his character traits mimic those of the \\"suffering servant\\" Christ. In fact, the Uncle Tom character is so full of strength, integrity, love, and mercy that it is an absolute shame his name has become a pejorative term. This book is powerful in so many ways that it may move you to tears. Its a painful read in that it reminds us of the sin of slavery, but it also is redemptive and has a positive message. If you've never read this book, you need to."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I chose to read this because it was a free book on the kindle. Wow! was I impressed. I did not expect it to be this good. I could not put it down and it didn't take me long at all to read it. I was disappointed when the book was finished because there was no more to read.

I am definitely glad that I read it and enjoyed it tremendously. Yes, it is rather preachy, and dramatic, but understanding the purpose of the book in that era, and the author's personal background, I would say that this is an example of author's passionate devotion to speak out against the injustice. And because it is an easy, entertaining read, its attraction to common readers probabley produced more powerful impact in the society. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"We've all heard references to \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" throughout our lives, but I, for one, had never actually read it.Figured it was about time, and glad I did.A must read!"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I am glad I took the advice of other customers and purchased the audio tape rather than CD version of this classic.

Book chapters are not identified on the lable or in individual CDs it is broken in to 30 second sound bites, which makes it easy to pause for a moment but difficult to find the begining of a chapter since the chapter may begin at 20 seconds in to the sound bite.

A Kentucky slave owner, Mr. Shelby, is a reasonable slave owner, fith some financial problems. So he doesn't loose his farm he agrees to sell two slaves, to Mr. Haley. Mr. Shelby decides to sell Tom and young Harry; but Eliza, another slave, catches word of the transaction and can't bear the thought of being separated from her only son, Harry. Eliza and Harry take off north, towards Canada, but Tom stays. Slave hunters go off after Eliza and Harry, and Tom is sent south with the St. Clares. Tom lives comfortably for two years, but Mr. St. Clare dies, and Mrs. St. Clare sells Tom to a malicious slave owner. George Shelby sets off to find Tom and set him free like he had promised before Tom was sold. As George lets the last of his slaves go he says, \\"Witness, eternal God! Oh, witness that, from this hour, I will do what one man can to drive out this curse of slavery from my land!\\"Uncle Tom's Cabin is a fiction story, but it's biased on non-fiction events. Depending on the version you have, determines the number of pages, but most should average about five hundred pages. I would recommend this book to anyone, especially if you're interested in the south, and southern history. The only hard part about this read is the southern dialect and references used to describe things, but once you get the hang of reading the book it's no problem at all."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"There is no doubt in anyone's mind that Harriet Beecher Stowe's novel has been unequaled in its vast political influence. However, it contains one major flaw. Although the book treats slavery with a simple and determined resolution, and reduces slavery to what it really was (EVIL), the book ends with a happy and most improbable ending. Stowe might have been attempting to show that ultimately, good reigns over evil, but the message of the extreme urgency of the abolitionist movement is lost in the fairy tale ending."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"It is easy to see how this book influenced public opinion regarding slavery in its day. What comes into play, though, is that we as a culture today are more demanding on investigative truth, documented truth, of situations described, not just the author's say so. So, although I personally believe in the evil of slavery, if I were a person who was not so convinced, the book could be described as just manufacture of the author's imagination and, therefore, not evidence of any mistreatment of slaves. So readers today could see the book as not convincing at all because it does not present investigative fact. The book tends to work on the emotions, not on the facts. It was effective in Stowe's day, but not as effective today. Also American English has evolved and the English of the book is verbose and dated and, consequently, it interferes with the understanding of the message of the book. In addition, the different understanding of Christian theology today compared to the the understanding in Stowe's day can also be a deterrent to the readability of the book. Christian fundamentalism can interfere with tolerance of any other message trying to be conveyed in a piece of literature."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"The Shelby family owns a plantation in Kentucky, and within their plantation system, they own slaves. Yet these slaves see the Shelby's as loving masters. Having financial difficulties causes Mr. Shelby to sell two of his slaves, Tom, known as Uncle Tom by many, and young Harry, son of Eliza, a house slave. When Eliza hears of the plan, she takes Harry and escapes, in the hopes of making it to Canada. She is pursued by the slave trader who purchased her; eventually she is reunited with her husband and the family makes their way to freedom. Meanwhile, Tom is taken away and sold to the St. Clare family. The St. Clares are good to him, particularly the young daughter, Eva. After a series of family tragedies, Tom is sold by Mrs. St. Clare, and becomes the property of Simon Legree, a heartless and cruel master.This book is a difficult read, for various reasons. Written and published in the 1850's, the books subject matter and language both seem so foreign to me. The main theme of the book is the evils of slavery, and the potential redemption of the sin of slavery through Christianity. The book is credited with bring the issue of slavery into the national political spotlight. Part of the evil of slavery, as shown in this book, is the concept of ownership over another human being. The idea that one man can own another, and that the Master-slave relationship trumps all others. I cannot even fathom the idea of ones child or spouse not actually being their own, but instead being merely the property of the master. Women lose their children, men lose their wives, and they are expected to just accept it, because they are slaves.The masters portrayed in the book are varied; some treat the slaves well and eventually free them, while others beat their slaves mercilessly. It makes the subject matter complex, in that some slaves do not appear dissatisfied with their bonds. Similarly, one of the minor characters in the book, Aunt Ophelia, is an abolitionist, yet she appears to me as one of the most racist characters in the book. While she finds slavery to be evil, she also finds the black race to be distasteful. I find the complexity of this character, along with the complexity of the good Master-willing slave relationship, to be compelling, and find that it adds significant depth to the story.The language, I will admit, is a bit difficult. Some of the slave dialect was quite difficult for me to decipher, yet I found it to seem more real that if the slaves had spoken grammatically perfect English. The realistic dialog helped the characters come to life. The language and social morals are so significantly different from our own modern ones that I can see how this book might be intimidating or off putting to many readers, but I urge them to stay with it, and try to find the deeper message in the story.While this book is certainly not without its flaws, I have to respect it, and recommend it, if for no other reason that the important role it played in American history. We may not be proud of this portion of our history, but we have to acknowledge it in order to grow as a nation."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I read this book because elsewhere I read that \\"the way slavery was really\\" is debated between this novel's portrayal and that within Gone With the Wind, with Uncle Tom's Cabin being the more widely accepted (and far less pretty) version. What I did not expect was to read a story that moved me so deeply and even strengthened my faith as a Christian. Literary scholars and historians and civil rights advocates all analyze and twist and discuss and corrupt the content to death, and that makes me very sad because I think that many people will hear everything they have to say and miss what I've found.I read it without any preconceptions about what stereotypes exist and the presence of allegory and already fully understanding and believing in the complete equality of all humans, and I fell in love with characters like George, who struggles through life and faith so honestly; and Topsy, who has more to her than she's ever been allowed to see; and of course Tom, whose love of his enemies, faith in God, and hope for his life yet to come can be too easily glazed-over by calling it only \\"Christ-like\\" (though such a description should have a much more powerful implication). I snarled at Simon Legree for his unrelenting cruelty and wanted to slap Mrs. St. Clare for her rampant narcissism. I celebrated Cassy and Emmeline's escape plan and cheered when the Quaker Phineas steps forward to push Tom Loker off the cliff. I looked on Augustine St. Clare and the Shelbys with a cautionary trust due to their obviously kind hearts but commitment and participation in an evil social institution.The scholarly approach is to say that many of the black characters are a heartless and demeaning characterization of black slaves; that Eva's kindness to slaves de-humanizes her; that Phineas pushing Loker demonstrates that Stowe thought only whites were capable of violence; and, most offensively to me, that Tom is, well, an \\"Uncle Tom.\\"I found none of that. I found a moving and very human story, and it is currently my favorite novel. I hope others find that, too."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"The publisher of this pricey printing did not take care to check the pages of the text for successful copying. Some pages were so poorly copied they were illegible. Substandard quality control. I had to return the book."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"This book should be required reading for all high schools.For the rest of my life, I will carry with me the vision of the slaves owned by Simon Legree. They wake up and go to work breaking their backs in the fields. They get home at night and can't rest yet, because they have to make their food. They work, work, work, and his policy was not to get them a doctor when they got sick - just work them to death and buy more. They lived a miserable life and had no hope. It's sickening to think that, although this story is fiction, things like that happened here in this country."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Uncle Tom lives in Kentucky under the kind Shelby family, where he has had the life of ease, even as a slave in America. He's treated with respect, both him and his family. He has helped work the Shelby's land for years. Tom loves the Lord, and serves Him all the days of his life. His heart is set on winning others to Jesus and serving the saved and unsaved. He is joyful. He has everything a slave could ask for.But Shelby has some debts to settle. Tom, the most valuable slave on the plantation, is sold, and sent with a trader named Haley to be sold. It is the beginning of one of the greatest adventures ever put to paper. It is an adventure of sorrow, broken hearts, and a love that is more redeeming than any human love.I was greatly impressed by this book. Before I was finished with it, I read in a curriculum that many writers and publishers were very critical of Stowe's work, that many did (and do) not like it. Even then I wasn't quite sure why, but at the end I was confused. How could anyone dislike this book? Even if the story is too sad for you - how can you not at least see the beauty of the characters and how Stowe formed each sentence? It was all careful, taking one step, one breath at a time. The book was like that. Breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out. Methodical, like breathing. And what's the beauty of breathing? It keeps you alive without you even knowing it. In a sense, Uncle Tom's Cabin was like that. Every breath was perfect, I didn't even realize it, but it kept the story going in a way that I will never, ever forget.There isn't much else to say about this story...other than please, I beg you to read this book. I laughed, I cried my eyes out, I went numb with fear and hatred, I was captivated by the love of God. And Tom, the slave who is now free, will always be a hero."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I thought it was interesting how Stowe portrayed legalistic Christianity and Biblical Christianity. Through her characters, Eva and Marie, Stowe presented to the audience the vast differences between legalist Christianity and Christianity as a lifestyle. Stowe proved that the legalist Christian did not reflect Biblical standards. The legalist Christian, Marie, treated people with cruelty and disrespect. She thought she was of a higher position being because she was white, and acted as if there was no one more deserving than herself. She did not go out and make disciples, because she was consumed with her social class and would not associate herself with those of a lower class.Eva portrayed authentic Christianity in this novel. She treated everyone fairly and with respect. Eva did not care about social classes and was friends with everyone. She shared her faith with everyone with whom she interacted and thus lived her life as a light for Christ."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"The complete title alone will make you want to throw the book across the room. \\"Life among the Lowly\\"? This book was written close to 150 years ago which accounts for it's anachronisms....in part. It's overly sentimental in a gushing way. Stowe exudes prejudice against slaves throughout the book in the midst of fawning over them. Children parade as little adults, that is when they're not being angels. Slaves live to be good slaves. The really odd thing is there was something about her writing that kept me turning pages. There are so many old chestnuts to choke on, the drinking, clowning, obedient slave. There are slave owners who value their slaves so much they're part of the family, they just happen to be owned family members. The opening scene talks frankly, casually as a KY owner discusses selling Tom to a slave dealer, a dealer who was known to sell slaves down south where they would likely be treated worse than in KY. The owner agreed to sell a house slaves child and how best to get the child from her with the least amount of fuss. Of course I always knew our country had slavery but the very day to dayness of this conversation slapped me in the face. And it gets worse the further you read. Stowe made people re-think the slavery issue. For that reason alone there's value in this book, a purpose to read it. Life among the lowly indeed but who gets to decide who's lowly?"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"This books is one of my favorites and how anyone can criticize it, I'll never know. This is a must read for everyone who can. Those who find period pieces hard to read because of the language (regional, colloquial and/or jargon)shouldn't let that deter them from reading this novel. If you need to look up words, do , but don't pass on this book!"},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"The Book, Uncle Tom's Cabin, when first published, took in an amount of 10,000 dollars to the Author, Harriet Beecher Stowe. This was believed to be the largest sum of money to any author from a sale of a single book produced in such a short period of time.Stowe has the skill in describing her characters. There is no book, in which a Negro's life had been portrayed so life-like such as this way. Uncle Tom and Eliza's fate is the interest in this story, for they are somewhat heroes of slave times.The opening is a deal of slaves, to a slave proprietor with no feeling whatsoever. Haley is making a bargain with a nice caring slaveholder, Shelby, who is in major debt. Haley is a villain and wants these slaves all for himself. Because there is no federal law which can compel the slave states to resign the \\"property\\" which they hold. These states are as free to maintain slavery, as are the states of the North who rid themselves of this scandal.With Stowe describing these characters feelings, it feels like she is going right along with them on their journeys to freedom and deeper into slavery. There is a feeling there, while reading, which no one can describe. It is a shame that Stowe does not know how she excites her reader's passion towards all these characters, and how Uncle Tom's Cabin is now known as a classic."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"I had always heard about this particular book through history class. Finally my eighth grade history teacher encouraged me to read it. I really enjoyed it. It made me laugh and it made me cry. It also made me think. I was familiar with slavery and their hardships, but this book is not a biography. It's more real. It stirred feelings of disgust in me when I read about the overseers of the slave plantations - same as it did 100 years ago.Harriet Beecher Stowe showed how lucky slaves could be and how lucky most of them wasn't. She used a southern dialect that was most likely used by slaves. She also included slave folklore and songs. Anybody who loves a great story that tells the truth should read it. I've passed it onto friends and they love it too."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"Upon re-reading this work, I found the book to so much more melodramatic than when I read it thirty years ago.

That's all. It may have enlightened the country as to the plight of the slave, but the rest of it was too saccharine. Much of the story is contrived, and the characters are exaggerated. The good characters are very good, and the bad characters are very bad. However, they do serve the purpose--you will hate the slave owners by the end, and sympathize completely with the slaves. This certainly isn't a bad thing. Just don't pick up this book expecting some original story full of deep characters."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's cabin;: Or, Life among the lowly","review":"If we must never forget the evils of slavery then this book is the vehicle for achieving that aim. Empathy is the key word when reading this book. If you are the type of rebel reader who wants to read books that others don't want you to read, others such as those who believe that slavery was justified or that the South won the civil war, then this book is for you. My only complaint was that there was too much religion, even though religion was very much a part of the slavery culture.

His use of first hand documents such as newspapers, magazines, political cartoons, journals, and his extensive citation to then-comtemporary historical works is materfully woven to create a rich historical tapestry.

I'm pretty well read when it comes to this subject, and have readRaising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boysamong other books, but I learned some new things about boys from this book, such as specifically how boys' changes in testosterone affect them and when those changes take place. He also makes a convincing case that boys should be one year behind girls in elementary school--something the author of \\"Raising Cain\\" brought up, but didn't fully cover. He has a chapter on how to find a boy friendly school which I'm really looking forward to reading--not there yet, but the quality of writing in this book is very high and consistent, so I am confident it will not disappoint. In short, this is a helpful book and you'll probably learn something valuable from it.

It was a shame that I had to wait until I had a son withdifficulties, to be able gain some insight into the problems facing a veryboyish-boy in today's society. Hopefully, I will now be kinder to my son,and be able to give him more of the elements which he needs -following Steve Biddulph's very sain and logical advice.This is a very easy to read, well laid out book : and the fact that the'Typical Boy' that he is describing, is a perfect carbon copy in every respect of my eldest son, can only make me believe that he Knows What He's Talking About. I discussed Steve Biddulph's point of view with an Head Teacher and a Child Psychiatrist, who both agreed with him.I would recommend this book to anyone who has just had a son..."},{"Title":"Raising Boys: Why Boys Are Different - And How to Help Them Become Happy and Well-Balanced Men","review":"my girlfriend who has 5 and 2 years old sons suggested that I should get this book in order to understand a nature of boyhood.

Just one of the many titbits I picked up from this interesting and helpful little book. It's not a work of genius. Much of what Steve Biddulph has to say is plain common sense. But if, like me, you're looking for ways to be a better parent to a clutch of high-octane, high-powered pre-school boys you might find it a useful and easy-to-read starting point. Oh, and Biddulph doesn't recommend the rat thing, by the way. You'll be pleased to learn that only works for rodents."},{"Title":"Raising Boys: Why Boys Are Different - And How to Help Them Become Happy and Well-Balanced Men","review":"That describes my reaction to this book. It came HIGHLY recommended to me, but I was shocked at how much of it is just common sense. Like, love your son, duh. And make sure he has male role models in his life, duh. I've read close to 50 parenting books in the past 2 years and this is easily in the bottom 3. I guess if you are a single parent or didn't have good parenting role models growing up, you might find some of this information helpful.

What I would like to know is if this title has been translated into Greek. I live in Greece and I feel this book could help a lot of my Greek friends and teachers who have a hard time reading English books. I feel that everyone should read this book."},{"Title":"Raising Boys: Why Boys Are Different - And How to Help Them Become Happy and Well-Balanced Men","review":"I received this book for Christmas along with several others that were much better.The author of this book is an athiest who relies on \\"years\\" of research and clinical studies to determine what makes boys tick. His precepts suggest there is no wrong, no accountability, there should be no confrontation and that the child will evolve into his own being without you really parenting him at all. In other words, stay out of the way so your childs Goth friend can introduce him to the real things in life, like drugs, homosexuality and \\"personal\\" freedom, along with the side effects like addiction, shame, and oh, spiritual and physical death.Instead I would highly, highly recommend the movie and associated literature that goes with the recently released Film \\"Courageous\\" by Sherwood films which covers topics like handling death in your family with your child, committing yourself publicly to raising your son to the absolute best of your ability (accountability to your friends and family), being honest even when it means sacrificing your job, realizing the accountability that comes with the responsibility of being a father, forgiving others, sacrificing/risking your life for your child, restoring honor and integrity to a broken relationship where mom and dad split and the child is now in a single family home, the fact that child without a dad is 20x more likely to end up in prison, on drugs or in a gang, and how to communicate to your child on THEIR level. The material ends with you, the parent committing in front of others you know and will be accountable to, that you pledge on your word, to be the parent God has called you to be. It is powerful and the generation changing potential is unreal.You hang a \\"resolution\\" plaque in view of your family, that shows them (that and your actions) that you are committed to being the parent God made you to be and watch your family ties double by the week.I would also highly recommend any book or seminar from the author Joe McGee whose books are also availabe on Amazon. His books carry parental guidance on topics like dating, teens, toddlers, preparing your child for the day they must leave home and support themselves and a family in DETAIL. He goes over things like budgeting, personal finance, public speaking skills, courting and relationship with the opposite sex, step child relationships, proper discipline and more. Some of his books provide forms for tracking your money, establishing \\"at home\\" finance plans with your teen (allowance on steriods), teaching your kids about credit and borrowing etc. I have seen him in person and he is one of THE most entertaining, funniest speakers I have ever seen. His material is worth its weight in gold for any parent who is looking at improving their parent-child relationship both short term and long term.And last but not least, I would recommend the Five Love Languages of Children book by Gary Chapman. In a nut shell, we all \\"value\\" different things that tell us we are loved. I might like gifts. Someone else might like words of affection. Gary goes into detail about identifying your childs love needs and meeting it. If you feel like you give and give and see nothing changing in your child, please read this book. It will show that you are not even speaking the proper love language that your child values resulting in you being exhausted and frustrated and them not feeling loved.Update: I have updated this post, which is why alot of the comments below it don't make sense. I previously addressed my disdain for certain topics in the authors book and then came to the realization that him and his book weren't really worth that disdain."},{"Title":"Raising Boys: Why Boys Are Different - And How to Help Them Become Happy and Well-Balanced Men","review":"paying a terrible price...since when did the feminist yada get turned into Girls Are Better?

This is not a &quot;how to&quot; book, however. Instead, it is a general overview with many particular examples and explanations. The author's recommendations are straightforward and affirming, to fathers, mothers, and sons. He cares for and accepts the foibles and modes of boyhood. Biddulph has a whole chapter on the effects of testosterone, and I thought that was a little overdone, since our humaneness, as he notes many times later in the book, is not biologically determined."},{"Title":"Raising Boys: Why Boys Are Different - And How to Help Them Become Happy and Well-Balanced Men","review":"This book was written after Steve Biddulph's first book &quot;Manhood&quot; which was truly groundbreaking. If one grows up in the masculine societies of Australia, US, Britian, Scandinavia etc then these books are invaluable. Problem of course being that it's hard sometimes to get these masculine men to read books like &quot;Manhood&quot; as they are very confronting and avoiding emotions is what macho societies are all about! This book is great as it's aimed at parents and others raising boys and the differences between little girls and little boys.

For example, the [paraphrasing] &#34;extensive study...of three boys in the UK over 15 years&#34; leaves a bit to be desired. I absolutely agree that girls are very different from boys and they need to be treated and taught differently, but that's true about different boys AND different girls.A good read, and I would recommend it to a father and mother of boys (especially mothers of only boys).

Can Rex Finch of Finch Publishing publish one? Based on their track record of excellence, you can bet that if either of these folks ever wished to stop producing superb quality work, they would be better at being bad or average than anyone else.Luckily for us, they show no signs of wanting to do either. The beneficiaries are ourselves and also, in this case, Celestial Arts of Berkeley and Ten Speed Canada, who are handling publishing and distribution of \\"Raising Boys\\" in North America.\\"Raising Boys\\" offers an eminently readable overview of the increasingly tricky task of bringing up sons---who to begin with face some sex-specific challenges--in an often imposing, dangerous, and all too frequently unsympathetic or apathetic world. Biddulph laces his appealing presentation with generous portions of humor, wisdom, cartoons and drawings, presented in a variety of engaging formats, and graced with a number of absorbing vignettes by outside writers. His wife joins in to co-write the chapter on mothers and sons.The author has some simple points to make. Few if any can say them as bluntly and clearly as he does: \\"If you routinely work a fifty-five or sixty-hour week, including travel times, you just won't cut it as a dad.\\" Boys need male teachers, but it has to be the right kind of male, which means two basic qualities: 1) a mixture of warmth and sternness, and 2) freedom from needing to prove anything and a comfort with youthful exuberance. Intriguingly, Biddulph advocates starting to include sexual words in dinner table conversation around age ten so that sex does not get pushed underground for your boy.I learned that young boys tend to have growth spurts that affect their ear canals, and also that the language part of the brain is not fully formed until age thirteen. Biddulph is a careful, creative wordsmith. At one point, he writes that a boy who is turning into a man senses a need to \\"download the software\\" from an available male to complete his development. An adolescent, he notes bemusedly, is a role-seeking missile.The author may be too busy writing superlative books to go to many recent films, as he laments the absence of \\"movie depictions of tender, sensuous, playful and boisterous lovemaking.\\" Is it really true, as Biddulph suggests, that in past times \\"men hit their wives routinely\\"? (Without firm evidence, I personally tend to resist the move to demonize the behavior of past humans relative to present people.)Biddulph goes into a rap about \\"creeps\\" a couple of times, by which he means boys who haven't learned to harness their sexual and aggressive urges properly, so that instead those impulses emerge sideways in forms that are hurtful to others. The author seems to alternate between harshly judging these boys, and identifying or at least understanding the pressure, stress and in some cases abuse that leads boys to act this way. As readers, we can feel his ambivalence.Steve Biddulph has specifics aplenty to offer readers, but in the end it is not so much the truly invaluable advice and ideas but rather the spirit and faith of the author that shines most brilliantly. The writer makes this father of a nine-month-old son excited about what is here and what is to come, anxious to go grab every moment available as they slip away toward the future, plunging to the earth like so many dominoes."},{"Title":"Raising Boys: Why Boys Are Different - And How to Help Them Become Happy and Well-Balanced Men","review":"I read this book some time ago. I found it very informative and an interesting take on raising boys. I think the take on boys needing lots of time with their dads is an important message. The old-school way of being the financier more than the father is not the best format for raising well-rounded boys. I changed my own interaction with my son and have tried to be less of a nag. I realized how much I was doing that without finding the positive moments to praise my boy.

I do agree it is easy to read however much of it IS common sense and quite frankly some of the statements turned me off a bit. I almost quit reading the book after the first few pages. For example, the author says boys should NOT be in daycare for the first three years of their lives. I think many working parents, like myself, would find that remark a bit preachy and generalized. I think I know kids pretty well having taught for many years and some of what the author writes had me going, \\"Whaaaat?

And this is what ig got in the first 30 pages. I also found as I am a single mum, it had little to no consideration to me (2 pages), and most children these days are brought up by separated parents or single parents, and generally the mother is the sole carer. Luckily for me my mum is a psychologist for relationships and children and clearly expained all you need to give is love and good base foundation with clear rules and be available for your son, and also agreed that this book should not be taken as gospel nor correct and it is very one-sided. for a best selling book, i thought it was terrible"},{"Title":"Raising Boys: Why Boys Are Different - And How to Help Them Become Happy and Well-Balanced Men","review":"I bought this book because it became clear to me that I do not understand my 3 year old son and I realized it would only become worse as he grew older if I didn't at least try to figure out what is going on from his perspective.I think that this book really tells it like it is. He doesn't sugar coat it. I also think the person who took offense to his saying boys should stay out of daycare until 3 years old did not read the book very carefully. He does not say that mothers should not work, he says boys should not be put in institutionalized day care settings but that good home based day care or staying with a family member is acceptable. I've read this in other books as well that boys just don't do well in daycare they really need one on one close time with a single, consistent care-giver be it mom, dad, grandma or a home day care.This book also says many times how it is not trying to put women down or trying to set back the women's movement, it is just trying to show how boys are different. I have already noticed this with my children. I have two girls and a boy and I quickly picked up that my son is 6 months to 12 months behind his older sister in his speaking, reasoning and his ABCs. I talked to his preschool teacher about it and was relieved to find out it is normal for boys to be behind girls and the teacher said exactly what this author says, boys catch up somewhere in middle school but until then they are 6-12 months behind girls emotionally and academically. My son has a September birthday and I will be holding him out a year to start kindergarten at 6 instead of 5. I have already seen it in his preschool class how boys are treated, unwillingly as defective girls. Girls take to things like circle time and learning while boys would rather vroom cars and build block towers. I agree whole heartedly with the author that boys acting out in preschool is because they are anxious or stressed out. Girls withdraw when stressed, boys act out, often aggressively.If you are ready to hear what this author says then buy the book. He is very strong on dad being a big part of a boys life and goes as far to say if dad is working 55 to 65 hours a week he won't cut it as a dad. This is hard stuff to hear, but if you want your son to grow up to be a good man it will take sacrifice on everyone's part. If we want our daughters to marry good men we need to make sure that we are raising good sons."},{"Title":"Raising Boys: Why Boys Are Different - And How to Help Them Become Happy and Well-Balanced Men","review":"This is the BEST book I have read on raising boys.

Although we try and do the best we can and be balanced in our parenting, we cannot change the fact that boys and girls are different. What we need to do is to embrace those differences and work with them.I just found the book to fall a little short in that much of it was common sense, and the author made many statements on what boys need, yet did not give suggestions on how to bring that about. Also, the author quotes many Australian stories, studies, examples, etc., which is fine if your Australian.

His words about Boys are simple and matter of fact. Boys will not grow up to be sound men without help. This help can only come from the input of sound Men [preferably dad]at critical times in a boys maturation. Mom's are very important but they can't teach a boy how to be a man, for that the boys need a safe, strong male to model. Steve Biddulf sets out to help Dad's and Mum's sort out, First - what does it really mean when we say 'boys will be boys'? Second - How can I assist, as a parent, in helping my son to become aware of his 'maleness' and then assisting him to become a sound, loving but not wimpy man. Third - he tackles the thorny issue of single mums raising a son, how does mum, who can't be a man, raise her son? First recognising she needs help, then sorting out what to do about it. His style is simple, funny and never patronising. He is pointing out a real problem and proposing from a wealth of clinical and parenting experience his matter of fact pathway through the minefield.

The other night my wife took something away from him in the bath. To cut a long story short it ended with hyperventilating and a touch of 'demon possession'. When everyone was eventually calm and in bed, I looked through this book to try find some answers as to how I should have dealt with this sort of situation. In the index... 'Temper'... nothing, 'Tantrums'... nothing. 'Discipline'... 4 pages, with the headings... 'Teaching boys to respect women', 'Dork dads', 'Learning through consequences'... (remember the blowtorch!?) and 'Boys in the kitchen'... hmm... lets try 'hit and smack', should I, shouldn't I?... nothing!I thought maybe the index wasn't that accurate, but after going through the book the best advice I could get on raising a 3yr old boy was, boys need lots of affection and the mother is the best person to provide this. Not much help when your son has pushed his little sister off a chair, etc. etc. Maybe the later sections on dealing with older boys is better, but the birth to 6 years section is pretty thin, obvious and unhelpful."},{"Title":"Raising Boys: Why Boys Are Different - And How to Help Them Become Happy and Well-Balanced Men","review":"Raising Boys is an excellent book that really highlights the ins and outs of raising a son.

The underlying philosophy behind the book is that if emergency procedures are learned and practiced, they cease to be emergencies and rather just more procedures.An example happened earlier this year when I was flying with a friend who had recently transitioned to a complex airplane (one with retractable landing gear). On final approach, he didn't get the &quot;all green&quot; lights on the gear (meaning the gear was not securely locked down for landing). With a gear not locking, the plane is still perfectly flyable, and indeed, we had four hours of fuel left. Although you'd obviously prefer not to, you CAN land with the gear up without doing undo harm to you or the plane (but not your ego :)Since I was in the right seat, I offered to trouble shoot while he continued flying. Trouble shooting involves working down the checklist and doing things like swapping out bulbs and making sure metal contacts are not dirty -- not very complicated, but involved enough that a second person makes life easier. After tinkering with the light bulbs, I looked up to see my friend was, shall we say, in a self-induced unusual attitude. HE FORGOT TO KEEP FLYING THE PLANE.This is a where he would have benefitted from practicing the emergency procedures in order to build confidence and react more positively to the situation.Handling In-Flight Emergencies covers engine failure, VFR into IFR conditions, electrical failure, control system failure, and getting found after being &quot;temporarily lost.&quot; The book should be read in the spirit that these are things to think about, work with your preferred instructor. I feel it's successful at that.For the various control system failures and how to work around them, I recommend Rich Stowell's &quot;Emergency Maneuver Training&quot; book and video. They are very thorough and take a scientific approach to the situations. (Stowell is also able to explain aerodynamics without boring you.)"},{"Title":"Handling In-Flight Emergencies (Practical Flying Series)","review":"When I announced to a friend that I was learning to fly, hegave me a hardback copy of Handling In-Flight Emergencies, by JerryEichenberger. On the inside cover he wrote me the following personal message . . . &quot;There are old pilots and there are bold pilots, but there are no old bold pilots&quot; He was sharing with me what he must have learned as a helicopter pilot in Viet Nam. If you are going to learn to fly, you must be prepared for the ultimate in flight emergency. Mr. Eichenberger's book was a timely gift for me. I read it interchangeably with all my training books, and actually understood the many recommendations he makes in the book, as some of the situations a pilot has to be aware of were either actually encountered or simulated in the course of my training. The book is very logically written from the point of view of a pilot and a flight instructor. I commend it highly to any aspiring new pilot, and even to seasoned pilots. In fact I have just ordered a copy from Amazon.Com (the first time I have ever ordered anything on a computer) as a gift for my own instructor, who patiently led me to this accomplishment today."},{"Title":"Handling In-Flight Emergencies (Practical Flying Series)","review":"As an instrument pilot of airplanes and helicopters and commercial student, I've read countless aviation books.

However, his advice on how to deal with specific emergencies leaves a lot to be desired. In a few cases, he does not provide correct and accurate information. In others, his recommendations are in poor sequence. Other than for the brand new pilot, I think this book is merely a reiteration of what most pilots already know. He didn't have many stories and learnings from them either. AOPA Pilot's Never Again series is a much better learning mechanism."},{"Title":"Shakespeare","review":"How often have you encountered a book on Shakespeare or his works that attains a level of writing that is often heart-meltingly gorgeous, even at times comparable to the beauty of the Shakespeare quotations it contains? Probably only once, and this is the book.A helpful introduction by David Lehman reminds us that Mark Van Doren was a celebrated professor of literature at Columbia University, and a poet of considerable accomplishment, who served as mentor to a long list of students who later achieved great things. In his courses he generally spoke without notes, and this 1939 book on Shakespeare's works was also written without notes or references, other than a well-thumbed one-volume edition of the works, printed in about 1906.Any modest power of description which I might possess fails utterly for this exquisite book. Instead, let me give a sample of Van Doren's commentary: \\"It may well be that Shakespeare in 'The Tempest' is telling us for the last time, or consciously for the last time, about the world. But what he is telling us cannot be simple, or we could agree that it is this or that. Perhaps it is this: that the world is not simple. Or, mysteriously enough, that it is what we all take it to be. Any set of symbols, moved close to this play, lights up as if in an electric field. Its meaning, in other words, is precisely as rich as the human mind, and it says that the world is what it is. But what the world is cannot be said in a sentence. Or even in a poem as complete and beautiful as 'The Tempest.'\\""},{"Title":"Shakespeare","review":"Highly recommended for someone who has some familiarity with the plays and wants to see this terrain through sharper eyes. This is not \\"CliffsNotes.\\" These are essays by a master critic who loves Shakespeare, written *for* readers who love Shakespeare. But be prepared when Van Doren plays the critic, not the worshipper. If your favorite is \\"Henry V,\\" for example, keep an open mind and wince along.A pleasant aspect of this book is that you can take the essays in any order. This means that if, like me, you know some of the more popular plays (Hamlet, Othello, Macbeth, Lear, Julius Ceasar), but not some of the seldom-performed ones (Titus Andronicus, Troilus and Cressida, King John, Pericles), you can see what Van Doren has to say about \\"your\\" plays and then come back when you have hunted up the others.Van Doren's prose is familiar, easy, and full of love. It is almost a conversation, and hardly less a joy to read than Shakespeare himself."},{"Title":"Shakespeare","review":"I have always loved Shakespeare but, even though I have studied it, sometimes, he is a little difficult to pin down on what exactly he is saying or meaning and it is often hard to get the feel or mood for certain scenes. After all, he was a playwright, not a journalist! And he wrote five centuries ago in the idiomatic English of that time. This critique is absolutely brilliant. Van Doren's feelings on Shakespeare are that he wrote his plays to be enacted on a mostly-bare stage in front of a noisy crowd of Joe Q. Publics, not enacted in an elaborate hushed stage setting in front of a group of phychologist, phychoanalists, etc. I have often felt that some critics see deep, mystical, dark meanings in Shakespeare that he never intended (I feel it is more a reflection of the critic's own phyche). Not to say that Shakespeare is shallow! I feel his &quot;well-written&quot; plays are awesome and unmatched by anyone, anywhere, anytime. Van Doren brings Shakepeare to the light of day in a clear, logical, yet so very elegant way. This book literally brings me to tears, it's so beautiful!"},{"Title":"Shakespeare","review":"Articulate, scholarly, yet accessible. A classic I have wanted to have for a long time.

Matter of fact, sadly enough, the ONLY stories that were to any extent even slightly erotic were the 'boys will be boys' stories ...In the first story 'Innocence in Extremis' we get 3 pages of a 28 year old virgin describing her frustrations with any relationship except her fingers.The second story 'Space Girls are Easy' a young man is kidnapped by good looking green women with antenna that use manuals like 'The Whole Earth Catalogue' which also came with abduct-o-matic, and bind-a-bean tape and fasteners to hold down the earthlings they want to have sex with.'The Maltese Dildo' is a story about a private detective finding a dildo that had a jewelled handle... it's a boy boy story that was aaahhhhemmmm penetratiing to say the least ..'Triple X' is a story of a young girl in the South going to X rated theaters because it's the only place she could find AC. 'A hand rests on a swollen breast, thighs open like a bible' is about as erotic as this stupid story gets....LOL'Sophies Smoke' is a hoot. This is a story about Sophie and a young man in a humidor closet doing things with cigars that would make Clinton proud.'Calcutta' story of two boys in a steam room, nuf said OK ...'S&amp;M'A two page story of a girl wanting to be taken by the back door and be spanked. The story can't have more than 125 words for goodness sakes, I'm sure it was first written on a cocktail napkin!.'Somewhere I have Never Travelled' is a story of a young girl in Japan being trained in the martial arts. She has the hots for her master and the only erotic sex that takes place her is that one drop of sewat hits her from his face, and after she breaks her leg in sparring, he kisses the instep of her good foot. Can't say it makes me tingle....OK thats only the first 8 stories and not a hetero sexual erotic story in the bunch .. from here it goes down hill till, oh ya gotta love this one, we get to 'Rebecca' which is a story about Siamese twins joined at the head and one of them wants to, you know diddle the boyfriend Remus. I won't even get into their discussion at the hairdressers while they decide how to cut and trim their hair ....OK so if any of these stories turn you on and you find joined siamese twin, cigar munching, alien sex, with heavy emphasis on homesexual couplings as erotic, and exciting, then this book is for you .... otherwise save your money ....Finally, as if that ain't enuf, there isn't a mainstream published American erotic writer in the bunch of them ...

Where are the true artists of erotic writing? I see no excerpts from M.S. Valentine or Don Winslow or indeed, any recognizable names in the erotic literature field. Does Ms. Bright collect stories from her friends and neighbors? I think this is yet another prime example of overkill.

While its discussion of the last 8 years is unfortunately a bit truncated, this is probably one of the best texts out there to study a major islamic political movement in its proper context. What the author successfully does is not only take the study of social movements outside of its standard western milieu, but also look at the critical role ideology plays in mobilizing particular segments of the population to support and join a (r)evolutionary movement.While political economy explanations can show the context that leads to the creation of a potential audience for a message of social justice and transformation of society from below, it doesn't explain why people would do so when the costs of such action in an authoritarian country are so high. Usually survival is the paramount concern of most in society outside the coopted elite, unless an opportunity for change occurs. But such was not the case in Egypt in the 1970s and 80s, not one sufficiently great in and of itself anyway, to mobilize the disaffected semi elite who did join and became the backbone of the Brotherhood. What was needed also was a message of hope, social justice, and fairness, and that message was supplied by moderate political islam. The opportunity of course was facilitated by the traditional failure not only of the state's own neopopulist economic, social, and educational policies, but also of the main other opposition socialist movements. Moderate political islam provided the answer for many.It should be noted that this book, unlike many other studies of egyptian political islam by authors like Barry Rubin and Mary Anne Weaver, does not focus on the more violent offshoots of the Brotherhood, Egyptian Islamic Jihad, and Al Qaeda. Ergo this is not a book about terrorism. But that's kind of the point, this shows the fact the even now (at least before 9/11) mainstream political Islam in most Moslem nations in the Middle East and beyond are quite moderate and while wanting to create a Moslem state in the long run (i.e. over decades) are willing to do so from below. Wickham quotes a female activist in the book who says precisely that, i.e. that by teaching children about the religion, its values, and goals, as well as their mothers and fathers, that over time this will help build support for the movement until it grows to a large enough popular majority to overtake the state peacefully. This could be called revolutionary in the sense that the long term goal is change of the state and society, but it is neither a top down, not militant movement, but rather one that seeks to achieve its goals at the ballot box, in the mosques, schools, health care centers, sports clubs, newstands, in professional associations, and such rather than with weapons. It therefore very much is a study of a movement in a major Moslem nation that joins a growing list of outstanding works in English on the subject from other countries such as Jenny White's \\"Islamist Mobilization in Turkey\\" about Turkey's AK party, which recently came to power and Robert W. Hefner's \\"Civil Islam\\" about Indonesia's Nhladatul Ulama of former President Abdurahman Wahid.If you want to understand what mainstream political islam stands for and is seeking to achieve, in the most important Arab nation at that, this is probably the most important book you could read."},{"Title":"Mobilizing Islam","review":"Too often Islam as a comprehensive systme of life is overshadowed by the comparatively few but dangerous terroriist individuals and organizations. Though I am not a Muslim, I do think that the Western perceptions toward Islam and Islamism is excessively biased and near-sighted. And more often than not, people are hung up on analyzing the radical extremist aspects of Islamism, or the politics of the movement.This excellent book by Rosefsky Wickham does not provide answers to the whole notion of Islam being 'opposed' to the West, or the debate about whether Islamic countries can become democratized 'like us'.It is more focused on the deeper, underlying social movements that propel Islamism in Egypt, the people/organization/methods through which the religious movement has gained ground. She also examines how this change takes place, via what she calls \\"transvaluation\\". It's a nice departure made from the conventional obsession with the violence and the need to 'save' the Muslims under Islamic autocrats.The narrative she provides does not use the normal political science jargon and is an enjoyable academic read. I found it quite refreshing."},{"Title":"Mobilizing Islam","review":"I am an avid reader of books about religion and political science, and am most concerned with the impact of religion on a nation's policies and politics. Dr. Wickham's book is the most interesting and profound book on modern Islam I have read. She has the ability to allow the reader to understand Islam from the inside out and therefore to make sense of what we Westerners often feel is not logical. The author held my attention from beginning to end with a style that was both interesting and informative. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning more about Islam and it's impact on the United States and the world today."},{"Title":"Mobilizing Islam","review":"I concur with the other reviewers - a thorough and interesting book."},{"Title":"All These Girls","review":"All These Girls by Ellen Slezak is the story of a bond between a young woman and aunts.

Her Grandaunt Gloria struggles to help Candy straighten out and reclaim the energy to return to the basketball court, while her other, more distant aunt Elizabeth reluctantly comes along in what is meant to be a rejuvenating trip. Yet the travel goes off-course, and places the three of them in a remote locale, confronted by characters that will make them re-examine who they all are and what they are striving for in life. A story of emotional transformation, hope, and forgiveness in troubled times."},{"Title":"All These Girls","review":"What a superb book this is! Slezak skillfully braids the lives of three women incompatible in every way--age, aptitude, beliefs--who are nevertheless held together by the stubborness of affection and the long guilt of family ties. Affecting without ever being remotely maudlin, the characters grope through their long-cherished anger and resentment to arrive at a new balance of compassion. Written with wit and often gorgeous power, the book will linger long with its readers."},{"Title":"All These Girls","review":"All These Girls is that rare multi-generational novel about real women and girls that doesn't pander to its characters. In this rich, engrossing novel, the author presents three principled women as they are -- without condescension or excuses or undue praise. The story of their journey together isn't just that of a family coming together despite their differences, it's a celebration of those differences. As Glo's staunch Catholicism, Elizabeth's driving (but not always welcome) need for autonomy, and Candy's stubborn desire to confound expectations collide, they all find themselves not so much changed as enriched. This would be a terrific book group book, I think, because it's not only a great read -- lots of unexpected humor and intelligent insight here -- it raises a good many questions on how women and girls choose -- or must choose -- their way in life. The central narrative in this novel is a reluctant pilgrimmage, and I couldn't imagine a more apt metaphor for the journey many women make alongside their mothers, aunts, daughters, and nieces as their lives take shape. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"All These Girls","review":"Lately, I've been reading collections of short stories. Including Ms Slezak's, 'Last Year's Jesus'. I'm a writer, and was looking to understand the form more. What I learned was a) tremendous amounts of latitude are afforded even the most lauded of collections, and b) 'short stories' these days don't mean short stories. They mean 'situations'. Bottom line: short story writers aren't storytellers. The tales they publish may have style, power, even entertainment value, but they aren't generally proof of a story well told.'All These Girls' is proof that celebrated short fiction writers aren't necessarily adept at writing novels. Several references come to mind when I think of my impressions of the book: 'ham-fisted', 'ill-conceived' and 'beyond her grasp'.I wanted to stop reading about fifty pages in. The dialogue is, by far, some of the worst I've ever encountered. Most of the exchanges between characters (predicated on dialogue, of course) possess no credibility whatever. And the characters themselves... It wasn't even so much a group of unlikable ones being gathered together, it was that very little about what they did or said rang true at all. (There were moments when I felt a man must have written this novel, because the insight into a woman's world was sorely lacking.)What was most painful about reading 'All These Girls' were the reminders that Ms Slezak has some very powerful skills as a writer. (Well, as a writer of short fiction, anyway.) She has a well-vocabularied style, and a nice way with turning a phrase. But as far as writing a compelling story goes? I believe she should be reminded of a standard credo: 'Show, don't tell.'At its worst, this novel is a bad attempt at something Richard Russo would have crafted into something magnificent. At its best, it's a polemic, a badly-executed attempt to plough into a narrative all manner of personal insight, Life philosophies, and Psych 101 notes. And I'm not sure there's much between the 'worst' and the 'best'. Truly a wasted effort 'nonpareil'.Paraphrasing the moviegoer feeling ripped-off by a bad film, \\"I want my four days back, please.\\""},{"Title":"Cowboy Santa (HA 755)","review":"Main characters:Joni Evans and her four year old son Brady.Sam Crawford.Joni & Brady move from Chicago to Saddle (cute name), Wyoming.Brady decides to ask Santa for a daddy.If I remember correctly Sam was the Santa.

Flush with Palmer's recent inheritance of three million dollars they have come to rest and recuperate before Palmer plays in a scheduled tennis tournament, the greater New Orleans Open, featuring the likes of John McEnroe and Jimmy Connors.Palmer is beginning to wonder how much longer he can keep playing, let alone keep the much younger Corky happy. And while the first week of vacation has been fun, the nights have been difficulty as dreams of doom and death haunt him. He doesn't know what the dreams mean anymore than he knows the meaning of what he saw on the balcony of a movie set as Corky and he passed quickly by on a streetcar. Unlike the dreams, that he could investigate and briefly did before Corky explained it away as the actor and the actress was rehearsing.Maybe they were and maybe they weren't. Troubled by his dreams of doom and death and what he witnessed, Palmer isn't looking forward to the interruption provided by Bliss, Corky's old friend. The beautiful Bliss arrives like a hurricane stampeding across Palmer and Corky's lives. Her arrival sets off a cascade of events involving wild sex, illicit drug use, and Mob involvement that ends in a shattering and very bloody climax beneath a full moon.While billed as a mystery there is virtually no mystery involved here at all and very little depth to any of the characters. These characters are known for what they are within a few pages, if not paragraphs, as each one is introduced. Both the Mob boss and the movie director seem to have come from central casting. Palmer is a troubled aging tennis pro, with a hip young and fun girlfriend and an ability to get into trouble no matter where he goes or what he does. Within the first fifty pages of the novel, the parameters of the situation are clearly defined and all that is left as they followed their scripted roles are a few details.Palmer's angst over the twilight of his career and his future relationship with the much younger Corky, while pushed heavily by the author, comes across as shallow as his studly activities, drug induced or not. The character seems more like a caricature than an actual person to care about and as such, his own drama means little, as do the dramas of the other characters. While often told what to feel through lines in the text, this author does not jump that gap to make the reader actually feel or even care about these shallow characters.Any alleged story is pushed to the background by the rampant and very graphic sex scenes laced heavily throughout the 210-page novel. Wild sex is the primary theme aided at times by illicit and accidental drug use. Much of the sex is performed by women gone wild as their secret sexual fantasies come to life unleashed by the ingestion of the drug Rohypnol.What this novel is, instead of being a mystery, is a very graphic men's adventure read. The hero, often injured, is still a stud, the women are beautiful and amazingly willing (with or without drugs), the crime guys are Italian and do their typical Mob stuff. For what it really is, a fast paced simplistic storyline and read, it isn't bad."},{"Title":"Bourbon and Bliss","review":"By TT reviewer Elaine LeitePalmer Morel, under any normal circumstances, would be a down to earth, easy going type of guy. Except he has this dream that would make any one uneasy. He and his girlfriend, Corky Kennedy, decide that they need some time to rest and adjust to their new wealth. Palmer has received a three million dollar inheritance. So they take a three week vacation to New Orleans.During their stay, Corky decides to invite her long time friend, Bliss McCarthy, to come down for a few days and enjoy the sites of the Big Easy. No one would ever forget Bliss McCarthy. You could say that she is an Amazon, six feet tall with blond hair. Any man's fantasy would come to mind and she knew it. She attracted attention every place that she went.When Bliss arrives, Corky fills her in on how wonderful the city is. Not to mention that they are filming a movie right down the street from where they have rented their apartment. Corky's favorite movie star, Mark Christopher, is in the film. They think that it will be exciting to go and visit the set. What they are not expecting is that Bliss will attract the attention of the director of the movie, and that he will cast her to do a sexual scene with none other than Mark Christopher himself. Mark, being the playboy that he is, invites Bliss, Corky, and Palmer out for a night of fun.Palmer isn't sure if this is a great idea, until he sees how happy Corky is to be invited to go out with Mark, so he goes along with it. Bliss, on the other hand, wants more with Mark. Bliss finds Mark very attractive. She has been turned on by him after their sex scene and can't stop thinking about him. Mark has the same idea of Bliss that she does of him.Bourbon Street is no ordinary place. But the three of them never would have thought that Mark could get them into the trouble that they find themselves in. Sex clubs, drugs, the Mob and murder.Bourbon and Bliss is a book that makes you wonder how much trouble these four people can get into. I didn't want to stop reading until I found out. After I was done, I just said to myself, \\"unbelievable.\\""},{"Title":"Bourbon and Bliss","review":"I liked this book . . . and I'm an avid reader of non-fiction! The book has such a real-life appeal with Rochelle's descriptions of the New Orleans nightlife, the tastefully erotic interludes, and characters on the edge . . . their actions are believable if you \\"think\\" about what the author tells you about them -- yet you'll shake your head in disbelief that they can't see what's in store for them. Bourbon & Bliss will definitely stimulate memories of sultry New Orleans for those (of us) who have experienced Body Heat in the Big Easy."},{"Title":"Bourbon and Bliss","review":"While sitting at an airport waiting for a flight I found this book discarded and starting reading out of boredom. Well boredom should be part of the book title - as in Boredom and Bliss.The author writes in a shallow and clich&eacute;d style and seems to have modeled his storyline with the same depth as one of those 4th rate late night TV movies.The book does seem to prove that anyone can get published. Possibly the author guaranteed enough advance sales that it was published. You get the sick feeling that his family all received an autographed copy for Christmas. That is where the vanity comes from, writing a book to satisfy your ego. You suspect that he would send out congratulatory messages to himself."},{"Title":"The science of successful living","review":"I believe this book can give anyone the tools for living a happy and successful life. I was a student of Dr Raymond Charles Barker in New York City some 30 years ago. This book along with his many others changed my life. Dr Barker was truly one of the great spiritual thinkers of the 20th Century. His books are being reprinted and are all highly motivating, but this one may be his best. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The science of successful living","review":"The name Dr. Raymond Charles Barker is familiar to those in the Religious Science and Divine Science movements. THE SCIENCE OF SUCCESSFUL LIVING was written for the spiritually liberal and psychologically aware individual, because the author believes that health, prosperity, and well-balanced relationships are creative expressions and completely normal. The chapter titles proclaim the dynamic approach Barker has to living: The Necessity of Creative Ideas, The Operative Action of Mind, God and Your Subconscious, Resentment is Ruin, The Divine Intangible, The Intangible and Business, Why Spiritual Thinking Heals, Your Mind is Your Future, The necessity of Flexibility, and The Technique of Demonstration. A well-written expose on life, one that will further your grasp of Reality and personal success."},{"Title":"The science of successful living","review":"Charles Barker is so concise in this small book but there are some real powerful concepts that he explains well. His writing is very accessible and easy to understand. I think he's one of the best Science of Mind writers. He makes the laws of the universe and the applications sound so simple (and it is!). I found it to be very inspiring."},{"Title":"The science of successful living","review":"The book came quickly, I was surprised. It is in good condition. I am enjoying the notes that the previous owner wrote inside. This is an enlightening book and I think anyone who buys it will not be disappointed. Words of wisdom for sure."},{"Title":"The science of successful living","review":"There is something intangible, yet very powerful about Barker's writings. This book is no exception. If you want to feel more fulfilled and serene, then this book is worth its minimal costs 10 times over. Just have an open mind and follow his instructions. Recomended for anyone interestied in improving themselves. Law of attraction buffs will certainly enjoy this as well."},{"Title":"The Flip Side of Money (Sepia)","review":"Tabetha finally has a husband that appreciates her and treats her good--and life could not be better--or could it? Gilbert, her current husband wants a child of his own, since he has practically raised her teenage son. But Tabetha's career is going great and she doesn't want to interrupt it to have a baby. Tabetha and Gilbert are trying to work out their marital problems. Then, her first husband, Marlon, who jilted her and her son years ago, is now a proclaimed millionaire and has returned to get his family back--at whatever the cost. To make matters worse, Gilbert's ex-con sister is causing money problems for the couple and Tabetha's son is disrespecting Gilbert. Distrust and ulterior motives abound. Life is full of everyday situations that only money can fix! So, is the grass really greener on the other side? Earl Sewell writes a very realistic life situation."},{"Title":"The Flip Side of Money (Sepia)","review":"This is the third book that I had read of this author. Every book that he has written that I have read is just great. The characters in this book came to life every time and keep you turning. I read this book in one day. Marlon-ex-husband-is off the hook, he is right down dirty. Gilbert-husband-is too trust worthy. Tabetha-wife-is beening pulled in two different directions. She didn't know if she wented a trust worthy husband or her ex-husband that is down right dirty. Veronica-sister of Gilbert-is a con artist that stoles from everyone to keep her Man-BMC from killing her. Keep up the good work Earl and God Bless you."},{"Title":"The Flip Side of Money (Sepia)","review":"I agree with Zane's statement that this novel is for anyone who has ever been in love can relate to this story.

Another great story Earl!"},{"Title":"The Flip Side of Money (Sepia)","review":"This book was so good that I had to pull myself away from reading it and hated when it ended. That Veronica and Marlon were something else. I wanted to jump in the book and whip their you-know-what myself.

You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Flip Side of Money (Sepia)","review":"Earl is a great writer. Why do I say that? Because he does what gifted writers do. Expose those little nuances in life that say...\\"That is real, because it happened to me. How could he have known my secret?\\"Next, character development. Earl wants you to know the people he is writing about. No mystery. No guess work.Concerning the book, Earl has switched on us as readers. He has moved on from his sexually provocative experiences to a different genre of the human condition. He exposes the essence of unconditional love. Deserved or undeserved. I think most of us have felt the sting of this life experience. To be betrayed. To not receive that same love in return...to have the switch flipped on us. And for those who have not, this may be a shock to the system for uninitiated. To do something good for someone....just because. Stay tuned!I would like to say more about Earl Sewell. He is adventurous with his writing. Willing to open doors that we are too willing to keep close. In his skills as a writer he shows courage, strength and confidence. We are being exposed to a writer that is developing and growing with each book. This is a writer that needs our undieing support so we can all feast in his words.And to Earl I say...don't stop now. We have a long journey ahead."},{"Title":"The Flip Side of Money (Sepia)","review":"Tabetha Murphy was a college student with a bright future and a boyfriend named Marlon.

He leaves Tabetha to raise their son Rick on her own. Tabetha is now a successful career woman with a wonderful husband name Gilbert. Gilbert treats Tabetha better than Marlon ever could. Although Gilbert loves Rick as his own, he wants his own child with Tabetha. Tabetha doesn't want to stop her career and have another baby considering Rick will be heading off to college in a few years. Gilbert doesn't understand this, but he still wants to save their marriage. To make matters worse, a now wealthy Marlon is back in the picture and so is Gilbert's shiftless sister Veronica. Marlon wants Tabetha and Rick back, but he also has some ulterior motives.The Flip Side of Money is another wonderful novel by Earl Sewell. What I most liked about this storyline was the way Marlon came back into the picture causing confusion right in the middle of Tabetha and Gilbert's failing marriage. Gilbert's sister Veronica also threw in a good dose of drama. The Flip Side of Money shows that the grass is not always greener on the other side. With this novel, Earl Sewell continues to bring realistic storylines and engaging characters."},{"Title":"The Flip Side of Money (Sepia)","review":"After being jilted by her first husband Marlon, who could barely make ends meet, Tabetha Murphy now happily married to Gilbert, couldn't ask for a better life.

Her little perfect world is turned upside down when Gilbert reminds her that she made him a promise to one day have his child. She's not ready and for that matter, never will be; her only obstacle will be convincing Gilbert. However, now that Marlon, a self proclaimed millionaire with the means to provide her every need, makes known his intentions of getting his wife back, Tabetha decides to consider his offer.Gilbert doesn't know what to do. He and Tabetha are having major problems and Rick is starting to disrespect him. His ex-con sister Veronica, who does nothing but uses people, needs him. To top things off, he finds out that Marlon suddenly decides that he wants his family back. Will Gilbert find the strength that he needs to fight for his marriage and sever family ties with Veronica or will Tabetha discover that the grass is not always greener on the other side?I found Earl Sewell's THE FLIP SIDE OF MONEY to be a fast-paced and well-written novel. This novel delves into the lives of each character and the problems they each face. Sewell has written a wonderful novel about love, family and trust.

It seems everything gets touched on and nothing gets really discussed in depth. I find that after reading on a subject in this book, I am left feeling like I want more on the subject. This is a decent book for overview and probably works well for women who just want the facts and to move on. It really is a good book, just not for my particular needs.

I would advise people to get this book when they start trying to get pregnant because it also covers fertility. Many women I know waste a lot of valuable time with doctors that are not really fertility specialists and it is great to get any information that you can."},{"Title":"The Unofficial Guide to Having a Baby (Unofficial Guides)","review":"I'm so glad I found this book! I am six weeks into my first pregnancy, and this book has answered all my questions. It's packed with facts and appealingly presented. Pregnancy is not a disease, it's a process. The authors don't talk down to their reader at all, yet everything is clearly explained. I've spent hours in the bookstores, poring over every pregnancy book, and this is the only one I need."},{"Title":"The Unofficial Guide to Having a Baby (Unofficial Guides)","review":"I bought this book for a friend of mine who is expecting her first baby. As a woman who has already been through the pregnancy process twice, I started scanning the book, and it really started to draw me in. I found this to be the most informative pregnancy book I've ever read. I wish this book had been around while I was pregnant with my first baby! It has everything you could ever imagine in one book: from trying to conceive, to planning a layette, to a complete list of which medications are safe to take during pregnancy. It really captivated my attention with the tidbits of facts in the margins! I'm seriously contemplating another baby, and am going to buy this book for myself, and will definitely be giving it to any expectant friends!"},{"Title":"The Unofficial Guide to Having a Baby (Unofficial Guides)","review":"As someone just entering the pregnancy process, I have been spending hours in local bookstores looking for just the right thing. To find out what to do before conception to get your body healthy you need one book. To find out the best ways to ensure pregnancy you need another book. To learn about what it's like to BE pregnant you needed yet ANOTHER book! Until I found this book. It is newly published, so the information is very up to date. It includes all of the topics I listed above in great detail, and many more. The first large section talks about getting ready to conceive and then how to get pregnant, including a detailed section on infertility and all of the various treatments and options. After that, it takes you into all of the aspects of pregnancy including many I had never seen discussed at all, let alone at such length. Things like multiple births, miscarriages, etc. There is so much information in this book, I know I will be reading it over and over again. The only weakness I see is that there is not as much in depth about what to expect each month - it's broken into trimesters, and while it is pretty thorough, this is the one area I could have expected a little more detail. However, as a type A, planning focused woman, this book hit the spot for me. I know I will be as prepared as I possible can be. Last, but certainly not least, I loved the tone of the book. Especially with the sidebars, this book feels like it's written by a peer - a friend to friend discussion rather than a scientific lecture."},{"Title":"The Unofficial Guide to Having a Baby (Unofficial Guides)","review":"The editors at Amazon.com have it right: this book *is* the most comprehensive pregnancy reference book on the market today. There's information in this book that you won't find anywhere else: detailed information about prenatal testing, coping with the stress of a high risk pregnancy, being pregnant on the job, and much more.The information is comprehensive and extremely up to date. In fact, there's brand new information from the Yale University Department of Genetics about trends in carrier testing--a subject we're going to be reading a lot more about in years to come. There's also groundbreaking new data about high tech fertility methods, surrogacy, and the latest advances in preconception health.The web site directory also made a great addition to the book. I haven't had a chance to visit all of the web sites yet--there were over 100 web sites listed in the book!--but I've been very impressed with the calibre of the web sites that the authors have selected. (My husband got a real kick out of the one with the sports conflict catcher for expectant parents--a tool that lets parents time their pregnancies so that their due dates won't conflict with major sporting events. He wishes he'd known about that one sooner. Our baby is due in prime football Bowl season!)This book is fun to read and packed with useful information. I'm so glad that my doctor gave me a copy of this wonderfully informative book."},{"Title":"The Unofficial Guide to Having a Baby (Unofficial Guides)","review":"If I had known that 1/2 the book would be focused on special pregnancy circumstances, miscarriages, high risk pregnancy, carrying multiples, and infertility, I would not have bought the book. If you are having a normal pregnancy like me than reading the 3 chapters on what happens during the 3 trimesters left me finished with the book in one hour and wanting more information. The girlfriends guide is a better book, touching upon what a woman goes through.If you want a book which touches a bit on every combination and aspect of pregnancy, than this is for you. But if you are having a normal pregnancy and want more detailed information on what your body is going through than I would recommend another book"},{"Title":"The Unofficial Guide to Having a Baby (Unofficial Guides)","review":"This was a fantastic book. While I was pregnant, my husband and I would look forward to every Sunday morning when I would read the next chapter describing my baby's development that week. At the beginning of my pregnancy, I used several books but after a couple of months, I only referenced this one. This book offered practical, sensible advise and was not at all preachy. It offered different perspectives on subjects such as breast vs. bottle feeding without being negative toward any one subject. I highly recommend this book if you want a practical book that treats you like a reasonable adult."},{"Title":"The Unofficial Guide to Having a Baby (Unofficial Guides)","review":"I cannot say enough good things about this book. I've been using it for my whole pregnancy and it has answered every question I have and even some that I didn't think to ask. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Unofficial Guide to Having a Baby (Unofficial Guides)","review":"Finally, here\\u0012s a book about pregnancy that addresses real issues for real moms. (I wish it had been available when I started my family, and not when I was pregnant with my last child.) In addition to what you might want a pregnancy book to include, this book covers so many important topics that others gloss over or simply omit\\u0017infertility treatments, bed rest, pregnancy loss, surrogacy (there\\u0012s even a sample contract in an appendix), high-risk factors and treatments, emotional responses to pregnancy and motherhood. Although the book contains over 800 pages, it\\u0012s organized so that you can get just the straight facts quickly or read all the details at your leisure. The easy, approachable tone is also professional, so you intuitively sense the authors\\u0012 authority on the subject. And, unlike some pregnancy books that contain a lot of \\u0013fluff\\u0014 and are mostly good for entertainment, this one is rich with useful information from the medical and maternal community. Throughout, the book reinforces the notion that although nearly every pregnancy has its own quirky personality, most pregnancies are \\u0013normal.\\u0014 In short, it alleviates--rather than creates\\u0017paranoia. For example, where many pregnancy books lay down the law on what you must eat, how often you must exercise, and so on, this book is entirely forgiving of the expectant mother who is so sick with nausea that she can\\u0012t choke down her daily broccoli allotment, or too busy or exhausted from working or running after her other children that she can\\u0012t exercise. Sprinkled throughout each chapter are helpful hints, warnings, practical sidebar information (which reads like the whispered advice from a good friend), and the quoted experiences of many real-life moms, all which give the book a broad swab-stroke of knowledge about this most mysterious, profound, terrifying, worrisome, and joyous time of life. This is the book that I expect to recommend to my girlfriends."},{"Title":"The Unofficial Guide to Having a Baby (Unofficial Guides)","review":"I bought this book when we decided we wanted a baby. I really wanted to get The Mother of All Baby Books, but my store didn't have it. Turns out, Ann Douglas wrote both books, so it didn't matter.I found the preconception advice wonderful. It also gives you an overview of what to expect when you're actually pregnant, and breaks it down week by week. There are several helpful charts in the book, such as one that goes over the most common prescription and non-prescription drugs and the effects they have on the baby. There's also information on fertility testing when things don't go as planned.However, now that I'm 7 months pregnant first time mom-to-be, I find I don't use the book very often. The week-to-week information is great when you want to know what to expect before you get pregnant/just get pregnant, but it's not sufficient information to keep you really informed when you're actually at those critical points. I find that the book is lacking in details on those conditions that can pop up during pregnancy, such as increased heart rate, shortness of breath, etc. These are normal events, but I just wanted more information on what to expect and when to expect these kinds of conditions.Overall, it's still a great book. I definitely recommend it to those who are trying. However, if you're already pregnant, I recommend Your Pregnancy Week By Week. This has been my favorite book so far."},{"Title":"The Unofficial Guide to Having a Baby (Unofficial Guides)","review":"I'm trying to get pregnant for the first time. The Unofficial Guide to Having a Baby has proven invaluable. I've poured over practically every chapter -- preparing for pregnancy, misconceptions about fertility and infertility, getting pregnant, fertility treatments, symptoms of early pregnancy, how to choose a doctor and hospital or birthing center, childbirth education, and so much more! There are also chapters jam-packed with great information that I'll need to know later on, like carrying multiples, coping with a high-risk pregnancy, going through each trimester, delivery, and getting ready for the baby. To me, this book seems like a godsend. Lots of my friends have given me copies of other pregnancy books, but I like the Unofficial Guide to Having a Baby the best -- it's incredibly reader-friendly (finding information is a breeze!), and I have yet to look up something in this 800-page book and not have it be in there! Plus, there are short information blurbs on almost every page that offer terrific extra information, from recent studies to how to to save money to quotes from women like me. I can't imagine anyone not loving this book."},{"Title":"The Unofficial Guide to Having a Baby (Unofficial Guides)","review":"I found this book much more helpful than What to Expect When You're Expecting, mainly because it contained more practical information and less preaching. I would have liked a better sense of a week-by-week analysis of the stages of pregnancy and fetal development, but I did appreciate the way the book organizes some of its other major sections. The very best section is Chapter 13: The Dirt on Diapers and Other Baby Gear. This kind of advice would be very hard to find on sponsor-supported internet sites, since it advocates less consumerism and more practicality about what you really need to take care of a baby. I found this book less maudlin or &quot;cute&quot; and more intelligent than most of the baby guides I have read. What a relief to find a book that wasn't pastel and that didn't sport lots of sentimental claptrap! The guide to websites is also very helpful. My husband and I have read and enjoyed Unofficial travel guides for years, and we were thrilled to find that they had branched out to cover this important topic, too."},{"Title":"The Unofficial Guide to Having a Baby (Unofficial Guides)","review":"I owe my doctor a huge thank you for giving me a copy of this book. (Yes, I have the nicest doctor in the world. He gave me a copy of this book as soon as I announced that I was planning to get pregnant!) It has saved me so much anxiety. Whenever I've been tossing and turning at night, worrying about some aspect of my pregnancy, the answer has been right here in this book. Let me give you a few examples:I experienced a really scary episode of spotting when I was about eight weeks pregnant. The authors of this book gave me an idea of what was probably going on (spotting after my pelvic exam), something that really helped to ease my mind. I was positive I was going to miscarry.When I was about three months pregnant, I fell down about half a flight of stairs. I was totally panicstruck until I dug out my copy of this book and read about how well the fetus is protected during pregnancy.Around the same time, I got a terrible yeast infection. I was desperate for relief, and yet I was scared to use Monistat in case there were harmful effects on the baby. When I looked up the active ingredients in the drug on the prescription drug chart in the book, I discovered that there was no apparent link to birth defects--something that really helped to reassure me.When I was about six months pregnant, I was involved in a minor car accident. Once again, the book had reassuring words for me.The book has a list of the top ten worries of pregnant women. The list really helped me to realize that I was not the only one freaking out about whether or not my baby would be normal, how having a baby would affect my relationship with my partner, etc.I gave a copy of this book to my sister, who is trying very hard to conceive (unfortunately, without any luck so far) and she says that it's explained the mechanics of conception more clearly than any other book she's ever read. She found out that she has been miscalculating the timing of ovulation by nearly a week up until now. Hopefully it'll be just a matter of time before she ends up pregnant.I have so many positive things to say about this book. When I think of how many pregnancy books are scary or insulting, I'm just grateful that I happened to be given a copy of this book."},{"Title":"The Unofficial Guide to Having a Baby (Unofficial Guides)","review":"I debated about whether or not to buy the second edition of this book because I already own the first edition and I own The Mother of All Pregnancy Books, too (a book written by Ann Douglas, one of the authors of The Unofficial Guide to Having a Baby). But I can tell you that the second edition is a huge improvement over the first edition, and that's really saying something, because the first edition was pretty exceptional (we're talking mega-comprehensive).So why would you want to own two pregnancy books by the same author? Because they are two completely different books. The Unofficial Guide to Having a Baby gives you a highly comprehensive medical look at pregnancy, structured in a week-by-week format. The Mother of All Pregnancy Books give you a much chattier insider guide to pregnancy: the kind of stuff that your sister or your best friend would tell you if you were having a heart-to-heart the night the pregnancy test came back positive. The two books cover totally different turf, which is why I bought them both.Other books that are pregnancy must-reads, in my opinion: The Expectant Father (for fathers); The Pregnancy Journal (if you want to keep track of your baby's changes/growth day by day); and Pregnancy Fitness (for staying fit during pregnancy)."},{"Title":"The Unofficial Guide to Having a Baby (Unofficial Guides)","review":"I bought this book, on the recommendations of other Amazon readers, because my husband and I are planning on trying to conceive our first child in about 3 months.

It covers pre-conception, including how to get your body in shape for pregnancy, what to do if you have trouble conceiving, &quot;tricks&quot; for optimizing your chances at conception, and ways to keep the fun in your love life when trying to make a baby can make sex anything but fun. It covers the pregnancy itself, including the emotional and physical issues through each stage of pregnancy, the various tests that a pregnant woman might undergo, how to find decent maternity clothes, how to find a health care provider that is right for you. It covers (in an unbiased way) the circumcision decision and natural childbirth vs. medicated childbirth. It has a chapter on pregnancy loss, and a chapter on special-needs children. It covers the post-partum period, including C-section recovery tips, nursing tips, bottle-feeding tips, and baby care tips.

I bought all these books partially because I was so excited about becoming a mom that I wanted to read everything I could get my hands on. But as I embark on my second pregnancy, I've learned to streamline. Just as I came to appreciate the versatility of a pair of black leggings and a huge black maternity shirt (they can take you anyplace from a candlelit dinner to a morning at Gymboree), I value the all-inclusiveness of Ann Douglas' &quot;Unofficial Guide...&quot; Who needs a shelf full of pregnancy manuals when one will do the trick?

Those books are good, but they provide only one angle on pregnancy, that is, Arlene Eisenberg's. It's as cold as a sterile lab. We like a little bedside manner, and obviously want to hear more than one opinion.This book, like all the others in the Unofficial Guide series, is the result of surveying people who are in the situation that the book describes, in this case - Pregnant or Trying.The insight that other pregnant women can give is invaluable, since every pregnancy can be different. It's the next best thing to having a bunch of friends with kids. This was helpful for us since we don't!While the What To Expect books might describe something clinically, this Unofficial Guide tells you how this might affect you during the pregnancy. There is a great chapter which is dead on, entitled somthing like, &quot;What the other pregnancy books won't tell you&quot;.

(Again &amp; again!)"},{"Title":"The Unofficial Guide to Having a Baby (Unofficial Guides)","review":"While not quite living up to its promise of \\"For when you want more than the official line\\", it did come close. Of the six pregnancy books I read when my wife was pregnant, I think this is the best single book. However, I think the _Girlfriends Guide_ / _The Mayo Clinic Guide to a Healthy Pregnancy_ pair is better than this one alone. We ended up, however, buying all three, and didn't regret it.Why is this book better? For example, this book had the only really good discussion of the issues involved in genetic screening. Other books did discuss the pros and cons and risks of each procedure, but this was the only book that really laid out the personal / emotional issues involved, and when you should and should not consider it. Other books should learn from this.I also really appreciated the list of medicine. I know all books say to consult with your doctor first, but it's good to have everything in one summary without having to find a good site on the web.It also includes advice on trying to conceive. While we got this book after we conceived I didn't not really read that part, but from what I did look at it seems quite good.Alas, like all things in life, it's not perfect. I find that they try to be too \\"cutsey\\"; while good for about 5 pages, it gets annoying very quickly. It is slightly out of date in places, for example in their list of which artificial sweeteners are safe they miss all the new ones introduced in the last 10 years. It's also very difficult to hold (near 900 pages but only 8.2\\" x 5.3\\"). If they went to a larger but thinner book it would be much easier to hold.

I was able to open it up once a week and find out \\"What's Going on with My Body\\", \\"What's Going on with My Baby\\", \\"What Might be Going Through My Head\\", and a topical subject for the week. Each week I knew what body parts my baby was growing, what my body was about to do to me, and more. It was perfect for my first-time curiosity and excitement!The information was accurate, thorough, and honest WITHOUT being scary (like so many other books).I couldn't have survived my pregnancy without this book.The only thing it's missing?

Everything in it I had either read or heard elsewhere. Also, I was already pregnant when I bought it, so the large section on preconception wasn't of any use to me.

The sections about doctor, and childcare are extremely helpful as they provide you with a list of questions to ask. Additionally the chapters on what to buy and how to save are VERY helpful.

When I developed a cold, my OB recommended an antihistamine. I read the section on OTC meds and asked my OB if it would be all right if I took one that was rated safer in the book. He said that would be fine (I think he thought I was a bit overcautious). I delivered a healthy baby boy without the extra stress I would have felt about taking meds if not for this book. Lots of other useful info too..."},{"Title":"The Unofficial Guide to Having a Baby (Unofficial Guides)","review":"I totally disagree with the earlier reviewer who thought that this book was disrespectful toward expectant fathers. The authors went out of their way to include the expectant father in their discussions of all aspects of pregnancy and birth. In the chapter on bedrest, for example, the authors made a point of pointing out that the expectant father has to shoulder a huge burden when his partner is on bedrest. And each of the sections of the book that discuss the emotional challenges of pregnancy contain valuable information on how both partners may be feeling. Ditto for the detailed section on surviving the highs and lows of the postpartum period.As for the book containing feminist rants--oh, please.... The quote the earlier reviewer cited in his review was a humorous comment by the authors, not evidence of male bashing! Lighten up!

I predict that this book will soon become the new pregnancy bible for smart women who want to be as informed as possible during their pregnancies. The book also contains a lot of information that I simply haven't been able to find anywhere else: what you can do to increase your chances of conceiving as quickly as possible, which types of drugs are safe during pregnancy and which could pose a threat to your baby, what types of baby equipment are essential and which ones are frills, a blow-by-blow description of both a vaginal and cesarean birth, and much more.This is also one of the few pregnancy books on the market that doesn't talk down to fathers-to-be, something my partner appreciated tremendously."},{"Title":"The Unofficial Guide to Having a Baby (Unofficial Guides)","review":"I have been reading this book for the past few days and I absolutely love it!

And I've appreciated the way the info. is presented -not judgmental in any way. For instance, you can read the section on breastfeeding vs. bottlefeeding and come away informed, without feeling like you're going to ruin your child's life if you opt not to breastfeed.There's a really useful section on over-the-counter and prescription medications that I've referred to numerous times to make sure I was making smart decisions.I highly recommend this book for the medical perspective on pregnancy.

It covers everything from preconception to postpartum. The graphs are especially informative, covering such topics as over-the-counter medications and their potential effects on the fetus.

It really is the &quot;Bible of Pregancy.&quot; I refer to it constantly."},{"Title":"The Unofficial Guide to Having a Baby (Unofficial Guides)","review":"I find it to be the best pregnancy book I've seen so far. It gives you the &quot;no nonsense&quot; approach to conception, pregnancy and birth in easy to read chapters. If you are TTC, definitely grab this book. I love it."},{"Title":"The Unofficial Guide to Having a Baby (Unofficial Guides)","review":"I feel like I have waded through dozens of pregnancy and birth books, but inevitably, I always turn back to this one when I need information. It's a huge tome, and it does the best job of any book I've found of at least touching on just about every relevant subject one could think of (and going into great depth on many topics). Particularly valuable to me during my first pregnancy which ended in miscarriage was the generous section on loss and mourning. Many books hardly even mention the sad possibility that this can happen, and I really relied on this information a great deal. In addition to dozens of charts and diagrams, the appendices offer everything from Internet contacts to &quot;fill in&quot; guides for birth plans and hiring doulas. I would never recommend that any mother/dad-to-be rely on just one book, but I strongly advise expectant families to make this one a key part of their pregnancy/childbirth library."},{"Title":"The Unofficial Guide to Having a Baby (Unofficial Guides)","review":"This book is the best book I've found on having a baby!

I recommend it above all the others I have read."},{"Title":"The Unofficial Guide to Having a Baby (Unofficial Guides)","review":"This book is far from being a &quot;typical pregnancy book&quot; (as one unkind reviewer has unfairly described it). On the contrary, it is chock full of information I have never seen presented in any other pregnancy book, including supportive chapters on being pregnant while in an abusive relationship, or being pregnant while in a lesbian relationship. This is a pregnancy book useful for ANY pregnant woman, though, regardless of her life situation.Every topic is covered in a friendly, familiar tone, and potentially controversial issues are presented in an unbiased way. References to other resources (such as web sites, books, and toll-free numbers) are also provided.One of the best features is the quotations from real mothers liberally sprinkled throughout the book. Nothing speaks like the voice of experience, and any pregnant woman will benefit from the wisdom and insight provided in this book."},{"Title":"The Unofficial Guide to Having a Baby (Unofficial Guides)","review":"This practical, comprehensive book is written in a clear, easy-to-read style and includes many topics ignored or skimmed over in other books -- such as: tax ramifications related to having a baby; tests for fertility problems; shopping on a budget (what you really need &amp; what you can do without); and pregnancy in a variety of special circumstances, including being single, plus-sized, disabled, lesbian, etc.Sally Wendkos Olds, co-author, THE COMPLETE BOOK OF BREASTFEEDING"},{"Title":"The Unofficial Guide to Having a Baby (Unofficial Guides)","review":"I just bought this book for 2 friends of mine that are currently pregnant (based on another friend's recommendation). I have heard positive feedback from both of them - saying it's both a factual book and addresses many of the issues that they cannot find in other pregnancy books - and not in a &quot;doom and gloom&quot; format.

Now 2 weeks from the end of my second pregnancy, those 2 books have lived on my nightstand throughout both. I literally bought the Unofficial Guide because I like the format (have used Unofficial Guides for vacations etc.). I find it easy to reference and although the information doesn't go as indepth as some of the others it does provide stats and links to other sources (particularly on the web).The Girlfriends Guide is light reading and something that should be read cover to cover (also one of my favorites). But this book is for the quick answer to any question you might have (without annoying the heck out of your OB nurse or midwife). I have also thrown this book at my husband on several occasions when using it as proof that I am not crazy. Both are great picks for pregnancy reading.PS. while on my soapbox---I hate \\"What to Expect when you are expecting\\" it is entirely too negative and full of threats of all the things you shouldn't do and should be worried about. That book makes it difficult to enjoy pregnancy."},{"Title":"The Unofficial Guide to Having a Baby (Unofficial Guides)","review":"I was very pleased with this book. Even though I'm in the preconception stage, I read the book cover to cover, and I found it very useful and interesting. Even though the preconception and fertility sections are relatively brief, they are very concise. The book also answered many of my questions about the later stages in a very clear way. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Unofficial Guide to Having a Baby (Unofficial Guides)","review":"If you want the facts without being preached at, here it is. Lots of info on which to base YOUR decisions, without having someone tell you what to do or make you feel guilty. This book covers more topics in depth... but more importantly, it does something no book I have ever read does - it helps moms who WANT a hospital delivery have a GOOD one (and doesn't totally trash the concepts of birth center and home births at the same time). It describes the things you need to do to make sure that your pregnancy and birth are YOURS, and gives a fairly clear picture of the risks and interventions you face in a medical setting, and what to do about it, WITHIN that setting.Lots of useful advice, all piled into one book. I like the fact that things that are proven to work are supported here, like midwives, dulahs, relaxation, using water for pain management (like showers and Jacuzzis), and mobile labor (changing positions)... but if any of these things doesn't work in YOUR case, it is OKAY - no guilt! There are so many variables and ideas here that you will probably find something that helps for YOU, for anything from resolving back pain in the first trimester, to relieving morning sickness, to picking out maternity clothes, to deciding if you need genetic counseling, to pain management during labor. This book covers more bases and gives a clearer picture of the HUGE range of experience out there than any single book I've seen.Overall I give it a 5 star for women who don't know where to begin, and especially for those who expect to have a hospital delivery. I give it 4+ stars for women who plan to deliver outside the US medical &quot;norm&quot;... If you are a very alternative-healthcare mom, it is still a good resource, though you may already know some of the info from elsewhere.Plus, the tidbits from the &quot;real moms&quot; make it interesting and fun to read without adding &quot;fluff.&quot; :)"},{"Title":"The Unofficial Guide to Having a Baby (Unofficial Guides)","review":"My wife is pregnant and asked me to order a couple of other books.

I had already bought and read &quot;The mother of all pregnancy books&quot; and I loved her style of writing so I thought I would get this one as well. Surely it would have some different information? Not really, a lot of the quotes from the mothers and fathers are used in both books and even some of the writing seems to be almost exact.This is a GREAT book, it has pretty much all you'll need unless you have a special pregnancy that requires more specific books. But just know that you dont need this and &quot;The mother of all pregnancy books&quot;"},{"Title":"The Unofficial Guide to Having a Baby (Unofficial Guides)","review":"As other reviewers have noted, this book is stuffed with useful information from pre-conception to basic care for newborns. Tests and procedures are explained in detail, and the book does a good job letting you know how much (or how little) to worry about potential problems. This may not be a book you read from cover to cover. Rather, you may want to refer to sections as needed. The book's index makes quick reference easy. I find this style more useful than the chatty syles of other pregnancy books.The downside to this book is that it is geared solely to mothers. While the information is useful to a father, the book makes no effort to address questions or issues that might only concern a potential father. The book often assumes that the mother will go through her pregnancy with a partner, but the partner often seems like an afterthought. I have not found any section that discusses a partner's concerns (except where they would be the same as the mother's). For this reason, I feel that an otherwise good resource falls short.For potential fathers, I recommend using Mr. Brott's &quot;The Expectant Father&quot; as a needed supplement to the &quot;Unofficial Guide.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Unofficial Guide to Having a Baby (Unofficial Guides)","review":"Having been one of Dr. Sussman's patients for 20 years, I had to get all of his books! This book is very thorough just as he is when you sit down and talk to him. Having had my first child 8 years ago I needed a refresher course on what to expect. I use this book as my bible lately and it is an excellent resource for any questions that I have. Dr. Sussman covers everything from preparing for pregnancy, getting pregnant and fertility, childbirth classes, prenatal testing and what eachtest involves. Also covered are topics such as nutrition, exercising, hazards, and working while being pregnant. All three trimesters are discussed fully and what you may feel and what changes the baby is going through. Finally, labor and delivery are discussed as is breastfeeding and bottle-feeding. Postpartum information is given at the end of the book. Anyone that is interested in getting pregnant or is pregnant should invest in this book. I trust Dr. Sussman 150%! He delivered my son eight years ago and hopefully he'll be delivering another one soon!!!"},{"Title":"The Unofficial Guide to Having a Baby (Unofficial Guides)","review":"I have purchased all the &quot;must have&quot; books on becoming pregnant and pregnancy. I was afraid of the amount of pages in this book (over 800) and felt that it may be too technical. But instead I was very surprise to find this my favorite. I love this book! It gives a straight foward look at all aspects of pregnancy and touches on things that you would never think about ( having your partner take swimming trunks to the delivery to accompany you in the shower). For someone who has not been around a lot of smaller children, much less newborns, this also provides a very good overview of childcare and what to expect when you bring the baby home. A girlfriend of mine recently found out she was expecting and I have ordered her a copy, not wanting to give up mine! VERY informative. Easy to read. Great book to have from the pregnancy test on!"},{"Title":"The Unofficial Guide to Having a Baby (Unofficial Guides)","review":"This is the best book I have seen or read on pregnancy.

Granted, all the information is not pertinent to my particular pregnancy (thank goodness) but this book has an answer for just about anything -is it okay to color my hair while pregnant? What does it mean if I have spotting? It is all here in a beautiful, easy to understand, well written book. What I really love is that the book is thick. I love a really thick baby book for these inevitable insomnia filled nights we have while pregnant."},{"Title":"Fathers of the Church: Saint Augustine : Commentary on the Lord's Sermon on the Mount With Seventeen Related Sermons (Fathers of the Church Series)","review":"The table of contents is as follows:IntroductionCommentary on the Lord's Sermon on the MountRetractions: Book I: Chapter 19Sermons:53. On the Beatitudes54. How to 'Let Your Light Shine Before Men'55. On Taming the Tongue56. On the Lord's Prayer60. On Almsgiving61. On Almsgiving72. On Almsgiving94. The Slothful Servant109.

Christ: The Glory of Martyrs*11 (Morin). On the Beatitudes**Index.* The sermons so marked and the numbers assigned them are taken from a collection published by Michael Denis in 1792.** Taken from Dom Germain Morin's &quot;Miscellanea Agostiniana&quot;.Although the title work of this book is Augustine's close commentary on the Sermon on the Mount, the book also includes the chapter concerning the commentary taken from Augustine's &quot;Retractions&quot;, as well as seventeen of Augustine's sermons: ten of which took their themes from the Sermon on the Mount, and seven others that were included because they had not (at the time of writing) ever been translated into English.Scriptural commentary is not generally regarded as Augustine's greatest strength as a theologian; held closely to the text and the order of presentation in the text, he could not address the deep questions which the text as a whole raised, but at which individual passages in their immediate context only hinted, and it was in addressing the deep questions that Augustine excelled.Apart from their questions concerning their excellence, Augustine's method of commentary may seem quite surprising to those familiar with the more modern historical approach. Augustine's focus is on symbol-systems. Here, for example, is Augustine's commentary on the first part of Matthew 6:6:&quot;'But,' says He, 'when you pray, go into your bedrooms.' Now, what are these bedrooms but the very hearts that are signified also in the Psalm wherein it is said: 'The things you say in your hearts, be sorry for in your bedrooms.' He then continues: 'And closing the doors, pray in secret to you Father.' Our entering the rooms is not enough if the door be left open to the importunate, for external things rush brazenly in through this door, and lay hold on our innermost affections ... Therefore, the door must be closed;&quot;By way of contrast, Daniel J. Harrington, in the modern form, writing on the same passage from &quot;Sacra Pagina: The Gospel of Matthew&quot;, says:&quot;The Greek word tameion can refer to a 'storage room' or 'pantry', the innermost room in the house. In either case the idea is the room least likely to attract public notice. Perhaps such a room had no windows ... Matthew 6:1-18 functions as part of the attack against Jewish opponents of the Matthean community.&quot;Of course, the two forms of commentary are not mutually exclusive - a reader may hold both, either, or neither to be good readings. Some of course, may hold to the Harrington's form exclusively, and reject Augustine's symbol systems as imaginary. Others may hold to the Augustine's form exclusively and reject Harrington's Matthean community as imaginary.With regard to the sermons in the collection, Augustine himself always regarded his sermons as unsatisfactory, but he seems to have been alone in that assessment. His sermons were admired and his style imitated for many centuries afterwards, a fact that has greatly complicated trying to determine which sermons Augustine wrote, and which were imitations of his style.The editiorial material in the book includes the introduction, which provides a historical view of the works, both prior as regarding their composition, and later as to their reception and impact. Additionally, footnotes give exact references for Augustine's scriptural citations, translation issues, and references to other works of Augustine's or of others. Finally, the work has an index, which is, however, only fair."},{"Title":"How I Stole Her Husband","review":"Have you ever cringed because of a book title? I certainly have on many occasions. However, I've discovered that some of the most awful-sounding titles cloak some of the best stories. This is one such book. I absolutely loved Liz Ireland's previous book \\"Three Bedrooms in Chelsea\\". This latest novel is yet another wonderful read!Meet Alison Bell, our main heroine. She was once a rich girl and grew up in a very nice part of Dallas, TX, but her father has since went bankrupt and went to live the simple life on a ranch. Alison is now on her own and in her late twenties, living in a squalid apartment, and looking for a new job. She finds a wonderful opportunity in the newspaper and goes to inquire about it. The ad was looking for a nanny, with possible relocation to New York City. This particularly appeals to Alison since her best friend from college relocated there years ago.Imagine Alison's mortification and surprise when she discovers the woman who is interviewing her for the nanny job is none other than Pepper McClintock. Not only was Pepper a rival of Alison's since the tender age of 5, but Pepper had stolen and apparently married Alison's one true love, Spence Smith! Pepper and Spence are married with a beautiful child, and very well off, while Alison is single, poor, and looking for work as a nanny.However, Pepper manages to talk Alison in to taking the job. Alison discovers a few things pretty quickly. First off, she isn't really nanny material. Second, Pepper is certainly holding a grudge against her. And third, she isn't quite over Spence yet... The entire situation is a recipe for disaster! When they do relocate to New York City, things get even more insane.Despite the ridiculous title, I loved this book. Liz Ireland has crafted a fantastic, multi-layered and impossible-to-put-down story. She seems to have a knack for creating irresistably offbeat characters with both good and bad qualities. I must add that this book really much about stealing husbands and getting revenge. (The back cover certainly exaggerates). Alison is a great main heroine despite her many weaknesses and passivity. The plot, which goes from the present to past tense (so the reader can see why Pepper and Alison have so much angst between them), is absorbing and exciting.There were a couple of things in the story I found irritating. One was Spence's character. He wasn't in enough scenes for the reader to get a good sense about his personality, and when he did show up, he seemed lifeless and like a cardboard cutout. (What DID Alison and Pepper see in him??) Also, as mentioned above, Alison was very passive at times - to the point of me wanting to give her a good shake. However, even those things weren't enough to make this less than a five star read.Overall, this is one book you do NOT want to miss!"},{"Title":"How I Stole Her Husband","review":"Former debutante Alison Bell had it all. The rich daddy, the McMansion in a Dallas suburb, the expensive private liberal arts college, the handsome boyfriend... Her pampered existence is no more when a series of errors in judgment causes her father to lose the family fortune.Fast forward ten years: Alison is destitute after a series of dead end jobs have left her penniless & unfulfilled. An ad for a nanny seems too good to be true. When she meets the woman of the household, she realizes it was in fact too good to be true, as her would-be boss is her high school nemesis, Pepper, at whom she tossed horse doody when she was five. In high school, Pepper stole the love of her life, financial whiz Spencer, who is now Pepper's husband. Pepper is living the life that Alison dreamed about. After mulling the offer over with the aid of her two best friends - one who said run, the other who said take it, she takes the job, as Pepper has assured her that bygones are bygones. Not surprisingly, Pepper was not honest. Alison finds herself in over her head with a troubled toddler, an uncooperative maid, a constantly absent father, and an unfaithful Pepper who figures her job ended after childbirth. And she's nursing a broken heart over Spencer, who takes every spare moment he can to reminisce about the good old days.When the family finally relocates to New York, Pepper continues to make Alison's life unbearable. But time spent with her best friend and Finn, the brother of her other friend, who wants to be more than her friend helps may it more bearable. But with unresolved feelings for Spencer, she pushes Finn away, staying primarily for young August. When she finally gives in to her passion for Spence, her life is suddenly turned upside down as she has become what she always dreaded - the other woman. Will she find love everlasting with Spence? Will she ever overcome her esteem issues and stand up to Pepper? And what about her growing attraction to Finn?While a great premise, and written with very witty dialogue, it's disappointing that we never really get to know either of the male characters, particularly Spencer - he's rarely around to get to know, we know more about him from her high school memories than his current life (probably why she still cares for him). But the story is enjoyable, and her interactions with Finn make you realize that she might be chasing after the wrong dream."},{"Title":"How I Stole Her Husband","review":"I almost passed this book by because I took it for yet another dreary chic lit Bridget Jones imitation but I was facing a long train ride and really wanted something light and breezy to read so I bought it. Lucky me. The heroine is very well written. She's not dumb, or pitiful and she actually grows up and discovers that having isn't always as satisfying as wanting. The villainess of the book, Pepper is suitably nasty and the New York scenes are all mostly funny. I had two small nit picks though. Spence, the love interest falls flat when he finally makes his adult appearance and the the apparently prerequisite strained mother/daughter relationship thing has been done to death. Just once in a chic lit book I'd like to see a heroine who has a reasonably healthy relationship with her parents.Anyway, the book is a very amusing way to spend a few hours."},{"Title":"How I Stole Her Husband","review":"I had my eye on this book for awhile but I just recently purchased from Amazon. I'm so glad that I did. I won't recount the plot since other reviewers have already but the book was never boring for me and I read it an afternoon. Alison is a great character and Liz Ireland wrote it so you do root for Alison and want the best for her in the end. Liz Ireland also does a great job of creating characters so you know who to root for and for who not to root for. The title does make you think of something different than what the book actually is but the phrase \\"How I stole her husband\\" does tie in with what happened to Alison in the book-you'll just have to read it to find out how. I would definitely recommend this book to any chick-lit reader. In the future, I will definitley be reading more of Liz Ireland's books."},{"Title":"How I Stole Her Husband","review":"I figured this was some story about a slutty nanny in the mold of Paris Hilton (not that she was ever a nanny), but it's really about a less-than-glamorous woman named Alison who takes a job out of desperation. She ends up working as a nanny for her childhood rival, Pepper McClintock. Pepper stole Alison's boyfriend in high school, but their rivalry goes back to age 5, when Alison threw horse dung at Pepper during Pepper's extravaganza birthday party.Pepper puts on a facade of niceness but quickly shows her true colors, forgetting to reimburse Alison for money Alison spent on Pepper's daughter's bathing suit ($108), becoming hysterical when Alison gives a Dove bar to Pepper's daughter, and sleeping with a guy on Alison's bed, then refusing to change the sheets. Given how awful Pepper is, the reader is actively rooting for Alison to steal Pepper's husband.However, you can tell Alison is blind to the husband's faults, and so certain plot developments are not a surprise. That said, the book is really well-paced, especially after the very beginning, and Alison is a very funny character with lots of one-liners and snide observations. She is not always the best-behaved, but most readers will identify with her flaws and wishful thinking. The novel takes a little while to get going, but once it does, it's a page-turner."},{"Title":"How I Stole Her Husband","review":"I am not usually a fan of Liz Ireland. Her previous book left me blah!However, in How I Stoler Her Husband, the author manages to tell an interesting tale of chick lit with a little twist.I really got into all of the characters in this book even though I must admit that \\"Pepper\\" was kind of your standard fare evil-rich woman that you find in so many chick lit books. Its hard to believe that anyone would tolerate these types for very long - so this makes the story a bit of a stretch for me.However, I enjoy the relationship between Al and August (this kid is going to need therapy) and even Al's friends are interesting and play a semi-important role in the book. The character of Spence feels as though he just \\"appears\\" in the story and then pops out and in again. This character did not feel fleshed out properly to me.The writer has an engaging writing style and the story is fun although it is far from deep.The character of Al is truly a doormat (as one of her friends points out to her) and this kind of removes some of the pleasure of reading this for me. I would have liked to see Al with more backbone - but then again, this book would not be possible if Al was written in this manner.Overall, a very good choice."},{"Title":"How I Stole Her Husband","review":"How I Stole Her Husband is a very enjoyable read to anyone who has ever felt bad about themselves or is having a hard time finding a book that the average person can relate to. The characters are all unique and you find yourself drawn into every second of the book to find out what happens. I never found a boring moment where i just wanted to skip ahead because what i was reading wasn't interesting. I also enjoyed the creativity not to many books out there make you feel like you could actually be in that situation, which gives it appeal. I would definatly reccomend this book to any girl, sorry i don't think the fella's would enjoy this one."},{"Title":"How I Stole Her Husband","review":"I found the characters to be so life like - it made the novel even more entertaining.

Reading it was very disappointing and rater boring and I'll explain why:The main character Alison takes a job as nanny for Peppers 3 year old daughter August, which is lengthly drawn out over 100 pages including all the likes and dislikes of this job. Also we learn that Pepper seems to cheat on her husband Spence.Spence, which we know has been Alison's High School Sweetheart, is on a business trip to Hong Kong, and noticeable absent the majority of the time, even Alison states on page 104 \\"I had begun to think of Spence as just an occasional talking point, not really part of the household\\". Maybe I was wrong to begin with but I thought the romance between Alison and Spence was supposed to be the major plot line.When he finally appears, he Alison and August go together to a restaurant the used to go back in High School talking about old times, still no romance building up yet.Then the whole clan moves to New York, we learn that Pepper has another affair there; Alison, Spence and August go to central park together and one evening they go out to dinner without August and start kissing each other after that. A few days later Alison moves into Spence's hotel room, and a week after that she decides to leave him after finding out he had had an affair with the prior nanny too. Within a few days later than that she starts a new relationship with this guy Finn she knew.This book is more a run down of events than any kind of a romantic story, everything just seems to happen for no reason, I miss the gradual growing attraction between Alison and Spence. For me that makes this book a major disappointment."},{"Title":"How I Stole Her Husband","review":"This book is way above and beyond all the other chick lit out there.

Afterwards her mother left her father for a man who had lots of money and her boyfriend Spencer Smith left her for her nemesis Pepper right before all three graduated.10 years on Allison just got lad off from her job and needs another. She reads a help wanted add for a nanny for Mr. and Mrs. Smith who is willing to relocate to NYC or London. Allison calls and has an interview the next day. Low and behold Mrs. Smith turns out to be Pepper the girl that stole Spencer away from her. Alison is reluctant to work for them, but little August \\"Auggie\\" is so cute that she decides to work for them.Allison's friends don't want her to take the job because Spencer was the first person that she ever loved and the first person she was with in a romantic way (One of them sings Sheryl Crow's song The First Cut is the Deepest to her) Allison does not listen to them however and moves with the Smiths to NYC where things with Spencer and her really start to heat up.The only reason why Spencer and Pepper had married was because they thought she was pregnant and stayed married even thought Pepper continually cheats on Spencer. Their marriage is not very good and when Spencer and Allison are together in New York City they can not fight the attraction that they have for each other and Spencer ends up leaving Pepper for Allison.

I really didnt care much about some of the details because they were not important to the story. I found them to be filler details.The book slowly picks up speed and then it gets good. I wasnt \\"hooked\\" but I had enough interest to keep reading. It gets a bit juicy towards the end but I felt it a bit rushed which by then I didnt mind as I actually wanted it to speed up.The end was just horrible. Gunning it for the highway? that is so cliche.

I kept reading, hoping to have that \\"aha\\" moment where I finally put all the pieces together... but there was not one. I did not think there was anything remarkable about Alison, and I never really liked her. She was wishy-washy, spineless, and settled way too many times during the story. I felt so sorry for every character in the book.... except for Alison's friends.. Nola and Jess - who were poorly developed. I found myself flipping back pages/chapters to see if I'd missed something about these random people. The middle part of the story dragged on and on.... and then in a matter of one or two chapters.. everything was resolved ... but I still felt unresolved since the resolutions were so weak."},{"Title":"How I Stole Her Husband","review":"The characters in this novel are what I think makes this book a success. The antics and personality of Pepper were completely atrocious and you really just began to feel hatred for her while reading. I kept waiting for Alison to stand up for herself and just totally tell her off and was disappointed that she was more like a doormat but at the end, she comes through and delivers.

There had always been some conflict between Alison and Pepper, which started off by Alison who threw horse poo on Pepper during Pepper's birthday party when they five. Not to mention Alison had never gotten over the fact that Spencer dumped her for Pepper. However, Alison was determined to forget the past and have a fresh start with her new job. Things were of course became quite complicated.This was quite an okay chick lit. Personally, I did not feel connected to the main character Alison because I find a bit annoying as well as whiny. She chose to be the \\"victim\\" and subjected herself to be humiliated by Pepper. There were not a lot of secondary characters development as the book seemed to focus solely on Alison's disdain for Pepper as well as her unending attraction for Spencer.

If you have not caught up by reading volumes 1-7, I'd suggest finishing those volumes before moving to this one. It's not absolutely necessary (this volume takes place largely outside the continuity of the universe), it helps if you are familiar with Gaiman's style and characters. If you have not read any Sandman yet, you're in for a treat:The Sandman Vol. 1: Preludes & Nocturnes (New Edition).REVIEW:WORLD'S END is a 6-issue arc that is composed of 6 short stories. Picking up off of the heftyThe Sandman Vol. 7: Brief Lives, Gaiman takes the listeners outside the Sandman narrative for a handful of musings. WORLD'S END follows two travelers who mysteriously find themselves lost in a storm. Seeking shelter and safety, the two travelers find their way to World's End, an inn that exists somewhere between space and time. The inn is populated with other wayward travelers, from different times, dimensions, and universes. With everyone stuck at the inn, the patrons pass the time by sharing stories.These standalone stories range greatly in content, delivery, tone, and characterization. What I admired most about this collection was the range that Gaiman has control over. Each issue's narrative feels almost as if it were written by a different author -- this creates an impressive perceived verisimilitude to the characters' stories. These shifts in tone, however, are nearly seamless. The stories work with the reader and not against them. There's a moment in WORLD'S END when Gaiman is describing a character telling a story in which a character is telling a story about another character telling a story. Sound confusing? In the moment, it makes perfect sense, it's perfectly clear, and it doesn't feel out of place at all.Gaiman admits in the acknowledgments that WORLD'S END was inspired by his desire to experiment with other authors. The result is incredibly interesting and beautiful. Each patron's story is pencilled/inked by a different artist as compared to the frame narrative. This conceit adds further depth to these stories; WORLD'S END is a story about the power of stories. While some of these narratives find us encountering Morpheus, he's conspicuously missing for the most of the volume. There's a good reason for that, but readers will have to wait for the final moments of the volume to discover why. The ending is spectacular.I've read this collection in the original trade-paperback version (released in the mid-90's) and again in the updated version (released in 2012). The \\"new edition\\" (The Sandman Vol. 8: World's Endcontains everything from the previous collection (including Stephen King's introduction), but the color has been restored to reflect Gaiman's intent. The difference isn't jarring, but in the case of WORLD'S END, which relies heavily on the artwork, I'd definitely side with the \\"new edition\\" here. Additionally, the updated version is available on Kindle (and other eReaders)."},{"Title":"The Sandman Library, Vol. 8: Worlds' End","review":"An excellent example of Neil's work. A wonderfully told tale about telling tales. Mr. Gaiman utilizes the \\"frame story\\" to such advantage that the audience is often so lost in the multifaceted worlds that one forgets that they are reading at all. Truly masterful."},{"Title":"The Sandman Library, Vol. 8: Worlds' End","review":"I am a huge Neil Gaiman fan and have been slowly working my way through his Sandman graphic novels. Slowly because I want them to last as long as they can. This book was lots of fun. It was less pilosophical than the last book and more fun; but there are still deep underlying messages woven into the stories that are told.In this book a guy and girl get into a car accident and find themselves taking shelter from a June snowstorm at a strange inn. In the inn a number of fantastical people from various times and realities are waiting out the reality storm. While they wait they tell a number of interesting stories.This story is a bit of a break from the stories about the mythological gods. The gods are still in some of the stories and, in the end, it ends up that even this whole novel is really about them in a very direct way.I enjoyed every bit of this book. It was fun to read about all these different stories. The idea of an Inn at the end of reality is fun and interesting. The artwork throughout the book went through a number of different styles but all of them were fantastic.A wonderful addition to the Sandman series. I can't wait to read the next one!"},{"Title":"The Sandman Library, Vol. 8: Worlds' End","review":"This is good, but likely my least favorite Sandman so far. It has some of creativity present in the other volumes, but, really, it represents a significant step downward from the peak of inspiration the Sandman is famous for. The format of this volume is the 'story collection' used in earlier volumes, yet, here, to weaker effect. Overall, a decent disappointment."},{"Title":"The Sandman Library, Vol. 8: Worlds' End","review":"First, it's Gaiman, which makes it almost a must buy. It's also Sandman, the title that put Gaiman on the map, for me, at least. It's the eighth book in a ten book collection of the entire Sandman series. This one has a lot of seemingly unconnected stories, which, in fact, kind of wrap up some loose ends from earlier. More importantly, it shows the funeral of a major character in the Sandman's world. This sets the stage for the next two volumes. Fan-blasted-tastic. Get it, read it. End of this story."},{"Title":"The Sandman Library, Vol. 8: Worlds' End","review":"While some readers may believe Worlds' End may not be as entertaining as other volumes because Dream and the Endless are only briefly shown, Gaiman spins another yarn of a tale and what may not seem to be about Dream actually is.A large collection of characters from different worlds are drawn together at a tavern called Worlds' End. A large \\"reality\\" storm brings these travelers together to the tavern, where the many different characters tell tales to pass the time. These tales include \\"a swashbuckling adventure, a sea story, a gangster story, a grisly boys' funeral story, and even a little ghost story.\\" Each of these tales is unique and a splendid read, but the funeral at the end is big (and explains the reality storm), and it is clear Gaiman has drastically changed the Sandman series and is setting up the reader for a monumental volume to follow."},{"Title":"The Sandman Library, Vol. 8: Worlds' End","review":"Like Fables and Reflections, this volume focuses on a collection of stories. I liked the short stories because it was a nice break from the main plot, and we could enjoy stories from this same universe and learn a bit more about minor characters we have seen before. Following Brief Lives, this was a definite solid read."},{"Title":"The Sandman Library, Vol. 8: Worlds' End","review":"Neil Gaiman has established himself as one of the great writers in the world of graphic novels. Volume 8 of the Sandman series takes a side step to view the universe of the Endless from the point of view of a handful of (relatively) small beings stuck in an Inn at the end of the world. As the Reality Storm rages outside, these travelers share stories that reveal the depth of the characters that Gaiman has created. Although not focusing on Morpheus, aka Dream of the Endless, their stories give the reader perspective on the Lord Shaper that cannot be seen in any other way.The last few pages are haunting and urges the reader into Volume 9 like few other literary pieces. This is a MUST BUY for graphic novel fans and fans of a wonderful story."},{"Title":"The Sandman Library, Vol. 8: Worlds' End","review":"This is my favorite of the Sandman series so far. On to book 9, but this one blew me out of the water. The quality and beauty of all the mini stories was mind altering. I feel like I just did drugs again for the first time.One of my favorite things that Neil does is introduce old stories and mythology that I've never heard of. Then I can go back and investigate these characters as they existed in real life and walla!, I've learned something new."},{"Title":"The Sandman Library, Vol. 8: Worlds' End","review":"A reality storm causes a group of travellers, all afflicted by actual storms in their own realities to be transported elsewhere, nearby to the Inn at World's End. They all take shelter there, heal injuries, and pass the time on the piss and doing some telling of stories. One of the travellers is Cluracan of Faery, having been on a diplomatic mission, and two are humans from different time periods."},{"Title":"The Sandman Library, Vol. 8: Worlds' End","review":"From a previous review, the following quote exists:fans of Gaiman will note that \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\" borrows heavily from the essay he wrote for the SIMCITY 2000 gameAs a point of accuracy, it's the other way around, The Tale of Two Cities came before the SimCity 2000 Game.This is still my favorite collection of Sandman Stories. The Sea Witch Story is one I occasionally dream about."},{"Title":"The Sandman Library, Vol. 8: Worlds' End","review":"Are Sandman fans such because they love the characters (Dream, Delirium, etc.) or because they love the writings of Neil Gaiman?I'd imagine that there are both types, and that most of us are somewhere on a continuum in-between.I mention this, because those of you who are closer to the \\"love Gaiman\\" pole, like myself, will doubtless love this collection of short stories, set in the Sandman universe. On the otherhand, those who are closer to the characters pole might well be disappointed, as they are almost non-existent, here.Worlds' End concerns a group of travellers, taking shelter from a very strange storm at a pan-dimensional inn, who while away the hours telling stories, a la The Canterbury Tales, The Decameron, Hyperion, etc. While we *could* say that this is a tired cliche, or device, or any number of things that would be unfairly unflattering of Mr. Gaiman, I think, rather, that he's using this structure to make a point. In fact, *within* one of these stories, there is a character who gets into a group that starts telling stories to pass the time. The tale, itself, is a narration of a story being told. And, lest we forget, the whole comic is a story being told from Gaiman to us. Stories, within stories, within stories, within stories, within stories...I think that, here, Gaiman wants to reflect in part on the role that stories play in our lives. Sandman, here, isn't Dream, but is the Master of Stories (which is pointed out in this volume).And so, if you're comfortable with the fact that cutie Death will only put in a cameo or two, the question becomes: are these stories any good?My answer--yes, they're good.Another strong book in an amazing series. Five stars."},{"Title":"The Sandman Library, Vol. 8: Worlds' End","review":"Neil Gaiman, Sandman: Worlds' End (DC Comics, 1999)Worlds' End, the eighth book in the Sandman series, shows the increasing fragmentation of the main characters' stories, as we get another book that only tangentially has anything to do with the Endless. That said, the possible disintegration of the overarching story arc does nothing to diminish the quality of this fantastic series.Brent and Charlene are driving through rural Illinois when a snowstorm blows up. This would not be strange, save that it's the middle of June. The car is wrecked, and the two of them eventually come to the Worlds' End Inn, a place between the worlds where travelers caught in out-of-the-ordinary storms come to rest and exchange stories until the storm ends. That's the frame, anyway; the actual book is stories within stories within stories. And while the stories themselves are fascinating glimpses into both new worlds and those we already know, what is most interesting about this book is its construction, the way in which we go levels deep into stories without ever getting confused as to where we are and how far down we've gone; everything works surprisingly well for this sort of narrative.This probably shouldn't surprise me, given that Sandman has a well-deserved reputation for brilliance. This book is one of those that truly showcases it. ****"},{"Title":"The Sandman Library, Vol. 8: Worlds' End","review":"Like Fables and Recollections and Dream Country, World's End is a collection of individual stories that have little do with the Sandman arc. Unlike its predecessors, however, there is greater continuity between the stories, negating the impressions I had (particularly in Dream Country), that Gaiman just threw together a bunch of cool - but unrelated- ideas and constructed a book. The stories within World's End are all linked to a singular event: travelers gathering 'round and exchanging their weirdest, most interesting tales (admittedly, an almost done-to-death literary device). Gaiman breathes new life into this convention by inserting a dizzying amount of layers into the storytelling function. In a wonderfully witty Introduction, Stephen King compares the collection to \\"nested Chinese boxes:\\" stories existing within stories within stories. Gaiman really flexes his writing muscles here, constructing highly imaginative parallel universes that eerily mirror our own world (fans of Gaiman will note that \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\" borrows heavily from the essay he wrote for the SIMCITY 2000 game). He also inserts his most shocking plot twist to date at the end of the book, which forms the basis of the last two books on the Sandman collection and is guaranteed to pique the continued interest of the Sandman readership.I really enjoyed the diversity of the art; to note, the visually arresting rectangular and vertically arranged panels done by Alec Stevens in the aforementioned lead story \\"A Tale of Two Cities;\\" John Watkiss' crispness and use of clean lines; the tasteful, subdued tones of Michael Zulli and frequent Sandman collaborator Dick Giordano in \\"Hob's Leviathan.\\"My only wish would have been for the book to be a little longer. Obviously, that's not a critique at all, but a compliment to Gaiman's skills as a writer. But, when you're plunking down $32.95 (Canadian) for a book, it's a little disappointing to get a relatively slim volume."},{"Title":"The Sandman Library, Vol. 8: Worlds' End","review":"Neil Gaiman's Sandman is one of the greatest comic books of all time. Alan Moore may have started the comic-book-as-art movement, but Neil Gaiman made it more accessible by setting his stories in the common world of Myth. Sandman is the comic book that English teachers (should) love, a story that blends both popular and obscure myths and stories of Egyptian, Greek, and other cultures into an entertaining story backed by poignant and timeless philosophy.That being said, I don't like this book nearly so much as some of the others. \\"World's End\\" centers on several travelers who find themselves unstuck from their native universes and they pass the time telling stories together. Like \\"Dream Country,\\" this is not a story but rather a series of largely conflict-less vignettes, and I don't enjoy those nearly so much as the mythic epics like \\"Brief Lives\\" and \\"Season of Mists.\\" In those stories, there is a sense of adventure, but in these short story collections I feel like I am just witnessing Neil Gaiman ramble on about some weird thought he had, a thought that is intriguing but doesn't really go anywhere.This is of course personal preference, but I think it is best exemplified by the \\"Prez\\" story. Our narrator meets a man who tells her a story about an alternate universe President of the U.S. This president was beloved by the people but discovered that he was put in power by a guy named Mr. Smiley, who has a smiley face for a head. That's pretty much the whole story. For this pointless bunch of words to be lodged squarely between \\"Brief Lives\\" (a fantastic and thoughtful book where someone dies) and \\"The Kindly Ones\\" (a world-shattering book where someone else dies), I don't know, I have to admit that I was kind of bored. I didn't really know why I was being told the things that I was being told, and felt generally unsatisfied.I like the end of \\"World's End\\" very much, when we discover why these people have found themselves at the end of the world, and when we learn what happens to them afterwards, but I didn't much enjoy getting there. I got this one out of the library, whereas I bought many of the other ones, because that's pretty much what it was worth to me."},{"Title":"The Sandman Library, Vol. 8: Worlds' End","review":"I guess one would be extremely hard pressed to choose which of the Sandman collections can be considered the best, but I'm going to choose this one. I'm a little biased, because it was these stories which hooked me on the Sandman when the series was still being published in the early 90s. Gaiman is an intensely storyteller with a wide bredth of mythology at his command which he weaves together in the individaul issues reprinted in this collection. The artwork but such luminaries like Mike Allred of later Madman fame (in the mesmerizing story &quot;Prez&quot;) enhance the spellbinding words that Gaiman has meticulously crafted for the right affect.The Sandman is best appreciated when read it order the magazine was publihsed, which is difficult to do in the TPB and hardcover editions because some of the stories are reprinted thematically, not sequentially. However, if you are not sure who you will respond to Gaiman, Dream and the rest of the Endless this edition will give you a satisfying glimpse of not just great comic storytelling, but great storytelling. I wouldn't call this fantasy, nor would I dismiss this as &quot;a mere comic book.&quot; Gaiman helped elevate the medium with his creation, all fans of the written word and graphic art will enjoy this and all the volumes in the Sandman collection."},{"Title":"The Sandman Library, Vol. 8: Worlds' End","review":"This is the only volume in The Sandman series that I actually had to force myself to finish. Although \\"Worlds' End\\" includes some foreshadowing to the far superior \\"The Kindly Ones\\", the story just doesn't seem to go anywhere. Needless to say, earlier volumes that focused on minor/supporting characters were far more successful."},{"Title":"The Sandman Library, Vol. 8: Worlds' End","review":"Brant Tucker and Charlene Mooney are two travellers making their way cross-country, when a snowstorm (in June, no less!) and an otherworldly animal-beast in the middle of a highway interrupts their travel, and the car crashes. Lost in the blizzard, Brant stumbles upon The World's End Inn, a free house. A tavern populated by people and creatures from different worlds and times, displaced from their homes by a \`reality storm', an event so cosmically huge, it resonates across time and space.So, to kill time until the storm passes, they tell stories. The art in theWorld's End framing sequences is top-notch stuff by Bryan Talbot and Mark Buckingham. Very tight, its realism contrasting nicely against the art in some of the other stories.The first story, \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\", the story of a man (literally) lost in the dreams of his city. While a favorite of Sandman editor Karen Berger, I must confess I found it a little puzzling and indecipherable. And this is no fault of the artist, because the separation of text and art works very well. The format almost makes up for the lame story. My least favorite in the book.Cluracan's Tale was much more enjoyable, starring and narrated by the lovable, oft-inebriated, arrogant emmisary of Queen Titania of Faerie. Cluracan is sent to a city-state run by a corrupt, piggish king, who is, by a quirk of politics and bloodlines, is also the city's spiritual leader. What follows is an adventurous story of murder, family helping family, and political sabotage. The art's very nice here, conveying a very interesting fairy-tale look, although Cluracan, Titania, and Nuala look nothing at all like they do in this or any of the other books.Hob's Leviathan, a story of the immortal Hob Gadling (my favorite Sandman character, bar none) told by Jim, a young man who met Hob on a Ship in 1914. A stowaway is discoverd, whom Hob knows as a fellow immortal (in case you didn't know, he's the king in the story of the fruit of eternal life). Jim's fascination with the sailboats becomes the readers own. The crew of the Sea Witch are given real personalities here, and are shown to be real people. After the ship is nearly capsized by a sea serpent, every one of these grown men cry. This was my favorite story in the novel, mostly because of Michael Zulli's wonderful art. While sketchy and bland compared to his work in The Wake, it's still beautiful and works with the story wonderfully to convey the wonder and grandeur of those ships.In The Golden Boy, the story of cheesy 70's comic character Prez Rickard, the teenage president, is updated courtesy Gaiman and Madman Comics creator Mike Allred. Given a Christ-like sensibilty, Prez becomes not only the hippest president of all time, appearing on Saturday Night Live skits with John Belushi, but also the best. He disarms the country's nuclear and biological weapons, and puts education back as the #1 priority. And he does it on his own, despite the evil Boss Smiley's offers. Both Death and Dream put in welcome appearances here, after Prez's passing on. Mike Allred's work in always a welcome sight, and I doubt that his ironically animated style would have looked half as good on any other Sandman project.Cerements, a story of a young apprentice in the necropolis Litharge, a city whose chief industry is the \`funerary arts'. After performing a disposal of a corpse, young Petrefax and his disposal party share tales, one of which Destruction pops up in, to give a little history of the previous necropolis, and the death of his sister, the first Despair. Lots of threads of started here which re-appear when members of the Endless return to Litharge in The Wake. Despite the EC-Comics-like horror-style in which it's drawn, the story holds a lot of emotion and warmth.The final story is Charlene's. Maybe not a story, but as Stephen King puts it, in his introduction, \\"a scathing soliloquy.\\" Finally, a funeral in the sky is witnessed. No one in the tavern knows whose it is, but all are agreed, it is the cause of the reality storm. Afterwards, some leave, some stay.Don't be deceived. Ignore the title. Despite what your senses are telling you, this is NOT a Sandman book. Morpheus shows up on maybe a half-dozen pages. And that's what's so cool about it. There's very little of the grand, and at-times head-swelling epic of Morpheus stuff in here. This was my introduction into the world of Sandman, and a very gentle introduction it is. With some of the best stories in the series to boot."},{"Title":"The Sandman Library, Vol. 8: Worlds' End","review":"Travelers all converge at a Tavern at the end of the world to sit out a snowstorm. They pass the time by telling stories. The stories make up each issue and quite often the stories are inseparable from their narrators. Many familiar Sandman characters pop up such as Hob Gadlin and Cluaracan of faerie in the most entertaining of the stories. Even though the Sandman barely figures into the stories, his presence is felt; but what makes everything work is that different artists do the different stories in their own styles. In the case of Mike Allred (the creator of Madman one of the funnest super hero books in recent years) his style works perfectly with the tale of Prez. The last issue is a foreshadowing of things to come... Brace yourself for &quot;The Kindly Ones.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Sandman Library, Vol. 8: Worlds' End","review":"These are good stories. Properly speaking, they are barely 'Sandman' stories: I think the Sandman makes just one cameo appearance. They're still good stories.The format is familiar: strangers wait out a storm at an inn unfamiliar to all of them. They pass the time exchanging stories. OK, it's an old bottle, but Gaiman fills it with new wine. The stories range from the biographical to the fantastic and satiric.The most mythic story, I think, takes place in the politics of a world much like modern America, or maybe 70s America. Mythology isn't about distant times, it's about grand heroes and their quests - I like to be reminded of that occasionally.I usually read comics for the artwork first and writing second. The various artists in this book are all capable enough, but that's not what carries the book.

This is a book about dreams...the lives, in essence, that he touches. He pops up in various places along the way, but this is more a collection of short stories. Two travelers get lost in a snowstorm in June and find their way to an inn of all worlds. Creatures from various times and places, caught up in the &quot;reality storm&quot; have come to this place for food and drink and rest from the icy storm, including Clurachan (sp?), a favorite faerie hedonist from other installments in the Sandman series.My favorite story is inarguable &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; when a very average man with a very normal job and a great love of his city finds himself, after falling asleep in the subway (see if you can't connect to an interest in subways overall by Gaiman in his book &quot;Neverwhere&quot;), that he has fallen into a dream of the city. Cities dream as do people...anyone who has traveled extensively knows that cities do have their own personalities. New Orleans feels nothing like New York, etcetera. He searches for months trying to find an exit from the dream of the city, only to find temptation to stay.All of the stories are entertaining, but this one sticks out the most in my mind. I have a great love of cities, especially New York, and I can only imagine what she dreams.A dark shadow plagues the end of &quot;World's End&quot;...a funeral procession...who this funeral procession is for, well...call it foreshadowing."},{"Title":"The Sandman Library, Vol. 8: Worlds' End","review":"In this collection of the individual stories of some visitors at the Worlds' End Inn, we see the impact of the Sandman on the lives of those around him.

Interestingly enough, unlike the others, which I at times found quite offputting, this omnibus works perfectly.Indeed, I feel that The Sandman: World's End demonstrates just how far-reaching Neil Gaiman's gift for storytelling goes. Essentially, this omnibus is a story about stories, each one more interesting than the other.Here's the blurb:This collection of tales tells of travellers caught in the vortex of a \\"reality storm\\". These wayfarers come from throughout time, myth and dreams to converge upon a mysterious inn, there to share stories of the places they have been and things they have seen, beside a flickering fire.\\"A Tale of Two Cities\\" a man who believes he now finds himself in the dream of the city he lives in. Exploring that strange environment, he fears that one day the city would awaken. \\"Cluracan's Tale\\" is pure fantasy and recounts the story of a Faerie sent to the city of Aurelian to represent the interest of his people. When freed from imprisonment, he'll foment rebellion against the autocratic ruler. \\"Hob's Leviathan\\" is about a girl posing as a boy so she can go to sea. \\"The Golden Boy\\" follows the tribulation of a messiah figure representing the American Dream. \\"Cerements\\" is told by an apprentice from the necropolis Litharge, a city devoted solely to the Dead.While every story has merit and is entertaining, my favorites were \\"Cluracan's Tale,\\" \\"The Golden Boy,\\" and \\"Cerements.\\"This omnibus was illustrated by Michael Allred, Gary Amaro, Mark Buckingham, Dick Giordano, Tony Harris, Steve Leialoha, Vince Locke, Shea Anton Pensa, Alec Stevens, Bryan Talbot, John Watkiss, Michael Zulli. Considering the number of artists, it is no wonder that there is absolutely no visual continuity. And yet, each artist's style suits the story they are illustrating very nicely.Onward to the ninth omnibus!"},{"Title":"The Sandman Library, Vol. 8: Worlds' End","review":"In which Gaiman takes a breath before entering the inevitable final act of The Sandman. At first glance, World's End is another series of short stories, a laThe Sandman Vol. 3: Dream CountryandThe Sandman Vol. 6: Fables and Reflections, albeit one with a stronger framework to it that reminded this English major of Canterbury Tales. But there's more going on here than meets the eye, and the final chapter culminates in an astonishing visual image that clearly foreshadows what's to come. Still, the stories are the main attraction here, and this collection is every bit the equal of Dream Country, with a stronger focus this time on the way that our reality often hides something far stranger underneath. From the dreams of cities to an ocean encounter (depicted here in a two-page spread that literally made me gasp a little) to a journey through the Necropolis, Gaiman's wondrous imagination is as alive here as ever. If there's a downside to World's End, it's the realization that I'm almost finished with this incredible series."},{"Title":"The Sandman Library, Vol. 8: Worlds' End","review":"Rather than a continuous narrative, this volume is a collection of short pieces with distinctly different artistic treatments. The frame story is that there's an inn just outside space and time, where travelers just might find themselves marooned for awhile when a reality story hits. There not being much else to do, they take turns telling stories, Canterbury-style. Some, like \\"Cluracan's Tale\\" and \\"The Golden Boy,\\" are quite good. Others, like \\"Hob's Leviathan,\\" are just kind of pointless. For me, this is one of the less satisfying entries in an excellent series."},{"Title":"The Sandman Library, Vol. 8: Worlds' End","review":"_There is an inn at worlds' end. It is a place beyond space and time where all realms, all planes, intersect. Some travelers between the worlds come there willingly, but others find themselves driven there by reality storms- storms caused by events that disturb the very fabric of the cosmos itself. That is the case with the guests on this night. They find themselves trapped, and by immortal custom, obliged to pay for their keep with their best stories._The first of these stories is \\"A Tale of Two Cities.\\" It deals with a man trapped in a dream city- or is it the dream of a sleeping city?_The second story \\"Cluracan's Tale\\" tells of the mission of Cluracan, Ambassador of the Queen of Faery to the mortal world. It teaches why it is both unwise to attempt to combine temporal and spiritual power- and to offer disrespect to the Fair Folk._Tale three \\"Hob's Leviathan\\" is from the last days of working sail upon the high seas- and of those who walk among us who are not what they seem._The fourth \\"The Golden Boy\\" is the myth of Prez Rickard- born to be America's greatest president. His nemesis is \\"Boss Smiley\\" (interesting that this symbol of corruption and evil is based on the symbol of Wal-Mart....)_Finally, there is the story \\"Cerements\\", of the great necropolis Litharge. This is a city whose entire reason for existance is to render respectful last rites to the dead. Even the Endless trust their cerements to the inhabitants of this city._And after all the tales are told the guests at the inn are granted a vision of the event that is powerful enough to create a storm to shake all their worlds...."},{"Title":"The Sandman Library, Vol. 8: Worlds' End","review":"This is a book for those long winter nights, when you just need to curl up by the fire (or the lamp) and escape into the realm of stories. The collection is similar to the Arabian Nights in it's story within a story structure and it will not disappoint. Definitely a must have for all Sandman buffs as well as for lovers of good storytelling. This and the entire Sandman series is comic book literature at it's best."},{"Title":"The Sandman Library, Vol. 8: Worlds' End","review":"The Saga of Morpheus continues in this Graphic Novel. Gaiman is the best. A co-worker's 18 y.o. son is reading the series and he is blown away."},{"Title":"The Sandman Library, Vol. 8: Worlds' End","review":"Telling stories is a lost art. Few do it well anymore, (although Anna Devere Smith and Spalding Gray come to mind) and Gaiman uses A World's End to take a breath and tell some stories before the end of the Sandman series. A tavern in the middle of nowhere is the place to tell stories of Prez Rickard, the elf Cluracan, of a young \\"man\\" at sea and a world dedicated to the proper treatment of the departed. As with any collection of short stories, some stories are more successful than others and one character even complains that they are all \\"boy's own stories\\" simply variations on a theme. This is basically true and I admire Gaiman for having made this reference himself. They are stories to kill time before the next journey."},{"Title":"The Sandman Library, Vol. 8: Worlds' End","review":"It's the first Sandman story I ever read and that's why I feel a bit out of place judging it. I'm reading Brief Lives right now too, but it seems like Sandman is beyond anything else in the industry right now. The Invisibles, Preacher and Sandman all have been cancelled so we're stuck with reflecting on these."},{"Title":"The Sandman Library, Vol. 8: Worlds' End","review":"Interesting structure to a series of tales told by travelers stuck at an Inn during a storm. Cantebury Tales was the inspiration and Gaiman employs many levels of stories within stories and even eventually brings the story full circle, which is cheeky. However it seems that the stories were given little precedence and therefore come off very weak. Now part of this is expectation. Fables and Reflections blew me away and may be my fav of the series so I expected this as a series of individual stories to be just as good. So with it being just average I was overly disappointed. There are some good moments and the few appearances of Death and the Endless are captivating. However they are not enough.One note: the end of this book overtly hints at the plot of Kindly One's so if you want to be surprised, read this after that one. I wish Gaiman hadn't done that, myself."},{"Title":"Footsteps","review":"My mother gave me this as a Christmas present way back when I was early in my high school career. She obviously had not read this book. She knew that I liked sports--including football. That must be why she purchased this for me as a Christmas gift.Unhappily, this was a book about a broken down former football player (who had performance problems, hence the title \\"Footsteps\\"). The coach was a jerk. He used his football players as if they were there to fulfill his own aspirations. One key player had suffered injuries--but the coach tried to get him into a crucial game. A symptom of the \\"win at any cost\\" philosophy.In addition, the coach led a seemingly very nice young woman astray, conning her for his own pleasure.Altogether, a novel that distressed me many years ago-and distresses me still. . . ."},{"Title":"Spreading the Light: Meaningful Answers to Spiritual Questions","review":"A REVIEW OF \\"SPREADING THE LIGHT by Archie CrawfordTo attempt a critical review of Archie Crawford's, \\"Spreading the Light,\\" is going to be a strictly personal journey. I would first make the declaration that I have been interested in the subject matter for almost all of my adult life, and have read as many texts as I could manage to help me with that interest. This includes health information, mental health information, science in general, both eastern and western religion, and cosmology. I did this searching without specific training in any one of these fields, and without the benefit of being an organized scholar. I did it as an interested person searching for a better understanding of things I considered important. These understandings became dots for me, and to make use of a familiar phrase, this author connected those dots in a most remarkable way.With that preamble, I would state that Crawford's book has, for me, rearranged the knowledge I have gathered, sorted the relevant pieces of prior understanding, served to confirm gut feelings I have held, and produced a feeling of profound enlightenment more than I could have ever dreamed possible from reading a single book. In the light of that statement one can easily see why I prefaced it as \\"personal.\\"I will now proceed to try to give my objective review of Crawford's book. It is a book about the important questions of life, with answers provided based on a most impressive review of the wisdom of the ages. It is a book for the 21st century. It is detailed, far beyond that of the average researcher. A glance through his Bibliography at the end of the book is awesome. I had previously studied a portion of his references, gaining from them a fair amount of understanding. What Crawford's book does is \\"cast further light,\\" on that prior understanding. Crawford speaks forcefully, and with considerable authority, but always with respect both for the subject matter and for the reader's integrity.The scope of this book is great. While dealing with basic subjects such as the world's religions, and science, the material used in his arguments seems to embrace most of the history of mankind. His grasp of the material he tackles is reasoned and measured, except perhaps when he takes the church to task in his chapter on the dark side of religion, where he gets somewhat grim. On the whole, Crawford's basically optimistic philosophy comes through, not for the way things are, but for what they might become in a new paradigm.It was particularly interesting to this reader that the author summarized his view that organized religion has been a crucially positive factor in the history of mankind. He took all of two and a quarter pages to describe those influences. He then takes the church to task in thirty seven pages describing how its dark side has played havoc with human history. His summary on this part is nevertheless optimistic, with religion being a very necessary and firm part of any future he sees for humanity.I have read work by many of the leading particle physicists, and in my opinion, his coverage on the current state of that field is adequate for a basic layman's understanding. The historical background he presents for this work is clear and relevant. His summary statements at the end of the book present an impressive list of things to think about to stay informed in that field.He is not shy about tackling sensitive subjects. He credits psychology with being an important part of man's evolution, although he cites fundamental principals that were part of ancient eastern texts, long before western schools on the subject were formed. He offers hardheaded advice on many of life's social quandaries in a straight forward way. In fact, that is a description which I would apply to the overall tone of the book; straightforward and assured.In my mind this is an outstanding book for serious seekers in our time. For me, it is a text I am certain to re-visit often.Keith Van Vliet"},{"Title":"Mary Jane","review":"Dorothy Sterling brilliantly interweaves the shocking, painful truth about segregation's effects with everyday happenings (chats in a &quot;secret clubroom&quot;, purchasing grownup clothing, a beautiful new bedroom) with which any teen would identify. The pleasant and friendly aspects of the latter, combined with dialogue involving Mary Jane's lovely family, make the former message all the more powerful. As a white Northerner, I can say honestly that many of Dorothy Sterling's subtle points presented me with the full impact of segregation's effects (which I abhor.) There is no question that Mary Jane (child of a prosperous lawyer, granddaughter of a professor, and living five blocks from the school) is hated entirely because of her race - no elements of class distinction and the like. The violent protestors on the school's steps somehow shocked me less (since hate-mongers always have some reason to &quot;protest&quot;) than Sally's parents being special because they encouraged integration as obedience to the Supreme Court (rather than because segregation was an outrage), and actually were polite to Negroes (how expansive of them! even if their daughter cannot visit her closest friend's home.) The themes are easily accessible for the young reader because the book is not written with hatred or bitterness - merely a presentation of the facts that makes them especially vivid. Mrs Sterling wisely does not add other issues to the theme, which would only take away from the underlying truth that she manages to present in a vivid, entertaining, and engrossing style. Mary Jane has been a good friend of this reader's for over thirty years."},{"Title":"Mary Jane","review":"This book is a product of the time it was written, and when we judgeit, we need to remember that. But it was a ground breaking book:one of the first young adult fiction books to portray African American kids not as victims to be pitied, or on an inhuman perfect pedestal, but simply as: kids.I read it when I was in elementary school, when it first came out and it had a different kind of impact on me: I was a white child growing up in a suburb (Orange County, CA) and although I saw the news on TV it was my first exposure to the issues of African American kids: it made me think and to see them as - kids who should have the same rights I had.But it helped me too: I was the victim of teasing, not because of my background as happened to Mary Jane: but just because I was different.And especially in middle school, I experienced some of the same things that she did. The difference was: it was kids, not adults, when they did it, they broke the rules, the authorities were on my side, and there were no mobs who wanted to keep me out of MY school. But reading about Mary Jane's courage under infinitely worse conditions, helped me to \\"just ignore\\" the cruel comments, and sometimes physical attacks of the kids that I dealt with.I read that the author was born in 1913: so almost certainly has passed away: but I wish that I could thank her for both things I learned: an introduction to the fact that racism was happening, and a lesson in dealing with cruelty of any form."},{"Title":"Star Crossed (Arabesque)","review":"I have enjoyed all of Francine Craft's books because each one has its own unusual plot. If you like a book where you can unsolve a murder, then this is the one. Lance Carrington although acquitted of his wife's murder, still is very uncomfortable with this cloud of suspicion hanging over him. Fairen Wilder, faternal twin sister of Lance's wife accepts the challenge to assist Lance as he tries to clear his name. If you enjoy playing detective and putting all the clues together to come up with &quot;who-done-it&quot; then this is a book to read. The author has you putting clues together all the way to the end. This book may be comtemporary romance but it has the seasoning of murder, secrets, lies, cover-ups and lots of initimate romantic scenes. I truly can say I enjoyed this one and encourage others who may not have taken the leap of faith on Francine Craft's books and give this one a read, I don't feel you'll be disappointed. If you like the books that have murder type mysteries or solving kipnapping matters check out these other two published books by Francine Craft: Lyrics of Love (a slow read but its good) and Still In Love. Also, another one about long lost love relationships that takes place in Alaska..read Francine Craft's &quot;Devoted&quot;."},{"Title":"Star Crossed (Arabesque)","review":"I enjoyed this book!!

The story revolves around Heather LAngenkamp (The female Heroin of the first Nightmare Flick) who is making a fairly succesful career outside of horror. She does more Day time TV and so on. The book starts off like the films, in a nightmare. From there she wakes up in the middle of an earthquake with her husband Chase and little boy Dylan. After the quake she is on edge, not just because of the quake but because she has also recieved a stalker who calls her and impersonates Freddy. Shortly there after she does a spot on some Talk show and then heads down to New Line Cinema where she is asked to play Nancy one last time in the Newest Elm Street Film that Wes Craven is currently writing the screen play for. Soon after that her world goes to hell as the spirit of Freddy is after her and her son, while plauging the stars of the first film (John Saxon, Robert Englund, Wes Craven, and probably others their just not mentioned). So she must fight Freddy one last time.Now what makes the book unique and a definite must read for the Elm street fans is that the author every now and then puts in this mini journal bit and sometimes a newspaper article as he is writing this book. THe way these little scenes play out it's like Freddy is after him as well, thus making reading a little more intersting.OVerall this is an OK book that probably won't win any one over, but is an entertaining read for Elm Street Fans."},{"Title":"Modern Viola Technique, 1st Edition","review":"This is an exception pedagogical work for advanced players.

It shows that wherever women and men are thrown together, love will thrive even under corrosive conditions. The author says his story was carefully researched, and this is very obviously true. I highly recommend this compelling and wonderful book."},{"Title":"Wicca: Satan's Little White Lie","review":"Im talking about some of the wiccans leaveing reviews here. Your supposed to actually read a book before reveiwing it...yet I have seen comments in which people admitted they didn't read the book and then go on to prove it with arguments which where if fact adressed, delt with, and answered quite in depth in the book....which they didn't read. that's to bad because I think this book would have helped them. Leaving comments on a book you didnt read is deceptive. Very deceptive. My sister is a wiccan though so this kind of behaviour dosn't supprise me. Anyways I'm going to prey for all you wiccans in the name and blood of Yahshua. May the evil spirits who have ahold over you be bound and their power over you stripped away. May Yahweh cast those demons out and may you be saved by the blood of The Lamb and may He bless you and keep you....and cast those demons out.

But like it or believe it not that is where your power comes from. (The demonic relm) I suggest you actually read the book. Seriously I don't go around giveing pro-wiccan books 1 star. (Well I'm a servent of The Most High and that would be lieing which would not give a good testamony) You know the funny thing is Brother Schnoebelen back when he was a wiccan used to go around and defend wicca just like all you are doing. Even when he actually was worshiping satan and into all kinds of bad stuff he denied it and scoffed at/mocked Christians for saying wicca was satanic and slandered them by falsely accusing them as liars...which you would know if you had read the book. I'm sure there are wiccans here who don't believe in satan, I'm also sure there are those who do knowingly worship him and who deny it.

Wicca is based on the Ancient Worship of Lucifer also known as The Morning Star. Why else do these various religions share all the same symbolism.

I wonder if people honestly don't realize that their religion is rooted in The Mysteries. I'm thinking they must be aware of this. Hey if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, yeah, I'd say it's a duck. All of these Pagan Religions are based on The Ancient Mysteries which were forbidden as a form of witchcraft by Yahweh, it was an abomination any way you slice it. Babylon is the birthplace of all Paganism. Christians today were more or less forced by the first Pope Constantine (Pagan until his death bed) to honor all Pagan Traditions or be put to death. This is a historical fact. That is why Christians today worship on a Pagan Sabbath (Sunday) it has little to do with Paul, celebrate Ishtar (better known as Easter) Look up the rituals of this celebration, absolutely horrific (you'll never dye another egg again for the rest of your life), celebrate Saturnalia Dec 25th (not the Birth Date of Yeshua at all) and Lent (The mourning of Tammuz)."},{"Title":"Wicca: Satan's Little White Lie","review":"This book is a big eye-opener on the truth behing Wicca.

He uses general points and embellishes them with a convoluted twist to give the fundamentalist Christian book market what it has wanted since the author of \\"The Satan Seller\\" was proven a fraud..... something to use against those who find their truth in pre-Christian spirituality.I was raised in a fundamentalist church, went through the \\"saved\\" phenomenon, and studied theology. The only problem was that my deeply analytical, rationalist mindset drove me to find the genuine truth, at least as much as one can, behind Biblical scripture and it's modern interpretation. The undeniable fact is that Christian mythology was merely a borrowed, rehashed version of older Hebrew and Pagan mythologies.This discovery led me into studying and eventually becoming a Priest of the Craft, a position I have held for over thirty years. I have worked with many Wiccan/Pagan groups and individuals in the Midwest, and have never known anyone who has heard of Mr. Schnoebelen. If his claims of having been a Wiccan Priest are true, I find that a bit odd. Furthermore, as one who has been privy to the \\"inner teachings\\" of this path, I can attest that I have never found a Satanic connection in any way, shape nor form in Wicca or any other true Pagan path.As for Mr. Schnoebelen's claims that Wicca and Paganism are virtually modern practises, with no true roots in ancient history, I would ask him whether he's ever heard of the Druids, the Strega or the Vikings? (Not to mention the many indigenous tribal paths that are enjoying a resurgence, such as American Indian, African, etc.)My impression is that Mr. Schnoebelen has made a handy profit on the fundamentalist Christian book market by embracing the very \\"white lies\\" he professes to expose. No religious path is perfect or without it's flaws, including Christianity. As a Pagan who has never lost respect for the ideals and examples of tolerance and love the Christ represented, I must say that I find today's Pagans far more akin to genuine followers of Christ than most contemporary Christians, who are actually following the teachings of Paul in their dogmas.I only hope those who don't know all the facts are not easily taken in by this deliberately misleading bit of propoganda, as so many were in the early seventies by Mike Warnke's \\"Satan Seller\\"."},{"Title":"Wicca: Satan's Little White Lie","review":"Man, this book is awful.

We bought 5 bikes for kids who would not have had any gifts for Yule. We will try to do it again this year.We celebrate holiday differently from most but we hurt no one. Do I care what is going on in your home on Christmas day? No. Should you care what goes on in my home on Yule? I wouldn't think so. But so many people are frightened of Wicca. We celebrate Yule (Winter Solstice) instead of Christmas.We put up Yule trees. The decorated Christmas tree only caught on in the mid-19th century. We exchange gifts, but they are usually handmade or meant to be of a special request or desire of the person receiving it. Yule isn't about exchanging thousands of dollars worth of useless presents, it is about honoring the Goddess during her time of bringing forth the new year's sun.The author confuses modern-day Wiccan (a.k.a. Paganism) with the Paganism mentioned in the Bible. The latter worshiped what the Jews considered to be idols, and allegedly engaged in child sacrifice. These practices are totally unrelated to modern-day Neopaganism.The author confuses Wicca with the imaginary Satan-worshiping religion which was created by the Christian church in the late Middle Ages in order to justify the burning times -- the era from about 1450 CE to 1792 CE when secular courts and the church condemned witches, other heretics, midwives, etc. to be burned at the stake. The people burned at the stake were innocents, the church was showing how fear can keep the masses in line. It can also make the church very rich due to the fact many family members of thsoe accused would give over their estates if the family member was set free.The author has a fear of retribution from God. He appears to believe that if he demonstrated religious tolerance by recognizing Neopagan traditions as actual religions, that he would somehow become a Neopagan and would be attacked by God.This book is full of propaganda against a group of people who are gentle and loving, selfless and strong enough to stand against the closed minds of those who dislike us."},{"Title":"Wicca: Satan's Little White Lie","review":"This book is horrible and filled with half-truths & blatant lies.Mr. Schnoebelen claims that he was \\"initiated into the Alexandrian Wicca on Imbolc, February 2, 1973 and made a High Priest and Magus in September of the same year.Alexandrian Wicca is very traditional and it takes a few years minimum to make it to the rank of High Priest.But hey, don't just take my word for it. Kerr Cuhulain, author of Witch Hunts: Out of the Broomcloset, wrote a rather long article on this book exposing the falsified information contained within."},{"Title":"Wicca: Satan's Little White Lie","review":"A very horrible book, whose sources can be linked to such shoddy scholars as Higgins and Vallency who calimed that the Druids had directly emmigrated from India and Armenia respectively. Upon further research, I also discovered that the &quot;Wiccan&quot; organisation which this man claimed to be a member of, was not specifically a Wiccan group to begin with, and also kicked him out for physical and psychological abuse of other students. I do not suggest this book to anyone, it is just dreadful."},{"Title":"Wicca: Satan's Little White Lie","review":"This book, I thought, was excellent for a good laugh. I have been a practicing Wiccan Witch (Eclectic) for over 6 years now. A friend loaned me this book to read, and in the first thirty pages, I was able to write 2 pages worth of mistakes. He mixes up a lot of terms, only tells the reader portions of certain rituals, etc etc. He also claims to have been so many things . . . Alexandrian High Priest, Craft of the Wise high priest, Druidic High Priest, Minister, Satan worshipper . . . and all in only 50 years? Doubtful. Also, from reading his other books, it is apparent the man is a psycho. Can you really trust a man that believes aleins to be part of Satan's mastermind in creating babies with his &quot;fallen angels&quot;? I don't think so. Not to mention the book is from Chick publishing . . .~Path"},{"Title":"Wicca: Satan's Little White Lie","review":"Well, I've read a couple of this guy's books now, and he certainly has been a busy little beaver in his short span on this earth, hasn't he? If I cared enough to give this gentleman the ripping refutation he deserves, I'd construct a time line and try to pinpoint exactly when/where he was doing all his wicca/satanist/masonic/catholic/UFO abduction activities, just to see if it is at all plausible. But, I'm bored enough after reading this one and skimming another, and I won't be subjecting my poor brain to any more of this silly mess."},{"Title":"Wicca: Satan's Little White Lie","review":"I did not want to give this book 1 star, but well we have to give it at least one. Wicca aside this book should never have made it to print. His theories are so outlandish. He claims that Satan is using ufos to cross-breed with humans to create a new breed of demons. According to this author even Catholics are satanists, which I find very offensive as I come from a catholic family. It appears to me as just another book that will appeal to those who are looking for satan everywhere. It is just a book of hate and slandering and offers no real academic value."},{"Title":"Wicca: Satan's Little White Lie","review":"This book and the author are perfect examples of Christian Extremism. Garbage, and it was terribly researched."},{"Title":"Wicca: Satan's Little White Lie","review":"Epic FAIL!! Total crap. Each page filled with complete rubbish. Don't waste good money on such garbage!"},{"Title":"Wicca: Satan's Little White Lie","review":"I found the book overall helpful. True, some of the stuff he says seems absolutely hard to believe, but it was a good read none the less. It must be left up to the individual reader to make up their own mind regarding it, since it is impossible to verify the author's personal experience. He claims to have a been in the highest circles of Satanism and Wiccanism, and tells of sorts of fantastical stories"},{"Title":"Wicca: Satan's Little White Lie","review":"Here is yet another idiot bashing something he is totally clueless about.. As Wiccan Clergy, I want to say that We don't believe in the devil nor will we ever.. I have devoted My life to helping others. I don't judge nor slam others beliefs. Its his hell let him burn in it.."},{"Title":"Wicca: Satan's Little White Lie","review":"I have read this book a few years ago and have been a Wiccan for about 20 years now. One of my studies was to find out if what the Fundie Christians have said about Wicca is true. I have contacted some former Wiccans who have become Christians, Buddhists and so forth, so I know that people voluntarily come in and out of Wicca. Part of my investigation was ( and is) the Fundie Christian references to Wicca and Paganism. I have also read the comments here by supposed former Wiccans ( now conviently born again Christian). My conclusion so far is that Wicca is in NO WAY satanic and that books like this are deliberate lies to uphold a specific view of a Christain cult mentality. If I had found ANYthing like this guy claimed, I would have left Wicca and vehemently spoke out against it. Fortunately books like this are not in the mainstrean of Christianity. Reminds me of teh Jack Chick books that are so hateful of Catholicism. If a born again Christian wants us to convert, at least they should not try to lie so badly about what we do and do not believe. He's almost embarrasing in his absurd claims and his ignorance. No he never was a Wiccan, much less a High Priest. Poser, yes, fabricator no doubt, add sexually obsessed to boot."},{"Title":"Wicca: Satan's Little White Lie","review":"True to form, Schnoebelen is just one more Illuminati Satanist who \\"Found Jesus\\". The story is always the same, from Mike Warnke and John Todd Collin to Lyndon LaRouche. An Illuminati Satanic priest with insider information about the plot of the Luciferian global elite to take over the world finds Jesus. It's equally consistent that the agenda becomes to discredit everything good about every religious tradition including Christianity, that isn't their Jesus as scape-goat who excuses all evil variety. The secret to truly understanding the agenda of these dangerous recruiters into a cult nightmare is their perversion of everything good. Schnoebelen is pleased to note that Wiccans are trapped in the dark world created by Gerald Gardner and Aleister Crowley. His claim that Gardner and Crowley created the Wiccan tradition is ludicrous. Paganism is older than Christianity. Crowley was notorious for perverting every spiritual tradition that has ever existed. Schnoebelen mentions the Pagan goddesses that represented the darker sides of human nature and insists they are representatives of the Wiccan tradition. It's like pointing out that Satan is a character in the Christian Bible and therefore Christians are all Satanists. Schnoebelen is dangerous, and \\"Wicca: Satan's Little White Lie\\" is the evidence. Schnoebelen's lie is not so little and not so harmless."},{"Title":"Wicca: Satan's Little White Lie","review":"There are many fantasy books written about witches and this is one. If you read ths do so w6ith that in mind.As just one tiny little example that highlights the book's inaccuracies: he states that the law of return says that whatever you receive you are entitled to give back three times.in reality it is the exact opposite: it states that whatever you give comes back to you three times and therefore you should harm none.but of course I am not a high priest of many different traditions as he states he was - and how did he have time to complete al0l of these different programs of study as each level would traditionally take at least a year if not much longer??shadow work has nothing to do with the Devil and the descent of Inanna is not about Hell.i will say the book is interesting and well written, but the product of a parricular agenda.what is scary is the thought someone knowing nothing of Wicca might believe thisif you are one not following a Pagan path but want to learn about it a better book is When Someone You Love is Wiccan."},{"Title":"Wicca: Satan's Little White Lie","review":"I'm sorry, but I must say this. Don't buy this book Those who bought this book and believe it, have your heads up your rumps. People who claim to be former Wiccans, may have been caught up in a cult they thought was Wicca. Or they were never involved in Wicca at all and just want to write a book to show the public how crazy they are. I'm a practicing Wiccan who happens to believe in Jesus and I've never been happier. I've niether bought nor read this book. I don't even plan to. Wicca is a good and practical way of life where respect for all living things including followers of other religions is key and formost. We don't try to recruit anybody. Spiritual seekers look into us and at what we do. We don't down other religions and say they are wrong. We don't even say we are the right one for everybody. We even encourage to deeply study other faiths and give the choice to stick with Wicca or try something else. All paths to God are good. Jesus preached respect and good will, not a religion, and never tried to convert anybody. I'm tired of seeing these books showing up on Amazon.com. Please take this book out of stock."},{"Title":"Wicca: Satan's Little White Lie","review":"I haven't read this book but I'm not going to waste my money on some ignorant literary work. I am a practicing Wiccan and have been for ten years. I fail to see how we, Wiccans/Pagans, could worship a being that is not of our beliefs. We do NOT believe in a being even like Satan really. Satan is creation of Christianity. Now, mind you, Paganism has been around MUCH longer than Christianity! Wicca is just a branch of Paganism just like Catholicism is a branch of Christianity. It's amazing how some people will be so quick to judge and make that judgment based off of ignorance. I have read the bible and I have also noticed that that's more than most Christians do. Instead blind faith is much easier to manage therefore; this doesn't surprise me in the least. Although, I could have sworn that people may be judged upon 'God' and no other in Christianity. But then again, what would a Wiccan know..."},{"Title":"Wicca: Satan's Little White Lie","review":"ZERO STARS!!!

He is full of lies and Total Mis-Truths!!!"},{"Title":"Wicca: Satan's Little White Lie","review":"I found &quot;Wicca:Satan's Little White Lie&quot; to be a brief, very easy to read, yet extremely informative book. Schnoebeln speaks in an honest, straight-to-the-point manner from his sixteen years of experience in the organization. He adds bits of subtle wit and humor to help the reader wade through the darkness of what he encountered. His personal Christian testimony is also straight-to-the-point and not over-done. I would recommend this book highly to anyone who wants to become truly informed about Wicca."},{"Title":"Wicca: Satan's Little White Lie","review":"The book is excellent and shows what goes on behind the PR of witchcraft."},{"Title":"Wicca: Satan's Little White Lie","review":"I read this book from cover to cover on a 6 hour road trip to see my brother, who at the time was dating a woman involved in Wicca. It was impossible to put down! Bill Schnoebelen is an incredible author that has first hand experience with Wicca as well as many other cults. He is clear in his explanation of Wicca,its dangers and snares as well as some shocking details that most Wiccans are not aware of. Schnoebelen also brings some humor through his writing,(which helps you keep your jaw from dropping from being in shock as you learn about the practices of this deceitful cult). This book is well written and easy to read. Anyone who is involved with Wicca or knows someone who is NEEDS to read this book!!!"},{"Title":"Wicca: Satan's Little White Lie","review":"Having many Wiccan friends i can see that this Book was truly written by an ex-wiccan. This book is wonderful for people who want to really know about the occult and what goes on in that relm of thinking. If you are the kind of person who wants to think that everything is fine and dandy in the world, i suggest that you either grown up and notice that the world isnt all flowers and candy, or keep your misconseption and not read the book. If you are A Christian with wiccan friends you will find this book very helpful as it goes deep into Wicca to find that the &quot;old religion&quot; isnt so old and that indeed Wicca is Satans Little White Lie!"},{"Title":"Wicca: Satan's Little White Lie","review":"Great support for the thesis of this book exists in M. Scott Peck's wonderful book, \\"People of the Lie\\". Herein, the great psychotherapist and best selling author deals with the concept of evil in psychotherapy. He actually observes two cases of possession and subsequent exorcism. In each case, the patient was possessed by a supernatural entity called Satan. Also in each case, the patient had been exposed to Wicca at an early age. This information is provided to support Mr. Schnoebelen's important work and in the loving hope that practicing Wiccans will cast off the bondage of this sinfulness and accept the wondrous blessings of a Christ directed life. God bless!"},{"Title":"Wicca: Satan's Little White Lie","review":"This book was very informative and had a great perspective from someone who's been there & deeper still. It showed the tendency of the occult to slowly pull a person deeper & deeper into the forbidden - while blinding their eyes to The Truth. No one could honestly deny that the author lacked factual Wiccan knowledge & history of same - which led to the great insight of the story.

I nearly vomited after reading the first pages of this book. Not because what was in it was true, but because the author CLEARLY has a vendetta against anyone/anything that isn't Christian. The &quot;Prime Directive&quot; of the Wiccan religion (the Wiccan Rede) states, &quot;And it harm none, do what you will.&quot; This means, &quot;do no harm.&quot; DO NO HARM (I THINK that's the first line of the Hippocratic Oath, too). This book is just so full of lies that under different circumstances, it'd be funny."},{"Title":"Wicca: Satan's Little White Lie","review":"I love how other faiths seem to like to throw stones at poor little witch craft. It's quite a shame and feel sorry for any one that is so narrow minded that they can not be accepting of the lives of others. Here's a hint. Live your life but open up your mind to the fact that maybe your beliefs aren't right. If your faith can't stand scrutinization than perhaps you should be asking questions to build your faith don't just insult and label others for their ideals, or basically you're just another hater with out anything better to do."},{"Title":"Wicca: Satan's Little White Lie","review":"Wow! This guy has an impressive religious resume doesn't he? An Alexandrian Wiccan, a Druid, a member of the Church of All Worlds, a member of the Church of Satan, a Mormon, a Catholic Priest, a Christian Fundamentalist. I don't believe any of his credentials. It's apparent that he thinks pretty much everyone is a Satanist. I'm still a little confused on who exactly he thinks is a true Christian though. If a Catholic is actually a Pagan (and therefore a Satanist), and a Mormon is a cult member, someone please tell me who the real Christians are. I will say that this book was an interesting read, in the sense that I now know how extreme some people can be in the belief that their way is the only way."},{"Title":"Wicca: Satan's Little White Lie","review":"The story of Wicca: Satan's Little White Lie is just that--a story. A wild make believe story catering to a group of people that feeds off of their own fears and paranoia.

Here is a direct quote: &quot;Put simply, if you aren't a believer in Jesus Christ as Almighty God come in the flesh to save you from your sins, you ARE a satanist!&quot; So the author is saying that this applies to Catholics, Jews, Buddhists, Hindus, and Mulims among others (he even explicitly mentions names like &quot;Krishna&quot;). But the quote that takes the cake is probably: &quot;Even if you are a purported atheist, you are still worshipping Satan&quot;. I think the ignorance of this analysis speaks for itself.I guess the only people who would like this book are paranoid Bible-thumpers who already agree with the above, and want to read more books to reinforce this bigotted idea.
