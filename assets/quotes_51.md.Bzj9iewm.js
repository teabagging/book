Kate's voice comes across as written by an author obviously making up for his lack of solid personal experience in the business world with an abundance of mundane cliches, boring personal involvements and buzzwords to be found in any business magazine. Any wit in the Business inevitably also takes on a contrived feeling. My suggestion to anyone looking for a book grounded in personal experience, sharp satire, wit and humor revealing the realities of life in high-tech corporations, is to turn to the skillfully written episodes in &quot;MANAGEMENT BY VICE&quot; instead....And you'll get a candid, worthwhile eye-opener that won't disappoint!"},{"Title":"The Business: A Novel","review":"This is an excellent read that kept me rivetted to it and desperate to get an opportunity to carry on reading when I had to stop (I was reading it on the train, the bus, and even at my desk in my lunchbreak).The business is an ancient shadowy organisation that has strange things going on inside it that go all the way to the top. The hero(ine) is an unwitting pawn in some of this and you move through a twisty maze of cluse to the denouement."},{"Title":"The Business: A Novel","review":"Iain Banks has proven himself a master of various genres including science fiction, fantasy and plain old fiction. The Business is his latest contribution to the \\"regular\\" fiction genre. And Banks does not disappoint.The Business follows the life of a woman who works for \\"the business,\\" an age-old company shrouded in mystery. Without revealing plot or storylines, let me just assure that Banks continues to do all the things he does so well - excellent character development, mystery and intrigue, excellent storytelling and settings and an overriding sense of morality that seems to guide most of the characters in his novels. Again Banks proves why he deserves such respect as an insightful and innovative author.Frankly the only reason why I can't give The Business five stars is that, compared to some of his other works such as The Bridge and The Player of Games, The Business, while excellent, does not quite measure up to his potential.

I loved and I know you will too!!!"},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"Personally, I enjoy this book less than The Time Machine because there is less of a journey. The story basically consists of the citizens of Earth pitting their wits agains an invasion army from Mars and getting their collective butts kicked. Yet it an important novel - being the first to capture the terror of conflict with alien life - and it is a cornerstone of science fiction."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"I was somewhat let down when completing The War of the Worlds by H.G. Wells. The way Wells wrote in Old English, required me to often reread the text to fully understand the concept. Secondly, I was surprised how limited the number of fighting situations there were compared to action films that I've previously seen. Instead, there was a lot of hiding and survival situations. I think Well's writing style showed that he was very specific during the first few chapters as he described the setting and characters. However, Wells did not necessarily allow more of the characters to develop, thus decresing the interest of Wells's writing. In conclusion, I would only recommend this novel to a reader who enjoys Old English writing and has fun with Wells's style."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"Gee, I know its a \\"classic\\" but I could't wait to be done with this book.

The Martians, with their heat rays and giant robotic machines, are attempting to conquer Earth and use it as their new home because Mars has become uninhabitable. This story is told from an English man's point-of-view, with vivid descriptions telling what it was like when the Martians came down and waged their war on Earth. The story takes the reader through a chaotic and suspenseful journey seen through the eyes of one man trying to survive.In my opinion the story was well written, overall. It was just a bit too retro science-fiction for me. The plot mainly revolves around a man's travels while he is trying to escape the onslaught of the Martians. I lost interest about mid-way through the book, because the plot became redundant. The character descriptions in the book were good, as well as the descriptions of the Martians. There was good visual depiction of the destruction that took place as the Martians conquered more territory. I think the conclusion could have been a little more climactic. Although it was clever, it just wasn't as exciting as I thought it would be. Although the concept of this story is interesting, I would not recommend this book to teens that enjoy futuristic adventure."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"A Review by TrevorThis is a story of a reporter named Ogilvey.

The characters were real sounding, but they didn't do anything exciting. I usually like science fiction books; I guess it was just to old for me. H.G. Wells used words you usually don't hear in our society anymore. You can see what is to come so easily in this book. It was hard to tell when the climax was because there weren't any real exciting parts. This book seems to drag on because you know what is coming. I would not suggest buying this book.

The book starts out slow, and the characters take a very long time to endear themselves to the reader, but each section of the book warms over time and climaxes appropriately. The setting is a bit foreign, and the author assumes a lot with regard to the readers familiarity with places and names, but soon the story becomes immersive and the reader can look past the colloquialisness.The free version of the book in Kindle is very well put together, no oddities at all in the translation to the electronic version (which i have seen in some of the other freebies).I believe that all sci fi fans should take the time to revisit this classic."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"This book is over 115 years old and yet the technology and the invasion by an alien race is almost prophetic in its very nature. It is a wonderfully written story told by one of the masters of Sci-Fi whose visions of the future were amazing.The story of the invasion is eerily realistic and describes how an invading race of aliens who cannot tolerate our atmosphere and gravity use advanced technology to crawl out of there craters they have created and take on the military might of England.I don't want to spoil this very good story but I recommend to you that you read it for yourself and enjoy it. The book is worth reading and it is entertaining. One of the messages I got was that mankind, who thought themselves to be superior to all of the earth's creatures were at the total mercy of the alien invading force. The aliens were indeed brought down to defeat by the lowliest life forms on earth.A great story, even 115 years later."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"I was very pleased to find this book listed among the freebies on your websites.

I read the book through in one or two sittings. HG created a sense of menace and despair through the book, which I loved. His descriptions were evocative of the times, and I could almost visualize the destruction taking place, as the book weaved along.The writing is, for our times, old fashioned, yet timeless. The almost forgotten craft of writing is something that was displayed through the book. I lost the part where the Martians were 'destroyed'. It would have been really nice to have had a nice description of this, but you can't have everything in life!If you want a good book to read by the fireside, then this is one I can recommend."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"I first read this when I was 8 years old. Since that time I had seen the movie made in the 50's, listened to the Orson Wells radio broadcast, and saw Tom Cruise destroy the story in the moive remake. It was great to read the original again. I had forgotten it totally. Its a slow start.. but once it gets going, its a classic"},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"As with most other HG Wells novels, THE WAR OF THE WORLDS contains poignant social commentary veiled behind a simple adventure/sci-fi story. Wells' critical views of British imperialism and industrialisation come through here clearly. The treatment of indigenous peoples and ecosystems by real-world conquering powers directly reflects the ruthless treatment the aliens from Mars show the people of London. His always sharp and cynical views of the masses' attitudes and behaviour is again reflected in the many panicky and ridiculous-acting background characters here, while the unnamed protagonist/narrator lives up to the heroic image of what a Real Man should be. Keeping a cool head, acting kindly towards others, and fighting to stay alive, this book's narrator seems remarkably similar to many of the leading roles in other Wells novels.This is also a very descriptive novel, unlike some of Wells' other works. From the Martians themselves to the various scenes of total destruction, and from the ravenous dogs searching for food to the panicking crowds fleeing the Black Smoke, Wells brings this story to life with detailed and dramatic descriptions. While the technology and nitty details of the Martians' assault on Earth seem dated and far-fetched today, this novel actually reflected current thinking of the time (1898). And while there have arguably been better alien-invasion novels written since, THE WAR OF THE WORLDS founded the genre, and has had a huge influence on popular culture since its publication. Also, while its not saying much, this book is much better than either of the movie adaptations. Appropriate for all reading levels and should be enjoyed by almost anyone. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"This is a great book . It used to be my favorite book. But now my favorite book is twenty thousand leagues under the sea."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"It is interesting coming into this one having only watched the movie. Wasn't impressed with the movie, so would this reflect poorly on the book? Not at all. The book is so much more that it feels almost like a completely different story line.For starters the feel of the book is different because it was set around the turn of the century when cars were a newfound technology and war materials were vastly inferior than today's, let alone WWIIs war material. This of course lends a completely different feel to how the alien invasion should be viewed. This does, at times, make the story feel dated, but then you start to see that Wells wasn't trying to write a book just about an invasion, but in the consequences of an alien life form landing and unable to adapt to the organisms that live and thrive on Earth.This is what makes this short book stand out. You progress from utter destruction to hopelessness, to humans living like animals in order to not be eaten, to the ultimate consequence of consuming alien food. The progression is so natural that you barely notice the transitions until they've passed, or in the conclusion after you think about what you have just read. The fact that humans as food ultimately killed the alien was just amazing. Watching the protagonist live through the worst of it and relating his experiences and thoughts also add a flavor to the story that lifts it past its dated feel and ultimately makes a book that should be a must read. A definite recommend.5 stars."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"I have been a Science Fiction fan since childhood. The War of the Worlds by H. G. Wells is one of my favorite stories.

This book from Amazon is a top quality hardcover book with excellent paper and text.The War of the Worlds"},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"\\"The War of the Worlds\\" must have seriously freaked people out in 1898. Imagine squeamish readers buckling at any unusual celestial event; the skies seemed impenetrable then. A falling star? No! It must be Martians! Augh! Run! The story retains a certain spine-tingling creepiness even today via historical imagination or present day extrapolation. It will evoke, for some, the I'd-better-look-over-my-shoulder-every-few-minutes syndrome. And though its quaint science may inspire derisive snorts today, then little was known about \\"the Red Planet,\\" especially whether it supported life. Add to that, the scientific theories of the day posited a Mars that, much like Earth, would cycle through geological and biological phases that culminated in life. So, to the general reader of the time, the notion of \\"life on Mars\\" remained not only a distinct possibility, but an almost certain inevitability. Plus, the people of late 19th century England had no early warning system for astronomical events. So when, early in the book, the first Martian \\"cylinder\\" plunges into the earth outside of London, only those nearby really know it happened. To top it off, news then traveled at the speed of print and human speech, the equivalent of frustratingly viscous molasses today. So, strange as it seems to our instantaneously informed modern world, news of the Martian invasion doesn't reach into London for some time. And when it does, many don't take it seriously as they see no direct threat. That changes fast as Martian death machines and black smoke smother everything in their path. Appreciating the book's true horror today involves conceiving our immediate solar system as an utter mystery. A sort of historical empathy. Sure, observations were made and scientists had rudimentary knowledge in the late 19th century, but no one really knew anything substantial about our neighboring planets. As such, \\"The War of The Worlds,\\" though obviously fiction, and serialized as such, probably didn't ring hollow for many readers of its time. With this perspective H.G. Wells' incredible storytelling powers begin to appear. They remain on full display throughout this page turner (or, for those using e-readers, this \\"button pusher\\"). The story's implications and subtexts also seem to provide a model for science fiction up to our strange present where science, morality and self-referential anthropology mingle.The story may or may not seem familiar to today's readers, depending upon which versions of the story one has come across. Orson Wells' famous, or infamous, 1938 radio adaptation, set in America, still resonates the power of mass media through rebroadcasts. And various film versions have appeared in the interim (some more memorable than others). But Wells' original story takes place in England through the perspective and words of a man of letters, or a \\"philosophical writer.\\" The Martian invasion begins near his town of Woking. He subsequently witnesses the instant death of the \\"heat-ray\\" and the Martian tripod war machines. The indistinctness of his descriptions make these invaders and their weapons radiate with the horror of the unknown. Many passages genuinely read in the manner of a man delineating technology 100 years ahead of his own time. This heightens the helplessness of humanity, who flee all human-like in abject terror and chaos from the ensuing carnage, ignorant of the very nature of the powers they face (told mostly through the narrator's brother). The Martians proceed with brutality. Their \\"rays\\" and poison gas \\"tubes\\" reduce entire cities to piles of burnt corpses and edifices. If Wells' intentions involved reducing humanity to a helpless blabbering mass, he succeeded. Once the Martians have dominated, regardless of a few small human victories, humanity faces the prospect of living in a \\"lowly animal state.\\" The character of the artilleryman manifests this idea, though he eventually shows his true colors. The character of the curate, who the narrator finds himself holed up with for days, paints a less than charitable picture of the religious response to the invasion. The man basically goes crazy after witnessing what the Martian's do with human prisoners. Whether God fails him, or whether he merely perceives that God has failed him, or that humans have ultimately failed God, remains a subject for speculation and discussion. In any case, things seem absolutely hopeless for humanity until the end. And, to keep from giving anything away, the ending implies something about humanity's relationship with the planet it inhabits. As the invasive, and very destructive, Martian \\"red weed\\" smothers the countryside, humans themselves don't ultimately prevail. But certain \\"partners,\\" both friend and enemy, come to the inadvertent rescue. In a sense, nature saves the day. No human weaponry of the time musters the firepower to bring down the invading army. \\"War of the Worlds\\" thus paints a picture not of human power, but of human impotency in the face of superior technology. In the end, humans don't play the role of triumphant heroes.So what does this imply? That technology gets us only so far? That our sometimes arrogant perceptions of our power and might simply dissolve in the face of even more superior might? Maybe. At the very least it gives readers an idea of the potential limits of human power. Maybe horrors we could never prepare for, despite our advances, exist \\"out there?\\" Essentially, \\"War of the Worlds\\" presents a very humbling view of humanity, not a glorified one. It also presents a great fictional example of Nassim Taleb's \\"Black Swan.\\" A Martian invasion, or any extraterrestrial invasion of superior power, would carry extreme consequences for humanity, but we may never see it coming. In modern terms, what if an alien force infiltrated us underneath our radars despite our perceived technological level? What we don't know might hurt us. Uncertainty usually wins the day. We may not know the extent of our own vulnerabilities.\\"War of the Worlds\\" stands as a justifiably hailed classic of literature and science fiction. Though in the end, despite the supermarket label, it's simply a great story. Potential interpretations at philosophical, social and technological levels provide enough mind food for weeks of munching. Plus, it provides a stunning read filled with horror, suspense and human drama. And though it's definitely not 1898 anymore, \\"War of the Worlds\\" may still hold enough power to freak people out."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"You have to suffer thru some archaic language, but this book invented the alien invasion genre and is worth reading. When I was a kid in High School I read it for the first time, and loved it from the start. Get in the right mood and enjoy. I particularly liked learning the way people thought back then, such as judging everyone you meet by their clothing, etc."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"I was in the library one day when I saw this book and decided to give it a try. I am so happy that I did! This book was my first real Science Fiction book, so I was a little scared. This book completely turned me around.

I would recommend it to anyone and everyone."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"The bottom line of the positive attributes of HG Wells novel is simple: this is where it all began. Every science-fiction book and movie ever written stems from the crative ideas od HG Wells. All the little green men, all the spaceships, all the invaders were born out of this book. The othe fascinating thing about the story is that it contains themes and allusions of litterary value, something that todays dime a dozen action scifi books and films geneally do not. Overall HG Wells ha created an important and entertaining work who's words still echo through todays culture."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"I downloaded this for free for my Kindle. I have never read this before (I have seen a couple bad movies about it) but was eager to read the original story. Overall I liked the story. I thought parts of it were a bit drawn out and boring; but overall it was definitely worth reading...and much better than any of The War of the Worlds movies I have seen.The nameless narrator of this book tells about green capsules that fall to Earth. Inside them are strange tripod/octupus like creatures that use a heat-rays to destroy a number of people early on. The book follows the narrator as he struggles through the English countryside trying to make it back to his wife. Then for a while he tells the story of his brother in London and of the second Martian weapon they face, that of a black cloud which instantly kills people. Then the story winds back to the original narrator as he makes his way to London to see the final destruction of the Martians.Like most classics, this story is most outstanding for the story it told at the time it told it. There are probably better books out there now (Christopher John's Tripod series comes to mind) about alien invasion; but for the time this was a very forward thinking book.The description in the book is very well done and, it is, for the most part very readable and enjoyable. Wells does an excellent job of creating suspense at certain times in the book. He also does an excellent job at showing humanity both at its best and its worst. It is amazing how inhumane some of the humans in this book behave when they are in a panic. The most colossal tragedies this book show that there is space for great heroics and great evil in a time of mass destruction.I also enjoyed the irony behind how the Martians finally meet there death; it was suiting and says interesting things about evolution in general.There were some things I did not like about this book. Some of the parts just went on too long. There is a portion where the narrator spends forever describing every minute aspect of the Martians which was slow, another portion where the narrator is making his way across the countryside that was boring, and the part where the narrator is trapped in a collapsed house seemed to drag on forever. Wells gives great attention to the narrators situation but doesn't ever go outside of the narrators sphere of influence to see what is happening world-wide or what kind of reaction the rest of the world is having. Also the characters were pretty sketchy...this was definitely more of an adventure driven novel than a character driven one.Should you read it? Well if you like sci-fi and are interested in alien invasion then this is a must; this is pretty much the story that inspired a lot of later sci-fi stories. A lot of the story is very enjoyable, engaging and intriguing; but as with many classics there are portions that drag on a bit. I never found the language or writing difficult to understand, so that means this novel has aged well with time. If you are not a sci-fi fan, interested in post-apocalyptic stories, or alien invasion I would probably skip this in favor of something else.If you do really like this story and haven't read theThe Pool of Fireby Christopher John I recommend that you do; the story is similar in tone, more character driven, and a wonderful read."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"This is H.G.

WellsSeptember 20, 2002During the summer I read the best book yet. War of the Worlds by H.G. Wells is a science fiction novel that explains the existence of extra terrestrial beings on the planet Mars. This story dates back into 1882. These 2 men who live in England are observers in an observatory that have observed suspicion things going on, on the planet mars. Every night at about Midnight they see a very gassy object shooting out of the planet mars.My favorite part of the book is when one of the gassy objects land on earth. One morning in that town that the observers lived in, one of the objects they saw landed about a couple of miles from they there own town. It was a giant cylinder. It was very hot and the bottom was still red. A couple of hours later the top of the cylinder opened and a thing came out. I cant tell you what came out you are going to have to read it your self.This was a great novel to read over the summer and it was very interesting. I highly recommend this book to people who are into sci-fi books and alien encounters. When I started to read this book it was boring because the author had to set the setting and tell what's going on, but it got better later on in the book. It turned out to be the best book yet."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"This is the book that got me interested in Science-Fiction in the first place, and i've never really read anything else that has drawn me in in quite the same way. It is along with two other H.G. Wells books (The Invisible Man, The Time Machine) quite possibly the blueprints for everything else that followed. For me the only apocolyptic books that came even come close to War Of The Worlds, are The Stand and The Day Of The Triffids.It works on a number of levels. You can read it as a novel about a Martian Invasion and it works, or you can reads it as a political commentary on the British empire and it still works. It also gives you a pretty good account of life and attitudes in England a century ago.Quite simply in my humble opinion it is the best piece of literature written in the last 150 years. Now if only Hollywood would make a proper adaption of it. One set in England in the 1890's and with proper tripod fighting machines."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"This book was great!

After discussing the book, we listened to a recording of Orson Wells' original radio broadcast, which caused listeners great terror when it first aired in the 1930s.

The following evening, we watched the 1953 film classic.In a related assignment, my son wrote:A cylinder falls from space onto Horsell Common, an area some miles from London. One night later, the cylinder opens, unleashing a tragedy on three metal legs. Is it possible that we can destroy these beings from Mars before they destroy us?A few years before I read the complete, unabridged story, I read an abridgement.

This is down to many things, not least my lack of experience with Science Fiction novels. That aside, this book is a story designed, at the time it was written, for a nation (England) that Wells believed was complacent in its own power and dominance. It is this complacency that helps the martians in their destruction of human kind, and also nature in its destruction of the martians. For me the greatest importance of the book is the irony in the fact that the martians are not defeated by humans, but by nature, something neither the martians or humans have control over. This twist to the story is what seperates it from other science fiction works, and this is why i rate it so highly."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"This is the first novel describing warfare between planets. Mars is portrayed as a dying world. An invasion, expeditionary force of Martians has landed in southern England, landing first in Woking (about 25 miles southwest of London), and this event and the destruction caused by the Martians is seen through the eyes of a writer in speculative philosophy. This book is probably Wells' most noted work. It was published right after certain noted astronomical observations had been reported in the newspapers. Wells refers to his novel as an attack on &quot;human self-satisfaction.&quot; At that time, Britain was deeply involved in Empire activities in Africa and India and Wells had presented a story in which &quot;the tables are turned:&quot; now it is England who suffers takeover. The book isn't simply a science fiction tale (or, even the first novel of a war between planets). It leads into a discussion of Britain's role in the world, of imperialism, and of colonialism. And, to all those teenagers who thought it was boring and gave it one star, remember that it was the first novel in a whole sub-genre of science fiction. It appeared in 1898! My goodness, think of the science of that time. Marie Curie's first paper was only just published in 1897. The first all-metal dirigible first flew in November of 1897. This is a pioneering novel. And you should read it as such. Those other books and films you use as examples would not be what they are without Wells."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"When i first heard this radio broadcast, I got a serious case of heebie-jeebies.

Wells wrote War of the Worlds as a warning to the complacent, world-dominating British citizens of his era to not take the status quo for granted. The arrogance of some British politicians in particular rubbed Wells entirely the wrong way, particularly their sentiment that the British had an 'obligation' to 'civilize' the world (read: colonize) for its own good. Well's book was a rock thrown at that attitude-on-a-pedestal, and although he didn't knock it down, he made his point- and in spectacular fashion. In one way, the Martians *were* the conquering British, with their superior weapons and baffling ways that must have seemed incomprehensible to the natives of Africa and other areas colonized by force. Wells' dark tale was also a warning that even the British- despite their firm belief in their world destiny- could be squashed like so many bugs by an indifferent cosmos that didn't give one whit about the British (or anyone else's) false boast of superiority. In the end, though, it's a hopeful book- just as the Martians died off because they weren't biologically suited to live in this world, Wells also foretells the end of the British Empire because the British (alien) way was not the native way of life in the colonies, suggesting that the British wouldn't survive there long; the natives would eventually prevail. And they did. On top of all that, it's rousing entertainment that can be read just for its drama and suspense.And that's why it's still in print a hundred years later.-Mark Wakely, author of An Audience for Einstein"},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"Note: I made some Mormon reader angry over my negative reviews of books written by Mormons out to prove the Book of Mormon, and that person has been slamming my reviews.Your \\"helpful\\" votes are appreciated. Thanks. It took some effort to type up the following wonderful lines from this story about an invasion from Mars. I hope you enjoy them.\\"No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man's and yet as mortal as his own; that as men busied themselves about their various concerns they were scrutinized and studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinize the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water. With infinite complacency men went to and fro over this globe about their little affairs, serene in the assurance of their empire over matter. It is possible that the infusoria under the microscope do the same. No one gave a thought to the older worlds of space as sources of human danger, or thought of them only to dismiss the idea of life upon them as impossible or improbable. It is curious to recall some of the mental habits of those departed days. At most, terrestrial men fancied there might be other men upon Mars, perhaps inferior to themselves and ready to welcome a missionary enterprise. Yet across the gulf of space, minds that are to our minds as ours are to those of the beasts that perish, intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic, regarded this earth with envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their plans against us. And early in the twentieth century came the great disillusionment.\\"Don't miss the other great novels by H.G.

Currently, and not surprisingly perhaps, it carries a very post-9/11 feel. This is a story of gradually mounting terror and the panic that ensues, triggered by an incident whose momentous import is unappreciated initially. The world changes and the previous age's complacency can never be retrieved.Wells's ability to capture a believable human response to an unbelievable occurence is what keeps the story grounded and genuinely frightening. This edition, illustrated by one of the great masters of the mischieviously macabre, is one to savour in these unsettling times."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"When I first read this novel back in 1998 (A hundred years after the novel had been written), I was expecting a good horror novel. What I got was a powerful novel of faith and hope within the story of a Martian invasion. Mankind is powerless against these invaders, their weapons useless. But in the end, Mankind wins anyway, thanks to the Master of Heaven and Earth. H.G. Wells' novel is a masterpiece that deserves a place in everyone's collection of great science fiction! Grade: A+"},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"As usual, the book is better than the movie(s).In all really good science fiction, once you accept the author's basic premise, the story makes sense on many levels. The characters act and interact in complex and believable ways. Human society starts falling apart under the overwhelming strain of the seemingly unstoppable Martian machines. The Martian technology is plausible even today (like heat rays we can interpret as infra red battle lasers.) He anticipates the potentially deadly impact of earth microorganisms on inhabitants of another planet, something NASA takes very seriously today.I was a science fiction junky when I was growing up, but I moved away from it as an adult. H G Wells has rekindled my interest."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"Edward Gorey's line drawings always feel like they're a hundred years old, and H.G. Wells The War of the Worlds first appeared 108 years ago. Both stir the same nostalgic senses. New York Review Books Classics celebrates their union in a 2005 release of 'Edward Gorey's' The War of the Worlds, first published in 1960. Gorey's 29 text illustrations, unremarkable on first glance - that is compared to The Doubtful Guest (1957) or The Object Lesson (1958), or even to Warwick Goble's illustrations in the serialized first appearance in Pearson's magazine in 1897 - do end up working very well when digested together. And together, the vivid first-person narrative and drawings creep out the shadows into the imagination. Gorey's gloomy, somber silhouettes serve as backdrops for the swirling confusion the narrator encounters in every chapter.The catastrophe unfolds through the eyes of this faceless man, the weight of his horror carried to the end, and the drawings carry the same weight. Only the Martians and their gangly machines are illuminated, and the cover illustration presents them in all their menacing glory. The wraparound illustrations on the boards alone is worth its' having, though a dust jacket would've made it extra special.When Looking Glass Library (Gorey was art director and a co-founder) published War of the Worlds in 1960, many probably recalled an event just eleven years earlier. Riots in Quito, Ecuador resulted in 20 deaths, in response to a radio broadcast of a localized version of The War of the Worlds in 1949. And eleven years before that, there was New Jersey, Halloween night, and Orson Welles on the air waves. The War of the Worlds moves mysteriously between two worlds. Not between Mars and Earth. Between fiction and non-fiction. Impelling entertainment or mass hysteria. It's all in how it's delivered. The War of the Worlds can be vitriolic stuff."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"The \\"War of the Worlds\\" published by New York Review of Books is simply H. G. Wells' novel. But about 50 years ago I purchased Edward Gorey's illustrated \\"War of the Worlds\\" and along with the \\"Classics Illustrated\\" images the images of Gorey's edition burned in to my mind what War of the Worlds should look like.I praise the New York Review of Books for re-publishing this wonderful copy of Wells' novel because if you are going to read Wells' book (and the summer of 2005 is a good time to do it) this is the copy to get and hold and pass down to your kids.I still have my 1950's Edward Gorey copy of \\"War of the Worlds\\" but just like his Haunted Looking Glass (also re-published by New York Review of Books)my 1950's copies are now so brittle that I do not dare to open them.

It keeps you glued to your chair both by its plot, but also by its writing. This is not fast food writing. This is not the kind of writing that you consume like french fries, enjoy and forget instantly. The prose is beautiful, every word seemingly chosen with care to build up a scene or create a mood. The quote that began this review is one example. Here is another to describe the collapse of the government and the end of law and order, \\"All organizations were losing coherency, losing shape and efficiency, guttering, softening, running at last in that swift liquefaction of the social body.\\"Right from the start, the reader is given a growing sense of danger, dread and horror. The narrator (who seems to be Wells, himself) describes the ancient, doomed civilization of Mars. It is doomed because Mars itself is a dying planet and the Martians must look elsewhere if they are to survive. They look to the earth and they have a technology so advanced and a moral sense so non-existent, that people do not exist for them except as a nuisance to be gotten rid of.Having given the reader that background information, Wells describes the landing of a mysterious object near the small English town where he is living happily with his wife. The object is regarded at first as a meteorite, then as a curiosity and then as an enigma as it slowly opens. No one sees it as dangerous until it lashes out with a deadly heat ray, killing people. (Clearly Wells anticipated the invention of the laser!) When these first deaths occur, the narrator hastily sends his wife to stay with relatives a few miles away, not anticipating any real danger, but just being sensibly cautious. He himself quite matter of factly returns home and is suddenly plunged into the midst of chaos and danger. The Martians are on the move. More and more of the strange objects are landing. The Martians ignore all efforts to communicate and contemptuously destroy all human efforts at attack or defense. The Martians begin a sweep of the countryside, slaughtering everyone in their path.So everyone expects that the moment the British army goes into action against the Martians, the Martians will be doomed. Instead, the Martians simply annihilate the British army. The highest technology known to man is slapped aside like the stinging of mosquitoes. That is all man is to the invader, a pesky insect. Or, as a soldier who is the sole survivor of his unit tells the narrator, their best efforts were: \\"It's bows and arrows against the lightning.\\" I doubt that we, reading it today, can fully grasp how shocking that must have sounded to the average Victorian reader.That was Well's intention -- to shock the reader. It's no accident that he used the simile of bows and arrows against the lightning. Great Britain (along with the other Western powers) had been able to conquer \\"savages\\" around the world because the British had the lightning (guns) and the \\"savages\\" had only bows and arrows. Out of those victories came a sense of moral superiority the concept that Western civilization was superior instead of admitting that it was only Western technology that was momentarily superior. Wells was a writer on social issues and he used science fiction to show what would happen if the British Empire came up against aliens who were as far beyond them as they were beyond the \\"savages\\" they had conquered and who treated them as they did the \\"savages.\\" In War of the Worlds, it is made very clear that the Martians really don't behave any worse towards humans than humans behave towards each other. In fact, he comments early in his story, \\"Before we judge of them (the Martians) too harshly, we must remember what ruthless and utter destruction our own species has wrought...Are we such Apostles of Mercy as to complain if the Martians warred in the same spirit?\\"Wells wanted his readers to think and feel what it means to be a conquered people who are conquered and destroyed not through lack of courage or effort but simply because the enemy's technology is superior. I have no idea how many readers of the day understood the message and learned humility from it. War of the Worlds began that popular part of science fiction that imagines invasions from outer space, the most recent being the blockbuster Independence Day. Here the message is, unfortunately, that even though alien technology is superior, humans are able to cleverly find a way to defeat the enemy. That makes for a good, exciting story, but it is not the message Wells was giving.War of the Worlds does have a happy ending. The aliens are defeated, but not by the cleverness and resourcefulness of man. Something else defeats them and saves the human race. The message of War of the Worlds then is as timely today as it was in 1898. Man is not the master of the earth, much less the universe. Man needs to learn to walk humbly upon the earth and value what he has before it all is lost."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"A metallic jellyfish flails across the green meadow, flinging its appendages every which way against the purple sky. Further on, similar creatures have already wreaked havoc upon the landscape and its inhabitants. Scores of small fires encircle everyone and everything in the foreground as the giant menacing marauder looms overhead. Wispy cirrus clouds, a flimsy gathering of pines and a minuscle moon all recede into the background as terror is unleased upon all in the vistors' path.Bold orange text announces the grounding of forms, THE WAR OF THE WORLDS by H.G. WELLS, and furthermore, Illustrated by EDWARD GOREY. Even the bar code is blocked out in fiery tones. Before you even open the beautiful NYRB reissue of this classic of suspense and terror, an indelible mark is made. The Martian creatures are inscribed upon your subconscious. At the beginning of each of the two books and twenty-seven chapters included therein, Gorey supplements the text with an exquisite pen and ink drawing, a troubling indicator of the action that follows.This confluence of forms is a victory for all involved; Wells, Gorey, Orson Welles, Steven Spielberg, and most of all, the reader or soon-to-be viewer. With the imminent release of one of the summer's most anticipated films, I can find no better prelude into the swelling hysteria that is The War of the Worlds than this elegantly-illustrated volume ."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"Why is it that every movie/radio/TV adaptation of this story has been SO different from the original story? This story is so much more gripping, thrilling and horrifying than anything seen in any of those half-baked exploitations, I don't know why they bothered. There are scenes where the alien death machines systematically exterminate the populace of London that are truly horrifying, even sickening. There's another scene where a death machine fights a one-on-one duel with a naval destroyer that is as cool as anything you'll see in the CGI-painted fantasies on the screen. And the section that details the evacuation of London that rings so true, you can smell the dust and panic. For a 19th Century British author, Wells had a style that was more cinematic and moving than anything you'll see at the local multiplex nowadays. Forget what you think you know about &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;. Forget the adaptations, forget the Cliff's Notes, forget what your teachers tell you about it.

I knew the hype, and I have read some of Well's other stuff, but I felt the story was mediocre. I realize the political-historical significance may have been great a century ago, but I believe its worth is lost today.Telling the story through the main character's eyes was interesting but maybe not the best way to tell of a world-wide invasion. Both in the book and in the movie, I desired to see a \`big picture' of the invasion. What was going on in other parts of the world? What were the Martians thinking? What were the governments doing? The ending was beautiful but maybe too sudden and thus anti-climactical. However, you have to read it for several reasons. First, because it is a classic. Second, because it is so short and easy to read. And lastly, in order to appreciate the 2005 movie, you need to have read the book.

It is in the 1890s when few cars existed and most travel is done by train or horse and buggy. So in the story the main character is an astronomer who saw some kind of jet of gas on Mars. Later you find that it was a gun that shot pods with Martians in them. The Martians looked like gigantic heads on three little legs. They didn't eat what they did was inject human blood into them.

All around you are burning carcasses of people you know and love. Would you run, or would you try to kill what did this? Then what if you remember the cylinders with the big, long legged aliens that come out of it. Would you then fight or run?This may sound like something that only a hermit could conjure up, yet an well-educated man wrote it. His name was H.G. Wells and he wrote this book called War of the Worlds. In this story, Martians land in a small town where the narrator lives. Twenty or so round looking cylinders, crash into the soft dirt. The whole town viewed the odd shaped space ships hit the ground, so they went to look. Long legged aliens emerged from the cylinders. The narrator flees along with his family and a borrowed wagon.Around nine o'clock, the narrator returns to his town to find that it has been completely deserted and almost destroyed. The rest of the story is how the narrator finds his way home and his very interesting and dangerous struggle to survive. Many interesting events occur to the man behind the voice.This book is full of action packed paragraphs that make you want to read more. The most suspenseful scene is at the beginning when the Martians land on Earth. They are discovered in &quot;the pit,&quot; a small, bare basin, near the town in which the narrator lives. Groups of people have gathered near the spaceship, surrounding it. In one foul instant, a green flash of light disintegrates all around the spaceship, and sets fire to everything in its way. The narrator nearly escapes to his demise, to find that people do not care that there are Martians in their town.If you love action packed, edge of your seat books, then you will surely love this book. It is full with quickly moving action and it is never predictable. When this book was wrote it was ahead of it's time, and is still a very futuristic book.

In this novel Mr. Wells succeeds in accomplishing both and he does so in 1898(?).

Edward Gorey was the perfect man to illustrate The War of the Worlds. Dark, brooding and laced with a macabre humour, his illustrations are highly effective in illustrating Wells's classic invasion tale. If you like book illustration and are looking for an edition of the story, I don't think you can go wrong here.The book is well bound, on nice paper, and is an attractive, compact size.The story itself is superb, and certainly needs no review from me!"},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"The only real parallels between the movie with Tom Cruise and the book are the shape of the tripods used by the aliens and the manner in which the aliens meet their demise. With this in mind, the novel is a spectacular achievement from the innovator of science fiction.H.G. Wells had a vision of science in the future that was frighteningly close to reality. Even more striking is the logic that supports his plot. He does not reach for wild space theories to base the story. Instead, the logic behind the plot is very logical. Throughout the book, the narrator of the story jumps between his brother's escape and his own. Based in the world of the late 19th century, the fancy technology used by the Martians is more frigthening to the mind. Avoiding lasers and poisonous gas long before man conceived such ideas, the narrator and his brother separately try only to survive. Along the way they meet other trying to continue their existence, while learning more about their attackers.The one peculiar loop in the story is the mysterious reasoning for which the narrator just seems to leave his wife during this horrendous war. Just as easily as she is forgotten, Wells brings her back at the conclusion. It almost seemed as though the author forgot about her in his storytelling.The part of this book that I appreciate most is the way the Martians meet their end. The invaders become the invaded. It makes so much sense based knowing the vaccinations that may be necessary for traveling to a foreign country. The story is also a stark reminder of what humans overlook in their existence. Regardless of one's interpretation, it is a wonderful book that exceeds the movie in so many ways."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"\\"War Of The Worlds\\" is Wells' indictment of 19th Century Imperialism, as enforced by European technological superiority. Just as low tech societies were stunned & overwhelmed by 19th Century Europeans armed with artillery, warships & mass manufactured tools & weapons, so do the Martians humble the British Empire with Tripods, Heat Rays, & Black Smoke...all beyond Human comprehension or defensive measures.Edward Gorey's creepy artistic style is perfect, reminding us of just how grotesque the Martians are intended to be.I collect illustrated editions of \\"War Of The Worlds\\", and I highly recommend this nifty little volume.The Hipster gives it a Big Thumbs UP!"},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"Overrpriced! 6 CD set unabridged, narrated very successfully by Sean Barrett with his lovely English/Irish baritone voice, so very appropriate to this Wells' masterpiece."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"What struck me over and over about reading THE WAR OF THE WORLDS was the imagination that fueled this story at a time when men got around by horse and lit their homes with lanterns.H.G. Wells envisioned space travel, mechanized warfare as well as a killer Heat Ray and a deadly Black Gas the Martians employed to destroy mankind. Simply amazing. And that was only this story! To think he would also write THE TIME MACHINE, THE INVISIBLE MAN, THE ISLAND OF DOCTOR MOREAU and THE FOOD OF THE GODS! Just think what his mind might have come up with had he seen the technology he forecasted in the 20th Century!Another well-crafted aspect of this novel is how realistically he writes of the human slaughter as the Martians invade. Either on a personal level (the novel is narrated by one man with a section devoted to retelling what happened to his brother) or a description of the masses fleeing the attack, the story is quite believable. The chaos and carnage of the World Wars decades later kept coming to mind as I read the passages of the crowds fleeing London as the city and country are ablaze under the power of the Martian war machines.The writing also holds wonderful description and passages. I kept hearing the authoritative voice of Richard Burton from Jeff Wayne's 1978 musical version of WAR OF THE WORLDS as I read the opening, as great a first page of any work of science fiction since.And did the makers of the 2005 Spielberg movie bother to read the novels? I mean, come on: the section in the book of the men trapped in a house collapsed by a falling cylinder played so much better than the SIGNS rip off sequence with Tim Robbins in the basement in the film!Even the ending is brilliant (something else discarded by the filmmakers in their effort to remain politically correct).If I was an English teacher, I'd use THE WAR OF THE WORLDS as a reading assignment, exposing the students to the 1938 \\"panic broadcast\\" by Orson Welles and perhaps even show the movie adaptions to engage the kids. I wish my teachers had."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"I have just \\"reread\\" H. G. Wells classic of science fiction (actually I listened to the audiobook version on my iPod on a long flight). And it is still as gripping to me as it was many years ago when I was a young teen. As the grandfather of all science fiction concerning invasions of alien beings from advanced interplanetary civilizations \\"The War of the Worlds\\" always will be considered a seminal work of science fiction.The book is a first person account, by a survivor, of a Martian attack on the south of England during the late 19th century. Human armies and weapons are totally inadequate to stop the invading alien army. The Martian technology that Wells describes would have been frightening to anyone living in the late 19th century. Rapidly moving fighting machines, heat rays, and poison gas attacks all at the command of a totally inhuman and merciless enemy whose attack was entirely unprovoked. However, we had only had to wait for 2 decades to experience tanks and poison gas on the battlefields of Europe. A few decades more and we had atomic bombs and lasers. Neither did Wells depict the Martians as invulnerable. After all, the torpedo ram \\"Thunderchild\\" took out two and possibly 3 of the Martian war machines before it was sunk. Of course today a squadron of modern F16s could wipe out the entire invading Martian army of 1898 in a few minutes. Followed by a thermonuclear attack on Mars iteslf, of course. We clearly have outstripped the technology that Wells imagined.However, futuristic technology is not the point of Wells' book. Wells knew that human machines were advancing at a rapid pace. He probably would not be surprised at today's technology. Wells book actually is a social commentary and a condemnation of the British colonial system and the cruel indifference with which Europe exploited less technologically advanced peoples. The Martians that he describes could well become us. Sluggish beings, entirely dependant on machines, living on the life blood of the less fortunate. This is in fact what half of humanity does become in Wells' equally important novel \\"The Time Machine.\\" So the theme of \\"The War of the Worlds\\" is as important today as it was in 1898 in spite of the admittedly dated technology that it describes."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"While the style of this book is a bit dated, it remains a classic because of Well's incredible imagination, the influence the book has had and the social statements he makes. This is the quintessential story about aliens invading the earth and has led to hundreds of other such novels. Wells was far ahead of his time--in an era when the most common mode of transportation was a horse-drawn buggy, he writes of alien machines that walk, crawl and fly. The book is written from one man's perspective as he retells his experiences. His struggle for survival in the face of a seemingly unstoppable foe is a memorable one. There is a bit of a deus ex machina near the end, but it is at least somewhat believable in that it is scientifically based. The plot moves fast enough and makes for a great read. However, what makes this novel more than just great science fiction is the brilliant satire regarding the colonization policies of his own native England at that time that Wells implants under the surface of the book. As a work of pure science fiction, this book is legendary and is required reading for all fans of the genre. As a work of social commentary, this book is a bold, thought-provoking allegory that readers of all tastes can appreciate. Highly recommended whether you consider yourself a sci-fi fan or not."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"Humans are not alone in the universe, let alone in the solar system itself.

I enjoyed this classic by what I think it is: a gripping narrative of an alien invasion, cleverly written, intelligent, fast-paced, without naming even the main characters!The other merit is that this book is the genesis of all \\"invasion\\" books that followed.A great read."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"If you only saw the Tom Cruise version movie version of this classic book, you really must read the original novel. Much like Mary Shelly's masterpiece, Frankenstein, no movie: not the 1953 version, not the 2005 version (with all due respect to Steven Spielberg), has captured the essence of absolute fear of alien invasion this book ignited in its prime. Written in 1898, this book spans time because it is not caught up in the vernacular of its day, but in the general paranoia of being displaced as the dominant species on Earth.Yes, the book was a political statement. Yes, Wells was famous for his thinly-veiled diatribes. Yes, Orson Welles' [no relation] 1938 Halloween production of it over radio caused such mass hysteria that even Hitler tried to capitalize on it in a speech. Yes, yes, and yes - the book is THAT good. Now for the bad news: It has been actually read by less people than many other books that pale in comparison. If you haven't yet had a chance to experience the xenophobia of a true classic \\"aliens are evil\\" tale, you owe it to yourself to read the original (this copy) over the course of a few dark nights (preferably during a conveniently-timed power outage for added effect)."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"The impressive and breath takeing tale describes the Martian invasion of earth.

Giant cylinders crash to earth, disgorging huge, unearthly creatures armed with heat rays and fighting machines. Amid the boundless destruction they cause, it looks as if the end of the world has come.This novel represents an extraordinary blend of prophetic hard science fiction together with a superb narrative of the human effects of fear, war, mob psychology, courage, arrogance, pride, despair, faith and stupidity among other human strengths and weaknesses.The ending represents a new beginning for a humanity that has received a wake-up call and an opportunity to start over with what Huxley would call a \\"brave new world\\"."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"It is easy to see why \\"The War of the Worlds\\" is still in print more than a century after it was written. H.G. Wells produced a suspenseful, unsentimental, grippingly \\"realistic\\" account of a Martian assault on England circa 1900, when the British Empire was at the height of its power. With the tables turned by superior Martian technology, the invaders drive England to the point of civilizational collapse, as thousands of Englishmen are incinerated, gassed, and exterminated like 19th century Africans or Asians resisting well-armed European imperialists. In the end, England is saved -- but not by cleverness, pluck, or heroics. It is saved by microbes, which infect and wipe out the Martians, who lack any immunities. The technology in the novel may seem old-fashioned, but Wells's tone and sensibility -- his ability to convey a sense of the smallness of mankind and the fragility of social structures -- is astonishingly modern. The book towers over most science fiction."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"'The War of the Worlds' by H.G. Wells tells the story of an English scientist who witnesses the invasion of Earth by Mars. Martians are being forced to relocate due to the failing resources of their own planet. Ten waves of alien craft crash into earth and immediately begin to slaughter the human race. Their superior technology makes them unstoppable by modern Earth weaponry. It becomes clear that the humans are nearing their extinction. Though The War of the Worlds is a tale of warfare, it is also a commentary on the irony of human existence. Humans have become a hunted race, surviving only by hiding from the enemy. Just hours before, humans were the hunters. We ruled our planet with the concept of Survival to the Fittest and by that same concept we were defeated.Although I had to read this book for school purposes, not voluntarily, I had heard of it before and it did not disappoint my expectations. The story is really interesting and it is a pleasure to read this novel, which truly is one of science fictions masterpieces."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"I liked this book because no matter where the narrator was or what he was doing he always explained it throughly. He always told you why he was doing something, how he was doing it, and what he wanted the outcome to be. And once he was through doing the project or activity he told you what or how it turned out. He also told what others were doing in the story. He never left you wondering about what the enemy was doing if he was able to tell. This is more of an explanation fantasy book rather than lots of action.I believe that the best part of the book would be when the main character and the Curate were trapped in the fallen down house. It gave the reader a sense of just how immense their problem with the Martians was. It was also fascinating because they were trapped right beside one of the Martians' headquarters. The narrator explained the way of the Martains and how they go about their buisness. It told of the complexe machines and their looks and behavior. Overall I would say that this was the best and most interesting part of the book.The two elements of the book that were most vivid to me were the conflict between character vs. character, and setting. The conflict was easy to realize because that was about the only thing that the narrator talked about besides the setting. He really influenced the trouble that the human race was in against the Martians. He emphasized how meaningless and useless our ways were and are when something of unimaginable power takes over. The setting was also vivid to me because all through the book the author explained and told where he was. He really explained the scenery and incorporated the setting into the story."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"This is the book which spawned/inspired all subsequent short stories, novels and movies about Alien invasion of Earth and mankind's attempts at resistance. From The Invasion of the Body Snatchers to the X Files, authors and producers owe an inestimable debt to HGW, who practically invented the Sci Fi genre. (Jules Verne earlier had coined the phrase \\"Scientific Romances\\" for his own creative tales.)Stylistically there is little dialogue--just long narratives in the first person by an observant, occasionally active, narrator, plus occasional monologues by a secondary character. The role of women is negligible--except as in requiring male assistance. Wells slips in a few satiric barbs at human foibles, but the plot is deadly serious, as the majority of the terified masses react like cattle or idiots. The veneer of civilization is hastily abandoned in the panic of Self Survival.Torn between love for his wife and brother vs a sincere concern for the fate of all humankind on the planet, the Narrator spends two weeks as a prisoner in a bombed-out house. During this time he observes the Martians at his leisure--thus making him the most informed Englishman on the subject of alien anatomy and behavior. Stalking about on tremendous tripod legs, these first literary aliens deal death dispassionately and indiscriminately to hapless victims in their inexorable march to and through London.The red planet has sent 10 mysterious cylinders to Earth--an advance army of scouts for potential colonization as a result of Mars' inevitable demise. Nothing man can devise--weapons increase in sophistication as subsequent version are filmed over the decades--can withstand the superior technology of these ruthless but purposeful invaders. The conquest of Earth is settled within a week and mankind is doomed. For once man is the enslaved race--no longer the masters of their own planet. Is resistance futile--or even possible? Could mere ants (re size and technology) destroy or even survive against a race of giants? A critical and chilling must-read for all sci fi buffs."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"I love War of the Worlds. It was so far ahead of its time when it was written that today, over 100+ years later, it is still such a great read.The book does a great job capturing the terror of an alien invasion from Mars and the ensuing public panic; far better than what was seen in the recently released movie. Through Well's tremendously descriptive, first-person narrative, one can actually feel the death and destruction being caused by these mechanical tripods. The book gets you so caught up in this world of horror, damnation and fear that it is quite hard to put this novel down.Wells is a master of building suspense and evoking powerful images. War of the Worlds is certainly one of his best works, and for myself, this novel was certainly a thrilling ride...yet again."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"IN LATE 1900s the world is keenly watched by a superior force than MANKIND The &quot;MARTIANS.&quot; WHO WOULD KNOW THEIR GOAL WAS TO TURN THE HEVENLY PLACE (THE EARTH) INTO A DISASTER.&quot;BOWS AND ARROWS&quot; AGAINST THE DEADLY GREEN SMOKE HEAT RAYS,AND NAPLAM BOMBS.PEOPLE DYING.DEADLY SPACESHIPS LOADED WITH GUNS WERE TO ATTACK THE EARTH.WHOEVER TRIES TO ESCAPE THE DESTRUCTION IS DESTROYED.THE MARTIANS HAVE NO MERCEY;ATTACK AFTER ATTACKS.A QUESTION AROSOES IN EVERYBODYS MIND &quot;WHO WOULD SAVE THE HEAVENLY PLACE FROM THESE DEADLY CREATURES?WHO?DO YOU KNOW WHO?"},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"I like H.G.

Intelects, vast, cool and unsympathetic, regarded our world with envious eyes and slowly and surely drew their plans against us.&quot;Even after many times in reading, that opening, with visions of the red planet, drying canals and Gustav Holst playing in the backround, plays almost cinimaticaly across my imagination. Surely the best opening to any book I have ever read.While I think &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; stands as Wells's masterpiece, it's too bad that Hollywood has passed over this work. I don't count Gorge Pal's 1960s version, it is standard Cold War fare with the church bells ringing at the end... blech.There have been imitators, of course. &quot;Independance Day&quot; is the most recent, but the only quality treatment of Wells invasion from mars was The Mercury Theater's Halloween 1938 production with Orson Wells.And even that boiled it down to its essentials of invasion, desparation, futility and reprive. &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; was an exploration of how we, as humans, have treated our own world and the 'aliens' of our own planet. The animals, environments and fellow humans that have been trampled beneath the feet of so-called civilization. We think ourselves those 'vast intellects', taking the world for our own, our advance only irritated by 'godless savages', beings of little consequence.And still, 100 years after it was first published, Wells cautionary tale still holds true. Except that now, the earth is holding us to account as the Martians had to account to the microbes that spelled their demise. Global warming, antibiotic-resistant disease, over-population, species extinction, are these the things that bring to an end our dominion on this earth, the earth that we, in many ways, stole from ourselves, unthinking of the consequences as the Martian were oblivious to the consequences of their invasion?We know Mars to be a dead world but 100 years ago it was widely believed that, not only did Mars have life but it had intelligent life. But until Wells came along with his tentacled horrors to dethrone man kind from his empire over the earth, the earthlings thought looked on those that might one day be found on Mars as they had looked on the natives of Africa, the Americas, India and China; savages to be brought under the tutalage of Western society.The more things change, the more things stay the same. Will Wells's warnings continue to fall on deaf ears?"},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"One of the most famous science fiction books to date is H. G. Wells' classic War of the Worlds, which has become national paranoia in the late 30's with Orson Welles over the radio. And later in the 50's become a national hit with the movie goers. Well, neither the radio broadcast or movie rendition really took the book to its letter by letter copy, but rather improvised like most non-literal entertainers. The book begins with suspicion, suspense and wonder as a meteor passes the sky without any real notice to anyone. While the book is told in the perspective of the scientist (whose name I cant seem to recall at the moment), later, somewhere after the mid-point the gears switch and we learn what the scientists brother is doing elsewhere. For the majority of the book, once the aliens have control over the earth, which is within the first 4 chapters, things calm down and become a bit stale. Only after we come back to the scientist from the brothers story, things pick up, but mind you, they pick up slowly. I am happy I got the chance to read this book, but was a little dissapointed in how the story unfolded which is why I gave this book 4 stars.

Wells made some enemies with this broadcast simply because it was so realistic that people were panicking at the thoughts of the end of the world - even though the fact that this is a drama is stated clearly throughout. When you start listening to this, clear a good hour on your schedule because you won't want to walk away until it's over.

With War of the Worlds, well, this was different. I've seen the different films, etc. I decided to read the novel. To my surprise it was more interesting than any of the movies or any other thing I've read.It's interesting how a novel that was written so long ago has so many details regarding things of the future or technology, and it's interesting because, the author didn't put the enemy with weapons like bombs that could destroy an entire galaxy or something like that. It was just a simple laser and a few robots.It keeps the novel in a small place; he didn't try to cover the whole world with this, just this city and villages, but the most important, LIFE, the survival of the human race and how a man could maintain his sanity or not in such chaos.Keep in mind that this novel was written a long time ago, don't make like some idiots that tells you or write critics, saying, what's the fun in it, what happened with the armies, the new weapons, etc. It's a very futuristic novel, but don't compare it with the things we have now.

Not only does it create a frightening vision of what might happen if an advanced society were to invade earth (though this \\"vision\\" was more political satire than anything and continues to have relevance in today's world), but it is well written (not true of all Wells' works) and contains very real human drama that by itself is an engaging story. Though it came alive on the big screen and I occassionally had a hard time picturing the Martians and some of the details of the story without seeing Spielberg's version, this is certainly worth reading for all science fiction fans or people who want a little background when they watch the film."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"this book is a compelling book and has alot of up and downs in i i like this book because it has a lot of action and there is always a good twist. also threre is a good moral in this book witch reminded me of the boy who cryed wolf. another reason i like this book is because it has alot of action in it there is not one time in this book that i didnt want to put this book down. i like how it has real world based setting but has a si fi plot that is one reason i gave this book a five star rating i loved this book so much and i know u will too"},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"Not much needs to be said here about the story of this truly perennial classic. The War of the Worlds (1898) is the account of Martians invading earth, attacking and ruining London. What happens to the rest of earth and mankind is not resolved till the very end. Although this novel was seen as the start of modern science fiction, it had also a deeper meaning of fighting tyrannies and the occurrence of mass-hysteria.This deeper meaning was clearly shown when Orson Wells broadcast in 1938 an extremely believable radio dramatization. Listeners thought that Martians were actually attacking and in panic they left their homes trying to escape this terrifying experience. It is interesting to note that that broadcast happened at the eve of World War II.Now in 2005, a new movie adaption has just been released by Steven Spielberg and starring Tom Cruise. While I'll leave it to movie critics to evaluate that movie, it has already received wide acclaim for its special effects. Something else interesting to note is that in the early scenes of the attack by the Martians, the children of the character played by Cruise question whether these are attacks by \\"terrorists\\". In an era where we are sandwiched in time by 9/11, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and further terrorist attacks in Bali, Istanbul, Madrid and London, the world seems again in the grip of fear, of wars and of mass-hysteria. One could wonder if The War of the Worlds in 2005 again will create or foresee further scares in the world.What makes this edition of The War of the Worlds so worthwhile is not just the inclusion of the classic illustrations by Henrique Alvin Correa, but also the introduction by Robert Bartholomew. Bartholomew is a leading expert on panic attacks, media manipulation and mass delusion, and he puts this book in historical and contemporary context. He tries to answer why this book has \\"created\\" such a scare in 1898, in 1938 and maybe again in 2005, or is the scare in all of us us calling this book into everlasting existence? I rate this edition 4 stars, and just wished that the publisher had considered releasing a hard cover edition."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"The War of the Worlds is a amazing science fiction novel by H.G. Wells. It is a story about an alien invasion that takes place in Europe. All of the main action takes place in London and England. A man in a London suburb named Oglivy witnesses an alien cylinder crash into the Earth. Many of the towns people go to open it and see what's inside. The cylinder finally opens revealing sluggish aliens who have a killer heat ray. The ray shoots an invisible beam that incinerates anything in its path. A couple of more cylinders land and the invasion begins. The aliens built metal pods that walked on three legs so they could move around. They carry around the heat rays and start taking out cities. It has a very amazing ending but I don't want to give it away.The war of the worlds is one of the bests books I've ever read. It contains a ton of action which really keeps me reading on and on. The details were so amazing that I just couldn't put the book down. My version of the book, The War of the Worlds, contained amazing illustrations that re-explained and put the correct picture in my head for a couple of the semi-confusing parts of the book. With the illustrations and the great detail made me feel like I was running away from the aliens along with the main character. Also H.G. Wells wrote descriptions about these crazy Twenty First century machines used by the aliens that I wouldn't believe existed even today. His descriptions of the action and the details of the machines made this book an excellent five star book."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"Welcome to the book that has influenced all other Alien Invasion.Although now written over 100 years ago the concepts and much of the Alien technology is still being used today.Do yourself a favour and read this book to find out how it all began."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"What makes this book so great? It's not the plot or the characters... it's the believability of the story. Everything that happens seems well within the realm of reason, and is presented in such a way as to make you actually believe it is happening. You can feel the fear of the narrator, and the impending doom of the planet Earth. This book was the first to address the subject of an extra-terrestrial attack on the Earth, and is undoubtedly the best."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"It just might be! What a book. If you prefer quality over quantity, or don't have a lot of free time to read (and of course, if you do), then this should definitely be on your list. Wells spins a masterful multi-layered tale that is at the surface a story of an alien invasion, but also a statement about the effects of imperialism, mankind's abuse of our planet earth, our complacency in being at the top of food chain (what if something displaced us?), and illustrates the split between &quot;intellectual&quot; types (the narrator is a writer of philosophy) and working-class &quot;primal warrior&quot; types (he meets a character who wants to start a guerilla movement against the Martians). On top of all that, Wells eerily predicts the spread - and later, the internal rotting out - of communism, and its association with the color red (pay attention to Book 2 for this).Not bad for less than two hundred pages. But if you read for entertainment more than for education, this remains a gripping and entertaining piece of speculative science fiction. I'm not sure whether Wells is truly the genre's all-time master, but we're all hard-pressed to find someone who did it better. Spend a day or two immersed in this - and don't forget to come back a second and third time in the future."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"&quot;No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world was being watched by intelligences greater than man's and yet as mortal as his own....&quot; Thus begins The War of the Worlds, written by science-fiction mastermind H. G. Wells, who brought you other incredible novels, such as The Time Machine.This suspenseful story of Martians invading Earth is full of surprises. The narrator tells of his encounters with the powerful Martians and their stunning technologically advanced weapons and machines, which range from iron-melting heat rays to death serving war machines.This novel has its ups and downs. One down is that the author sometimes describes the surroundings too much. But, the book does have the eerieness of a suspenseful book, keeping you on the edge of your seat, wondering what will happen next. Will mankind survive? Will the invading Martians take over the Earth? Will the Martians destroy the Earth? Find out when you read the spectacular book, The War of the Worlds."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"Far more vivid than I was expecting, and it felt much more scientifically sound than I thought it would be from a general description. Although some of its claims are not valid, from the perspective of someone living in the 1890s, all of the alien's tools were logically explained, and seemed reasonable in an overall sense. Unlike in the movie version of the War of the Worlds, the aliens were not invincible due to some flimsy excuse of a magnetic field. They were vulnerable to man's weapons, but too clever to be devestated by them.I disagree with those who say this book had no passion. The author's reaction while being trapped in the house for weeks on end was quite vivid and believable. He never got all mushy or melodramatic, and we are meant to assume that he is writing an objective account of what happened to him, which would be hindered by over-emphasising his emotions.In a sense, though, the argument that the book should not have been set in England is valid. If aliens were going to invade, why would they choose such a geographically tiny island to attack first when the body of usable land is on the main continents. The book never once addressed this issue.As a side note, some of the reviews on this page are staggeringly stupid, to put it bluntly. If you can't get past page 10 of a fast moving book like this, I'd hate to see how hard you'd crash and burn on something like Tale of Two Cities, and you certainly have no business writing a review of it. What grade must these people be to be below the required reading level? Third?"},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"Having read the comments of those peerless students of the classics from Manassas, VA (where?), one can only wonder what correctional facility is currently running English Literature classes in that unhappy region. If only Mr Wells were still alive, I'm sure he would have agreed with their analysis and realised his mistake in not setting the book in Manhattan, and as for its 'british' language I'm sure he would have slipped in a few words of Southern-Fried Hick to enable the good ol' boys to understand the novel more clearly."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"I read The War of the Worlds just after I saw Steven Spielberg's very very loose adaptation of the book. While I did enjoy the movie immensely, I found the book more descriptive and full of a deeper meaning than Spielberg could convey.What I don't think was really seen in the movie was the way human beings were reduced to a state of being almost no better than animals, which is evident in the narrator's (we never know his name) run-ins with several of the people, and the narrator's brother's experience in a mad crowd running from London. Not only have these people lost almost completely their civilized ways, but just being under the oppression of the aliens makes them as animals are to human beings: lesser beings.Both book and movie, however, do show how the war is almost not a war and more of a termination of us, but a war because we fight back. Is it a war, then, or not a war?The book kind of paved the way for the science fiction genre also, except in this case, everything happened here on Earth and not on some other planet in the X system, which raises a few questions:1)Are we alone? (which is the most obvious),2) Is it arrogant of us to think that we are alone, that we are the most intelligent living beings and therefore no one can destroy us?3) Is it possible that something like this could happen? The book's narrative style is like a newspaper article, and so convincing that I found myself thinking that Martians really did attack England in 1898.Those are just a few of the questions that came up in my mind.The War of the Worlds is a very interesting read, I think, and a good one to read along with The Time Machine, because in both works the future of humanity and technology is portrayed directly and indirectly in different lights; primarily in Wells' time but also in our time.I liked the message of the book and the movie, which was that the human race will always survive and prevail over other living beings. Some may ask what saved them in the end? Was it God, or was it that we had not reached the point in which all disease had been eradicated?Hmmm.What was H.G. Wells thinking about when he wrote this book? Did he believe in aliens?"},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"I don't know if H.G. Wells can take all the credit for pioneering modern science fiction, but his 1898 novel &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; is certainly a revolutionary stroke, apparently the first conception of what a hostile extraterrestrial invasion would be like. The invaders here are Martians, who, as Wells describes, are superevolved beyond humans, having had to sharpen their intelligence and develop superior technology in order to survive their planet's cold climate. Looking with jealousy towards their larger, warmer sunward planetary neighbor, they have decided to take over Earth, where they can build a new civilization.Meanwhile on Earth, astronomers, their telescopes pointed towards Mars, notice strange luminous flashes on the surface of the red planet; these, it can be surmised, are the Martians launching their interplanetary spacecrafts towards their target. A few months later the crafts land in the English countryside one at a time; it turns out the Martians have traveled in gigantic cylinders which contain all their equipment, including their land vehicles--tall walking tripods with rotating control centers that look like hooded human heads--which evidently are stored in parts and need to be assembled. These machines have weapons that deploy &quot;Heat-Rays&quot; which roast anything on contact and dense black powder which poisons the air and water. With these undeniably cool toys, the Martians have no problems advancing towards London and decimating every living thing in their path.Undiplomatic and incommunicative with earthlings, the Martians are cold-blooded killers with possibly the ultimate goal of enslaving the human species for labor in their colonies. The Martian beings themselves are described as vaguely globular, tentacular monsters that are mostly brain and little else, creatures seemingly borrowed from the distant future of Wells's imagination in &quot;The Time Machine.&quot; What I found most original and bizarre about them was Wells's description of their machinery, which does not use wheels or any kind of angular mechanism, but rather complex systems of sliding parts on curved surfaces--in other words, their mechanisms approximate biomechanisms. Their cleverness is indeed formidable, but their information about Earth is lacking in one important area which causes their downfall.The human characters in the novel are hardly worth mentioning, especially the narrator, which is probably why he doesn't have a name; he is used simply as an eyewitness to relate the events. The Martians and their incredible machines were the only things that really drew my interest because Wells is at his best when he invokes the horror of the unknown rather than the realities of human behavior. Upon its first appearance, this novel must have struck many Victorians as distastefully grotesque, the idea of a cataclysmic war (at the dawn of the century that invented the cataclysmic war) the willful nightmare of a madman; but Wells was a visionary if not the most elegant writer, and visionaries sometimes shock us."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"We are in 1898 England. Yep we see something happening on the surface of Mars. Later what looks like a meteor comes to earth. Once we realize the significant of the situation (or think we do) Different people approach the situation in different ways. The true story is how the different people meet the situation.Many people want to equate this story with real potential invasions others as the bad guys vs. the good guys. However from the very first we see that they are the greater (more evolved) intelligence and we are the equivalent of vermin or the ants that are being held under the magnifying glass. From our point of view they seem like cruel creatures, from theirs is indifference. Their way of consuming nourishment is appalling yet look at what and how we eat.The writing its self is of the time in which Wells lived so the descriptions of our world may seem a little alien to today's younger readers. However, the suspense is still there and the story will hold their attention.Do not miss the 1953 movie. Even thought it adds more religious overtones it is still pretty much the same story with similar characters. Of course, this one names the narrator and adds a love interest.The War of the Worlds (Special Collector's Edition)"},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"Most everyone knows of 'The War of the Worlds', a story which has been told, filmed, and adapted into various forms over the past century. Yet actually reading the original by H. G. Wells is a disappointing experience. Oh sure there is horror, some violence, and the author's imagination is quite nicely captured in his prose. But the entire story takes place in greater London, and is told as if the author has never lived more than 50 miles from the place ... and somehow he believes all his readers are as intimately familiar with greater London's nooks and crannies as he is. Thankfully, I am very familiar with London ... and so I found the destruction of all these neighborhoods to be quite intriguing. I think those not familiar with London might be bored with it all.Bottom line: while it certainly has its moments, 'The War of the Worlds' seems oddly myopic and simplistic. Missable."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"Published in the end of the XIX Century, H. G. Wells's \\"The War of the World\\" have scared and delighted people for over a hundred years. First it frightened the author's contemporaries, and the years went by, the novel became a cult, and favorite among geeks everywhere. It had its status raised when Orson Wells made a radio show of it.As far as H. G. Wells's science fiction goes, \\"The War of the World\\" hasn't anything more remarkable than his other famous books, like \\"The Invisible Man\\" and \\"The Time Machine\\". In this alien invasion fantasia the writer had some flights of fancy -- but then again, so did he in the other books.What is more interesting in the story is that the Martians have more personality and will than human beings. The narrator for instance suffers from the absence of aspects to define him as human. He is more a person who is reporting a story than a human being really involved in the invasion and war. Probably that's why he doesn't even have a name. The invaders, on the other hand, are much more obstinate and don't give up. Plus, the fact that they are smarter than the earthlings helps a lot. But probably kids aren't taught Darwin in Mars.Since science -- specially what concerns on space -- has developed a lot since Wells wrote \\"The War of the Worlds\\", but the main theme of the book --the fear of the unknown -- is timeless and this makes the novel interested everlasting, despite it not being a good literary work."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"\\"The War of the Worlds\\" is a gripping sci-fi classic detailing the devastation of London and environs during a Martian invasion, told in the past tense by an unnamed narrator (likely Wells himself) who luckily has lived to tell the story. Wells' late 19th century conceptualization of the Heat-Ray (laser gun), Black Smoke (chemical warfare) and Secret of Flying (airplanes) correctly anticipates the direction of 20th century military technology. However, his descriptions of the brain-strong, emotion-free Martians, with their intricate though wheel-less machines and rapid-growth red creeper plants, today remain only imaginary, since prospects of extant advanced life on Mars are, by modern scientific judgment, whilst conceivable, strikingly remote.Wells' depiction of how humans commonly respond in disaster situations--initial nonchalance and controlled denial, followed by convulsive panic in the face of imminent death--is superb. Further, the juxtaposition of the narrator's courageous realism alongside the curate's wimpy fatalism and the artilleryman's dreamy idealism elevates the plot-oriented adventure to a stimulating, higher philosophical level.The \\"good guy wins\\" story remains suspenseful until the end because the means of victory (I'll just say \\"by power of nature,\\" to avoid revealing too much) is intriguing and believable. Regarding the title of the book, since the confrontation is limited geographically and involves a very restricted number of Martian invaders within the span of only a few weeks, a less grandiose title along the lines of \\"Invasion of the Martians\\" would be more true to the actual unfolding of events.The main weakness of the book as a literary work is the superficial development of the human relationships between key characters. The narrator's brother seems to be mostly a literary device used by the author to expose the reader to events outside of the narrator's immediate experience. Most importantly, the narrator's relationship to his wife begs further development, especially since she is the emotional driving force behind the narrator's lonely resolve to persevere through his struggles and, ultimately, return to her side."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"H.G.

It's not like I'm giving away the plot, everybody from tiny kids to grandparents know it. Yet Wells' version of alien invasion still seems to be very powerful. The images of mankind's flight and the Martians' ease at which they seem to smash civilization are still as strong and as bright as when the words were first put down on paper.Wells' work has spawned other books, a movie, a few radio plays and a musical version."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"I enjoyed reading the original story with its archaic language which has been reinterpreted so many times for both radio and the movies.,"},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"One of the original science fiction masterpieces, and still a winnerThis book, however, is living proof that the English language evolves ..."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"Mr. Well's portrait of the end of life as we know it is simply timeless and poignant.

Ciao"},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"It pains me to do it, but I can only give this novel three stars. It is ironic that a radio presentation of this tale led to widespread panic among unwary listeners; a reading of the novel itself is a slow, languid journey met with little excitement at all. It is almost a chore to get through the middle sections of the book. Wells is a fantastic writer, but here he seems to wallow in his own descriptive prowess. The story starts off promisingly with astronomers spotting strange emissions from Mars on ten successive nights. Soon, &quot;meteors&quot; radiating a green trail through the skies begin to land in the English countryside. The narrator, Ogilvy, is one of the first men to discover the impact site of the first &quot;meteor.&quot; As hundreds of curious people gravitate around the pit, they discover a rounded cylinder, the mysterious contents of which begin making strange sounds. In time, a portion of the cylinder begins slowly unscrewing itself, and what emerges from the cylinder is an inhuman mass of tissue sporting a great number of tentacles. As the people pull back in terror, the creature sets to work building a device that unleashes death and destruction on all those nearby. No man can withstand the utter destruction unleashed by the creature's heat ray. In the days that follow, more and more cylinders land in the area. Soon, the Martians emerge from their pits, riding huge mechanical contraptions towering over the trees. They unleash Black Death, a poisonous gas, throughout the countryside, and they burn villages remorselessly with their devastating heat rays. Now the story comes down to a description of the narrator's flight through the countryside and of the panic that spreads from town to town as unbelieving men and women come to realize that the Martians are here and cannot be stopped. Page after page is devoted to descriptions of man's flight, and the author names towns and roads repetitiously. Not content with his own overdescription, the narrator shifts midway to a description of his brother's flight from London. This shift did great damage to the novel, in my opinion, as it needlessly interrupted the flow of the story, a flow which was already greatly harmed by the author's endless orgies of overdescription.As the story draws toward a welcome conclusion, the narrator's personal travails again serve to draw the reader back into the story, but even this renewal of interest is hampered by the fact that the narrator has long ago removed any ounce of suspense by making statements that easily inform the reader that he survives and the Martians do not; he even all but explains how the end of the Martians will come. While the protagonist faces some harrowing situations throughout the story, the reader feels little tension or excitement about them because Wells has given away the ending early on. There is no climax, only a welcome relief that the long foreseen end of the story has finally come. The story's premise is wonderful, Wells' description of the Martians is unique and interesting, but the novel strikes me as a dud, defused by the author's own good intentions. Having read several other novels and a good number of short stories by the author, I greatly admire Wells and enjoy his writing. War of the Worlds, though, is largely, for want of a better word, boring. I would warn potential readers not to expect a thrilling ride such as that provided by the Orson Welles radio broadcast; in the novel, there is of course no such thing as radio yet, and news of the invasion and the resulting panic spread very slowly."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"This book was boring and depressing at the same time. A shallow plot that is supposed to bring fear but fails completely. This book might have been good when it first came out decades ago, but it fails to grab attention now. As a plus, it probably broke new ground in science fiction literature at the time, but this matters very little to me personally. I read this book as it was part of the Masterpieces of Science Fiction Collection from Easton Press, and I did not want to throw down $40-$50 on a title I did not enjoy or value thoroughly. Instead, for this genre, I recommend Orson Scott Card's &quot;Ender's Game&quot;, &quot;Dune&quot;, by Frank Herbert, &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;, by Heinlein, or &quot;Flowers for Algernon&quot;, by Daniel Keyes."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"I really liked this book."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"War of the Worlds by H.G Wells takes you back in the last few years of the nineteenth century, when an ordinary day goes from good to bad.

The aliens want the human race as their slaves, which could destroy human life for ever.H.G Wells takes you into a book of excitement and makes you want to continue reading it to the end.

I never really got one hundred percent into it. I would find myself thinking about alot of other things while I was reading. Once I even had to backtrack almost fifty pages because I couldn't remember a single thing that I had read in the past two or three hours. I had to really focus to be able to comprehend and remember what it was that I was actually reading.But anyway, enough about that and more about what the book was really about.The story is based in England, somewhere not to far away from London. These sort of capsule type of things come down and create big pits. They are supposed to have come from Mars. Since the gravity on Earth is almost three times what it is on Mars, it takes the martians quite a while to figure out how to get out of these pits. At first they seem very sluggish and weighed down.At some point in the story, the death machines come and destroy alot of things. They look like tripods. They are made of metal and can shoot a heatray that destroys anything that is in it's path, including humans.Of course, like all stories, this one has a happy ending.

Moreover, the alien in this movie were very different from some of old movie which I have ever seen before. That is, I was curious what's going on about the next content of the movie while I was sitting in the movie theater and gave me a breathless ride.In addition to the actor, Tom Cruse, who was a normal citizen in acity has a normal life and divorced with his wife for a couple of years. Also, he was not a hero that we have seen his movies before. On the other word, it was a new, hard challenge for him. However, he got a good job of the movie and show to us how human weak it is.In short, I really liked this film that gave me a big shock, and I would like to rate 9 point of the movie because the film made people to know the team spirit is very important for our environment of the earth. Anyway, even though some people rated a low score for this film, but I thought it was one of the best product in this season."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"I had to read this book over the summer for school. Since I love fantasy, I chose books that were fantasy or science fiction. I adored The Hobbit which was fantasy, but found The War of the Worlds to be too much science fiction for me. Even though it was a short book, I found myself constantly counting how many pages I had left to read. It was extremely boring. Normally I find reading fun and invigorating, but reading this book was like a chore. It had a good plot, but had too many events leading up to the climax and too many leading to the resolution."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"This book is over-rated, but does make you think...are we alone out here or what?"},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"Although many people found this book boring, I found it pretty exciting for a book written in the 1800's. I do have to admit that the beginning is slow, but people shouldn't judge a book after only starting it. Also the people who thought that it should be set in the U.S. should realize that this was written in the 1800's by an Englishman. What I found surprising about the book was how the machines were portrayed very realistically for a time without many of them.I found the explanations of the martians and their machines pretty realistic. And also the picture of the ruined world after the martian invasion was amazing. Definately a book for sci-fi fans only."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"I read War of the Worlds more than 20 years ago, and have seen it come back in many forms, including musically accompanied audio tapes. I never get tired of this timeless story. I was highly disappointed in the movie version, as I wanted to see Martian Fighting Machines that walked about on 3 legs (Perhaps George Lucas had this in mind when he created Imperial Walkers). I was more pleased then as now with the images that the book stirred in my mind. The narrative style, written by a Victorian-age author about a Victorian-age circumstance, is well worth reading. My only disappointment with the book is that the end was anticlimatic. It would have been more thrilling if Wells had said that the Martians had been weakened to the point that mankind could rally and finally expunge them. Still, it is a study in human arrogance, contrasted well with the valiant spirit of those who sacrificed themselves in fighting the Martians so that others could escape. All in all, a very moving book, and well worth your time."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"Okay folks, this is it. The very first alien invasion novel and it's 101 years old this year. That's right, over a century.Yet this is still a wonderful book to read. Sure, we know there aren't any real Martians. Put that aside. The straight forward Victorian narrative style is odd and strangely formal by today's standards. But that's part of what sets the scene.Here is a book that has all the basic elements of the genre - and Wells got them right the very first time. Better, in fact than most modern writers. There aren't any heroic moves we can make to save ourselves. There's no good-looking guy that defeats the Martians through cleverness and clean living. The Martians are centuries ahead of us technologically and we're going to lose. Period. Is that realistic enough for you?How about a writer that predicts tactical battlefield lasers, chemical weapons, armored mechanical fighting vehicles, interplanetary spaceflight and computer controlled robots up to ninety years ahead of reality. Pretty impressive stuff that STILL hasn't come to pass in some cases, even though we can understand such things now. Imagine someone who takes a horse-drawn carriage to town conceptualizing battlefield lasers. That's what Wells did when he wrote this novel.But most of all this book is there for its commentary on humanity - Victorian imperialism and lack of humility, the arrogance of invulnerability just waiting to be burst. Watch a cultured society crumble in the face of harsh reality. Watch us devolve into elemental things once more, as we learn what it means to be dominated as we have dominated other, less advanced cultures. Wells' book was meant as a commentary on English Imperialism and arrogance, but that lesson still has relevance today, whether you apply it to superpower politics or global environmentalism.Take the time for this book. It's worth it."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"This is the very best book I have ever read. Everyone should have to read this book. It is loaded with symbolism and the very primitive yet real sense of impending doom for a self-assured species.

So after seeing the movie (which did scare me half to death, btw), he dragged me to the nearest bookstore to get a copy of this book. The book did not scare me as much as the movie did ~~ but it's still incredibly scary especially when you consider that this book was written in 1898. Wow!While the movie deviates from the book in some things, it does a classic job of telling the book. The book is very descriptive of the machines that have taken over London and her suburbs. It is descriptives of the Martians and provides very vivid narrative of the fear of people running to save their lives. The narrator tells a wonderful story ~~ but it's not one to relish over a cup of tea. It's one story that you can just imagine people hovering over a campfire hearing the terrors of a world under attack from beings from another planet. It's a classic ghost story and what makes it so scary is, that it's plausible.This is a definite addition to my classics library ~~ and knowing my husband, this will be a book that he'll urge our sons to read someday. This is a book that has withstood the tests of time ~~ with vivid imagination and wonderful story-telling ~~ of people from the planet Mars.8-4-05"},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"H.G. Wells crafted his pioneering science fiction in a time when taxis were drawn by horse, indoor light came only from candles, and when far less was known by the general reader about astronomy and astrophysics. It was an era when the fiction of science and the fact of science were more easily interwoven. Even in our Speilberg-wise, video game era, when wars are intergalactic, as opposed to merely interplanetary, Wells' seminal work fascinates us, even if it doesn't chill us. In fact, the scientifically literate reader should be able to anticipate the defeat of the Martian invaders based on general knowledge and Wells' own foreshadowing."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"Not bad for 1892! A defining book, and in my top three faves. I first read this when I was twelve, and I have not been without a dog-eared copy since. The images it conjurs in the mind are terrifying, walking through the English countryside I often imagine those giant, pitiless war machines, striding over smashed artilery, burnt out houses, and men and horses suffocated by the unbeatable black smoke.I thought this book would be better received. I'm glad the book is not set in the US as although it is a great place to set a story in, we English need our own Apocalypse. The book is far from dull, and Well's narates it like a documentary, making you believe that it has actually happened. Do not hesitate, buy it. I cannot be sure that you will like it, but it is worth the risk for a book that could haunt your mind for the rest of your life. Uuulah!"},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"This is the original alien invasion classic. I love the way H. G. Wells writes. His style flows well and I found that I was able to become totally immersed in the story.

Well, there are times it is quite hard to know what the author is referring to just simply becuase of the century since the book was written (but this is when the definition function on the Kindle Fire really comes in handy!).

The text is clear; the reading experience is enjoyable; and the book is just plain good. I highly recommend this book for anyone who has not read War of the Worlds or wants to re-read it on a mobile device."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"Why is it that every movie/radio/TV adaptation of this story has been SO different from the original story? This story is so much more gripping, thrilling and horrifying than anything seen in any of those half-baked exploitations, I don't know why they bothered. There are scenes where the alien death machines systematically exterminate the populace of London that are truly horrifying, even sickening. There's another scene where a death machine fights a one-on-one duel with a naval destroyer that is as cool as anything you'll see in the CGI-painted fantasies on the screen. And the section that details the evacuation of London that rings so true, you can smell the dust and panic. For a 19th Century British author, Wells had a style that was more cinematic and moving than anything you'll see at the local multiplex nowadays. Forget what you think you know about &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;. Forget the adaptations, forget the Cliff's Notes, forget what your teachers tell you about it. Read the book as if you were watching a movie, a really great movie, and it will amaze you. Classics last for a reason."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"I just finished reading \\"The War of the Worlds\\" for a high school book report. I found it a very captivaing story, it is highly detailed. And although myself, as a teen, had to use the dictionary more than a few times, H.G.Wells chooses his words brilliantly.The most interesting aspect of this story is the point that H.G. Wells was not actually trying to tell the future. We was dipicting the present (or rather his present, the late 1890's). At that point there was a race to colonize Africa and in this story Wells is trying to show us the perspective of the Natives: Minding their own business and then a mess of higher intelligence with better technology invades their home. There is no spectacular war of technology at the end of the book because that's not the way it went down in Africa.Although a massive attack and triumphant victory in my opinion would have made for a more exciting ending, it was an awesome book nonetheless. I don't however recommend it for children. The language is very advanced and as you can see by a couple of the other reviews kid's prefer a bit more action in their sci-fi. To truly appreciate this book one needs to have some understanding of the era in which it was written. When you are able to compare it, even to modern life, it makes for a captiviating, thought-provoking story. Happy Reading."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"This book is the mother of all alien, evil empire, spiderman, extraterrestrial, science fiction stories and movies.H.G. Wells created a most credible and down to earth (no special effects) picture of an invasion of our world by evil extraterrestrial conquerors. The outcome of the fight is determined by a brilliant idea.Wells's story is mingled with horror elements (\`they took the fresh, living blood of other creatures, and injected it into their own veins') and scenes worth a H. Bosch (\`the windows in the white houses were like the eye sockets of skulls').His view of mankind is rather bleak: \`no proud dreams and no proud lusts. They just use to skedaddle of to work. And on Sundays - fear of the hereafter.'The second Estate (the clergy) is forcefully attacked with their \`stupid rigidity of mind'. \`We have sinned. There was poverty, sorrow; the poor were trodden in the dust, and I held my peace. I preached folly. Oppression of the poor and needy. The wine press of God.'This real and formidable classic is a must read for all those interested in world literature and science fiction."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"Im 16 years old and had to pick a book to read for an independent reading for my english class.

Despite being over 100 years old, this novel still packs a punch. In fact, I found that I like the novel version much better than the movies. The Martians seem somewhat more terrifying through the eyes of the 18th century, while at the same time seeming more realistic. For example, in the novel, the Martians are a little careless in the begining, and one of them is killed by a lucky artillary shot. However in more recent versions, the aliens are even impervious to nuclear attack. This takes the science of the Martians from advanced to super or almost magical. The novel does a much better job I think. H. G. Wells proves that science fiction doesn't have to be ephemeral--it can last despite the advances in science."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"What can you say about this? A total classic of sci-fi. It's a little difficult to read this these days, because everything in this book has inspired 100 cheap imitations. (See any movie used for MST, for example.)But the footnotes help show how this book fit into the times, and the sociological points Wells was making. I especially enjoyed the bit where they explained how the aliens really represent Wells' view of what humans may evolve to in the far future.The story inspired a lot of debate within a book club I joined. A couple things I found odd were: 1) What happens with the super-advanced aliens in the end. (Not too much spoiler here!) 2) The man who had all the great ideas for forming a resistance turned out to be a lazy drunkard. I couldn't take much uplifting from that. :-)I was disappointed with a couple of the footnotes. Specifically, 2 of the footnotes completely gave away the ending, halfway through the book. I felt that the reader could have been given some warning of this.Overall though, a very enjoyable read, for the sci-fi and the social commentary, and (mostly) good footnotes."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"What better way to launch into this modern adventure classic than with the aid and comfort of thirty Edward Gorey illustrations (including a sensational wrap-around full color cover)? I wanted to read this before the Steven Spielberg film opens at the end of June. This is the book that caused such a sensation when Orson Wells made a realistic radio broadcast of the story and scared the hell out of everyone who heard it. Its still a great read and Gorey turns it into something close to a graphic novel with his great illustrations. This New York Review Book edition gets my highest recommendation."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"In the beginning, an astronomer called Ogilvy spies a shooting star. Or what he thought was a shooting star! It was actually the first Martian invasion craft! The next day, Ogilvy tells the main character, Wells, about the \\"shooting star\\" and he and the townspeople go to find the Martians. That turns out to be a big mistake! Find out how the Martians are stopped."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"As I was reading this book, I found myself grateful that Wells thought to write about something all of us fear - invasion by an outside enemy that is unstoppable. We earthlings are all control freaks and can't stand for anything that threatens to take that away from us. We are also very vain and arrogant, enjoying our position at the end of our planet's food chain and assuming that God will never create a more advanced species than our own.But what makes Wells' novel so pleasing and unique is that he wrote this book before the onslaught of 20th century technology and before Hollywood came along and replaced his and others' thought-provoking masterpieces with garbage and then dressed it all up in flashy but unfulfilling special effects. If you have seen \\"Independence Day\\", you will see what I am talking about. Why is it always assumed that aliens would wait until we have jet fighters, nuclear warheads, a worldwide communications network and computer hackers to do battle with them? Did the Germans wait until Poland had a swarm of tank divisions and an air force before they invaded it? In Wells' novel, the Martians are smart enough to attack us when all we can do is fire 19th century cannonballs at them and hide in demolished houses like rats. No stupid one-liners from the latest Hollywood actor to jump from a sit-com with high ratings to the movies. Just real terror, real suffering. Something we can take seriously instead of just serving as an excuse for us to go to an air-conditioned movie theater on a hot July day. He offers us a glimpse of defeat, not some cheesy victory celebration that would be very unlikely should we be attacked by an enemy that is, after all, unbeatable. He knocks humanity off its mighty pedestal. No longer are rabbits, birds and fish the latest thing to be served for dinner. It is us who are rounded up and devoured. In Hollywood's version, the good guy always wins and mankind is once again reaffirmed as master of its own fate. But Wells didn't construct this tale to indulge our false sense of security. He knew full well that lurking out there are very real menaces. Whether the unrelenting force is an alien race from outer space, tiny viruses, the commies, or even our own apparent determination to destroy ourselves doesn't really matter.So read the book, which was written by a man fascinated by the dangers and uncertainties of tomorrow and was not distracted by big dollar signs and computer generated explosions."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"Upon completing this book, I was amazed that this was published when it was (1898?). I was expecting a sugar-coated portrayal of Martians invading England - &quot;Oh, I say, we're under attack!&quot;, or some such nonsense. What I got was a very enjoyable book that didn't pull any punches when depicting the chaos, destruction, and death that results from this invasion. His portrayal of the Martians and their technology beats anything that I've read in contemporary science fiction.The only problem I had with the book was Wells' narrative. The story provides far too much detail at points, giving exact times and locations for minor events which I'd think someone who survived a disaster would have a hard time recollecting. With the overwhelming number of locations for events presented to the reader, you'll need a map of the London area in order to stay on top of things.Additionally, Asimov's afterword is very insightful, and the cover by Roger Dean is great."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"It is typical H.G. Wells writing. I like the use of many adjectives that he uses. I had never read \\"The War of the Worlds\\" before, so it was time. So far it has been a good science fiction novel."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"I enjoy classic literature, particularly British titles published during the Victorian era. H.G. Wells was a visionary talent, years ahead of his own time in terms of technology and science as it applied to the everyman. War of the Worlds is a great story, truly suspenseful and entertaining. I know many readers today will call it slow or tedious and old-fashioned, but it's really not. It's smart and engaging. I think the story and the writing in particular hold up very well after almost 120 years.It's fun to encounter scientific ideas from previous generations. Obviously we know today that Mars is uninhabited, but there was a school of science in the late 1890's that believed in the possibility of life on the red planet, so this novel was a product of the then-current scientific and social climate. Newspapers routinely reported on the research of popular astronomers and their ideas about other-worldly life forms.Considering its period in history and the quality of the writing, as well as the subject matter (I love sci fi!), this is a classic. The free Kindle version is edited adequately, with no glaring mistakes. A strong 4-star reading experience."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"Was looking for a version a little shorter for my son to read, and other versions were too long, so he felt discouraged.

Have you ever read the book? The story takes place in and around London just before the turn of the century, the previous century, 1898. Wells goes into detailed account of middle class life in southern England, painting a vivid picture of the life and times of people in the real area, the towns of Woking and Surrey, where he lived and strolled through with his family.The best part of the story, the part that makes me think the most, is here is an invasion of beings from another planet who land in the suburbs of London and it takes over two days for the people of London to actually get confirmed information that their countrymen are being 'heat rayed' and slaughtered not 20 miles from their front door! No radio, no TV, no Twitter or Facebook or anything that people take for granted nowadays! Information travels by telegraph or you wait for the next train to drop off the paper, which usually came from London, where they don't know anything yet!The despair of the people as they watch their most modern weapons, no more than a flyspeck to the invaders, fall quickly to the Martians. Are they alone in this fight? Is there help coming? Is the world quickly coming to an end?

This book is superior to them, as most books are. What makes the book so much more interesting is that it is set at the end of the 19th Century,First of all, the Martians were vulnerable to the weapons of the time, and had to adjust their tactics and weapons in order to conquer. Secondly, communications were slower and only Britain seems to involved. Thirdly, the story focuses on the human element and, of course, the Martian invasion is both a strange and unbelievable event. The human adjustment as portrayed by H. G.

I was half thinking it'd be some outdated storyline from way back in the day, which would seem corny and cliched.How wrong was I! I should have known from the recent film that this would be a good book, but I thought maybe they'd used artistic licence. On the contrary, this book IS the inspiration for the film - it has so many elements and such depth that it transcends its time and comes almost as scary as it did in its day (we have Chuck Norris now... ;))In terms of the CD's, the case wasn't ideal, but the gloomy voice of Sean Barrett really chimes with the storyline & the story breathes with a certain ethos. And the best thing is that, at 6 CD's (6.5 hours) the recording is completely unabridged.Overall, I'd thoroughly recommend these CD to anyone seeking to 'cheat the classics' by the wonder of audio. This book is still inspiring due to its timeless characterisations, its plot & the thoughtful nature of its prose (e.g. the Artilleryman's rant).So, well worth it & if you like this one, then try Bill Bailey's audio rendition ofMoby Dick- it's equally Dark and Bleak, is not quite so clever, but still brings home the goods..."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"I just received the new Kindle as a gift and thought I would try it out by downloading \\"War of the Worlds.\\" How in the world have I missed this book for so many years.

The projectile lands near Woking, England. It is cylinder shaped. More cylinder shaped projectiles land and before long the place is covered with Martians in giant walking machines blasting away with ray guns.The book is really exciting and the story takes off quickly.

Well written, moves right along. After seeing the recent W of the W movie, bought this classic book."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"War of the Worlds is known as being the first science fiction book that talks about Martians invading Earth. This story has been told through just about every form of media including comic books, the silver screen, radio and of course this book. Controversy has surrounded this story, especially when it was told over the radio waves which caused hysteria back in 1938 - people thought Martians were really invading Earth! With this much of a history, this book is obviously a classic and recently I read it for the first time.War of the Worlds is told through the point of view of a narrator from Woking, Surrey in England. One day mysterious lights are seeing flashing around the planet Mars and soon after a mysterious meteor comes crashing to Earth near the narrators home. They discover that the meteor is really a large cylinder-like object which makes odd scratching noises and eventually opens up to reveal a horrifying octopus-like creature. Eventually the creature builds a large (100+ foot) tripod vehicle that has a very destructive heat gun. Soon more of these creatures come crashing down to Earth and without sympathy they begin to wipe out the human population. This story talks about the narrators experience through these events.This book was quite a fun read. Somehow I never heard this story before reading this book. I just knew it was a book about Martians invading Earth. Well's prose in this book is fantastic. I found his writing to be very visual and very easy to read. I wont give away the ending here but I will say this - there is only one book that has an excusable deus ex machina ending and that is War of the Worlds."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"Ultimately, Wells' seminal work is not about Martians and their vastly superior technology and intellect. Instead, War of the Worlds is about the blind, random triumph of mankind. It is not a story about the domination of aliens over humanity. Rather, it is a reminder of our own tenuous control over our world. Wells, in helping to set the stage for all alien narratives to come, establishes a precedent: in most subsequent stories, humans reach our own inevitable, if undeserved, victory over our enemies.Wells' use of the first person in his work forces the reader to occupy the role of the protagonist as he tells of his unlikely encounters with the Martians. We learn fairly early on that our narrator has been uniquely positioned to deliver an authoritative account of the invaders' occupation of Earth. From witnessing the first alien landing to following giant shiny machines as they make their destructive march on London, the narrator has a front-row seat on the action.Very often in the text, we find an analogy made: Martians are to humans as humans are to animals: \\"we men, the creatures who inhabit this earth, must be to them at least as alien and lowly as are the monkeys and lemurs to us.\\" Just as humans carelessly stop on ant hills and get their nutrition by devouring animals, so too do the aliens regard humans as inconsequential, expendable, yet necessary, resources. Humanity is asked, in no unclear terms, to consider the fragility of its domain. The narrator's brush with our unwelcome guests also comes with a brush with insanity. In the face of the apocalypse, humans do in fact often become basic animals. Lucky he who has another, even crazier, companion to keep his own head on straight.While War of the Worlds makes us acknowledge our inherent weaknesses, it also provides another example of our kind's tremendous good fortune. However we ended up on this Earth, whether through random chance or by an act of a higher being, so too do we end up \\"conquering\\" the Martians. The infinitely small lifeline that we hold onto endures."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"you either like it, or you don't... like most classics, the story's themes have been duplicated, so it reads like a cliche to the uninitiated... which kind of ruins the book for most"},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"I recently reread Wells's THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU and was struck by how dated and stilted it was. I had the opposite reaction rereading THE WAR OF THE WORLDS. It evokes a different time and place, but it nonetheless remains a riveting adventure story. It evokes the late Victorian Age (though it may be set in what Wells did not know would be the early Edwardian Age -- the action is in the early 20th century, though it is not clear if it is before or after 1903 when Victoria died) marvelously.In general you would not consider Wells a great prose stylist, but the first paragraph is as brilliant and as effective as just about any novel you can name. And while Wells is not strong on character, even the most cardboardish of the characters in the novel are used with great effectiveness, even if they aren't terrible convincing. The curate is a completely unbelievable character, but he is used in the way he needs to be used to enhance and further the mood and story.The Martians are described in a completely over-the-top manner, but their three-legged killing machines are absolutely unforgettable. The novel has been transformed into three memorable adaptations -- Orson Welles's famous radio version (our family mythology has it that my grandmother pulled my father out of Sunday evening worship when the show was on), the George Pal version from the early fifties, and the Steven Spielberg version from 2005. But all three of these were exceptionally loose adaptations. (The book was also incorporated in the second volume of Alan Moore's great THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN.) I would love to see a period adaptation of the novel, complete with three-legged behemoths and the ironclad Thunder Child ramming them in English Channel.People do not come out very well in the novel either against the Martians or against our ideals of human behavior. The Thunder Child aside, there is little heroism in the book. People are persistently presented as cowardly, selfish, aggressive, and ignoble. They are possessive and ungenerous, looking out only for themselves. Five years ago I might have found this unconvincing, but four years ago we witnessed the horrors of Katrina, when people behaved pretty much like they do in this novel. And we know because we have it caught on video.One thing that I can't quite get over is how original this novel was. The term \\"Science Fiction\\" comes from the 1930s while this novel was published in the 1890s. Along with Mary Shelley and Jules Verne, H. G. Wells is one of the parents of the genre. Before this novel there simply were no alien invasion stories. Wells made it up out of whole cloth and it was a brilliant achievement. The amazing thing is how many major contributions Wells made to the future genre: time travel in THE TIME MACHINE; alien invasion in THE WAR OF THE WORLDS; an original and deeply disturbing twist on the mad scientist story with both THE INVISIBLE MAN and THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU; an imagining of the future in THINGS TO COME and THE SLEEPER AWAKES; and space travel in FIRST MEN IN THE MOON."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"It is amazing to sit and read this novel which was published over 100 years ago. It is one of those books that does not seem to become outdated. Wells' work was far ahead of his time in my opinion. He writes with class, knowledge, and imagination. There is a reason that there have been so many film adaptions, series, and spin offs: it is that good.The introductions in this book are fairly straight forward, but they are interesting little reads by themselves, and they do offer some insight. There is also a map that shows you the path of the main character and his travels, which is a lovely addition. I remember reading this a while back and getting confused with all of the names and places.As for the novel itself, not much more can be said that has not been already said over the past 100 years. H.G. Wells has a wonderful writing style that mixes in vast amounts of his knowledge in science with some great passages (he can pull of the Gothic style with ease). He offers up some great science fiction, some horror, a few bits of humor, some thriller, even a bit of philosophy. It's all in there. And it reads just as well as any modern novel that came out this month. If you have not had the pleasure of reading this work, then I highly suggest you do."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"The story was very engrossing and descriptive. I don't recommend reading the scenes of him in the house spying into the pit before sleeping; pretty creepy... His ideas on science are very fascinating, even if some are dated. Him thinking the Martians telepathic (didn't know even if the word was that old, nevermind the idea!), in 1894, surprised me. The accurate info on Mars he gives is impressive, too, even if a lot is wrong The Martians are awful, in description, but seen as an allegory for imperialists, not too far off; the tale was an allegory of imperialism, and what it does to the locals... In its scenario, the story is quite believable, and it was nice that he did meet his wife again. his observations on the Martians, life on Mars in general, on their human victims, and on the post-war results are well thought out... Again, it's a fun read, but bear in mind it's from Victorian/Edwardian England..."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"H. G. Wells's The War of the Worlds is a great book for people who like science fiction. The book begins with puny-looking and repulsive Martian invaders, but quickly turns into a hopeless battle for the humans.

There are far too many books set here anyway. Give the author a break, if he wants to write something set in the country he knows something about, let him do that. He's been dead for quite a while here, and it would be sacrilege to &quot;update&quot; this book, and americanize it. It makes me sick to watch the entire US population think the rest of the world should be just like them. As for the person who said that he didn't like this book, and rarely read anything, well that's your problem. Of course you aren't going to be able to read a classic and understand it if you only read at a 1st grade level!

This book iis about an invasion i the nineteenth century.Three reasons I have that are good ones to read this book are: That this book started all invasion stories;second it has very good discription; and lastly it was rated four and one half stars Amazon readers. This story started all invasin stories. It started a televisoin series called the resurrection. &quot;Close Encounters and Independence Day were all movies that he might have started. If you like these movies you must read the book THE WAR OF THE WORLDS. This book earned four and a half stars. Peole say that the boo has not lost any of its impact scince it's first publication in 1898Can you imagin that this book is about 100 years old and still has not lost its effect.Then that must be some book. Even though this is a good book it does have some flaws. Some people say that the writing is poor. One person said that if you miss a word you are lost. Also many sentences begin with and or but. The drawing are mediocre. They are in black and white and they are hard to see what is in the pictures. Well I have to say that this book is probaly the best book I have ever read and that what the flaws are they are minor. Well now you have hear what I have to say abou this book.

For example, Poe's tales, some 150 years past their prime, are not particularly frightening to a public drenched in graphic portrayals. Instead, we read Poe to appreciate his keen sense of irony and his insight into the human psyche.Similarly, the works of H.G. Wells have aged a bit, too; technology has grown to overshadow his prose and decrease the entertainment level of his sf adventures. But does that mean nothing can be gained by reading, say, War of the Worlds?In addition to composing the seminal &quot;alien invasion&quot; story, Wells offers a subtext of social and political criticism targeted at Victorian England. The heedles Martian invasion is simply a mirror image of the arrogant imperialist expansion of Great Britain. Wells was simply describing what the vanquished natives of British-occupied territories experienced.So maybe War of the Worlds isn't the most exciting sf story. Read it anyway. You could learn something."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"I first bought this on audio cassette when I was about 13 years old and played it over and over.

And yet when those Martians leave their cylinders and march across the countryside, with their death ray and black smoke, it is terrifying, believable in details, and believable as an underlying vision of things to come. When we read this book now, we think two world wars and innumerable mass refugee situations (the scene of the brother's flight from London eastward is one of the best in the book)- none of which Wells' original readers could have had in their minds.

I have read it again many times since and still marvel at the superb descriptive narrative by Mr. Wells of a county in England (Surrey) that was &quot;ground zero&quot; for the Martian Invasion. A most important factor in the story is the Martian's ability to manufacture the raw materials to build their invasion machines here on Earth. They were, in effect, made from Aluminum - a metal that, before the 20th century, was considered more precious than gold because of the enormous cost of extracting it from the ore. This made the novel very prophetic, and even more so the description of the Martian's &quot;Heat Ray&quot; further advanced Mr. Well's technologial prophecy. Nowadays, we use both aluminum and lasers daily. The book's charm, with regard to the &quot;invasion&quot;, was described in detail by Herbert Wells of the evacuation of London and surround areas with nothing more technologically advanced than the railway to escape the advance of the invadsion force. I still find it hard to travel to Leatherhead by train without wondering how it would have been a century ago if it had really happened. A full 5 stars to the man who was a true visionary of technology. A MUST to read. Forget the 1950's movie of the same name. No comparison. Will anyone out there make a TRUE period movie of this event?! I hope so."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"I read it and loved it. It was brilliantly written, and was very tense.

It chronicles the invasion of Earth by the inhabitants of neighbouring Mars, from the point of view of the anonymous protagonist. Some of the ideas may seem somewhat inane upon reading the book presently, but bear in mind that it was written over a hundred years ago, where the concept of interaction with extra-terrestrial beings was thoroughly infantile.The book is seemingly written as a documentary with the hard-hitting authenticity of a late-night news bulletin as opposed to a fantastical yarn spattered with conspicuously impracticable fairytale imagery. This therefore creates a tangible sense of realism that causes the reader to wonder how they might have fared were they thrust into the same situation.Wells manages to keep the suspense mounting throughout, exploring the reaction of tense and fearful pre-WW1 humanity to the physical embodiment and culmination of their apprehensions, and the novel concludes in a way rather pleasingly unexpected, and that could almost serve to be the twisted moral of this paranoid parable.If you are looking for a book in which you can examine character developments and interactions, then The War Of The Worlds is at best inappropriate. However, it is a valuable contrivance insofar as instigating speculation as to mankind's position in the universe, and indeed the position of those civilizations and cultures traditionally or habitually thought of as subservient to one's own.The casual reader might have some difficulty with Wells' linguistic manner, and indeed may have only come across some of the vocabulary used through listening to MatronsApron, yet Wells still manages to explain events thoroughly and concisely.To conclude, then, The War Of The Worlds is a literary landmark that unquestionably invented the entire science fiction genre, and should appeal to fans of action, fans of adventure, fans of science fiction, and conspiracy theorists alike. With this book, H.G. Wells has proven to be a social commentator, sublime documentarian, sci-fi pioneer, and a splendid storyteller."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"This is a book way ahead of its time.

Wells which depicts a horrifying invasion of the Earth (and particularly the British Isles) by invading (and very slimy) hordes from Mars. Not only is this book an enjoyable sci-fi yarn but it also gives a different view of imperialism, namely from the view of the people being conquered. When the book was written, imperialism was at its zenith and an unquestioned fact of life. What Wells did was show the flip-side of imperialism and what it would have been like had the British (or any other colonial power) been on the receiving end of it. The martians represent the European colonial militaries that easily push aside ineffective native armies represented in the book by the British populace.For all sci-fi fans, this is a must-read."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"Wells wrote a great story that has been redone so many times now. It wasn't written in the 50's as many people might think. It was actually written in the 1890's. And Wells creates a story about Alien Invasion that is so scary and well put together. It has Martian's coming to corral the humans. And the humans at first have no way to beat them. They keep getting beat and it almost seems as if we are going to be killed at any moment only for the humans to come out on top. A great Victorian style novel that stands the test of time (a la Independence Day). Though this book is ten times better than Independence Day. A great sci-fi book that will forever be the blueprint for Alien Invasion novels or movies."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"The war of the Wolrds, written by H,G.

Reading the book, I felt as if I was with the narrator and with him through all the action. The story's plot is intricate and compelling with no pauses or dull moments. I rarely wanted to put the book down becuase I always wanted to know what would happen next. Many times, when the suspense was at its pinacle, I would have to sit at the edge of my seat. This is an amazing book written by a genius author. This is one of the greatest martian books of all time. I defenently recomend this to all who read this resoponse.

I believe that H.G Wells is saying a few thing in this book, one thing I think he is saying in this book is that the marsians atacking the human race is much like the human race invading the wildlife and habitat of animals. I think that he is also saying that the world should be prepared for anything and everything, especialy natural disasters. One other thing I believe he is saying is that god has total control over the world and he will do as he please.

What turns out to be a mere curiosity turns into a full-scale invasion. Told from the story of one man, who survived this whole ordeal, this story reveals the Martians, the attempts to subdue the Martians, and the reaction of the human species.What is most marvelous about this book is that it was written in 1898, but with only a few minor modifications, you could have said it was written in 2002. The language is suprisingly modern, the plot is still as interesting as ever, and the human aspects of this book still resonate today.What impressed me about this book is that the events unfold through the eyes of one man. We, the readers, uncover the mysteries and horrors of the aliens as he does. We get to see the large the curious onlookers, the scared masses, the insane lonely man, the giant tripod machines scrounging around looking to kill, and the battles between human and alien. We feel his terror and awe as any man would during that crisis. This book isn't a timepiece, it isn't a love story, it concentrates on action, mystery, and suspense.It's a classic tale that Hollywood and other writers have borrowed upon time and time again.

However, the absolutely unique point of view in this book is what sets it forth. This is not a history of the Martian War, and it is not filled with heroic derring-do. It is just one poor guy, an average Joe, whose name we never even find out, and the things he sees in the War. He is just trying to get by, just like anyone else would be. He isn't trying to be a hero, or even join the resistance, he just prays that his wife is somehow safe and that he will live another day. He sure doesn't know all the answers, and gives us only tantalizing views of the &quot;big picture.&quot; All we see is what he saw while running or hiding. And that is what makes this book so unique. It is a book about what anyone would do in such a situation - not Arnold Schwarzenegger or Mel Gibson, it is what you and me would be doing and seeing. Hollywood - make this movie from THAT viewpoint and you will have a sure winner. In fact, the movie &quot;Signs&quot; was made in that way, now that I think about it.

I do respect the fact that it helped create the science-fiction genre."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"This book wasn't as much a \\"page-turner \\" because it was exciting, but because you wanted to see if the main character was going to do what he was supposed to.When Earth is attacked by Martians, the unnamed main character leaves his wife stranded at a relative's house, and spends the rest of the story looking for her. Along the way, spending two weeks in a pit, fighting over whisky, and later playing cards with a man that wants to start the civilized world, again, by having everyone live in the pipes under London.I believe that \\"War of the Worlds\\" would make an excellent movie.....For Monty Python. This story was very lame. For the protagonist, when Earth is attacked by Martians, the worst case scenario is that they won't be able to play Cricket.This book is filled with unwanted details, i.e. a whole chapter on alien anatomy, and an obsession with alcohol, (Throughout the book the characters are drinking booze, looking for booze or fighting over booze.) and a very uninteresting storyline.There are no battles for freedom, making the human race seem like it has no dignity. But what was very unsettling for me was that throughout the book the author was dropping hints on how the Martians could be defeated, and the characters not noticing, instead the Martians are killed by disease. Oh, did I just give away the ending, I'm sorry! Oh well, I just saved you the trouble of reading the book."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"The War of the Worlds is a story about an alien invasion.

This book may be one of the first ever Science Fiction novels written, but first does not equal best. Especially in this case. Do yourself a favor and read something a little more current.

I am talking about the novel The War of the Worlds about an alien invasion from Mars. And it's boring! So very, very boring. Wells writes like a passionless, uncaring observer, so when the Martians start roasting us, who really cares? I sure don't.

I got the Kindle edition but i'm gonna post the review here since i'm reviewing the content. I'll try to keep this short. Unless you're attracted to this novel for some reason or you have to read it, i wouldn't recommend it for random reading. I might be too accustomed to a cinematic style, fast action, intriguing stuff, but there is simply too much description in this novel, not written in the most recent English :) I kind of feel disappointed that in such a huge sci-fi mythos it seems like sci-fi action was only a pretext in the originating book."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"Published in 1898 and set in and around turn of the century London, the story evokes the latest that was known at the time in astronomy, mechanics, and biology. Man had not yet flown and rockets were basically for fireworks. The story has been portrayed on radio, on the movie screen, and I believe even on television. Every telling requires some updating of the story so that modern audiences can get the effect of Wells' tale from more than a century ago.Mars was thought to have canals and that would imply a civilization. Suddenly there are huge artillery blasts. Gargantuan enough to be seen from earth. These blasts continue for several days and shortly afterward a cylinder crashes into suburban London. It is too hot to touch and nothing more is aroused than curiosity. Finally, the end of the cylinder is screwed off from the inside and exit and begin working on something unseen. The sounds of hammering and machinery tell the people something is being built, but what they do not suspect or understand. Then the craft arises and the heat ray begins laying waste to the people, buildings, and anything in their path.There are a couple things in the story that are different from most presentations. The creatures fire a canister of a black mist that seems to be a forerunner of the chemical agents of World War I. And the creatures are powerful, but not invulnerable. The people take a couple of them out along the way, but the creatures learn and become tougher in their attacks. More canisters arrive and more machines are built as the attack grows.The life of the citizens in late Victorian society is also so different that modern life that the details of the story are also often changed, but you can read these differences for yourself. They make for interesting reading as a window on the past. Remember, the story was quite modern when written. And the violence and destruction was quite hyper-real for its audience, but seems tame by modern standards. Have we gained or lost?Another fact that is often lost on modern audiences is that London was the capital of an empire that spanned the entire globe and controlled 40% of the world's land mass and a similar proportion of its population. The Martians were subjugated the greatest nation on earth as if they were, well, impotent natives out in the reaches of the British Empire. This aspect was not lost on its first audience.It is still a powerful story and reads better than most of the adaptations show. The narrator is always merely an observer and escapes with the most fortunate of circumstances, but the story lets us meet more people than we get in a movie, and all the adaptations have to leave holes where some of the problems that time has forced into the story because of modern advances make the story implausible.Still, the Martians end up the same way in every telling and for the same reasons. It is am important plot point, but knowing what we know now, probably quite faulty for an advanced civilization deciding to come and conquer Earth. Our own knowledge of bacteria and viruses would allow us to largely protect ourselves from such things as took the Martians and I doubt we would be so foolish as to enter another world so unprepared for this issue. But the people of the story were quite happy that the Martians were so foolish.Read this book and you will be able to better judge the adaptations."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"Beware: The War of the Worlds is nothing like the movie with Tom Cruise; it's better. It's interesting to look back at at life 100 years ago and see how they used the little technology they had to fight off the enemy. This book is entertaining if you can put yourself in the era that it was written. It's not easy to understand, however. There is a lot of old English."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"War of the Worlds by H. G. Wells was a good idea gone somewhat awry. Though the old English was part of the problem, the storyline became sort of monotonous in that it was always the same thing: the character would run, the Martians would happen to end up near him, and he would barely manage to escape alive. Though I found the ending to Wells' book well-thought-out, it did seem rather anticlimactic after witnessing the sheer power of the Martians. Although Wells' book is plot-driven, he does not really develop any of the characters in much detail at all. (It woould have helped if Wells had named the main character.) Altogether, Wells had a good thought when coming up with the book,the plan was, for the most part, lost in the writing."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"I personally thought this book was horrible. It was very boring and not once was I on the edge of my seat. I was never excited to keep on reading. The only thing that I liked about this book was how H.G. Wells described the Martians. I think he did a very good job at that but besides that the book needs a lot more action that will keep you on the edge of your seat wanting to know what happens next."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"I had to read it for IS AT practice and it was not good at all I chose the rating since it was boring"},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"I actually had to put this down, and start reading another because it became very dull, lacking in both suspense, and awful verbiage - granted it has to do with late 18th century English. However, after I picked it up again, I loved it (it probably has to do with the artilleryman who came later in the book, and whose text I hated). Very interesting read, and thank goodness none of the Tom Cruise bs, rather it is about a solitary man on his own to survive. Overall, very enjoyable and a fast read."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"The thing that really amazes me was that this book was written in 1898! We all pretty much already know the story from movies and the like but coming from the source, it's especially tantalizing and very well written.-Personally I'm trying to get caught up with reading the classics and this really does qualify as one.-In this modern world we often think of our selves as superior to generations past; this book exemplifies the fact that man has been very forward thinking for a very long time. Imagination coupled with the knowledge of the time can propel the creative to exhibit such fantastic conjurations that are still as valid today as they were then. In this case, 113 years ago!"},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"BAM went the heat ray as it was fired by the aliens. If you want to hear what happens next then go read War of the Worlds.War of the Worlds, by H. G. Wells, was written 110 years ago in 1898. It takes place in a small town in England. One day a mysterious black cylinder falls out of the sky. A couple days later the cylinder opens up and a cylinder is fired. Many people are killed but the main character just manages to escape. The aliens build up a ship thing and call for other cylinders to come. The aliens try to take over the town, then the world!I did not have a favorite part in War of the Worlds. I thought War of the Worlds was actually a pretty boring book because there was barely any good and exciting action at all. There was a lot of shooting, but all they shot at were the alien's ship things and the bullets just bounced off.H. G. Wells described almost everything way too much. For example: he uses 3 pages describing a dead horse and 2 pages describing fire.I thought the whole plot of War of the Worlds was good except for the beginning. For no reason at all a cylinder from Mars with Martians in it falls out of the sky.I do not recommend this book for people who like action. If you want a lot of action, I recommend the movie War of the Worlds starring Tom Cruise."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"This has to be one of the best books I have ever read.

I usually an read a book in 2-3 days, but this one didn't really get my attention, and it took me 5 days(Actually I was halfway through, and I gave up on it)to read it. I might have been reading a different version of it, but I'm pretty sure it was this book, because on this website I 'looked inside this book,' and it started out the same way. I personally think this book isn't as good as I thought it would be."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"H.G. Wells, is one of the first the introduce readers with the idea of aliens from mars taking over the earth, and triggered many writers later to write books involving martians. In the masterpiece, Wells introduces many ideas and masterfully blends them into his story.England is in trouble as cylinders of metal carrying martians constantly crash on the earth every 24 hours. Each cylinder carries a walking tripod, that has a heat beam attached, a beam that melts and burns anything it hits. As more aliens come, they bring gasses that can kill a human just when they inhale it.All seems lost for the main character as he tries to dodge martians, and return to leatherhead, where his wife has taken refuge. He is forced to hide from the martians byhimself, for almost everyone is dead.Hope of survival is almost noting for humans, when they find out the martians have developed flying machines, to promote their world wide destruction, but something happens to the martians......This is a great book and I am very pleased that I took the time the read it, even though some parts were very slow."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"Martians land in England and later pretty much everywhere on Earth. They find it rather easy to defeat its armies and proceed to establish total domination. Wells developed this original idea of an apocalyptic alien invasion in the last year of the 19th century. It would be copied endlessly in the 20th century. Orson Welles scared millions of Americans out of their wits with his 1938 radio adaptation of the story, except that his aliens landed on the East coast of the U.S. The Hollywood movie version differs significantly from the book.Wells deserves credit for originality, facility of expression, and subtle observations about human nature found in the book. The idea of the ultimate defeat of the Martians due to a virus to which they had no immunity was recently adapted for the computer age in the movie &quot;Independence Day.&quot; And the Martians' feeding method was adapted in the recent box office hit &quot;The Matrix.&quot; Read this book. It may feel a little dated in its description of technology, dress, and manners. But all the essentials of a truly good book are there."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"I don't know if 'carefully formatted by Timeless Classic Books' is the right thing to tell about this kindle version of this... nonetheless brilliant book. I don't speak english in my day-to-day life, so i can't really say if the text itself contained typos or grammatical mistakes. But i saw there was repetitive apparitions of the name of the author, or the title of the book here and there in the middle of a paragraph, and because of that i'm pretty sure it's not a 'Carefully formatted' text...Of the story itself, what can i say that was not already said by the first talented reviewers? A timeless classic, for sure, but seems dated sometimes. Perhaps a necessary reading for the scifi amateur, but don't expect to be amazed by this book. Beautifully written, in great part, and some memorable reflexions about mankind and the hope for life despite all the odds."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"I picked this book to be my first read on the Kindle, and I'm glad I did. \\"War of the Worlds\\" is a fun read -- H.G. Wells does a great job recounting this story from the perspective of someone caught in the fighting and strongly involved in the entire martian storyline. I especially enjoyed the historical aspect of the story -- it takes place in the late 1800s, and it's particularly interesting to hear the way that H.G. Wells describes various aspects of human life, and how he imagined the Martians to be, how they arrived, and how humans reacted to them. At the time of the story, humans hadn't invented/discovered winged-flight, automobiles were barely in existence, and many of the aspects of modern life were not present. Reading this 100 years later, it's fascinating to see how things progress in the story, and how the citizens react to various events, and utilize the technologies of their time. It's definitely a fun, interesting read.One note about reading on the Kindle -- it's fantastic. Something I never realized I would enjoy so much is the easy-access dictionary. For an older novel such as this, there are plenty of words that I'd never heard before. Having such convenient access to a dictionary meant I could look up words like navvies and omnibus."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"The War of the Worlds is more than a scary monster book, which some people who don't read science fiction may see it as. In fact, this is part of a broad foundation of the genre of science fiction as well as the father of sci-fi/horror. Though written in 1898, it is indeed filled with grisly descriptions of charred bodies lining in the English streets, dogs turned feral feeding upon their masters and rotting corpses. The people of southeast England find themselves \`leaderless, lawless, foodless, like sheep without a shepherd' once the Martian invasion begins to asphyxiate bucolic England.Though written in 1898, the narrator doesn't give the year of the invasion, though makes a number references to events, statistics and inventions which help us pin a year down. The current timeframe is one hundred years after the Lisbon earthquake, London is populated with six million citizens and the countryside is sparsely touched my automobiles yet still has a strong train line. From this data, we can estimate the time to around 1880-1900, which is different from many of today's sci-fi novels which typically take place ten or more years in the future. Wells' novel must have been hauntingly timely when it was penned.From Woking (just 23 miles southwest of central London) to the Tillingham coast in Essex (50 miles northeast of London), Wells takes the reader, even though as ignorant as we may be of 19th century English country life, through a detailed cartographic wandering across the land. From the initial discovery of the Martian cylinder in the narrator's town, to the horse and bicycle escapements to the adjacent villages all the way to the eventual tours of mayhem and destruction of downtown London. The personalized tour of the 19th century bucolic England is exotic and charming, even in the midst of an alien invasion!Needless to say, the English used is British English and dated, as well. Wells seemed to favor the word tumultuous and its root word tumult, which I don't come across very often in other novels. Reading this novel had me fetching my dictionary from time to time to reference Wells wide vocabulary. Sometimes his use of words is humorous to the modern reader. One example I giggled to myself for a number of minutes at the thought of Wells' words: \\"I grew very weary and irritable with the curate's perpetual ejaculations; I tired at the sight of his selfish despair.\\" On a more serious note, the passages of the narration are full of wonderful imagery, imagination and an uncanny ability to convey the sense of despair himself and his fellow countrymen are experiencing before, during and after the invasion.Not only is this the first \`alien invasion novel' but it's also the finest... which hasn't been more poetically written or enriched with detail in over 110 years. Wells' The War of the Worlds has withstood one century already and will continue to awe readers for the next dozens of generations."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"I have been planning on reading this book for over 10 years. I remember watching the movie when I was little (and then the remake a few years ago). First of all, this was far better than either of the movies.Written in first person from the account of a survivor of the attack (who is never named) and then recounting the tale of his brother, this is a very immediate and unsettling tale. What I did not expect was the time frame the book was written in. I assumed (for some idiotic reason) that it would take place in the twentieth century. Instead, for those of you who like myself, forgot the timeframe that Wells lived in, this book takes place in the nineteenth century. The Martian attack occurs prior to the weapons of warfare that we are so used to thinking about; there are no tanks, no planes with bombs. Hussars and artillery are their greatest defense. People couldn't hop in their cars and drive from the invaders; they were instead in horse drawn carriages, communicating the disaster via telegraph and daily papers. This put a whole new twist on the tale from what I was expecting.Our narrator lives only a few miles from where the first \\"ship\\" lands and we follow the town's initial curiosity and complete lack of fear as they peek into the hole in the ground created by the wreak. Even after the first \\"heat rays\\" are fired and people are killed, there is still no sense of fear. When the action comes, it comes quickly. Separated from his wife and family our unnamed narrator survives mainly through luck and the fact that he never stops moving. The entire story takes place in less than a month, from initial landing to total devastation. There is a lot of science involved, discussing the physiology of the aliens, speculation on their planet, and how they evolved. For the casual reader it's not too bad and doesn't bog down the story. For the rabid science hound, please remember when this book was written before you blast the scientific inconstancies and flat out scientific errors.I highly recommend reading this book, to just about anyone. It is a fast read, which manages to keep your attention from beginning to end. The political and social commentary though written for another time still holds value today. The religious implication is not jammed down your throat. This is a fun yet chilling read, which you will find yourself pondering over long after you have put the book away."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"Mars has long since sparked our imagination. For centuries, mankind has wondered whether this cold, dark, and barren planet has ever supported intelligent life. When an observer in the English conutryside, whose name is never mentioned, notices gas flumes coming from the surface of the alien world, he becomes intrigued, especially when, ten days later, a green star impacts a near-by farm. However, curiousity changes to terror,when a cylinder rises from above the wreckage and shoots out and invisble heat ray that kills everyone around but himself. Confused, bewildered, and overwhelmed, he grabs his wife and heads to the town of Leatherhead, where he leaves his wife behind to look back at the wreckage. Over the course of the novel, he discovers more and more about these machines of terror in secret. However, he learns that even the great English army is no match for these weapons, as the army is quickly devastated. The Martian cylinders continue to come and transform into menacing tripods that spray a poisonous black smoke, silencing England and eventually, London. However, when the main character walks through a deserted street, he notices that several Martians have died. With the death toll of one billion people, humanity had survived the invasion, thanks simple microbes, which were not present in the Martians' own environment. Thus, the Martians were brought to their demise when they first invaded. As the main character walks on, he sees his wife, alive, and a new life ahead. The War of the Worlds, by H.G. Wells, is an excellent science-fiction novel for its suspense, its action, and its revolutionary science-fiction.H.G. Wells wrote a great suspense novel when he wrote War of the Worlds. When the main character notices a shooting green star fall across the sky, he becomes curious. The reader is wondering what will happen next, until the alien machine lets out all fury on the crowd before it. The reader is then thrown into amazement as the machines of terror devastate the English countryside. When the machines arrive at a small port town, the masses trying to evacuate panic, the army tries to take them down, and so the war of the worlds begins.Action is also prominent in the War of the Worlds. When the tripods first impact the port town, there are mass sequences of explosions, in which the Royal Army does manage to shoot down one of the tripods. But the only problem is that there are several more left standing, advancing with great speed. The tripods shoot their heat rays into the water, causing it to be boiling-hot, literally frying the fleeing people who used the water as a refuge. The main character is almost crushed by one of the feet of the machine, and is almost boiled to death by the sheer heat of the water. This signifies how much action this novel contains.H.G. Wells revolutionizes the word \\"science-fiction\\" in writing the War of the Worlds. Written at the turn of the nineteenth century, Wells wrote of intelligent life on Mars, in fact, more intelligent than us. He imagines a cold Martian world that is getting colder and less inhabitable, which is why the Martians invade, to find a warm planet to thrive in. He invents the alien cylinders and the tripods, 100 feet tall weapons with tentacle-like arms and an invisible heat ray that turns anything to flames. H.G. Wells also created the Martians themselves, creatures crushed under the weight of Earth's gravity and creatures that have no resemblance to mankind what-so-ever.The War of the Worlds tells a story of the Martian invasion and an Englishman's attempt to survive in the process. It's best trait, however, is the fact that it has been a classic for nearly a century. Children, teens, and adults alike still find fascination in his works. The results are in the sales: his books have sold millions of copies. Besides this, the War of the Worlds, by H.G. Wells, is a an excellent science-fiction novel for its thrills, its climatic battles, and for its futuristic appeal. I rate this novel five stars out of five.A. Chappell"},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"The Dover edition of HG Wells's 'The War of the Worlds' is offered in an abridged version that worked well with my first grade boy. At 76 pages in big type, it's probably one-third the length of the original. Each of the seven chapters is a short bedtime reading, though with Wells's compelling prose we often pressed on to the next chapter. It is a good introduction to science fiction in general and this classic story in particular."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"H.G. Wells' WAR OF THE WORLDS is a wonderfully imagined science fiction novel. But it is also a biting commentary on its era and on the evils of British imperialism in the late Victorian era.Supposedly inspired by the British decimation of the South African Hottentot tribes, WAR OF THE WORLDS concerns intelligent, pitiless, technologically advanced Martians invading Great Britain and laying waste to humanity. Little more than giant bloodsucking brains, the Martians care not a whit for the natural world they have discovered, and they care even less for its denizens, except as a source of sustenance. Earthly culture is likewise eminently disposable. Wells rather intentionally puts one in mind of Jonathan Swift's earlier A MODEST PROPOSAL, which postulated that the young children of Ireland could make a fine food source for the British, and for the same satiric reasons.The narrator (essentially Wells himself) is a philosophical writer living in the comfortable West End village of Woking. He is intimately connected with the Martian invasion from day one and becomes a chronicler of it's inauspicious beginning, it's destructive high-water mark, and it's ignominious end. Although written in 1896, WAR OF THE WORLDS has a bizarrely twenty-first century feel to it. The pastoral and complacent environs of Woking become a perfect counterpoint to the chaotic fog of war, death, and indiscrimate destruction wreaked by the Martians, a prescient envisioning of The Great War, glimpsed in the middle distance of the future, and World War Two, dimly lying beyond.Wells imagines his Martians and their almost sapient war machines in exquisite detail, including the Martians' great flying machine. Martian technology literally suffocates humanity (the Black Smoke) and is so advanced that it renders humanity's technology obsolescent (\\"Bows and arrows against the lightning\\").Wells' commentators include his intellectual narrator who becomes a kind of British upper-middle-class Everyman, a rough-hewn artilleryman who envisions a pragmatic future under the Martian heel even while plotting the invaders' overthrow (yet significantly, he lacks the energy to do more than dream), the half-mad and unthinking Curate, who calls blindly upon God even while it is evident his faith has been shattered beyond restoration, and the narrator's brother, who fights manfully against the blind panic that has gripped humanity in its talons. Taken together, these four characters represent all the aspects of man.The downfall of the Martians, as most people know, is caused by insignificant microbes, \\"the humblest things on God's green earth\\" to which the Martians have no resistance. Substitute \\"natives\\" for \\"microbes,\\" and the ending presages the setting of the sun on the British Empire. The meek do inherit the Earth.WAR OF THE WORLDS moves along at a good clip. The writing is crisp though prolix in the fashion of the ninteenth century. There are a few disconnected sentences missed by the editor's blue pen, essentially nicks in the fine surface of this very fine story. While not as well written as THE TIME MACHINE, WAR OF THE WORLDS grips the imagination more powerfully. This slim book has been the direct inspiration for a number of films and TV shows and several recorded versions, including Orson Welles' famous 1938 Mercury Theatre production, which caused widespread panic in the northeastern United States. Archetypal, WAR OF THE WORLDS has also indirectly influenced virtually every alien invasion movie and show ever created, from ALIEN to ZARDOZ. WAR OF THE WORLDS all but singlehandedly created its genre."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"I think it was Brian Aldiss who said that Wells has practically every gift that a novelist can have. That is not something that becomes obsolete, whereas the state of scientific knowledge inevitably does. Just one short century ago, the atom was unsplittable (which is what 'atom' means), time was the universal constant that Newton thought it was, and the popular notion of raw power in action was represented by steam engines. If there really were, across the gulfs of space, \`minds that are to our minds as ours are to those of the beasts that perish', it would have taken a very brave as well as a very gifted novelist to envisage their technology. It's hardly surprising that Wells doesn't foresee that there was a science that utterly transcends chemistry and mechanics and comes to the very heart of creation with nuclear physics. What surprises me rather more is not that these advanced intelligences have either never invented a wheel or never seen a use for one, but that they seem to have fallen for something like the three-card trick in failing to identify the bacteria and viruses that would spell near-instant doom for their first expedition to the inner planets on which they hoped to set up a new home.Give or take such details, what The War of the Worlds is about is domination - domination of one species by another, of one race by another and of one class by another. I think it's possible to overstate the socialistic element in Wells's thinking. Wells is either pessimistic, or, if not precisely pessimistic, at least deeply apprehensive. In creating scenarios of a class-struggle Wells does not seem to me to resemble Marx in any important respect. Marx is not pessimistic for the very good and sufficient reason that he sees a solution, or what he takes for a solution, to the whole issue. Wells feels no such certainty or confidence, and he foresees possibilities that are not pretty in the least, from any political perspective, as his readers will recall from the Eloi and Morlocks in The Time Machine. That work at least was restricted within the confines of this one planet. In The War of the Worlds Wells lets his imagination go further afield. As I read the book, there is one real oddity in the plot. The Martians presumably intend to conquer the whole earth, but their first expeditionary force, consisting of only 10 vessels of which Wells accounts for 7, is restricted to a small corner of south-east England. The British empire at that time was of course extremely influential and important, but not in the kind of way that would have made the invaders' task easier just by setting up bases in Woking, Chobham and Shepperton. There might be some kind of symbolism in this, but my own suspicion is that Wells was playing to his audience, whose perceptions were in general as provincial as those of Mrs Elphinstone in the book, to whom the Martians were hardly if at all more alien or terrifying than the French.In general it's very easy, and probably rather pointless, to pick holes in the author's concept of his Martians. Their invasion was over almost before it had begun, and humanity had no opportunity, or were allowed no opportunity, to make contact with them. If the Martians were one-half as intelligent as the author lets on then they can hardly have perceived humanity as anything like the \`infusoria' viewed under a microscope that he talks about on that wonderful first page of the book. Wells himself says that there was no need to assume that the Martians were pitiless. They had come because they had to go somewhere as their own planet was dying under their feet or whatever they used for feet. Humanity itself is not notably considerate of other species when it wishes to expand its operations for far less urgent reasons, and Wells is something of an early environmentalist in making this point. Where he is much more on his own home ground (in every sense) is in his speculations as to how the race accustomed to being dominant might be liable to behave when itself under subjection. He puts the thoughts on this topic into the mouth of the artilleryman rather than expressing them himself, and I take this to indicate not (as has often been argued) that these were his own convictions but precisely that they were scenarios viewed in a murky crystal ball, uncertain and hazy but all the more deeply unpleasant for that.At another level The War of the Worlds can be read simply as a story, and what a storyteller Wells is! The picture of the pre-motor London home counties is as fresh and vivid as surely it can have ever been from the day it was first published. The sense of awe and strangeness about the alien interlopers is hardly equalled in the more recent fiction, far more aware and savvy technically than is that of Wells himself, which has poured out since his time. There is real, palpable, drama here, and a sense of pity as well as irony in the final fate of the Martian expedition, laid low by creatures as literally beneath their notice as that wonderful but hyperbolic first page asks us to believe that we may have seemed to the Martian civilisation in a more figurative sense. In its own way, one of the greatest novels there can ever have been."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"Today H.G. Wells is chiefly recalled by the general public as the author of three seminal science-fiction novels: THE TIME MACHINE, THE INVISIBLE MAN, and most famously THE WAR OF THE WORLDS. But these are only three of the more than one hundred books Wells published in his lifetime, and it is worth recalling that Wells himself was a socio-political and very didactic writer, a determined reformer with distinctly socialist leanings. And his point of view informs everything he wrote--including these three famous novels.In each case, Wells uses the trappings of science-fiction and popular literature to lure readers into what is essentially a moral lesson. THE TIME MACHINE is essentially a statement on the evils of the English class system. THE INVISIBLE MAN addresses the predicaments of the men and women to whom society turns a blind eye. And THE WAR OF THE WORLDS is a truly savage commentary on British imperialism and colonialism.This is not to say that it isn't science-fiction--for it most certainly is, and moreover it is science-fiction well grounded in the scientific thinking of its day: intelligent life on Mars was believed to be entirely possible, and Wells forecasts the machinery and weapons that would soon become all too real in World War I. Set in England about the beginning of the 20th Century, the story finds a strange meteor landing near the narrator's home--and from it emerge Martians, who promptly construct gigantic and powerful killing machines and set about wiping the human population of England off the face of the earth. The Martians and their machines are exceptionally well imagined, the story moves at a fast clip, and the writing is strong, concise, and powerful. And to say the book has had tremendous influence is an understatement: we have been deluged with tales of alien invaders (although not necessarily from Mars) ever since.But there is a great deal more going on here than just an entertaining story. Both the England and Europe of 1898 were imperialistic powers, beating less technologically advanced cultures into submission, colonizing them, and then draining them of their resources. With THE WAR OF THE WORLDS, Wells turns the tables, and imperialistic England finds itself facing the same sort of social, economic, and cultural extermination it has repeatedly visited on others.The upshot of the whole thing is that Wells ultimately paints the English habit of forced colonization as akin to an invasion by horrific blood-sucking monsters from outer space--and even goes so far as to suggest that if the present trend continues we ourselves may follow an evolutionary path that will bring us to the same level as the Martians: ugly, sluggish creatures that rely on machines and simply drain off what they need from others without any great concern for the consequences. If we find the idea of such creatures horrific, he warns, we'd best look to our own habits. For these monsters are more like us than we may first suppose.And this, really, is why the novel has survived even in the face of advancing scientific knowledge that renders the idea of an invasion from Mars more than a little foolish. THE WAR OF THE WORLDS is a mirror, and even more than a century later the Martians reflect our own nature to a truly uncomfortable degree. A memorable novel, and strongly recommended--at least to those who have the sense to understand the parable it offers.--GFT (Amazon.com Reviewer)--"},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"I though I knew this story. I had heard the radio show and seen the movie - so I was just planning to read a classic in the original words but wasn't expecting anything new or interesting in the content. I was very surprised. Setting this back in Victorian Times when it was originally written totally changes the story. The speed at which the disaster is communicated is different. The speed at which the participants can flee from the Martians is different. The tools that the humans can bring to bear against the Martian invaders is different. All of these things make the story surprisingly new. I really enjoyed it."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"Many people who have heard of &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; may have seen the movie without reading the book. The movie was set in Cold War America, with martians that flew in what looked like greenish manta rays. The book was set in Victorian England, and the martians looked like towering tripods. In both versions however the premise is the same: Earth invaded by a superior alien intelligence. HG Wells wrote about humanity's ego and complacency being crushed by a highly developed lifeform.&quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; has been interpreted as an allegory of imperialism. Just as the British took over other countries to make them part of the Empire, so too is the Earth being taken over by the Martians. They even bring their own plant life with them, the &quot;Red Weed&quot;. The Martians see us as vermin, trying to wipe us out with heat rays and poisonous black gas. Thats's what makes the story so much fun. It is frightening in a cosy sort of way. We read the story in a safe, comfortable room, while the narrator talks of all the death and destruction he sees.An interesting point that Issac Asimov once brought up was that if alien intelligence did exist, their advanced evolution would also mean they would be emotionally superior to us. They would not act like barbarians, as war is a primitive thing. When people write alien invasion stories, they are really saying something about us. We are destructive and aggressive by nature. Our history has been one long story of conquest, slavery and even genocide. So HG Wells has put a little bit of us into his Martians. Both metaphorically (as imperialists), and literally (as food)."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"Still Well's greatest literary achievement, it tells a story that's gripping, human, and powerful. Imitated a zillion different times in a zillion different ways, there's still something primal and evocative about this story.Probably the most impressive thing about it is that it reads like historical fiction written today, not science fiction written a hundred years ago -- to a modern reader, the heat rays and gas weapons of the Martians seem more \\"real\\" than the oddly bucolic Victorian setting that they shatter.The most interesting detail about this story, and one that many readers may miss (I certainly did until it was pointed out to me) is that Wells intended this work as a satire (not a funny satire, but a biting one) of British imperialism. The story was inspired by a conversation with his brother, discussing the eradication of the Tasmanian islanders by the British. His brother wondered what would happen if an alien race dropped from the sky and did the same to England; Wells wrote the book in response (and there is a brief mention of the Tasmanians in the novel)."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"Nearly fifty years ago the Looking Glass Library published an edition of HG Wells's WAR OF THE WORLDS with some very creepy black and white illustrations by Edward Gorey; for the first time, this edition has been re-issued by NYRB. It's hard to think of another artist who could have extracted the same bleak sense of horror out of Wells's 1898 novel as Gorey did: he beautifully captures the Martians's loathesomeness and their cruelty. Wells's novel always deserves another look--it is much more horrific than people tend to remember: his Martians casually fish for the humans in their giant tripod machines so as to suck their blood from them later. Its Anglocentric vision (the Martians only land around London, which for Wells is basically the whole of the world) shows the egocentrism of the most powerful nation on Earth at the Victorian fin de siecle, and the odd speech the man from Putney Hill makes to the novel's narrator late in the book exactly captures exactly what Wells believed might have to be done to combat the lassitude and decadence his overextended empire suffered from."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"As the percentage of the population that reads quality fiction declines, foundational literature like H.G. Wells The War of the Worlds is read less often. This is partly because whatever it has to offer is assumed to be easy enough to find in the movie - a regrettable error. In anticipation of the Speilberg/Cruise version, I recently returned to the book after more than thirty years, having read it first as an impressionable ten year old. What I found was much more than the story of a Martian invasion. The book resonates with profound observations about society and technology that are as far ahead of their time as the towering, metallic Martian invasion machines were to the horse and buggy world of Well's original setting.The movie and radio versions always want to update it, but this saps the power of the original novel. If it is terrifying to be invaded by a superior intelligence, it is all the more terrifying if the technological contrast between you and them is staggering, as Wells intended it. The power of Well's imagination is impressive when you consider that he was conceiving heat rays, enormous tentacle-endowed grappling machines and poisonous gas at a time before automobiles and airplanes appeared and when people still heated their homes with coal stoves.I can virtually guarantee you, Speilberg won't go there. Nobody today wants a movie about the late nineteenth century that doesn't involve lots of fancy costumes and an attractive young British woman deflecting the romantic attentions of some handsome hunk. Spielberg will update it.Interestingly, there is no romance in Well's book, and virtually no sentimentality, save a surrender to convention at the end which, by today's lights, will neither uplift nor terribly disappoint. Well's book is about something else. It's about one man's coming to terms with humanity, as much as he's coming to terms with the Martians. It's a theme worth exploring today.Some will argue that lots of science fiction is about humanity, but let's not lose sight of the fact that Well's was first. Along with Jules Vernes and a few other 19th Century pioneers he was inventing the genre. As is often the case with the foundational classics, from Mary Shelley's Frankenstein to Edgar Allen Poe's Murders at the Rue Morgue these newly forged nuggets of genre fiction may be considered quaint today, but their authors created the maps that every other writer followed, and what's revealed, if you care to read them, is that they are always about something else, the human experience, during the time they were written in, and for all time. They are universal, which explains their longevity. They are about the condition of being human, in profound ways, which popular movies almost never want to explore for fear of losing box office.Spielberg will give us a pseudo-family, thrown together by circumstance and menaced by something that wants to destroy them. Most popular American movies today are about the same thing. It's simple. It's why Fox News is so widely watched and why people vote for \\"moral values\\" with a picture in their minds not unlike the sanitized version of family that comes in the packaging for desk top frames. And it's why Spielberg's movie will make millions. But Wells is about something far more interesting morally - and far more complex.His main character contends with reckless fascination, suicidal skepticism, ugly greed, deadly self-interest, everyday meanness, as well as the cowardly smallness of theatrical religiosity and the self-absorbed laziness of loud-mouth intellectualism. Given the inadequacy of humans, the question arises, how can they possibly survive against their intellectually advanced foes? This is the true question of the book - which Spielberg is sure to brush aside in favor of lots of cool special effects and the pretty faces of the actors trying to save their \\"family\\".But Well's answer to the question is sheer genius. If you don't already know it, hold off on seeing the movie until you've read the book, because this is something Spielberg will include.Movies use art to generate commerce. Literature uses commerce to advance art. Two different purposes, two different results. Spielberg's movie will be great. I'm looking forward to it. But it's no substitute for the book. And if you're a Science Fiction fan and you've never read The War of the Worlds you owe it to yourself to see where it all came from, sans the Hollywoodization. It's all about being human, and that's something worth exploring deeply. And something worth fighting for, whether it be against Martians, or more human adversaries."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"Basically, it is a good, fast moving story. It keeps you glued to your chair both by its plot, but also by its writing. This is not fast food writing. This is not the kind of writing that you consume like french fries, enjoy and forget instantly. The prose is beautiful, every word seemingly chosen with care to build up a scene or create a mood. The quote that began this review is one example. Here is another to describe the collapse of the government and the end of law and order, \\"All organizations were losing coherency, losing shape and efficiency, guttering, softening, running at last in that swift liquefaction of the social body.\\"Right from the start, the reader is given a growing sense of danger, dread and horror. The narrator (who seems to be Wells, himself) describes the ancient, doomed civilization of Mars. It is doomed because Mars itself is a dying planet and the Martians must look elsewhere if they are to survive. They look to the earth and they have a technology so advanced and a moral sense so non-existent, that people do not exist for them except as a nuisance to be gotten rid of.Having given the reader that background information, Wells describes the landing of a mysterious object near the small English town where he is living happily with his wife. The object is regarded at first as a meteorite, then as a curiosity and then as an enigma as it slowly opens. No one sees it as dangerous until it lashes out with a deadly heat ray, killing people. (Clearly Wells anticipated the invention of the laser!) When these first deaths occur, the narrator hastily sends his wife to stay with relatives a few miles away, not anticipating any real danger, but just being sensibly cautious. He himself quite matter of factly returns home and is suddenly plunged into the midst of chaos and danger. The Martians are on the move. More and more of the strange objects are landing. The Martians ignore all efforts to communicate and contemptuously destroy all human efforts at attack or defense. The Martians begin a sweep of the countryside, slaughtering everyone in their path.So everyone expects that the moment the British army goes into action against the Martians, the Martians will be doomed. Instead, the Martians simply annihilate the British army. The highest technology known to man is slapped aside like the stinging of mosquitoes. That is all man is to the invader, a pesky insect. Or, as a soldier who is the sole survivor of his unit tells the narrator, their best efforts were: \\"It's bows and arrows against the lightning.\\" I doubt that we, reading it today, can fully grasp how shocking that must have sounded to the average Victorian reader.That was Well's intention -- to shock the reader. It's no accident that he used the simile of bows and arrows against the lightning. Great Britain (along with the other Western powers) had been able to conquer \\"savages\\" around the world because the British had the lightning (guns) and the \\"savages\\" had only bows and arrows. Out of those victories came a sense of moral superiority the concept that Western civilization was superior instead of admitting that it was only Western technology that was momentarily superior. Wells was a writer on social issues and he used science fiction to show what would happen if the British Empire came up against aliens who were as far beyond them as they were beyond the \\"savages\\" they had conquered and who treated them as they did the \\"savages.\\" In War of the Worlds, it is made very clear that the Martians really don't behave any worse towards humans than humans behave towards each other. In fact, he comments early in his story, \\"Before we judge of them (the Martians) too harshly, we must remember what ruthless and utter destruction our own species has wrought...Are we such Apostles of Mercy as to complain if the Martians warred in the same spirit?\\"Wells wanted his readers to think and feel what it means to be a conquered people who are conquered and destroyed not through lack of courage or effort but simply because the enemy's technology is superior. I have no idea how many readers of the day understood the message and learned humility from it. War of the Worlds began that popular part of science fiction that imagines invasions from outer space, the most recent being the blockbuster Independence Day. Here the message is, unfortunately, that even though alien technology is superior, humans are able to cleverly find a way to defeat the enemy. That makes for a good, exciting story, but it is not the message Wells was giving.War of the Worlds does have a happy ending. The aliens are defeated, but not by the cleverness and resourcefulness of man. Something else defeats them and saves the human race. The message of War of the Worlds then is as timely today as it was in 1898. Man is not the master of the earth, much less the universe. Man needs to learn to walk humbly upon the earth and value what he has before it all is lost."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"This is an edition to savor as Gorey's black and white illustrations really add to the creepiness and horror of the Martian invasion as only Gorey's illustrations could do.As Gorey points out in the intro, at the dawn of the 20th century, no one would have believed in an alien invasion of earth by a superior intelligence. So one thing that distinguishes the novel is Wells's ability to decribe a realistic human response to an unrealistic event.Some of that complacency is evident right from the start in the novel, as the humans are at first relunctant to admit the full extent of the danger, believing the authorities and the military have taken the necessary precautions and can contain any serious threats. This is despite the fact that several dozen people get incinerated by the heat ray in the initial attempt to communicate with the Martians.Then there is a creeping sense of dread at the fragmentary but disturbing news from the front, but still the humans don't fully comprehend or are willing to accept the situation. When they finally do, an all out panic ensues, the chaos, desperation, hopelessness, and enormity of which Wells spends much of the novel describing as town after town is abandoned as the Martians advance, and the countryside is filled with literally millions of starving, thirsty, exhausted, and injured people. Many people are killed in the panic and stampede, rather than by the Martians. As Wells says, it is the rout of civilization and the massacre of the human race.I had a few comments about the tripods and their weapons. In the book, the tripods have a heat ray with a rotating parabolic reflector to aim the beam, which is invisible since it is made up of heat waves. The second weapon is a missile containing a thick, heavy, oily, and poisonous black smoke and gas which hugs the ground and seeps into every nook and cranny, suffocating and poisoning anything that breathes it. The combination of the two weapons makes the tripods unbeatable and nothing can stop their deliberate and measured advance. The movies' versions are different obviously, but this is how it was in the original book.There is also very little actual description of the tripods, except that they are described as being about 100 feet tall, cylindrical in shape with a rotating cowl on top, presumably for aiming the heat ray. I don't recall the color, but the metal cylinders they arrive in are a strange whitish- yellow color. Here Wells does something interesting as he says the metal gives off four lines in the blue region of the spectrum, indicating that he was familiar with the science of mass spectometry, something most people would never have heard of.Also, contrary to the movie portrayals, there is only one Martian per tripod. Wells's view of the Martians is that they are mainly brains with vestigial bodies who occupy whatever machines they need to do their work.Some of the astronomy is obsolete but necessary for the plot; for example, the Martians have come here because their planet condensed before the earth from the original primordial nebula and Mars is therefore much older than the earth and is cooling and dying a slow death. But this isn't really true.One minor quip about the novel. One odd thing about Wells's account is that he is very fond of smoke and dust. There is dust and smoke everywhere, including green smoke, black smoke, and a ubiquitous fine, gray dust. London and its environs, it seems, are sort of like a Hoover vacuum bag turned inside-out. However, most of the time, one never sees the Martian tripods responsible for all of this smoke, except for one scene where the smoke carrying rockets are described. However, this is interesting in that Wells's description prefigures the phosgene gas weapons and attacks of WWI 17 years later.Also, he often speaks of artillery guns and batteries going off in the distance although one rarely gets to see them in action. Usually Wells just says they could be heard (and there was also smoke visible), but that's it.On a more positive note, his account of the Torpedo Ram boat, which brings down two of the Martian tripods that were wading in the harbor, is probably the most dramatic and interesting battle scene in the entire book. My sense is that Wells, being a former teacher, isn't that comfortable describing military actions and strategy and so the novel glosses over much of that.Another curious aspect of the novel is if I remember right, one never learns the name of the narrator of the story or of his medical student brother. But it seems clear that the writer, who admits to being \\"speculative philosopher\\" and writer on morals, is Wells himself.One final comment about the book. Although it's only about 200 pages long, few novels in the history of science fiction portray such a dire, dismal, hopeless, and pretty much depressing story throughout the entire novel as War of the Worlds does. In many ways, the sci-fi genre was a literature of optimism as it was still felt in the early years of the 20th century that science could solve all social problems and the future for humans and for society was bright. Wells's novel is almost unique in pointing out the risks of science and that the universe might be a bigger, more dangerous place than we had thought. Written at the end of the Gay Nineties, Wells's novel sounds an uncharacteristically cautious and sober note about mankind's possible future.But despite the overall downer theme and message, it's still one of the greatest classics of science fiction, and as the archetypal alien invasion novel it has probably never been surpassed."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"H.G. Wells' \\"The War of the Worlds\\" is a straightforward, tightly-written, and innovative little novel (barely 200 pages of actual author text in most editions) that helped define Science Fiction as a genre. It also inspired a slew of imitators and is the subject of countless adaptations (with no fewer than three film versions in 2005 alone) Its standard-setting plot of alien invasion and conquest continues to drive its diverse progeny in their many forms. Nevertheless, the basic story at the heart of this multimedia frenzy remains fresh, exciting, relevant, and (for the most part) has barely aged a day since its original publication in 1898.The 2005 Penguin Classics edition is a great way to experience Wells' original work first-hand. Between its elegantly designed covers, this edition includes two insightful -- and somewhat overlapping -- introductions from Patrick Parrinder and Brian Aldiss, generous annotations, and (most helpfully) a map with notes detailing the narrator's journey throughout the story. All of these features are immensely helpful to readers unfamiliar with the history of the novel, Wells, or the Victorian London portrayed in the story. Even long-time fans of the novel are likely to find some extra little detail that will broaden their appreciation for what Wells achieved with this early effort."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"When I last read the book, I was about twelve-years-old -- far too young to appreciate its various subtleties. It seemed just another science fiction novel, albeit one that was a little difficult for me to read at that tender age. Revisiting this as an adult is an eye-opening experience. Not only did I find more to enjoy in the story and the prose, but I caught a lot more of the metaphors and real-life parallels that H. G. Wells invoked.One of the really noticeable aspects of the novel (especially when compared to more modern science fiction writings) is how human it seems. Wells was apparently fascinated by the thought of how people and societies would react to an alien invasion. He shows us both the micro- and the macro-level. We see the panic on the collective mind of the general populous. We're shown the unreasoning hysteria present in a frightened mob. But Wells also makes the fear individual. Not only are we viewing the situation from the eyes of the narrator, but we're encountering particular people each reacting to the situation in different (yet entirely reasonable) ways. The false bravado, the total inability of the human mind of cope -- they're all presented here.Another thing that immediately struck me was the rich use of language. I've read so many books written in an overly simplistic \\"he said, she said\\" fashion that I really appreciated this. Some readers may find it tedious, but I found it very absorbing.In short, I really enjoyed reading this. It's not a particularly long novel, and I managed to put it to bed in a single afternoon sitting. THE WAR OF THE WORLDS had a profound message at its core, one that would be diminished through the following years by the many science fiction movies that ripped out the events without fully understanding the meaning. H. G. Wells was showing his 19th Century audience the dangers of British Imperialism. He wanted to show the effect that so-called liberations and enlightenments had on the indigenous populations. The lessons for the 21st Century are obvious. And for this reason, WAR is so much more than just the first sci-fi alien invasion story. While we still inhabit a world of war and conquerors, the message of WAR OF THE WORLDS will, unfortunately, be necessary."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"The illustrations contained in this edition are simply amazing. If you only buy one version of H. G. Wells' classic story, make it this one."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"All in all, H. G. Wells' The War of the Worlds is indeed a masterpiece of scientific fiction. While the chances of intelligent creatures living on Mars \\"are a million to one\\", as the character Ogilvy puts it in the book, Wells gives a very realistic and detailed account of a Martian invasion, if one were to occur. He describes how the Martians have difficulty walking on Earth, because the gravity is much stronger. He also discusses the fact that the Martians have difficulty breathing in Earth's atmosphere, because the atmosphere on Earth contains far more oxygen and far less argon than the Martian atmosphere. Biology also plays an important role, as the Martians never need to rest. The explanation for this is that the Martians have no extensive muscle system that requires rest, and so the Martians are able to work sleeplessly. Of course, there is also the famous role of bacteria in defeating the Martians, because there are supposedly no bacteria on Mars, and so the Martians are not immune to bacteria.Wells also provides a detailed look at the British military, and its brave but hopeless fight against the Martians. He accurately describes the pre-World War I British Army as being composed of hussars (cavalry), grenadiers, and artillerymen who operate cannons. The army is also mentioned as having the Maxim gun, an early machine gun. The Royal Navy is said to have ironclads, and the HMS Thunder Child, which battles the Martians at sea, is called a \\"torpedo ram\\". Wells describes how the British artillery batteries are positioned all over the countryside of southern England, and their firing madly at the Martian tripods. The Royal Navy's Channel Fleet is described as steaming all along the British coast, protecting ships full of refugees fleeing the Martian advance. It was nice of Wells to provide a sense of hope in the first half of the book by mentioning the destruction of some tripods by the British, unlike the recent movie, in which the tripods are equipped with energy shields and are therefore invincible.The only negative aspects of the book were that it used some old-fashioned language, which was a little hard to understand. Also, the names of many small, unfamiliar British towns are used in the book, so it can be hard to keep track of the geography. However, the story was excellent for the most part."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"First thing I have to say is what great scientific imagination for a book written in the late 1800's. I mean they didnt even have cars yet and Mr. Wells is writing about partical beams and biological warfare. 2nd is I was actually surprised at how much the recent movie used from the book. I didnt care for the movie as much as I did the original version but it was much more faithful to the book than I'd ever imagined. If you your a fan of either of the two movies or just want a very good sci fi book to read I highly recommend this book.

I was quite surprised to discover, that while the movie's main character couldn't be more different, the plot is almost identical in spirit. Spielberg didn't create all those different modes of suspense, he just channelled them from Wells. First we have the discovery, then the initial panic, then the mob mentality, then hydrophobic, claustrophobic, and xenophobic situations that are chilling. Granted all these circumstances are updated into the 21st century. I was impressed by how many details were included (the redweed particularly).The book is better than the movie in two aspects. First off, the scene in the cellar with the main character and curate. I've talked to a lot of people who felt that the execution of Tim Robbin's character in the movie was not just and unnecesary.

The main character, Wells, runs away from the Martians in the direction of his family while also trying to figure out why the Martians were there. Wells goes on many exciting adventures to get to his family.The book took place in London, England on the 13th of August 1894. Wells goes through many different cities while he travels 20 miles on foot towards his family in Leatherhead. Wells watched tons of people die from the Heat Ray and just getting crushed by the Martians in their robot.This book is really good if you like adventure or science fiction. I think this book is mainly for boys 8+. I recommend this book if you have the chance to read it."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"The story shows the martians as being monsters with no feelings for humans. They are stronger, smarter, and more aggressive. Humans are shown as weak and dumb. The author shows what happens to a crowd of humans under a lot of stress. They steal, run over each other, and help only themselves. Even the narrator cracks under pressure when he kills the curate. The overall tone is hopelessness eventhough hope is all man had. The martians destroy everything including man's hope. Even with man's small victories, the martians were winning the war. The end is very interesting. The narrator said it was the smallest living thing on Earth that had the power to kill off the martians. The martians had no plan to battle the bacteria. Man was just lucky to have won the war. The martians should have realized that Earth belongs to man and all living things on Earth."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"What can I say? It is a classic. I found a little trouble reading his descriptions because he has trouble describing things, but overall, it was still great. It reminds me of the modern day Dragons: Lexicon Triumvirate."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"Mankind's big question is answered in this extradornary story written by a spectacular author. Ogilvy the protagonist of the story is the brains to help stop the horrendous incident the world is feeling. Aleins!.......quick run!, the thought of that just rushes the adrenaline to someone. An extra-terrestrial spaceship crash lands on earth, Ogilvy saw the crash and was shocked about what he witnessed when the hatch of the spaceship opened. What came out of there was not human....... The author really knew how to catch someone's \\"heart\\" from not flying away. Other then that the book is a very good book. Really interesting points if you like science fiction. But then again he could of made it sound more realistic with the explosions and action going around the story."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"HG Wells captivates the mind with this one of a kind Martian attack thriller. the reason for the deah of the martians is suprising but upon further retrospection somewhat boring and mundane. Regardless, excellent weekend reading!"},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"Since this school year has started, I have been introducing my first- and third grade sons to the \\"Great Illustrated Classics\\" book series as a way to cultivate an interest in the classics for a change and some variety from the prevalent \\"Wimpy Kid\\"-style plethora of books that are around these days. They love the series with the condensed translations that are more grade-school friendly along with illustrations to capture their attention as they listen to me read or read it themselves.My third grader picked up this volume and couldn't put it down! He read the book in two days and thoroughly enjoyed \\"War of the Worlds\\". I continue to check-out these books at the school library periodically as well as pick up some of the hard back volumes for sale at bazaars. Great enrichment for elementary school readers!"},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"The War of the Worlds requires little introduction. Originally published in 1898, it is one of the taproot texts of the science fiction genre, the father of all the alien invasion stories that have come along since. It was written during H.G. Wells's most astonishingly inventive and prolific period (1895-1901) in which time he also created or explored the fields of genetic engineering (The Island of Doctor Moreau), time travel (The Time Machine and, arguably, When the Sleeper Wakes) and interplanetary exploration (The First Men in the Moon), arguably the most important, and certainly one of the most impressive, sustained period of creative enterprise in the history of the genre. It's also arguably Wells's most popular and influential novel, remade, re-envisaged and adapted for other mediums many times over the past century.The book is told mostly from the first-person viewpoint of an unnamed narrator, a philosophical writer who relates his tale matter-of-factly, possibly for a book or newspaper report (the narrator seems annoyed by other accounts of the war between the worlds and has apparently decided to set the record straight). He relates how a giant cylinder, fired from the surface of Mars, lands near his house and disgorges several alien war machines which move on three legs. The Martians are unrelentingly hostile, using a powerful 'heat ray' to destroy the military forces the British government deploys against them and harvesting humans for their blood. More cylinders and tripods arrive and southern England is overrun, sparking a massive exodus from London and the surrounding towns. The British army and navy attempt a counter-attack, managing to destroy several tripods with the use of artillery, explosives and warships, but the Martians resort to using gas warfare to clear areas ahead of their advance, ending organised resistance. In addition an alien weed takes root and begins overwhelming local wildlife and fauna.For a book with the title of The War of the Worlds, relatively little of the war is shown, especially after the first half (in which most of the military action is related second-hand by the narrator's brother, who is attempting to escape from London by boat to the continent). In the second half, the narrator tries to make his way to Leatherhead to rendezvous with his wife, but finds himself caught near the centre of Martian territory. He takes refuge initially with a clergyman who has been driven mad by the stress of the invasion, and later with an artilleryman who entertains visions of a worldwide resistance to the occupiers and using the Martians' own weapons against them, but is far too lazy to do any work towards this end himself.I tried to read The War of the Worlds as a youngster and didn't get very far, possibly because the novel didn't have the requisite number of explosions and laser blasts I'd been expecting (I was about seven or eight the first time I saw the impressive 1953 movie and had been expecting something more along those lines). Rereading the book now is a revelation: this is really impressive writing and feels as fresh and vibrant now as a hundred years ago. Wells is way ahead of his time here, with his depiction of interstellar travel (albeit by being fired through space by a giant cannon), gas warfare, the placing of civilians on the front lines and an early form of a laser, but on the human level he is pitiless in exposing the foibles of his characters. The narrator is a thinker who is often paralysed by fear in the face of the Martian threat, to the point where his observations are unreliable (one moment apparently suggesting the Martians attacked England as it's the heart of the greatest empire in the world, the next suggesting that the Martians see humans as ants and take no interest in how they are organised). The artilleryman has grandiose visions but lacks the ability to translate them into action, whilst the curator's inability to reconcile his faith that God will save mankind with the mass slaughter unleashed by the aliens drives him insane. Overall the theme of The War of the Worlds appears to be nihilistic: humanity can score minor victories but the technical gulf between them and the Martians is so vast that victory is an unrealistic prospect.The defeat of the Martians is something that has been criticised over the years for being anti-climatic, but in context it feels appropriate. At the time the science of microbiology and germs was relatively new and exciting, and the idea that the Martians (as a product of their sterile environment) might have no experience with germs and thus no defences against them is reasonable. It also highlights Wells's suggestion that the war between the two races is Darwinian: the Martians have superior intelligence and weapons but their lack of adaptation to the environment eventually destroys them. Not just humanity but the entire biosphere rejects them. Of course, this has been misinterpreted over the years, particularly in the 1953 film which ends with people gathering together in a church and praying for a miraculous deliverance and then being granted it. But Wells's take is more mundane: humanity has spent millions of years evolving and adapting to the biosphere to the point where it can survive and the Martians cannot, and nothing more than that.Criticisms are few. The book's focus is perhaps weakened a little by the lengthy pause in the narrator's story as we follow his brother's tale, but this also allows us a glimpse of the wider scope of the war (and, in the case of HMS Thunder Child's famous duel with two Martian tripods, gives humanity a rare victory), but that's about it.The War of the Worlds (*****) is a short, dark and haunting story of war, death and hopelessness, where victory only comes from sources outside of the control of the characters. Powerfully written and rich in atmosphere, it remains the finest novel of alien invasion ever published."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"I have seen a few movies made from this novel and have enjoyed them a lot. Now I read the book and am even more terrified. The book eclipses anything so far on film and is quite horrific. The funny thing about the book is the pace. It was written before a lot of modern conveniences and a time when people were more contemplative (perhaps). The characters described in this book were a little slower on the ball than I would hope we would be today. We are a lot more reactionary as a society (for good or bad) and those aliens would have had to be a lot more aggressive nowadays. A great read; I highly recommend."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"I am not a sci fi reader but I was making a point to read genres I would normally pass over. Afer reading this book I will clearly start browsing the Sci-fi section. This book was vividly written and full of emotion. I will definitely read another H.G. Wells book."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"my mind went wild when i read this masterpiece. my imagination went wild with visions that could never be showed on television. none of the movies could ever do right by the book. a great staple for all aspiring high school and college writers."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"This is no doubt the best science fiction book out there. If u like that genre, get it. Can't believe it's free."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"Yet another great story told by H.G. Wells. This time he writes about an alien invasion from the planet Mars. The story starts out as the main character tells about the night he saw faint bursts of light coming from Mars. He sees this all from his friend Ogilvy's observatory. Soon the first cylinder falls to Earth and the narrator and Ogilvy go to inspect it. As time goes on, and more and more people come to see the fallen cylinder the Martian tripod finally emerges. Eventually the Martian unleashes it's heat ray upon all of the citizens watching the cylinder. The narrator has been keeping his distance and watches the event unfold. The narrator soon finds himself on a journey over many miles trying to survive while he watches the Martians destroy everything, This short summary of the beginning is only one of the many exciting scenes in the book, another including an iron clad navy ship fighting one of the Martians seen from the narrator's brother's perspective.I agree with other reviewers when they say that this book was an exciting story with many great parts. Some reviews critical of the book state that the book was too descriptive. As much as I agree that some parts were a little too descriptive I believe that this was a for a good purpose. H.G. Wells gives the reader a very good picture in their mind about what the tripods look like and what the Martians themselves look like. H.G. Wells really wants the reader to feel like they were in the narrator's position and for me he did just that. I have also read the Time Machine (also written by H.G Wells) and it and other science fiction books written by him really show H.G. Wells's imagination. Today we have an idea of what we think alien technology is like because of many stories and movies about aliens. H.G. Wells really helped open a new world with his ideas of heat rays and large mechanical tripods. These ideas are all what we think of today and it is amazing that H.G. Wells had these ideas in the late 19th century.I read this book before I saw the 2005 movie and I'm glad I did. I was able to imagine the story by myself and not base my thoughts on the movie. I did not like that the movie's setting was not in the late 19th century as the book was. I did not like this because when I first read it I was wondering how the Martians would be defeated (I was hoping that it was a happy ending). With the movie setting being modern day and the technology being far more advanced than the 19th century, one may not wonder how the Martians would be defeated. So I believe that the book should be read before seeing the movie.I highly recommend this book to any reader and if the reader hasn't already heard the ending of the story, then I think that it will be a very surprising moment highlighting H.G. Wells's genius."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"First thing first - THE WAR OF THE WORLDS is what they used to call \\"a cracking good yarn\\". Wells knew that his readers were picking up his work primarily to take off on a fantastic adventure, and he did not disappoint, delineating a thrilling, chilling \\"scientific romance\\" with the skill of a born storyteller. Certainly the narrative won't pack quite the same punch to today's more jaded reader as it did in the late 19th century, but its power to haunt is still very much present; I doubt that there are many images in the history of fiction more nightmarish than a monstrous Martian tripod bearing down on a panicked mob of hapless humans.If WOTW stopped there, it would be remebered primarily as fodder for big-screen popcorn flicks, the text itself largely forgotten. As it is, the novel today is routinely hailed as a classic and has, rather incredibly, stayed continuously in print since it was first published 112(!) years ago. There are, I think, a couple of good reasons for this. First of all, unlike the majority of science fiction before, say, Ray Bradbury came along, Wells could actually write - he was a respectibly good prose stylist. This is demonstrated especially well in the opening and closing chapters of the novel and in the cutting humor of the narrator's rejoinders to the character known as \\"the curate,\\" a hysterical clergyman I found to be eerily reminiscent of contemporary televangelist/wackjob Pat Robertson (\\"Think of what earthquakes and floods, wars and volcanoes, have done before to men!\\", the narrator tells him, as the curate identifies the Martian invasion as the Apocalypse of the Lord; \\"Do you think God had exempted Weybridge? He is not an insurance agent.\\")The other reason I believe WOTW remains as relevant (if not moreso) today as it was the day it was published is this: WOTW was written at a time when the British Empire was wantonly using its military might to get what it wanted - sometimes (as Wells himself points out in the opening chapter) wiping out entire populations with apparent carelessness. With WOTW, Wells was attempting to illustrated to his (mostly British) readership how the shoe might feel on the other foot. How does this relate to us? Well, I doubt this is a popular point to make, and I'm sure I'll get more than a few \\"not helpful\\" votes for saying this (go ahead and click on the button if you feel you need to - it's right down there), but America has not made a lot of friends with its own foreign policy over the years, and we have experienced events that have (hopefully) given US pause and have (hopefully) made US see how the shoe feels on the other foot. I am not trying to justify the actions of either ourselves or our enemies here - personally, I find violence in almost any form repugnant and feel that it almost always creates more problems than it solves - I'm simply trying to suggest that a novel like this one may be helpful in bringing some important matters into perspective for the contemporary reader.In conclusion, let me simply say this is as excellent a novel for modern readers as it was for readers of the past, and one that set the bar very high indeed for those who would follow in Wells' footsteps."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"The narration of this audiobook is properly paced and packed with enough emotion to keep it interesting, while not overbearing. The story is the classic H.G. Wells story of the martian attack. The understated power of the story dwarfs much of the over-the-top Science Fiction fare of today. The environmental message is also significant."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"A quick arrival, high quality buy, fantastic buy, would recommend to anyone.

As in most of his books H.G. Wells he somehow knows about technology and theory100 years in advance. After reading any of his books you want to believe his time machine really worked and he would just pop into the 1970's and 80's for a new story line.

I wish the younger generations would read his works instead of playing video games."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"After seeing the original movie in the 50's and the remake a few years ago, I was woundering how close they followed the book. They didn't follow the book as much as I thought they would and I was pleased. Reading the book was a whole new experience. Reading H.G. Wells own words I was able to see what a brilliant writer he was and how much his mind was asking us &#34;What If?&#34;"},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"The War of the Worldsis notable and significant on many levels; not only in its introduction of intelligent and malevolent aliens, bent on conquest for unknowable ends (which Wells based on reports of English invasions of aboriginal regions for resource control); but in its point of view of the \\"regular Joe,\\" the man who is not part of the elite, not pressed into trying to attack a superior foe, but whose only concern is to get the heck out of harm's way.We are therefore presented with a story that forces us to guess what might be happening elsewhere, as the only thing we know for sure is what is happening to our helpless central character... and considering the horrors he witnesses, we can only assume the worst for humanity outside of his relatively small sphere of influence.In this way, I admit to being one of those who preferred the 2006 movie adaptation of WotW, as it was much closer to the spirit of the original novel, and did not try to turn the central character into a Rambo that would somehow, single-handedly, save the world from invasion.The story follows along with the main character as he relates his experiences under the relentless Martian onslaught, and the reader becomes a fellow refugee, left wondering how any of it could possibly end well. As a result, the final resolution has that much more power and significance... while at the same time, leaving the ultimate question open-ended: Could this all happen again? It makes the individual feel somewhat smaller in the universe, less sure of his dominance in nature.In fact, this was one of the very first novels that made us look to the sky, and fear what we might meet up there. It has, therefore, been largely responsible for generations of alien invasion scenarios and more evil alien monsters than we can count. It is perhaps best-known for this, which is a shame; for the revelation of man's place in the universe would've been a much better message to lodge in the world's psyche. Perhaps, given time, Mankind will figure out what was really important about this story, and finally take that message to heart."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"This is one of those books you can read more than once. Myself, I've read this several times over my life and it always fascinates. Imagine a time when the 19th century is coming to a close, and then try to imagine what it would have been like to read something like this during that time. I know that many people like to point out the political subtexts included within the book's plot, but I never cared too much about that. I was always interested solely in the fantastic story. It never gets old."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"Grabbing War of the Worlds was just me adding a classic title to read to my collective of classics. I had seen the original movie a bunch of times and the newest Spielberg movie. But when I settled in to read the original, I was pleasantly surprised.Hollywood has taken liberties with the book that despite having seen the movies, they don't take away from the novel by H.G. Wells.There's enough untapped material in the novel to make it rather fresh and interesting and it was a surprisingly good and fun read.In other words, if you liked the movies I think you'll love the original story they were spawned off of and you probably won't find yourself spoiled by much.-Bruce Simmons (BruSimm)"},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"I realized the other day, that I could not truly call myself a Sci-Fi fan nor writer for one very specific reason: I had never read The War of the Worlds by HG Wells, a staple of the Sci-Fi community. Thankfully, I was able to solve this quickly, as I had found the book for twenty five cents at a rummage sale.Considering it to have originally be written over one hundred years ago in 1898, I will admit that I expected to be bored. And, to be fair, some parts of the book did seem to be long and drawn out. The first two chapters especially suffered from an information dump in the exposition, and really had me dragging my feet in order to finish the book. However, once the Martians landed, the pace did indeed pick up and I rapidly read through the book in the course of an afternoon outside.It is written in a journalistic style, which really lends itself to the credibility of the tale. I can understand now why people thought Mars truly was attacking during the Audio Drama of it in 1938. My only complaint is that the first part of the book-The Coming of the Martians-also told the story of his brother and two women who were trying to escape the attacks by fleeing off the coast of England. How would the narrator ever learn of this, especially since the ending of this section made it seem as though his brother died, never to be heard from again. This question, on if the brother is alive or not, is a sticking point with me even after finishing the book a few weeks ago.While unremarkable in this day and age, it was completely revolutionary in its time, especially due to the fact that it included space travel, evolution, the threat of bacteria, as well as blood transfusions as a form of survival. These ideas might seem commonplace now, but in 1898, the thought of leaving Earth was something that was only dreamed about.This book is said to have inspired Robert H. Goddard to his career choice of inventing rockets, rockets that eventually brought the Apollo project to the moon. Far-reaching results indeed.Numerous audio dramas, film adaptations, and even a few comic books shows have come from this book that, in 1898 was said to be too brutal for the average reader.While not the best book out there, it is one that I feel should be on every person's reading list as a Book that Shaped Our World.Five out of five stars for the lasting impression it has left, though only four out of five for the actual book itself."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"This is but one of the Classics Illustrated comics I read as a child, but it was the most memorable to me.

I love how as you read on, you learn more about the martians. However, Wells gave names to almost none of the characters. mot even the person telling the story, but it is still greatly written."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"We've all seen Hollywood versions of alien attacks. We've watched stories about space and time travel, genetic testing and mutation, and invisibility. So much of our modern storytelling owes a debt to H.G. Wells, a late 1800s British author caught in an era of intense struggle between science, faith, and ethics.\\"The War of the Worlds\\" is one of his best books, a heart-pounding, yet intensely human look at such topics. Through the eyes of our first-person narrator, we watch the arrival of the first cylinder as it arrives from Mars like a falling star. More such \\"stars\\" arrive. The calm English countryside, where steam-powered trains roar by in the night, where gas lanterns twinkle, is suddenly turned upside down by the emergence of a metallic and extra-terrestial object that is armed with the Heat-Ray. Humans are destroyed where they stand. Landscape is scorched. It's all written with great imagination--even more amazing, considering that Wells was laying the foundation for such images for centuries to come.What makes this book work, though, what gives it power and timelessness, is Wells' ability to capture the slow acceptance of the general populace that turns to sudden panic. He gives the entire, terrible ordeal the feel of reality, of something happening in the next neighborhood over. In less than 200 pages, he takes idyllic England and turns it on its head, forming an apocalyptic setting that is horrible, believable, and full of warnings. There are themes here related to the environment, to human connection, to the struggle between dreamers and doers. And yes, even in his character's frustration with a man of the cloth, Wells gives us brushes with faith.It's no wonder this book is a classic. It's immensely readable and timelessly important."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"H.G. Wells is truly a classic of science fiction and literature that is worth revisiting every few years.

This book is about Martians that attack Earth in an invasion. They mainly target London, England and surrounding cities in their raid. Earth's air solved the Martian problem about two years after the first alien appeared. The air killed the Martians because they simply breathed it.The main character of this story is George Wells. He is a wealthy man who dresses in tuxedoes and fancy clothing. He has a split personality of a friendly and rough person. We are alike in two ways: my sister invades my room like the aliens invade his city, and we are both boys. We are also different in two ways: he is a full-grown man and I am a kid. Another difference is I have not been in a book.My opinion of this book is a positive one to say the least. This is an enjoyable story because it talks about whether or not aliens are real. My favorite part is when a Martian destroyer falls into a river. I would recommend this book for a friend."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"I am writing this report about the War of the World, by H.G. Wells. This book had everything it needed to be one of my favorite books of all time. It had an original plot-line (when the book was written) about aliens invading earth. The book also had a good character, namely the main character, who was a journalist. He was smart, had a will and the luck to survive, and was a very learned man. In the book I saw a global alliance, with the whole world united for the first time to fight off the alien tide. Britain was all but taken over, but four aliens died, which proved that the extra-terrestrials were not invulnerable. I pictured an epic story, with huge battles of man versus alien, the humans against manufactured machines. The aliens had flying machines, but the humans could have found a way to fight that. But in the end the aliens would win, through force of technology.Then the artilleryman came into the picture. He thought he knew everything about what would happen to the world. After the aliens took over, (which in his mind was inevitable) the world would split into three types of people. One type would be the weak people of the world, who would give in to the aliens. They would live in cages and be used as livestock. The second kind would be fighters, using guerilla tactics. They would be inevitably killed. The third kind that the artilleryman was proposing to start, would live a free, independent life from the aliens. They would live in the sewers, slowly learning the aliens' ways. Finally they could rise up and defeat the invaders. At this part in the story, (while the main character was talking to the artilleryman) I was shivering with anticipation. Think about it: underground, hiding, keeping human traditions alive, and finally, one glorious day, rising up and defeating the invaders! Just then, reality set in. There were only five more pages left in the book.I did not like this book because of the way in which it ended. I was not satisfied as a reader when the author just ended the book when it was becoming interesting. I think the ending ruined my enjoyment of the book as a whole because a lot of my pleasure in reading it was the anticipation, suspense, and looking to the future. I would recommend this to anyone who likes a good, short, story, and doesn't like to read long books. I would not recommend it to anyone who prefers long, complicated story-lines and is not satisfied with a 100 page book that should have been 500 pages long. On the whole, I disliked this book because of how the author let me down by not following through with the plot."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"This book had a good story to it but it might have been better if they centered it in one of the major cities in the United States. And also if the president of the United States was invoved in it. They should have done it something like 1997 number one movie of the summer '' INDEPEDANCE DAY''."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"Have you ever watched an old 1960's sci-fi movie with spaceships held up by strings and lame costumes? Well this is the book version. Granted, for it's time, I'm sure it was phenomenal. But to read it today is like watching some old claymation dinosaur movie.I loved Wells' &quot;The invisible man&quot;, &quot;The Time Machine&quot; and &quot;The Island of Dr. Moreau.&quot; Great books even today. But War of the Worlds just wasn't that good--I recommend reading the others. I gave it 3 stars just for it's classic value--it really was the beginning of books like that so I've got to give him credit."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"The War of the Worlds is a science fiction novel and I didn't think it was very interesting. It is about a couple in London, England in the late 1900's. This couple was always interested in the stars and the sky, so when they saw red beams of light they got suspicious. So when people said that a flying suacer had crashed they were not suprised. The Martians started to invade the Earth as soon as the saucer landed. During the fighting this couple got split up. The main conflict is that he tries to fing his wife. I didn't like this book very much because there was not much action. The story would have been better if it was more exciting. I would recommend this book to 14 year olds and over, but more to kids who like science fiction."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"The War of the Worlds Review from Jacob BratzI recommend The War of the Worlds, because it's a classic. It's a classic because so many people read the book. It is suspenseful because in the book the spacecraft is in the ground, and it makes you wonder if the aliens are going to invade or not. The book is also realistic because it made people believe it was actually happening.A theme of the book is terror because the aliens are so mean. They're mean because they start killing people and exterminating the population. The aliens have the biggest effect on the theme of the book. Without the aliens, this book and its author wouldn't be famous. I forgot to tell you this book is famous.A theme is good for this book, but a good book needs some good characters. The main character is good because he has the story revolving around him. This story is told through the eyes of this character. The way you see events is determined by two things: the author and the main character.The setting is the 20th century. The spot where they crash landed is in a wide-open field. Then the humans fired cannons to fight against the enemy but nothing worked. Afterwards the aliens started their rampage. They began with a man with out fear. Being vaporized killed him, but some people got away.I'd recommend this book to people who like classic science fiction books. The setting is described in great detail. Part of this book is true. Who do you think is going to win The War of the Worlds? If you want to learn more, then read The War of the Worlds."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"I was very dissapointed after reading the book, \\"The War of the Worlds,\\" and found that it did not meet my expectations considering all the publicity (other people's reviews). A lot of chapters were very repitive if the fact that half of the time the book just talked about him wandering around. In addition there were too many references to Old English towns that made the book extremely confusing. Also I couldn't tell if the main character's brother survived or where he went. I was also displeased by the fact that the main character was merely an observer to the martian's defeat and the fact that his only real accomplishment was just surviving and didn't do anything to stop the martians."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"I read War of the Worlds for my senior english class. This book was pretty much straight forward. There were no character names in this book. It had a basic storyline and focused on it in the enitre book. This is a decent book to read if your into science fiction. I personally did not like the book, however it was very well written . I thought it had a terrible ending but you will have to read it to find out for yourself."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"Since Jules Verne and Orson Welles literally started sci-fi, any true sci-fi fan will read this book. The plot involves space invaders threatening humankind, which alone was revolutionary in Mr. Welles's day, but it's prophecy and its parrallels with history made it a classic. The attitudes and the fate of the Martians are incredibly similar to the attitudes and frustrations of the European nations to the territories that they controlled in the past. Besides being set from an Englander's viewpoint, Welles must have also focused on this nation because they were such a widespread world power who sapped the strengh and freedom from their own empire. In other words, it was a role reversal. Welles' explanation for the physical characteristics and selfish actions of the Martians is made in relation to prophesies for mankind's future. That was the most interesting part for me, but you'll have to read it to find out why!Again, if you don't care for philosophy or history but like sci-fi this novel is still a fun read, so please do!"},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"I think that the movie \\"War of the Worlds\\" the new one was not base on the book. Even though the movie was really tense and had some awesome graphics. It had almost nothing to do with the story, I mean I would like the movie to start off with the beginning of the story where they look at a meteor and do not now that they are under attack. And even when they fired at earth, they acted like nothing happen. But the part when the cylinder space ship landed and every one looked and just stood around and, BAAM! The ship just came out of the ground with all the green smoke and starter vaporizing everyone, and the book even explains how the beams of light work. Like super hot rays of light that could turn steel into butter. Everything is so detailed and ever though the book is fiction we might used these ideas for modern plans and how the aliens looked with big eyes and no chin; with pail gray skin. I recommend this book to any one, but don't be surprise if it does not run with the movie. But don't take it from me read it your self..."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"Excellent classic from the past. I loved reading it again as much as the first time.

The imagination of Wells is truly astonishing, and while some of his vision is clearly the product of his time, he does show flashes of the future that resonate to this day"},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"I am not a sci-fi geek by any stretch. While I enjoy the occasional flick on TV or at the movie theater, I tend to avoid the genre in books because of the fear of getting bogged down by jargon and details.I was determined, however, to at least try The War Of The Worlds by H.G. Wells so I could draw my own conclusions about the Tom Cruise movie remake without the hype. Boy, was I pleasantly and wonderfully surprised. I finished the book in less than a day. It was gripping from the very first word. I found myself totally immersed in the world that Wells created for this fantastic novel. He did not tie the reader down in his descriptions of the landscape, the culprits of invasion, and the protagonist's journey. I had vivid pictures in my mind as I devoured each sentence. When I reached the end of the book, I found myself wishing I had never watched the Tom Cruise movie.This book is definitely a keeper, and I intend to read it again in the near future."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"Not only was this story as good as I remember as a child, but the quality of the paper an print images was great.

The writing is gripping and pulls you in just as if it was happening in current times. Well worth the read!"},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"I've listened to the radio drama. I've seen a couple of movie/tv versions. But I'd never read the book. I've read a little bit of Wells but have never gotten around to this one. My son saw it on our shelf and wanted to know if he could read it so I decided to preview it for him first to be sure. After finishing it, I told him he could read it. He hasn't started it yet, but I'm curious to see what he thinks.The writing style is definitely late 19th-century. There's a lot of the \\"high\\" language style present in a lot of other 1800s literature. It's a very descriptive and thoughtful writing style paying careful attention to even small details and drawing the reader in with intricate attention to the characters's emotional attachment to surroundings and events.Additionally, H.G. Wells does an exquisite job in supplying fabulous details for the \\"science\\" portion of his science-fiction. He provides concrete information regarding astronomical studies of the day including references to astronomers, scientific magazines, various studies, and more. I didn't bother to cross-reference all of the details he provided. But they all had a definite ring of veracity. Some of them I was fairly certain I've read or at least heard reference in other documents I've read. Wells did a fabulous job of mixing the truth of science with the intense fiction of an invasion from Mars.I also really enjoyed the psychological analysis of the humans and the Martians. The narrator often takes a moment to ponder the motivations and beliefs of the Martians and compares those to our own human beliefs during our own conquests (whether of other humans or of \\"lower life forms\\"). It provided an interesting parallel line of thought to think of the Martians as doing the same thing we had done...simply fighting for survival/expansion and exterminating/controlling life forms deemed to be inferior.Overall, this was an engaging read and a lot of fun. While some of the writing and the details are antiquated, nearly all of the story and its concepts can be almost immediately dropped into our own 21st century world and be just as stark and terrifying (as shown in recent movies).As for a recommended reading audience, I'm not really apprehensive about having my 11 year old read it. There were a handful of characters who \\"cursed\\" and there was one reference to sexuality (though in a very scientific means...discussing the apparently asexual reproduction method of the Martians). As to be expected, there was a lot of violence and death, but it was generally distanced and when it was \\"in your face\\", it was presented more analytically than grotesquely. More than the actual content, I think the language and writing style will be more likely to slow down a younger reader.If you haven't read this one, you really should. I keep intending to read more Wells and other early sci-fi. It's a lot of fun..especially when it holds up so well even after a century or more."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"digital books are perfect and easy to use!

G. Wells, and one of my favourite books in general. His writing completely immerses you into the world of the protagonist.

The 1950s film adaptation was in mind at first, along with other corny sci-fi flicks of that time. But this book is far from stale or laughable. Wells paints a very realistic picture of a world in the midst of utter destruction as the narrator determinedly makes his way across the countryside towards London - with the current mega-popularity of the post-apocalyptic setting for novels and film today, War of the Worlds would fit right in if written in the present. This, coupled with the glimpses into humanity Wells gives, make this book surprisingly poignant in more modern times, regardless of the technological advances we've taken.\\"For full review, please visit me at Here Be Bookwyrms on Blogger!"},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"Even now this is a great book, even if it is a little outdated.

Surprisingly different from the film and radio broadcast. Worth the time, and free as well. Read it"},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"Very Classic Book and should be read before seeing the movie as it provides a totally unique story. HG Wells is the man."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"This is one of my very favourite novels. It is fast paced and exciting. I also love the time frame - 1890s in England. I guess we all know this is about an alien invasion of the earth. However, none of the films that have been adapted from this novel have ever captured the beauty of the writing...and all have been set in the future (1950s and 2000s).One characteristic of Wells' writing that I greatly admire as a reader is the immediacy of his storytelling. His narratives move at break-neck speed. In his science fiction romances (his term) he meticulously edited his material so that anything, any detail that might be perceived as superfluous has been purged. There are no asides to encumber the reader, no contrived subplots, situations or characters to divert us; these works haven't an ounce of fat on them, not an extra word or punctuation mark; thus, the reader feels as if he/she is hurtling towards the finish. This quality of Wells' makes these works lean and exhilarating for the reader. Many of his short stories possess this same quality; and that's one reason I like them so much.Something else - something beside the point - H.G. didn't clutter his narratives with subplots involving women (romantic or otherwise). I don't fault Wells at all. I think that the introduction of women, or a woman, would have muddled the story; rather it would have taken the story in a direction Wells didn't want or need to go. The Island of Dr. Moreau, The Time Machine, The First Men in the Moon, The Invisible Man, When the Sleeper Wakes, and The Food of the Gods, have basically no women. The Sea Lady: A Tissue of Moonshine does, and women feature very prominently in most of his social comedies like Kipps and Tono-Bungay. However, in almost all the film adaptations there have been girlfriends and/or wives who have remained present throughout the action. In The Time Machine the Eloi are [from Wikipedia]: \\"They are described as being smaller than modern humans, having shoulder-length curly hair, chins that ran to a point, large eyes, small ears, and small mouths with bright red thin lips. They are of sub-human intelligence, though apparently intelligent enough to speak, and they have a primitive language.\\" In the 1960 film Weena is played by Yvette Mimieux. Well folks, that's Hollywood. Even in James Whales very fun 1933 version of The Invisible Man, Gloria Stuart is introduced as the fianc&eacute; of Claude Rains (her character does not exist in the novel).His writing feels very contemporary as well. If you've never read his original text of The War of the Worlds you will be blown away; truly one of those books that more than lives up to the literary clich&eacute;: \\"I couldn't put it down.\\""},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"here is my review of \\"war of the worlds\\" by h.g.wells and it will be short and sweet. this this is aboutspace aliens(from mars) attacking england around 1900 and-of course-the humans have NO IDEA what is in storefor them!!! the narrative is quite detailed in the descriptions of the aliens and all the destruction that theycause and this is something that makes the story interesting for the reader. the narration is in first personby a man who never gives his name (that's different!). i liked this story alot. i do not see anything wrongwith this and i think this story has held up well over time. i am not going to give up the whole plot but,thealiens pay for their' greed in the end. this is a good reading for science fiction buffs or someone lookingfor an unusual slant on the whole\\"space alien V.S. human\\" genre.....as a side note,this is a book i have read-not a cassette tape. this book is the one pictured by whitman press,i believe,1964,280pages."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"Not much more can be said that hasn't been said already.

It didn't occur to me that War of the Worlds would fit under \\"apocalyptic\\", but it certainly fits the label.Many people seem to criticize the novel for being boring but it certainly isn't boring. Perhaps in today's mindset that everything has to get your blood pumping immediately and never let go, it could be a little slow. However, the pacing of this book is pretty common the the novels of the time.It is bleak, it is dark, and perhaps more true to the sci-fi than many of the recent greats. I do think that some people get reading this novel thinking it is like the movies, but it certainly isn't and I think that's a good thing."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"Let us give credit where it is due. H.G. Wells crafted one of, if not the, first \\"alien invasion\\" story to which many authors and screenwriters are deeply in debt. Written in the late 1890s the thriller is just as gripping today due to the universal themes, namely man versus the unknown and his certain extinction (and earth get's its ass galactically kicked by invading Martians). There were several points I would congratulate the grandfather of science fiction on: his clear descriptions of the alien life forms and their machines (using comparisons of everyday objects to assist the reader's imagination), his interesting theories about Martians and their inability to function on a planet with more air, gravity and airborne viruses, and his scientific approach to what at the time must have been a terrifying possibility. Although heralded for his originating a genre, where he earned my deeper appreciation was in his very accurate depiction of humanity in crisis: the confusion, misinformation, irrationality and idiocy that surround mass exodus and self-preservation. The book is not without flaws, for instance a completely unnecessary side story with the narrator's brother and some awkward sermonizing, but overall an amazing page turner which barely feels a century old. I was also amazed to see that the much bemoaned Tom Cruise film version kept pretty close to this text, adding precocious children and a lot more explosions, and I admit, I enjoyed it, but not as much as the original material."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"With apologies to Orson Wells, George Pal and Steven Speilberg, the Classics Illustrated version of H.G. Wells' \\"The War of the Worlds\\" was, is, and ever will be the best visual version of this classic book. The artwork by Lou Cameron is simply superb and Harry Miller's written adaptation faithfully captures the book without sacraficing any of the action. Although some may consider the appearnce of the tripods to be a bit dated by today's standards (they resemble Cold War era tank turrets mounted on water tower legs with vacuum cleaner hoses for \\"arms\\") they still retain a menacing appearance within the context of the story. The story itself thankfully remains grounded in the late 19th century when Wells wrote it. A pity that Speilberg decided to ruin the story by making it about a dysfunctional 21st century family. The image on the cover of the tripods attacking a World War I era artillery crew is not just classic; it's poetic."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"Great to listen to the real deal. No one needs to improve upon Well's clasic. All the movie remakes can't match the original telling of an alien invasion from Mars. Get the book and listen to the reading as well. Great stuff!"},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"(Kindle readers - there are no problems with this version)This is a science fiction classic that doesn't get old.Written in 1898 (yes 1898!) it's really amazing to me how current most of the fiction still is. H G Wells heavily influenced sci-fi as we know it today.Some of it is amusingly dated though - I love imagining the artillery lines firing on the 'tripods,' it's just great.Having seen the Tom Cruise movie rendition, I must say that I enjoyed the original infinity more.A must read for any fan of the genre."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"H.G. Wells' science fiction novel War of the Worlds is an examination of nature as life and death. On page three, there is mention of the magazine \\"Nature\\" which demonstrates the theme of nature at the forefront of Wells' novel. In the end of the novel, a man throws his hands up to the sky and thanks God. However, God in Well's sense is nature itself. He puts the two as equivalents, something that is often overlooked. Nature is too often seen separate from God, lesser than God, but not in Well's story; here nature is God and God is nature. It is the microscopic allies of nature that protect us from the aliens in Wells' story. Wells writes, \\"By a toll of a billion deaths, man has bought his birth rite of the earth.\\" (208) but Wells is warning us of this dominating human-centric view and letting us know that nature is still the one in control."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"War of the Worlds has come and gone in many different incarnations but I kinda just knew that none of them were really being faithful to HG Wells' original story, especially the mis-judged Spielberg/Cruise flick. So I decided to give the book a shot since it was cheap and this particular printing by The Modern Library looked rather sleek and sexy. I know it's sad, but I like my books to look good.Wells was actually the first writer to do the 'alien invasion' story and tells it from an everyman's perspective (like in that awful movie Signs, only much, much better). Our unnamed narrator is some sort of writer/journalist who lives in rural England. He is pals with a man named Ogilvy, who works in an observatory and is one of the first people on Earth to notice a series of explosions on Mars and projectiles launched towards our blue planet. When the projectiles (cylinders) arrive, no one is really freaked out but approach them with interest and curiosity.Our narrator feels the same way but slowly realizes that he should keep his distance. It's interesting to note how people either react with indifference or ignorance in these first few chapters. Before the advent of tabloid media and long, long before those dreadful cell phones were invented, it would be totally believable that major news such as alien landings would spread through the country pretty slowly.As you know the Martians turn sour and decide to start zapping everyone off the face of the planet with their mysterious heat-rays and tripods. Our narrator reacts with smarter logic than the rest and keeps a cool head while everyone else is a panicking idiot.I did get a little bit bored in the middle when our nameless narrator tells the story of his unnmamed brother in London (a thin attempt at fleshing out the chaos elsewhere) but it picked up the pace again rather quickly after that. It is a rather short book also and I feel like a total moron at the fact that it took me a month to read it. I did get pretty ill in the middle, which made the boring bit even worse and I put it down for a couple of weeks. I planned to read it in a few days, but I guess fate was against me.You know the ending already and how the Martians are defeated by germs, which might seem a bit of a cop-out to any young readers but to me, reading it like it was 100 years ago (a world I particularly like, the old english countryside filled with inns, cottages, paperboys, pubs and post offices) , it's rather ingenius. HG Wells must have been a really smart guy to come up with ground-breaking stuff like this.War of the Worlds IS an undeniable classic and is still far superior to any knock-offs and every-single-one of the movies. Give it a go for sure!"},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"War of the WorldsThe Human race has confident about our dominance of planet Earth not knowing that our dominance is about to be tested. Aliens have been watching Earth for millions of years waiting and watching how we humans evolve and solve problems. Then one day they decided to launch their massive attack all over the world. At first we humans thought we could just blow them up with anti-tank rounds and explosives but the alien tri pods had shields that we couldn't see. After a few days it seemed hopeless for the humans until the aliens began to get sick. The aliens weren't ready for the germs and bacteria in our air and became sick and their ships became weakened and eventually all the aliens died off and the humans triumphed after what seemed like a hopeless battle. This book was pretty good and very suspenseful in some places that wouldn't let you put the book down.War of the worlds was good because it had a lot of suspense and it didn't give away the next part of the book like most other books do. When the Martians landed in their cylinders I thought that it was some type of meteor that would come before they came but when I read that 3 legs shot out of it lifting the cylinder into the air I was taken by surprise. The Martians also had heat rays that would burn people into dust. That was impressive because it really showed how more advanced they are than we are. The ending also took me by surprise because I was expecting that their shields could only take a certain amount of abuse then it would be gone but when they got sick that really gave this book a good twist.This book was also very good because of how descriptive it was. This book described everything done to the bodies that were turned to dust by the heat ray that were laying on the ground, \\"He saw Miss Elphinstone covering her eyes, and a little child, with all the child's want a sympathetic imagination, staring with dilated eyes at a dusty something that lay black and still, ground and crushed under rolling wheels.\\" The book is so descriptive it made me feel like I was there staring at the blackened and dusty body. It also shows how determined we are to stay alive and free. The end of the book when we destroyed one of the aliens cylinder.Another reason I liked this book is that instead of the book only concentrating on one place of attack it told what was going on in the entire world. In one scene there would be a battle going on in the US but in the next scene it would tell about how London was being totally destroyed. Then after the battle in London it would describe the resistance that all the humans were putting up all around the world. I find that that makes the book seem a lot more realistic.This book was very good and suspenseful. It really put you right in the action and suspense of it. This book was also very descriptive, it showed how nasty the aliens looked and destructive they could be. I would recommend this book to any reader who was looking for a good suspense or thriller. I liked this book very much and it is highly recommended by me. A. Ingell"},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"This is the novel that started it all--the first serious exploration of what mankind's first exposure to Martians might be like. H.G. Wells was of course a visionary--as testified by not only THE WAR OF THE WORLDS but a number of other immortal works such as THE TIME MACHINE and THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU--and even his most outlandish plots are underpinned by enough realism and science-fact to make the reader believe they could indeed actually happen. THE WAR OF THE WORLDS is no exception, and his Martian invaders and the trail of devastation they leave on Earth are portrayed as believably as possible for the time in which the book was written. Believable or not, THE WAR OF THE WORLDS is one of the most exciting and entertaining sci-fi novels ever composed. From the first timeless sentence (\\"No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man's and yet as mortal as his own...\\") to the initial haphazard Martian landings through to the unstoppable onslaught of the nearly-invincible Martian titans and their merciless poison gas and heat-rays, the story careens toward its inevitable conclusion. Can Man marshall his resources to finally save himself from total extermination? The answer, actually, is a resounding NO. If you really want to find out just what that means for Man's ultimate fate then there are several other reviews here that will spell it out for you in frankly disappointing detail, but I'd rather not spoil it for any prospective readers out there that haven't been exposed to the climax just yet. Without question, this is the best alien invasion story ever put to paper, and as good as the cinematic adaptations have been the novel outshines them all. Wells' first-person narrative rings true throughout, with quite a bit of introspection, social commentary, and philosophy worked in. Wells was an opinionated man with some questionable ideas about religion, history, society, and humankind in general, and it's very possible WAR OF THE WORLDS was at least partially written as an indictment of Western (specifically English) imperialism. But for the record, the story is NOT anti-religous, even if its author was, and the narrator prays several times and at one point must stand a private trial before God. But whatever one thinks of Wells' personal theories and biases, he was an amazing storyteller whose intentions at least were honorable, much like George Orwell, and who left behind a literary legacy that will survive the ages. Indeed, I doubt even an alien invasion could wipe it out..."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"Wells, H.G. The War of the Worlds. New York: Bantam Books, 1988. 164 pages.The War of the Worlds by H.G. Wells was the first story to explore the chances of there possibly being life on other planets. What happened in this novel was that there were aliens from mars or Martians if you prefer that landed on English soil. There main goal of coming here was the destruction of man kind. There was a big whole from which the Martian cylinder landed on Earth. The Martians had something called a heat ray which could kill people with devastating heat. They used this weapon to kill up to 40 people in the first night. Martians were hammering throughout the night. They were building something big. One, two, three cylinders had landed. What assaulted the earth were 3 monstrous tripods which were the size of large houses. (Wells, 41). It took less than a month for the war between the 2 species to be complete. Is this the end of humanity as we know it or do we have an element of surprise for these alien invaders? \\"By virtue of this natural selection of our kind we have developed resisting power; to no germs do we succumb without a struggle, and too many those that cause putrefaction in dead matter.\\" (Wells, 153) The survivors could be found in the country and some had gone to the sea. (Wells, 154)This was one of the best novels that I have ever had the honor to read. The way that Wells described the devastation of the Earth was incredible. This showed me that there may just be another civilization out in the world that is even more technologically advanced than humanity. I was surprised that no matter what the humans tried to do against the alien invaders it did little to no damage at all. In the end it was not man that was victorious but it was god and one of his simple creations that saved use from the assault on our Earth. If you are a reader of science fiction I think that that you would enjoy this novel by H.G. Wells."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"Why is it that I've waited so long to read this book? The only reason I picked it up was due to being part of a reading group discussing the novel. H. G. Wells should be considered one of the founding fathers of science fiction. His science fiction is thought-provoking and grounded in reality -- no grandiose space opera here. If you're looking for Star Wars or cuddly ETs, this is not the book for you. But if you're looking for intelligent science fiction that spends more time on characters and less on theatrics, read War of the Worlds. One has to wonder how this book will fare once it's gone through Spielberg-ification with Tom Cruise in the lead role."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"This novel is another classic of vintage science fiction. H.G. Wells has a knack for creating situations and characters that literally jump off the pages at you; but only if you haven't polluted your mind with the images from the movie based on the novel. The War of the Worlds is a very entertaining book with a lot of action. It is perhaps the most entertaining of Wells' works, but it lacks the social insight you find in The Island of Dr. Moreau and The Time Machine. What it does give you, though, is a reminder that despite mankind's great achievements, we are all still very vulnerable! (This point is driven home rather bluntly at the end of the novel with the fate of the alien invaders - but I can't reveal it here without giving away too much) This is a great work that I recommend for any true fan of science fiction. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"This was the only book in my life that I did not finish due to boredom. Then years later I picked it up and have found it to be one of the best books I've ever read! I have no idea why I did a complete 180, but I can tell you why I love it now.First off, the writing style is simple yet rich. HG Wells is excellent at the very thing that Jules Verne failed at: mixing together enough action and dialogue in to keep a plot moving with rich, vibrant detail to immerse the reader. The book is presented as a narrative account of a historical event and the speaker frequently addresses his audience and adds in a healthy amount of \\"opinion\\" to make it feel really like a personal letter. And while we are over 100 years later, the book still speaks to us and is easily readable.Second, the plot is amazingly well thought-out. While there's arguments to be made that this is the first science-fiction work and has been imitated by many other stories (both in direct remakes and common themes), War of the Worlds still feels fresh. Alien invaders, the initial feelings of hope and fear, onslaught of horror and finally miraculous gratitude do not feel played out here.I think that's partially because of how the story was built. Everything happens in a way that feels natural, that we could easily see occuring. The story stays with the storyteller (or his recount of his brother) throughout the entire story. No cutaways to the aliens, or the military, or gratuitous scenes meant to show panic. The story remains one man's tale, and we learn about the incidents as they happen to him. His focus isn't solely on the larger picture; he thinks to his wife and his neighbors, to his country and the world and then back to himself. He worries about tomorrow and next year then back to the next hour. The character is human and fallible, not some superman. Society crumbles in the ways we would expect, no apocalyptic harshness or utopian kindness merely survival mixed with a dash of decency when possible.War of the Worlds did not feel like a \\"Great Literature\\" book but instead like a well-planned entertainment novel."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"I think War of the Worlds accurately portrays how humans would react to hostile aliens arriving onto Earth. It paints interesting pictures while using science to back up the story. It is a true science fiction novel. The only downside to the story that I see was that the name of the narrator was never revealed to the audience, referring to himself as \\"I.\\" It leaves us to question just exactly who he was. I also think that some of the events that happened in the book could have been composed of more detail so that the reader could fully understand what was happening. I admit that sometimes I was lost about what had just occurred, but skimming through the pages before I was caught up.Other than that minor detail the book was expertly composed of facts and fiction, all strung together by a touch of reality. The story has a good plot, and the conclusion at the end was surprising. I had wondered from the beginning what might kill these seemingly invincible creatures, and to find out that disease killed them, it was entertaining to say at the least. The H.G. Wells's use of language stunned me, as his smooth words made the story seem less boring and more original. The story also shows us how alike we are to the monsters that tried to take over the planet. It shows us that we kill things for hunger and amusement. We take over land which once belonged to the animals and turn it into cities and towns, not taking into account how many of the precious animals' homes we have destroyed.With the amount of effort that Wells has put into this book, I am interested to read his other science-fiction books, like The Time Machine and The Invisible Man."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"I enjoyed the book, The War of the Worlds ,by H.G.Wells, because it is a piece of classic 19th century sci-fi literature."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"It's war of the worlds.

WellsThe War of the Worlds is one of the crowning examples of nineteenth century fantastic fiction.

It truly kept me on the edge of my seat as I followed characters and their exodus from Martian tyranny."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"Ellie LezakOctober 9, 2007This book was no doubt the best science fiction book I have ever read. H.G. Wells does a amazing job recreating a book that has been done by many authors, into the type of story that has you on the edge of your seat, never wanting to put the book down because you just have to know what comes next. In this book, the main character who stays anonymous by name is a normal simple man, not any really any different from any of the other people in this time, but there is one difference, this man happens to know, how to survive. What to look for and what to stay away from, who to trust and who has to go. And how to rebuild something that was destroyed, so that there was nothing left. One normal night but one twist, what seems to be smoke in space coming from mars? For ten days, at the same time every night, the same smoke appears. And exactly 10 days after he 1st say the smoke a green light heading right for earth not to far from his house. Days. The day after the asteroid land no one really pays attention to it but it is mainly the noises inside that attract them. Even if they new what the future had in store for them. There would probably be no preventing fate from doing what was going to be done. Battling the fate of everyone around him this man manages to live, and start over again just like everyone else.In H.G. Wells's writing, he does a amazing job to capture the seen, and make it so the reader can actually imagine what the situation would be like. And put them self's in the moment. There were only 2 things that I did not like about this book. At some points it would just go on, about the same thing, just a list of different things, and than it would happen again. And the only other thing that I didn't like was the ending. I've always thought that the ending of a book should be fun and exiting, and wrap up the whole story. But the ending to this book wasn't the best it explained a few things and than there was one food scene and it ended. But over all I would rate this book 4 stars out of five and I defiantly recommend it for all ages."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"The British author, H.G. Wells, was a man of many gifts. He wrote the &quot;Outline of History&quot;, a superb, two-volume work on man's path through the ages, and many novels about English middle class life. Wells is perhaps best remembered, however, as one of the founders of science fiction. Of his many novels and short stories of this genre, War of the Worlds is one of the best.A cautionary note or two appears appropriate here. First, I hope you read this book before you see any of the movies taken from this novel. Screenwriters uniformly butcher good literature, and this book has suffered more than most at the hands of these amateurs. Second, Wells wrote many of his s/f novels nearly a century ago, and it is neither helpful nor appropriate to an enjoyable reading to compare the scientific knowledge of today with Wells's narratives, which were based on the best science of his time.As opposed to the more famous Jules Verne, Wells is an accomplished novelist, and keen wordsmith. His disciplined writing is geared to an educated, adult mind. You won't find any untied ends, or sheer voyages into fantasy, here. Instead, War of the Worlds is a very believable narrative of what would happen if modern man confronted a vastly superior, ruthless alien invader. The fact that a century has passed and science has learned far more about the physical universe doesn't matter at all. Human nature has not changed, and it is here that Wells is peerless in terms of analytical description.The novel takes place in 1890's-1900's England, at a time when England was the most powerful nation on Earth. The introduction is Genesis-like in quality, describing how man lay somnolent in the face of a gathering alien threat. Without warning, the aliens suddenly appear, and man greets them in innocent gestures of friendship, only to be slaughtered by giant robotic devices carrying heat-rays,(lasers), poison gas, and devices capable of powered flight, none which man had yet invented or used in warfare. The result, of course, is an absolute rout in which the best and worst of people appear. It doesn't spoil things to note that the Martian invaders are beaten by Earth microbes, since everyone knows that anyway. Wells's description of this defeat contains passages as good as any in literature.This book is the first in which man confronts aliens from places other than Earth, and many commentators have tried to draw more from it than appears on its face. Whether Wells intended an oblique criticism of British imperial policy is unknown to this writer, and I suggest that it really doesn't matter. What is apparent is that only quality novels can engender such hypotheses, and the fact that such theories have surfaced shows the depths of Wells's writing.Whether you finish the book viewing it as a morality play, or simply a visonary, well-written work, you will enjoy it immensely. I do not make the statement in jest that I consider it one of best novels ever written. I recommend it very highly."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"When I first started reading \\"WAR OF THE WORLDS\\" i was a little dissapointed. It seemed a little cliche, and not very original. Then I came to the realization that there never was a book written about aliens before this came out, and it was a blast to read afterwards. Kind of like watching the original \\"star wars\\" or playing the pc game \\"half life,\\" this book lets you see first hand where the cliches of this particular genre have come from. quite the fun read indeed."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"This book pulled me in right away. It was so indulging and interesting. I also enjoyed many of H.G. Wells's other books: The time machine, Island of Doctor Moreau, the invisible man. All great books. you must read them NOW!!"},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"Never matched and certainly never exceeded, HG Wells' 'War of the Worlds' remains the ultimate invasion, bye bye mankind extravaganza of the imagination.And ..somehow, being set in the Victorian era makes it even more irresistable, with people fleeing from the grizzly invaders wearing tweeds and bustles.. what a vision that conjures up in our jaded, new millenium plastic weary imaginations.My prayer is (having just learned that Tom Cruise is to make a new film version) that he avoids blasphemy against this beloved antique piece of science fiction and does not make an updated whizz-bang, glitzathon Hollywood piece of barbarism! Mr Cruise take note! plenty of bustles, corsets, horses, carts and brass telescopes - thank you sir!"},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"When I was in the Air Force, many trips to foreign lands ensued. Long hours spent in the back of various cargo planes ensured that everyone had a decent stockpile of books for the entire trip. And so in the early portions of my &quot;I want to read all the Classics&quot; phase I picked this book up at the store and began.It is a wonderful story, one that grabs your attention from the first sentence. Having seen the old movie on TV (one of my favorites from that era), I halfway knew what would happen, but I didn't realize the full scope of it beforehand. I waited with anticipation as the first cylinder opened and the Martian machines loomed overhead, beginning thier march to conquest of the Earth. As I read I thought to myself, &quot;Can anything stop these things?&quot; several times, and then as if in answer a lucky shot from a British artillery piece cracks the faceplate of one Martian war machine and fells it into a river where it's destroyed. The other passengers on the plane gave me strange looks after they heard my howl of glee, let me tell you. But as the Martians adapted to Earth-style warfare, they once again became unstoppable.So finally as the whole situation was becoming unbearable and I was beginning to get desperate to jump in the book and do something myself, two of these things wade into the Thames and begin blasting passenger and cargo ships filled with refugees trying to escape. This was too much! So you'll imagine that the desire for retribution against the Martians I felt was expertly preceeded by Wells introduction of the HMS Thunderchild, a warship (the most advanced weaponry at the time of his writing) which simply rammed the first Martian, toppling it into the river, is cut in half by the second Martian's heat ray, but still carries through in it's death throes to successfully ram the second one as well. And with much noise of approval I once again got strange looks from my co-passengers.And this book will really do that to you. I highly recommend it to anyone who really just enjoys a good, solid story. The Time Machine was equally as good, but since this was my first taste of HG Wells it'll most likely always be my favorite."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"This is definitley one of the greatest books of all time. It is incisive, suspenseful, influential, and undeniably a classic. It really makes you think. I was amazed at how H.G. Wells was able to imagine something like this back in the 1800's. A great book that ironically reminds us of how badly we've mistreated our own world and how we rush to protect it when someone ELSE tries to destroy it. Lastly, I must make this clear: If you do not have good grammar, don't even attempt picking this book up."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"The novel &quot;The War of the Worlds,&quot; was an exciting book. It had a lot of suspense and was actually pretty esay to follow like many of H. G. Well's novels. It had a great background idea about it. When this novel was first written it was the first ever to express the idea that there was life somewhere else in the universe besides Earth. The aliens embrace themselves for war against the human race. They our much stronger and have a lot better technology than us. As the novel keeps going it gets more and more exciting for the simple fact that you will get worried about the future of mankind. I would recomend this to people that really enjoy reading science ficion novels and who have read a novel by H. G. Wellls before. It is a very old book but it is pretty entense throughout its duration. So if you get a chance to read it you should give it a try."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"Along with &quot;The Time Machine&quot; this is one of those classics that helped shape the future of the science fiction genre, and is therefore worth the read. I have to warn you however that those who are used to a more contemporary writing style might find this book a bit slow. But if you enjoy classics, then this is one worth having in your library. The first of all the alien invasion stories."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"I've never cared for Wells' social/political views, but if read as pure science fiction his books (War of the Worlds, Time Machine, etc.) are outstanding. They have stood the test of time.A reviewer below alluded to a comment by Isaac Asimov that alien races advanced enough to cross the galaxy would also be more emotionally and morally advanced, and therefore would never think of conquering other worlds. If Asimove said this, it confirms my long-held belief that he was a pompous blowhard. Technological advances = moral advances? Right -- that explains why we are so much more morally developed than the Stone Age people. A much better reason not to fear alien invasion is that, if there are other civilizations out there (read &quot;Rare Earth&quot; if you think that's a given, by the way), many of them would be thousands of years older than ours, and therefore would have found us long before now. If they haven't invaded yet, they probably won't."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"This was a compelling story about two worlds battling for one planet. On one side we have super-smart aliens from Mars and on the other a man from England. It had periods when Wells was evading heat-rays to alerting the army about the oncoming army of one hundred foot tall machines made of aluminum. This is the epic story of how he survived that month. We think that if you are in to science fiction you will really like this book. It is a mixture of sci-fi and a survival story. If you have seen the movie Mars Attacks and you liked it, you will really like this book. This book is an extraordinarily great book."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"What Tolkien is to fantasy, HG Wells is to science fiction.For those who want some New York setting I can only recommend &quot;The war in the air&quot;.

Let the war begin.\\" A catchphrase that could easily be employed for Herbert George Wells's most acclaimed science fiction \\"The War of the Worlds\\". This is a novel revolving around the highly improbable but simultaneously stunningly imaginative idea that the earth is invaded by organisms residing on Mars. Composed in a first person narrative,\\"The War of the Worlds\\" is a gripping saga of the millions of people's agony and loss of ease in the face of a confrontation that would change the world for good.The story begins directly with the theme. In the last years of the 19th.century,in the most unassuming and delicate of all propositions,England witnesses the most surreal threat:ten bizzare cylinders all containing Martians fall near London. A wave of bitter agony,nameless fear and hopeless apprehension rocks the peole and as the Martians gradually come to terms with the Earth's gravitational strength,the police and the military of surrounding regions stolidly enarm themselves for an imminent war. The greatest of all human fallacies is perhaps the absurd universal acknowledgement that humans are the most accomplished creatures anywhere. This myth is firmly exploited in the book a the narrator---an ardent follower of astronomy and scholar of philosophy---perceives a plethora of harrowing incidents that compel him to shudder to his boots.The narrator's town of Maybury is completely demolished and so are the nearby towns of Woking,Weybridge,Shepperton and others. The narrator manages to traffic his wife to his cousin's place in Leatherhead in asumed safety but himself gets entangled hopelessly and helplessly in the boughs of life and death. In his maddening and desperate escape from the clutches of the more intelligent and powerful Martians,the narrator pairs up first with an artillerman and then with a curate. The latter is a lost soul whose faith in God and religion has broken in the wake of humanity's greatest ever calamity and the former is confident and visonery whose preferred modes of survival in a Martian dominated Earth is not that improbable,if at all naive. H.G.Wells's artistry lies in speedily building up to a great climax and in a plot so utterly novel and unique and symmetrical,this is a marvellous diusplay of wit,intelligence and clearness of structure.\\"The War of the Worlds\\" on one level may appear to be a mere science fiction with vivid illustration of beings from outer space and the havoc they cause on our planet but the essence of the book transcends much beyond this demarcation. The weahness of mankind in the face of unknown,unheard and unthought catatrophes is firmly delineated in this landmark novel and Wells applies a very,very subtle satire on humans' grotesque complacency on teir own abilities. When the artilleryman admits,\\"we're down;we're beat\\" with \\"absolute conviction\\",the reader fathoms the author's surrender of \\"the greatest power in the world\\" to Fate. On a much higher level,\\"The War of the Worlds\\" is a massive comment on man's petty as well as magnanimous follies garbed in a dress of science fiction.Composed in a sense of retrospection,the book does lose some of its charm from the very beginning that the narrator is alive and kicking. and the confinement of the sequence of events within a relatively small England territory narrows the scope of the novel and also trims down its volume. But even so,\\"The War of the Worlds\\" is a brilliant science fictin that leads the rteader on a journey on the back of an unfaithful wave that conpires to lead the world to the ultimate diasaster. H.G.Wells was a great visonery in the late 19th.century and it's no less remarkable achievement that this Englishman's great book is still being studied today and would be read for several decades to come. \\"The War of the Worlds\\" is a captivating and telling tale that would dazzle the reader by the shine of the writer's craftmanship."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"I liked this book mainly because it's science fiction. I liked the martions and the detail the writer used. I liked the interesting words used by the writer. It was illustrated well."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"The original book was far better than the recent movie. It made for easy, simple reading, and was very enjoyable."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"Published in the end of the XIX Century, H. G. Wells's \\"The War of the World\\" have scared and delighted people for over a hundred years. First it frightened the author's contemporaries, and the years went by, the novel became a cult, and favorite among geeks everywhere. It had its status raised when Orson Wells made a radio show of it.As far as H. G. Wells's science fiction goes, \\"The War of the World\\" hasn't anything more remarkable than his other famous books, like \\"The Invisible Man\\" and \\"The Time Machine\\". In this alien invasion fantasia the writer had some flights of fancy -- but then again, so did he in the other books.What is more interesting in the story is that the Martians have more personality and will than human beings. The narrator for instance suffers from the absence of aspects to define him as human. He is more a person who is reporting a story than a human being really involved in the invasion and war. Probably that's why he doesn't even have a name. The invaders, on the other hand, are much more obstinate and don't give up. Plus, the fact that they are smarter than the earthlings helps a lot. But probably kids aren't taught Darwin in Mars.Since science -- specially what concerns on space -- has developed a lot since Wells wrote \\"The War of the Worlds\\", but the main theme of the book --the fear of the unknown -- is timeless and this makes the novel interested everlasting, despite it not being a good literary work."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"My opinion of the book \\"The War of the Worlds\\" by H.G. Wells is that for the most part, I enjoyed it. I enjoyed the story due to the fact that it had a sci-fi theme that could keep the reader involved in the story. Another attribute I noticed about the story was that H.G. Wells used very good vocabulary throughout the story but never used words that were too far out of context so the reader would be unable to understand the meaning. The only thing I did not enjoy about the book was the point of view. I wished the author would not have had the characters remember the story but actually be living in it. I believe that would have offered more action, suspense and intrigue. Overall, I give this book 6 out of 10 and recommend it to younger audiences that enjoy the sci-fi side of books."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"In 1898, H.G. Wells wanted to find out what it would be like if an intelligent race of Martians turned the tables by conquering and colonizing the Earth. The result is a gripping account of The War of the Worlds through the eyes of reporter in search of his family in the mid of extraterrestrial chaos. The poetic opening of the novel takes the reader directly to the Victorian world with its typical ponderings about the nature of society. The image of aliens studying Earth like scientists studying transient creatures that multiply in a drop of water is extremely powerful. Imagine the effect it would have had on any imaginative person living in the tumultuous end of the 19th century. The \\"Panic Broadcast\\" in 1938 of the radio play adapted by Orson Welles, gave the popularity of the book a major boost, when thousands of Americans fled for the non-existent alien attack.Even now, more that a century after its first publication, the story still lives on and maintains its popularity. Whereas the narrative sometimes tends to be pompous and belittling for the modern reader, the strong ideas and compelling storyline offers more that enough food for thought. Compared to other major works of its time, Wells succeeded in composing a refreshing plot that keeps the reader hooked until the end. The convincing description of Earth under attack, depicted in situations like the brave battle at sea with the Thunder Child, widens the setting of the story to global proportions. At the same time this contrasts strongly with the personal struggle of the protagonist when hiding in a claustrophobic hiding place and seeing his friend being devoured by the aliens.Joy and despair. Pain and hope. Every emotion is interwoven in one of literatures most important works of science fiction. Although probably not the initiator of the genre, The War of the Worlds certainly has had a tremendous influence on what the Sci-Fi turned out to be. No fan of the genre can allow skipping this masterpiece."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"The war of the worlds is an ok book; but it wasn't that good because through the whole book people were mostly running and hiding and running some more. At the beginning of the book the author is just telling us that the people are being watched. How is that supposed to get a readers attention? If a writer is writing a book, he or she needs to make the first few pages interesting to the reader, not telling us that something is watching people. A writer needs to put a little bit of action in a book if the cover looks like that the book is going to be an action packed book. Then the next ten pages in the book after the beginning the people in the book are running because they don't want to die. During this part of the book the writer is just describing that the people are running from these alian invaders. After this the people reach London. They spend about a day there and then they are running again. After the people fled from London they reached this island in the middle of nowhere. They think that they are safe until the invaders come and capture or kill everyone and everything in their path. Only a few people are left living by the end of the the book. I just think that Wells could have done a better job on this book. Anyway, the war of the worlds turned out to be a good book while it lasted."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"I think that this book is ok. It could use a little more action than just people running and hiding. But still it was a good book. This book is a little slow at first but then it speeds up. I personally think that it could go a little faster at the beginning."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"IN FACT, ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS IN ALL OF LITERATURE! MODERN SCI-FI WRITERS, OR OTHER CONTEMPORARY AUTHORS IN OTHER GENRES, CAN'T HOLD A CANDLE TO VISIONARY WELLS.A 100-STAR BOOK!"},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"It is ironic and yet totally appropriate that the granddaddy of all alien invasion stories remains the most realistic of them all in that humanity is saved because the Martians have no immunity against our diseases. While that simply explanation may or may not explain what happened to the dinosaurs we do know that the arrival of Europeans in the New World introduced small pox and other diseases which decimated the Native American populations, primarily in the eastern part of the continent. However biological truth only gets in the way of good science fiction so that alien encounters in the worlds of &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;Farscape&quot; rarely worry about speaking the local language or breathing the local air, let alone falling prey to the local diseases.Written by H.G. Wells in 1898, &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; also has arguably the most famous opening line in science fiction history, although I am sure most of us always hear the voice of Orson Welles intoning the words, &quot;No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man's&quot; (my second choice would probably be &quot;Billy Pilgrim has become unstuck in time&quot; as long as we are on that topic). The other major contribution to the alien invasion genre Wells provides is the idea that these strange visitors from another planet come because it is Earth that has something special that they need; in this case it is the delicacy of human blood, sucked from living beings (which begs the question, did the Martians know we were such tasty treats or did they just luck out by traveling to their closest neighbor in the solar system?).Isaac Asimov argued that &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; could be read as an argument against British colonialism as the empire expanded to the point where the sun never set upon it. By the end of the 19th-century the British Empire covered a quarter of the land area and the population of the world, and while this is an intriguing parallel it does not strike me as being particularly profitable since the analogy is rather subtle and I would think most of his British readers would have entirely missed the point. Given the omnipresent idea of futurism in Wells' writing it is more worthwhile to look at the issues of mortality, humanity's place in the natural order, and the potential evils of technology.While rereading &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; to consider it for a Science Fiction class completely devoted to novels about the Red Planet, I was rather surprised to rediscover that it is a good yarn. The fact that his stories hold up, not just as escapist fantasies or scientific romances but as stories that continue to be relevant critiques of both the time in which he wrote and the times in which we live, only serves to confirm the place of H.G. Wells as not just one of the greatest names in science fiction, but also as a social critics and visionary futurist."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"This is an interesting book. It starts out as a man in london is describing Mars, and what the martians were doing before they actually came to Earth. Next a canister flies through the sky and lands a little while from the town the man is in. Everyone wonders about it the next day so they decide to open it. So they do and a couple martians come out. Everyone's excited, but soon the martians build giagantic destructive tripods and they start moving about with weapons called Heat-rays. They killed many people,and are storming around. The man that tells the story is running, and everyone in london knows of their destructive power. Their weapons at the time ca't destroy them, and at the same time more canisters are falling, and they've unleashed a new weapon, the tube that sprays a black death cloud.then he tells of his brother and how he escapes.then the martian s are roaming free and the man is hiding out with a curateand a cylindar crashes into the house they're in. So the man hides out for a while and when he comes out , the martians died from disease.The settings are in London in the last years of the ninetinth century. they still uses carts and bicyles and horses but there are no nuclearweapons or cars.I liked the book for the martians taking over the world. The things I didn't like was that you really only knew that people were either dying or running away. They also couldn't really fight back. Also there is not that much description of the martians.Although I really liked the weapons the martians had, because it made them sort of invincible."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"An extraordinary tale, War of the Worlds (the first epic tale about martians and man) tells of the great conflict which engulfs humanity when engaged against a power that greatly surpasses her own. Slowly informed of the alien lifeforms Wells soon bombards the reader with imagery of the future of warfare. Aliens terrorize as lasers vaporize, gas mystifies, while man remains helpless against this unslaught of futuristic intellegince. Drizen from house to streets to dens the narrator (one out of millions who flee before the martians, for what else can one do?) is eventually forced to observe the creatures that never rest, horrified by what he sees. After page upon page of war an eary silence suddenly echoes throughout the land, and the narrator ventures to find the world he knew a desert place as both martians and man are devasted and destroyed by the war which engulfs both worlds.One of HG Wells most enduring novels it has the characteristics which would combine to define science fiction. Origenal and thought provoking it shocks and entertains the reader throughout the 200 paged tale. However, like all of his novels the revolutionary ideas and not the litary magnifisence of the text makes this one of the premere science fiction tales of all time. I recommend reading this piece of literature if you are in high school or above so as to truly apreciate and understand the intricate brillance of the War of the Worlds."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"War of the worlds was an exciting book which I enjoyed. It wasn't as good as the time machine but good none the less. It starts off with some mild atmoshere changes on Mars and then a astronomer sees a shooting star which turns out to be the first of the alien aircraft. The martians first attack England. Which doesn't make any sense. Why would aliens come all this way to attack a small island. Had they attacked a continent it would have been more plausable. Once the story gets going the aliens and humans are engaged in a full blown war. Although this story was exciting I thought that there were sections that got kind of boring. It was well written. A lot of sentences started off the words and and because. However, this is still a great sci-fi book. It reminded me a lot of the movie Independence Day. Both had aliens that came to earth to start war. The only big difference was that in War of the Worlds the humans didn't take the aliens seriously they even thought that they were humorous."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"H. G. Wells (1866-1946) wrote this classic in 1898, and it contains lessons applicable today. Mars, in the tale, is cold at the end of earth's nineteenth century. Its inhabitants are more intelligent than earth's people. But the Martians are jealous of the comforts of life on earth. They decide to conquer the planet and live in its better atmosphere. There is no moral problem with the destruction of earth's people; they are like animals.The first large cylinder lands in an English village. When the villagers approach it, the Martians kill about forty of them with a heat ray. The first cylinder is followed by others. The Martians burn area after area, town after town, as they march toward London in crab-like tanks. Although written before the Nazi blitzkrieg, the Martian onslaught and destruction of natives was similar to it. The attackers also resemble the many conquerors; considered heroes in the history books written by their people.The British react deplorably to the attacks. When the first forty people are burned to death, for example, their neighbors a half mile away go about their customary routine, milk is delivered on time, the meal menus do not change, people walk their dogs. People say: surely the Martians are moral people and will not hurt everybody. Soldiers sent to the front to attack the Martians make jokes.The people slumber in a false atrophying paradise, with mental inertia, an inability to see reality, a failure to face challenges and seek solutions, to change and grow. They explain their new problem with old ideas, with vague meaningless idiomatic statements. They pray rather than act. They blame one another rather than the Martians.Wells, a deist and not a traditional Christian, inserts an episode where a clergyman questions his religion, instead of acting. How can God allow religious people to be harmed? What does this attack mean? Why is it happening? Is this the \\"great and terrible day of the Lord\\" mentioned in the Bible? \\"Be a man,\\" the tale's hero exclaims. \\"God is not an insurance agent.\\" This is nature in action, not God.Wells inserts ideas worth considering. He shows how the Martians, who lived off of human blood, treat the English like cows, goats, sheep, chickens - animals the English are convinced were created for human consumption. \\"Surely,\\" a person says, \\"If we have learned nothing else, this war taught us pity - pity for those witless souls that suffer our dominion,\\" as we suffer from the Martians.Thus, while Wells has given us an engrossing novel, he has also offered many ideas that should be pondered. Among others is the fact that the world functions according to the laws of nature, and it is these laws, not the foolish English in the tale, that solves their problem. Yet, people should not passively hope for nature or God to help them live a proper life."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"The Book was just like thay said .The book is just what I need .Great copy of a great book.I will buy more it is a great place to get book and more.Don Wooten"},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"While this book is a classic, I have to give it only three stars because as a teenager I found it very boring.

The action in the story is lacking for today's generation of action junkies, but is still an interesting look at possible human annihilation. Its popularity has created countless books and movies about aliens and other fantasy writings making it the father of Star Wars, Star Trek and Independence Day. This is a great book that is worth the read."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"H.G. Wells is best known for his science fiction novels (\\"War of the Worlds,\\" \\"The Island of Dr. Moreau,\\" \\"The Time Machine,\\" \\"The War in the Air,\\" etc.) but also has an extensive background in the sciences and a keen interest in political philosophy. Specifically, Wells subscribes to Darwin's theory of evolution and believes that the people of the earth should unite under one world government that promotes universal education and a world economy. From this background and these interests, Wells writes his best-known work, \\"The War of the Worlds.\\"This novel follows the exploits of an unnamed narrator during a month-long Martian invasion. The inhabitants of Mars--a highly evolved, intellectually superior race of octopus-like brains--find that their planet is cooling to the point of being unable to sustain life. For purposes of survival, the Martians build a giant cannon and shoot \\"manned\\" projectiles to Earth as the first wave of a Martian invasion. These projectiles (ten in all) land in the greater-London area and are at first met with curiosity. However, once it becomes known that he Martians are bent on violence and conquest, the inhabitants of England's anxiety rises to a fevered pitch. The British army is useless against the Martians' highly advanced weaponry; the civilians panic and stampede into the countryside; those who remain in London succumb to a variety of mental delusions and insanities because of the hopelessness of the situation and widespread slaughter of humanity.This reader found \\"The War of the Worlds\\" a very enjoyable read. The contrast between technologies (England of 1900 which relies on livestock and railroads versus Martian heat-rays, battle tripods, and black poisonous gas) a highly interesting part of the book. The literary technique of the narrator-protagonist successfully advanced the rising action, climax, and falling action. Finally, Wells' imagination is captivating--Martians (and the antiquated nineteenth-century way in which he describes them and their technology), the variety of human reactions, descriptions of Martian plant-life and physiology, the plans of man, etc., were all engaging and ingenious. This book is highly recommended."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"When one listens to this tape you have to realize the time that was associated with this broadcast.

The first, and perhaps best, sci-fi book. It originally scared the Victorian readership who first read it, HG Wells was decades before his time. What we would see now as naivity just adds to the charm. What makes it so original is the time setting, its like Pride and Prejudice mixed with Independence Day! The book reads like some kind of formal diary made by a Victorian gent, observing the 'cylinder' as they crash from Mars, meeting the Curate, and generally fleeing around London. That is what makes it seem all so real, the place names are just local areas around the capital. Superb...apart from the ending."},{"Title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"This was an interesting book to read in that we only got close enough to the main characters, but yet the focus remained on the reactions to the Martians.

It also has numerous site maps illustrating the ruins and their vicinity. The pictures are not just your everyday tourbook photos. They are spectacular. The author mixes numerous aerial shots that show you overviews of the sites and mixes in a generous amount of detail shots to help you see what the sites look like when you are there. There are also sketches and conceptual drawings which tell about the history. Just because there are a lot of photos, do not think the text is lacking. The book has all you would ever need to know about the sites including history, archeological finds etc. It accomplishes this amazingly enough without boring the reader. The most important thing about this book is that it is comprehensive. An example is its description of Mesa Verde park which is 44 pages of text and pictures. The section includes a detailed description of the stops you can make off ruins road as well as maps and pictures of sites you can't even access.

I found no more issues than I would with a paper-and-glue edition. If you're not acquainted with this \\"classic,\\" read on, if you want an in-depth analysis.The Plot:The story follows a few days in the lives of the Lesters -- a hillbilly family of former sharecroppers living on their former employer's land beside a \\"tobacco road.\\" Jeeter, the self-doomed patron of the Lester family, is obsessed with trying to farm the land again despite its increased infertility and his toxic reputation amongst creditors. His family is so consumed with hunger that they have room for few thoughts, other than wanting a fashionable dress to die in, (his wife), a working car horn to honk, (his son), and a man to seduce (his harelipped daughter). We are introduced to the family when Lov, the son-in-law, stops by to ask for assistance in coercing his twelve year-old bride into sleeping with him. Having bought her from Jeeter for food, he expects the full use of his purchase. Jeeter notices the sack of turnips he has with him, and waxes poetic about how much he's been craving turnips for the next several pages--to the point that he couldn't care less about the overtly public seduction of Lov that Ellie Mae attempts. Finally, Jeeter promises to help his son-in-law sexually coerce his own child, then, with the other members of the family running interference, he steals Lov's bag of turnips, (and only reluctantly decides to share with his family afterwards). If you didn't know before that you were reading a book about trashy backwoods tragicomic figures, you do now.Sister Bessie, the nose-less preacher's-widow-turned-preacher comes along just after the theft. She accepts a stolen turnip or two before praying over Jeeter to absolve him of the sin of theft (a well-penned example of irony, I must admit, and one that had me thinking about mafia \\"Dons\\" and the Catholic church for a micro second). Having decided (aka \\"received a message from God\\") that her widowhood has gone on long enough, she sets her eyes on Jeeter's 16 year-old son, Dude. (Yes, his name is Dude, a word that at the time of publication meant a fashionable city slicker -- another bit of wink-nudge irony). Of course, Dude the pretty boy isn't at all interested in marrying a 40-something widow with a facial deformity, or becoming her side-kick street preacher. So, what super-human feat must she perform in order to win his hand in marriage? Easy -- say she'll buy a new car with the insurance money her husband left her. Dude's only question regarding whether a car is worth a lifelong commitment to a woman more than twice his age is, \\"Will the horn work?\\" The depth and complexity of character here is staggering, isn't it?As Bessie and Dude go on to automotive shenanigans and connubial not-quite-bliss, hijinks ensue, and the book gets much more readable. Jeeter tries to go along for the ride, and more hijinks ensue, even if the book does put a toe or two over the boundary of believability. I won't say any more about what happens, because I don't want to give away the good parts, so I'll just get to my critical analysis.The Good:There is something approaching the poetic in Caldwell's use of repetition here -- it seems designed to portray the ruts a mind falls into when the path it is on is barren and charmless. I found myself reminded of Whitman, but with none of the joy, and almost none of the insight -- only the incidental music. Caldwell's characters, especially Jeeter, worry every thought like a dog with a bone -- the less meat to the thought, the more they seem to chew on it. This was intriguing at first, but became a little tiresome after a bit, (I swear, you could skip entire pages once Jeeter starts talking about wanting something). The artistry of the portrayal was subjugated by the subject--I can only read the inane sentences about wanting turnips or guano so many times before I become a bit numb to the brilliance of the repetition. Ok, ok, I get it, Mr. Caldwell -- hunger and longing is all these people have left to fill their claptrap lives, and they have fallen so low that even tasteless food and feces are transformed into symbols of elevated status.The portrayal of systemic abject poverty and the inhumanity such a condition breeds is very well done here. The atmosphere of starvation, desperation, and bewilderment is palpable. There is also a clear and believable picture of how people (on every rung of the social ladder) will ruthlessly take advantage of others. Caldwell doesn't go for the easy-out of castigating the rich for the plight of the poor; nor does he allow the poor to be solely the authors of their own tragedy. His characters -- illiterate, insolvent sharecroppers living on land they don't own and can no longer afford to farm -- are constantly taken advantage of by city folk. But they refuse to help themselves in many ways -- Jeeter is in love with the land that will no longer yield anything but unsalable \\"blackjack\\" wood for him. He cannot bring himself to leave the home his family lived in for generations, the land they tilled, or the methods and traditions they upheld. It is this stubborn resistance to progress that authors his fate, and the fate of those who have not yet escaped him.The Mixed (bad put to good use):The inhumane treatment of others by every (white) person in the book is abhorrent, and at times made the book damn near unreadable. The grandmother, for example is openly abused and despised, presumably for her drain on the available resources; even Sister Bessie, the \\"preacher woman\\" who should know about the biblical commandments regarding one's elders, treats her like a dog she'd like to kick. Blacks, (of course referred to in the most temporally-accurate derogatory language), are viewed as animals. The only thing more frightening to the Lesters than starving to death is being laughed at by one of the black workers trudging past their yard. The Lesters are starving, illiterate, bankrupt, lazy, ignorant, thieving squatters living in filth and rags and marrying off their underage children for food, but at least they have a group of people to whom they can feel superior! The portrayal here makes it easy to see why racism is still alive and well in the world -- when you have no good qualities to rely on but a sense of unearned superiority, you're not likely to give that little bit up. It is, in part, an artistically astute image of the human addiction to status, and, in part, a scathing condemnation of the lack of empathy that can accompany despair. It makes it REALLY hard to like any character in the book, though. Which leads me to:The BADWhile this book may be well-worded (if a tad too repetitive), and while it may raise interesting questions about the relationship between poverty and inhumane behavior, and whether a detachment from humanity and the progress humanity is wont to make can be a contributing factor to economic calamity, there is simply too much negativity here to make this book an astounding work of fiction. There is NO HOPE here -- the cycle is getting ready to repeat itself by the end of the book, as Jeeter's son learns nothing from his father's self-destructive actions. None of the characters grow one tiny bit, or learn any single lesson, (other than a car needs oil), or discover any ounce of empathy or ingenuity within themselves. They start with the emotional depth of Saharan rain puddles, and they end as they began. They are so unbelievably unlikeable that, when they are grossly taken advantage of, it becomes comical, instead of eliciting outrage or sympathy. (This book could almost be read as a brilliantly successful comedy, if it wasn't for some of the pervasively depressing and disgusting overtones.) Don't get me wrong, I can get along with a good anti-hero, but he or she must do something worth reading about other than steal turnips, try to sell twigs, and whine about not having seed cotton or guano to procrastinate planting with. I can get along with dark and dreary fiction, too, but the characters must be fully fleshed-out and thoroughly engaging. When the characters seem to be so utterly uncharmed by their lives that they can't be bothered to fight for it, I can't be bothered to find their story compelling, either. Give me something of beauty, or hope, or epiphany, or, at the very least, human connection, please!OverallThis is a quick read, it's rather entertaining in some places, and there is some salient social and historical commentary, so it's not at all a waste of time. It's just not at all a masterpiece, either."},{"Title":"Tobacco Road","review":"It's always been said that comedy is the best way to portray social conditions. You make your point without being overbearing. Up until reading Tobacco Road, Candide was the funniest thing I had ever read.If I had had the pleasure of reading Tobacco Road in college, I'm sure I could have written 10 different papers about this book: the influence of the Great Depression, familial relationships, stereotypical views of southerners, comedy in literature, and religious beliefs as motivation or hindrance for/of success. All these broad topics could be explored thoroughly.The absurdity of the characters' actions and Caldwell's tone leaves no doubt in my mind that this novel is a farce. While we're supposed to laugh at these people, the intention is not cruelty. The intent of Candide wasn't cruelty either, and that book could be compared to this one: the absurdity of a certain philosophy vs. the absurdity of having to live like an animal because of economic rape. Of course, the fact that the family is lazy and stupid throws a very big wrench into Caldwell's argument. Or maybe it doesn't. Maybe Caldwell's argument is that no one entity can be blamed for failure. That though people are abused and mistreated, they also abuse and mistreat themselves and those close to them, making them complicit in their own destruction. If the Lesters tried, we could feel more sympathy for them, but then again, if they were hard-working and intelligent, where would the humor come from? Plus, is their destitution breeding stupidity and laziness, or is their laziness and stupidity breeding destitution. It's cyclic.I understand the anger that some southerners feel toward this book. Tobacco Road gives many Northerners who already think they're superior to southerners the ammunition they need to continue their snobbish and condescending view of southern life. I don't think this was Caldwell's intention, being a southerner himself.The sprinkles of religion and faith shown in Tobacco Road raise an important issue: is morality an affordable virtue when you're destitute? The Lesters steal. But, they steal food because they're hungry, not because they're greedy. Is it justified? Not to mention, they steal from people nearly as bad off as they. If you're going to steal, at least steal from people who won't miss it.Caldwell takes the time to make social statements regarding the Lester family, proving he's not just presenting southern situations for the sake of mockery:\\"Though it sometimes looks like a rich man will never help the poor; whereas the poor people will give away everything they has to help somebody who ain't got nothing. That's how it looks to me.\\"\\"You don't work none, but you get all the money us farmers make. Here I is working all the year myself, Dude plowing, and Ada and Ellie May helping to chop the cotton in summer and pick it in the fall, and what do I get out of it? Not a durn thing, except a debt of three dollars. It ain't right, I tell you. God ain't working on your side. He won't stand for such cheating much longer, neither...God, He likes the poor.\\"\\"I don't know what's going to happen to me and my folks if the rich don't stop bleeding us. They've got all the money, holding it in banks, and they won't lend it out unless a man will cut off his arms and leave them there for security.\\"Bottom Line: a laugh a minute story parodying southern life while trying to make a deeper statement about the flawed conditions of life and ourselves."},{"Title":"Tobacco Road","review":"What a striking novel.

A short, fast and easy read, but well worth it."},{"Title":"Tobacco Road","review":"This book is a hoot. Even if you've never known anyone likethe Lesters and their cohorts, they seem completelybelievable."},{"Title":"Tobacco Road","review":"Erskine Caldwell's folk carnival Tobacco Road (1932) documents the last days in the lives of Jeeter and Ada Lester, poverty-stricken and permanently befuddled sharecroppers living in rural Georgia during the Great Depression. The tragic elements, initially almost undiscernable, strike sharply and rapidly in quick lunges before vanishing again beneath the book's brilliant comic surface.The novel has an archetypal framework: Patriarch Jeeter, dispossessed of his ancestral land, upon which nothing will now grow but \\"broom sedge and scrub oak,\\" perpetually dreams of bringing his dead and depleted soil to life. While musing on his farm's infertility, and when not lusting after the women around him, Jeeter, a father of twelve, is preoccupied with ending his own ability to reproduce via self-castration. Like the Hanged Man of the Tarot, habitually procrastinating Jeeter is continually hamstrung and locked in the stupefying moment.Caldwell is particularly cruel in drawing his female characters: simple-minded and otherwise beautiful daughter Ellie May has a disfiguring harelip; man-crazy, self-appointed preacher Bessie has a good figure and a set of nostrils but no nose, the unnamed, unspeaking grandmother is starved by the other family members, who will no longer acknowledge her; struggling wife Ada, who has not always been faithful, dreams only of having a dress of correct length and current style to be buried in; and twelve year-old child bride Pearl has lost the will to speak and sleeps on the floor to avoid her adult husband's sexual advances. In contrast, Jeeter and handsome teenage son Dude are merely imbecilic, gullible, and grossly self-serving.All of the characters are God fearing and largely well-intentioned towards one another, though uneducated and of extremely limited consciousness: they are guiltless of malice, if not of responsibility.In a potentially offensive scene, newlyweds Dude and Bessie accidentally kill a black man, but think nothing of it. But this blank, spontaneous indifference to reality and the reality of other people is what makes the Tobacco Road hilariously funny. The ancient grandmother meets a painful and grueling death through another careless accident with the car; Jeeter discusses Ellie May's disfigurement without the slightest regard for her feelings; Bessie, perpetually in heat, nearly rapes unwilling, unresponsive, 16 year-old Dude; car salesmen gather to enthusiastically stare down Bessie's nostril holes and insult her; Jeeter attacks his son-in-law and steals the bag of turnips he walked has seven miles to obtain; Ellie May casually masturbates in the front yard; the whole family gathers, tribe-like, to watch Dude and Bessie make awkward love on their wedding night; the Lesters destroy a new automobile (symbol of the modern, productive, urbanized world they will never be a part of) within a few days due to recklessness and the family tradition of being unable to respect and maintain any material possession.Like many of the characters in Muriel Spark's novels, the cast of Tobacco Road are only vaguely aware, if aware at all, of themselves as moral, spiritual, or ethical beings, despite the occasional religious trappings around them. This lack of moral awareness, \\"and the comedy that arises from it\\" is what fuels Tobacco Road. Caldwell has written the lightest of black comedies, and it is to his credit that he is capable of allowing his audience to embrace and enjoy these occasionally vigorous lost souls, even though only tragedy seems to lay ahead for all.The universal literary and commercial success of Tobacco Road in 1932 (the novel was adapted into a long-running Broadway play, and a bowdlerized John Ford film in 1941) gave new life to the country bumpkin genre in the 20th-century. Its success helped usher in the Ma And Pa Kettle films, the Li'l Abner comic strip, some of Tennessee William's short stories, and classic American television series such as the Andy Griffith Show (1960-1968), the Beverly Hillbillies (1962-1971), Petticoat Junction (1963-1970), and Green Acres (1965-1971).Despite the many ways in which sexual intentions go awry throughout the novel, Tobacco Road has a natural, healthy approach to sexuality, as does God's Little Acre, the equally-successful book which followed it. In our age of political correctness and sexual suspiciousness, the book's vibrant acceptance of sexuality as one of life's givens is admirable.Some Southerners, at the time of its publication and continuing to the present, have objected to the book as an indictment of Southern culture. But Tobacco Road is clearly a soulful high satire, and its characters are intentionally caricatures of the basest order. Ultimately, Tobacco Road is a novel which seductively illuminates and instructs while it seamlessly entertains."},{"Title":"Tobacco Road","review":"Tobacco Road must be one of the funniest and yet heart breaking American fiction I have ever read. The patriarch, Jeeter Lester, twentieth century Don Quixote, also a predecessor to Al Bundy, selfish, lazy procrastinator, who would do anything , say anything to have his way. Every year he would plan on tilling his land to grow cotton but he is so broke that no body would lend him any money for seeds or a mule for this endeavor.He and his wife live in a ramshackle house with two children,18 year old Ellie May who has a congenital deformity and a 16 year old imbecile, Dude, along with Jeeter's mother, who is completely ignored by the family. They had 17 children, 5 died and the rest flew the coop as soon as they could from this mad house except Ellie May and Dude. They have an equally comic neighbor, Bessie, a widow in her late 30's, who ends up marrying Dude. She lures Dude by promising him a brand new car with the money she received from her husband's insurance. She is a promiscuous nit wit and pretends to be a preacher! This \\"preaching\\", she contends is inherited from her husband. Using this logic she wants to marry Dude and make him a preacher.Jeu d'es-prit of the book is when Jeeter, Bessie and Dude take the brand new automobile to Augusta to sell wood and end up spending the night in a sleazy motel, where Bessie is taken to different rooms by various men. Jeeter and Dude sleep in one bed, wondering why the motel owner keeps changing Bessie's room and why don't they leave her alone so she can get some rest. However, Bessie never complaints.The book reminded me of Steinbeck's unforgettable paisanos of Tortilla Flat. It is a MUST read."},{"Title":"Tobacco Road","review":"If you were to ask me if I liked \\"Tobacco Road,\\" my answer would be \\"I guess so.....I think.\\"It's hard to decide whether or not I liked this book because it's hard to decide what exactly this book is. It's a wisp of a thing really, about 150 pages of nothing happening. Yet it's not boring. There are parts of it that I found funny, but they are so grotesque that I'm not sure they're supposed to be funny. I wanted to sympathize with these poor, pathetic people living like animals, yet I didn't, because they so frustratingly refuse to do anything to help themselves.Erskine Caldwell's story involves a couple of days in the life of a dismally poor one-time sharecropper and those members of his family who haven't yet left home, scraping a living out of the dust in Depression-era Georgia. Like I said, not a lot happens in the way of plot until the hurried ending, which feels tacked on by Caldwell at the last minute as if to justify to his readers why they spent their time reading his book.If you thought the Joads of \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" had it bad, wait until you get a load of the Lesters. This family has none of the dignity displayed by Steinbeck's characters, and it's this difference that ultimately makes the Lesters not worth caring about. Jeeter, the family's patriarch, stubborly refuses to leave his land, even though other poor families are finding opportunities and means for providing for their own families in the nearby mill towns. Jeeter justifies his refusal to leave by taking on a martyred air and feigning a noble attachment to the land, but in reality he's victim to an intensely lazy malaise that will prevent him from ever doing anything to help himself. He thinks the children who have left home never to return or even communicate with their parents have acted selfishly and callously (mostly because they refuse to send money home), but who can blame them? I wouldn't ever return home either.I think this book is supposed to be funny; the back cover of the book compares Caldwell to Mark Twain. However, if that's the case, then this book borders on the appalling. Caldwell's tone throughout is snide and nasty--he invites us to laugh at the Lesters and their stupidity. And if we're supposed to be laughing, then one wonders what Caldwell's purpose was in writing this. If we're meant to simply read this book as a comedy, then I'm repelled at the pointlessness of the whole enterprise. I don't truly believe this was Caldwell's sole purpose, yet the book also fails as an indictment of the social institutions responsible for reducing families to this state of destitution.\\"Tobacco Road\\" falls into that category of books that you might as well read, since it's held in high esteem by the literary establishment and will take virtually no time to finish. I think you'll be moderately entertained, but I also wouldn't be surprised if you have the the urge to scratch your head when it's all over and wonder what in the world you just sat through."},{"Title":"Tobacco Road","review":"\\"Tobacco Road\\" is about a family of Georgia sharecroppers who are so appallingly stupid, ignorant, and cruel, they can barely be regarded as human beings. Wretchedly poor, uneducated, living in a dilapidated house on a defunct cotton farm, unable to afford seed to grow crops, literally starving, the Lesters are both the cause and the product of their predicament. Erskine Caldwell does not attempt to make them heroes, villains, or clowns; he simply portrays them naturally, without ideological filters over the camera lens, and leaves the crusading against agrarian capitalist exploitation to John Steinbeck.Jeeter Lester, the patriarch of this dirtwater dynasty, and his wife Ada have seventeen children, but the accuracy of that number is in question since he can't even remember all of their names. We get to meet only two of them: Ellie May, his harelipped daughter who, unmarried at age eighteen, is considered an old maid by local standards; and his teenage son Dude who has a promising future as a living scarecrow. There is also a creepy old woman who wanders around and hides behind trees, and this, we are told, is Jeeter's mother, although it is scary to think how she could be anybody's mother, even Jeeter's.But the most frightening character is Sister Bessie, a noseless woman preacher with no particular denominational affiliation who just likes to thank God for everything. She (sort of) marries Dude and uses the money she inherited from her dead husband to buy a new Ford so they can drive around the county to preach. The car is, in fact, more deserving of sympathy than any character in the novel because of the brutal treatment it receives at the hands of the Lesters in just the first week of ownership -- a headlight is lost, a fender is crumpled, the front axle is bent, the paint is scratched, the engine is ruined for lack of oil, the upholstery is torn, and the spare tire is hocked. Dude's careless driving also causes two fatal accidents, but there is some consolation in the fact that one of the fatalities is Jeeter's mother.Despite his Neanderthal mentality, Jeeter does have a conscience about certain things. It is out of an almost spiritual devotion to farming and not laziness that he refuses to earn a living by working in a cotton mill. He has always wanted but could never afford to get Ellie May's harelip fixed so she can attract a man. After stealing a sack of turnips from his son-in-law and endeavoring to keep them all for himself, he feels a brief pang of remorse. And both he and Ada are distinctly modern in their irrational fears about death; not about the dying itself, but about the body's postmortem condition -- Ada hopes to have a nice dress for the coffin, and Jeeter just wants to be assured that he won't be laid to rest anywhere rats could chew off his face like one did his father's.However, for the most part there is no love nor humanity among the Lesters; they are animalistically selfish and insensitive to the extent that they resemble a pack of wolves more than a human family. In that sense, I enjoyed this novel because it's like a simpler cousin to Faulkner's \\"As I Lay Dying\\" in subject and setting. I'm just thankful the edition I read wasn't illustrated."},{"Title":"Tobacco Road","review":"Boy, talk about 'moan and groan acres.' The people depicted in Caldwell's short novel are almost unbelievable not only in their ignorance but in their immorality. Women are treated as little more than commodities, while the elderly are totally ignored. The scavengers feeding on the Serengheti plains in Africa have nothing on these rapscallions. Can more selfish, self-serving characters even be imagined? Any comparison with the Joads in \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" is frivolous, it seems to me. The Joads are no less than moral giants when compared to the folks on \\"Tobacco Road.\\" A fascinating read, but are these characters plausible enough to be taken seriously? Tobacco Road makes Dogpatch seem like a college town."},{"Title":"Tobacco Road","review":"Very little content and extremely repetitive dialogue which effectively does portray the pathetic life of the main characters but left me as a reader thinking I was reading a circular loop. Suggestive rather than outright sexual, but considering the time period this was quite controversial. What makes it really sharp is the sheer hatred and indifference the characters show toward each other. Described as humorous by some, I would disagree. It roused barely a chuckle out of me once or twice. That durn book is powerful sinful. The good Lord didn't intend for men to be writin' books like that noway."},{"Title":"Tobacco Road","review":"Erskine Caldwell's \\"Tobacco Road\\" is a depressing diatribe describing the plight of the Lester family living in Depression era southwestern Georgia. The Lesters headed by the lazy, procrastinating Jeeter are a group of dirt poor, illiterate and depraved sharecroppers living in a squalid, crumbling shack on land that was once a fertile family tobacco plantation.Year by year parcels of land would be sold off to pay for taxes leaving the Lesters in a position where they would work the land that no longer belonged to them. Seven years ago their landlord Captain Jack no longer able to make a profit from the cotton crop that was now the staple abandoned the Lesters and other families leaving them with no means of sustenance. The Lester family of 17 children had been winnowed down to two that still remained on their dilipidated homestead, Ellie May, an 18 year old cleft palated eyesore and Dude, a 16 year old dunderhead. Jeeter and his wife Ada, their two kids and his aged mother lived a hardscrabble existence of constant starvation. Through the years Jeeter made overtures to plant a cotton crop but could not establish credit for the seeds and guano fertilizer to actualize his pipe dream.The Jeeter's seemed to destroy anything they put their hands on. They lived a hopeless existence with lofty aspirations but no action in large part due to Jeeter's refusal to work in a cotton mill and give up his dreams of farming. The Lester's neighbor Bessie a promiscuous widow of a preacher who took up that same calling decided to marry young Dude Lester. She promised to buy a brand new car with the $800 in life insurance as a dowery for Dude. Within days the car used for joy riding and to cart wood to nearby Augusta was a wreck courtesy of the Lester touch.Caldwell's book is the furthest thing from a feel good story as could be created. It's disheartening conclusion intimates that Dude is more than happy to follow in the footsteps of his father Jeeter to continue the circle of this despondent and dreary life."},{"Title":"Tobacco Road","review":"I tried reading Tobacco Road several times in the past, but could never get past the first few pages. Now, I finally have read the whole thing, and I'm glad I did. This book could be tucked, whole, into the Canterbury Tales: it would fit very well there.If you don't read much, but thought the ATM machine theft sub-plot in the 2002 Ice Cube movie &quot;Barbershop&quot; was hysterical, this whole book is a story like that-- hairbrained ideas spinning horribly out of control. It's really funny on the top, but sad and inevitable underneath.Caldwell breaks with the silliness right in the middle of the book, inserting a chapter that explains the forces that have brought his characters to this particular brink. It's a bit of a change-up, so I suspect many readers skim over it. But the true story, the devastating cultural and economic shifts that occured as the region turned from tobacco to cotton and from agriculture to manufacture is a key part of understanding the South. And if you want to understand and feel hopeful about the future of the rural, agricultural, and disease-stricken Third World, in my opinion, you'd probably better work hard at understanding the emergence of this American region."},{"Title":"Tobacco Road","review":"Written in a plainative style reminisicent of Hemingway, Caldwell does a fasinating job creating his characters who are all concerned only with themselves and seem to disregard the rest of their family because they only get in the way of their own individual happiness. The main focus of the story is on Jeeter Lester who is the father of the family living on an old piece of land that use to be part of his grandfathers successful tobacco plantation. The Lester family is currently poor and the Lesters must beg or steal to get a hold of any food. Their complete disregard for others can be shown through numerous events throughout the novel, such as Jeeter carelessly stealing a croker sack full of turnips from his son-in-law and running off and eating nearly the entire sack before returning to give the remains to his starving family. When reading this book it seemed to have the same feel as The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck, but notably is more explicit which at times had me gasping. One instance of this is when Jeeter's mother is run over by a car and the family seems to pay no attention whatsoever to her laying dying in their front yard. Definately recommended read as it portrays an insight into a poor farming family of the 1930s coping with poverty, though perhaps a little twisted at times. But the twists and turns make it all the more enjoyable a read and I look forward to reading more by Erskine Caldwell in the future."},{"Title":"Tobacco Road","review":"Written during the depression era, this southern classic uncovers the ugly side of southern culture steeped in poverty. Come along on Tobacco Road and view Jeeter Lester and his dysfunctional family. Jeeter, the patriarch of this poor excuse of humanity brings out the worst qualities that a man can possess. His ignorance, selfishness and stupidity are magnified to the highest degrees as he attempts to survive in a world that has long gone.Erskine Caldwell has introduced us to a life of absurdity in the backwoods of the south. His characters are stereotypical charactures of poor southern whites. Some of them are grotesque in their appearance, greedy, selfish and totally shiftless. As much as you would want to sympathize with them, you can't. They are people who won't take responsibility for themselves and will put the blame on others. Jeeter and his son Dude are great examples of this mentality.How then can this book be so good if it describes people so bad? In telling the story of Tobacco Road, we see another side of southern culture exposed. It is not pretty, genteel or noble. You see the ugly for what it is and affirm that this too is a part of life when people are reduced to extreme poverty. There is also humor in the story. The characters are not totally one dimensional but their naivite draws you to tears of laughter and maybe sorrow. Look into this world of southern culture where people cling to dreams long dead and allow themselves to remain stagnate on Tobacco Road. This is an excellent southern classic of a people long forgotten."},{"Title":"Tobacco Road","review":"Although the book was not a total waste of time, as a native Southerner I was highly insulted. The psuedo intellectual New York trendsetters of 1932 probably thought this was typical behavior of Southerners. The Gore Vidal's of the world probably still believe it even today. What insults me the most is that the Modern Library, in their infinite wisdom, have included this book as one of the top 100 novels of the 20th Century and left off some truly magnificent novels about the Deep South like &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; or &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. Come on Shelby Foote where were you when they voted?"},{"Title":"Tobacco Road","review":"I'm not easily offended, but found Tobacco Road obscene. Not for the sex, for the protrayal of poor, white Southerners without compassion, or, in my opinion, any real understanding. Is making the same joke about physical deformities again and again and again satire or even good dark comedy? Not in my book. In well-drawn humor we are able to see our own wekanesses reflected and recognize the human link between ourselves and the most foolish. But Caldwell's characters are so devoid of humanity that poking fun of them just seems juvenile and cruel. Additionally, I found whole passages of the book poorly written and repetitious. I confess to being a Southerner and from poor stock and perhaps that colors my view. But I love Faulkner and O'Conner. I think Caldwell is best forgotten."},{"Title":"Tobacco Road","review":"Excellent story of an unfortunate family in the hard old days of the rural South in America.I felt very sorry for the poor old grandmother who was treated just like the dirt and rubbish that was her environment.I think Caldwells books are great reading and I have just ordered &quot;Complete Stories of Erskine Caldwell&quot; so I can catch up on some of the ones I don't have in my library.This book is thoroughly recommended although I would think that most fans of Caldwell would have already ready it."},{"Title":"Tobacco Road","review":"Good exact product, fast service!

It wasn't long, though, before I noticed some disturbing habits the locals had. Reading &quot;Tobacco Road&quot; one night (instead of, say, shooting traffic signs) was proof of sorts that I was not imagining things or being paranoid (rather Southern traits, they). Although its been 70 years, the Lesters still abound - and haven't changed much. I therefore find the book's characters to be accurate and believable portrayals; the story moves like a humid Southern summer, and the language is not contrived (some might find it rather &quot;slow&quot;). And the outcome is downright predictable. Of course, it doesn't help us understand why the Lesters of this world are still alive. They just are, and do that they do. The author does well in never attempting to explain why, because the Lesters sure can't. Shucks, its downright brilliant."},{"Title":"Tobacco Road","review":"when I was 20 years old I read this book.

They are barely human beings, seeking only to satisfy animal needs. They kill and maim and destroy thoughtlessly. While out on a joy ride, two of the characters kill a man; they later kill a family member. There is no remorse. The characters repeatedly make fun of physical deformities. They revel in destruction of property. They're racist and ignorant.This could be thought of as a type of satire, a hyper-exaggeration to produce comedy (as others reviewers have suggested) except that there is a problem with that. The writing, 99% of the time, isn't funny. Humor comes from the same word as \\"human\\" and with such grim material, there's little there to recommend it.Still trying to purge this from my memory (sadly hard to do) and I'd suggest you pass this one by. Literature is suppose to uplift, or if it cannot uplift, it should educate, or illuminate. This just debases. Read Steinbeck instead."},{"Title":"Tobacco Road","review":"Erskine Caldwell is a story teller: in my opinion, after 60 years and much reading, he is the best.

Their amazingly ignorant, destructive, and immoral behavior is almost painful to read about at times but is somehow strangely amusing.The story begins with Jeeter Lester stealing a sack of turnips from his son-in-law who has walked all day to buy them. After hearing the description of the family's living conditions, however, the reader almost feels he is justified in taking them to feed his starving children, wife, and mother. Any sympathy quickly vanishes when Jeeter runs off into the woods to stuff himself with turnips before he returns to give the little that is left to his family. It should come as no surprise that nearly all of his children ran away from home as soon as they could and never return home to visit. One of his two children that is still at home when the book begins is Dude, Jeeter's sixteen-year-old son. Soon Dude gets married to a traveling preacher woman named Bessie who was born without a nose. Bessie lures Dude into the marriage with the promise of a new car for Dude despite the fact that they are twenty-five years apart in age. After running over and killing a black man, an event which does not bother any of the Lesters, and other such calamities, the car is quickly rendered into a piece of junk by the destructive hands of Dude and Jeeter. When Bessie complains about their rough treatment of the car, Jeeter kicks her off his land and starts hitting her with sticks. In her rush to get away, Bessie runs over Jeeter's mother, but she does not even stop to see if she is alright. The amazing thing is that Jeeter does not go check on her either, and his mother suffers a slow, agonizing death as she attempts to crawl to the house.The characters in the book are not developed much beyond the fact that they are incredibly ignorant and immoral, but the reader gets the impression that that is because there is really not much more to the Lester family than those qualities. Any potential redeeming qualities are quickly obscured by a flood of more and more horrendous characteristics. An example of this is Jeeter's love of the land, which could be seen as a positive attribute. Quickly, however, the reader realizes that this love of the land is the root of the Lesters' poverty, because Jeeter cannot afford seeds to plant but will not leave the land to work in the city. This also serves to display the theme of the book which is man's often irrational refusal to accept changes in life.The style of the book, although plain, contains very well written dialog and the setting is excellently portrayed as well. If there is one problem in the book, it is the extremity to which the depravity of the characters is taken. This can make it nearly impossible to relate to or sympathize with the characters in any way. Although this can detract slightly from the story, overall the book was very entertaining."},{"Title":"Tobacco Road","review":"Geez! Just finished my original 1932 hardbound edition from the library book sale -- my first Caldwell book -- and feel blessed above all men compared to the characters in what I just read.This book makes the Li'l Abner gang look like the Vanderbilts. You've got a whole book based on a family who subsists off stolen turnips, snuff and boiled roots, with no money, no family allegiances (despite living like worms in a couple of beds in a shingle shack propped up on rocks), but somehow you come to love them, with their hairlips and inbred idiocy and more.Imagine the most isolated and ignorant hillbilly characters you know (I mentioned Li'l Abner, but maybe someone from Deliverance or Flannery O'Connor or Faulkner). You could put a Faulknerian idiot man-child up against this crew as a role model.Man, what a harsh book. It's kind of repetitive (a lot of times I thought I had already read a paragraph, but it was just the same thing being restated -- usually the parts about Jeeter wanting to get his daughter's hairlip \\"sewed up\\" or plant something in his wasted fields)-- I think the repetition may have been deliberate, in order to drive home the tiny hopeless world Jeeter and the clan live in. In any case, the book is short enough to wonder about this and still power though to the end without any draining literary analysis.Before Caldwell, I thought Emile Zola was the best at spinning a story that started off bad for all the characters and got progessively worse (oh, and Frank Norris), but this breaks the record. I'll be reading more by this guy wherever I can find them. There's something dirtily satisfying about reading such books, sort of a literary slumming alternative to trash TV.I don't know if this was literature or not, or if there is any factual basis for this -- but that hasn't stopped me before."},{"Title":"Tobacco Road","review":"I knew I had to read this novel when I discovered it was banned by many libraries upon it's publication. This is what is called \\"rich description\\" in sociology courses. At times I thought I was reading something by Malinowski or some other ethnographer.The Lester family were sharecroppers who have fallen on extremely hard times due to the depression and the departure of the owner of the land they sharecropped. They are left destitute with barely a roof over their heads. The entrenched poverty suffered by this family is heart-breaking.The Lester family patriarch is Jeeter. Imagine equal parts womanizer, opportunist and schemer all rolled in to one big package. If a movie had been made from this novel, the great character actor Chill Wills, (PAT GARRETT AND BILLY THE KID) immediately comes to mind. He goes so far as to practically sell his fourteen year old daughter into a marriage for which she is ill-prepared. The rest of the Lester family is comprised of Ada, Lester's long-suffering wife; Dude, Jeeter's hang-about son, who marries a nearby widow/spritualist with no nose on her face, simply because she promises Dude an automobile, an automobile which Dude proceeds to wreck upon driving. Then there is the libidinous ElleMae, who has the great fortune of having a rich libido, and an amazing body, but the great misfortune of a horrendous facial feature left untreated due to apathy, lack of money, etc. Oh and when we first discover ElleMae she is trying to dry-hump her fourteen year old sister's husband in their dirt driveway. Then there is a grandmother who dies lying in the driveway while the family just goes on about their business....The outsiders who become entwined in the web of schemes thought up by Lester are another story entirely. The widow with no nose who may have been a prostitute at one time (and enjoyed it thoroughly)...are you getting the picture. Poor Lov, a coal-miner who is married to Jeeter's fourteen year old daughter, and who just can't understand why she doesn't want to sleep with him.A fascinating, riveting and deeply sad, moving and-at times-hilarious adventure with a family you won't soon forget....a forgotten classic from one of America's great authors! Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Tobacco Road","review":"...and the land was at the stage where further disappointment might easily cause him to lose his mind and reason.\\"I love bleak books. And this is one of the bleakest I've read. It's the story of a family of ignorant, racist, illiterate white sharecroppers barely getting by near Augusta, Georgia during the Depression. It begins with Lov Bensey, son-in-law of Jeeter Lester, cautiously passing by his father-in-law's place along Tobacco Road with a sack of turnips he's just walked miles to buy, to ask that he talk Bensey's barely-teenaged wife into sleeping with him rather than alone on a pallet as she has since they married about a year prior. All but two of the Lester family offspring, eighteen-year-old Ellie Mae and sixteen-year-old Dude, have moved away. The Lester family has lived a long time in abject poverty, ever since they lost the family land. Even though Jeeter knows he and his wife could earn a decent wage by spinning cotton if they moved to the city, he chooses to stay in a ramshackle house, put his faith in the lord, and get by collecting and selling the occasional load of near-worthless wood. While Jeeter and Lov discuss the situation, Ellie Mae (unmarried due to a prominent cleft lip), tries to make a move on the man to distract his attention from the bag. After the situation with the turnips (which ends badly for Lov), Jeeter returns home to find a boneless-nosed, preacher's widow named Sister Bessie (p 44) \\"past thirty-five, almost forty\\" on the porch with the rest of his family. Sister Bessie proclaims that she is going to buy a car with the insurance money from her husband's death so that she can continue her ministry and plans to pray on the idea of marrying Dude and making him a minister. The verdict comes in as expected. Dude agrees to marry Sister Bessie so that he can drive the fancy new car, purchased with her last penny, and they head out to do God's work. Following the keeping it bleak theme, there are collisions with the car (some deadly), a motherly mishap, Sisterly shenanigans and a whole lot of other sad stuff. The ending is the icing on the proverbial catastrophe cake.My fellow book club members mostly disliked the book due to its racism, repetitiveness and stereotyping. I loved it. Although I'm usually the one raising the issue of racism and tracking the prevalence of the use of the \\"n\\" word (about 17 times by my count), what I loved about this book, which I expected to be difficult, dreary and dull, was that it was anything but. The overwhelmingly negative portrayal of Tobacco Road's characters was so over-the-top as to be comical.

The story begins with a well-rounded plot to steal a bag of turnips from a man everyone is trying to convince to marry one of the daughters--his much younger cousin.Things do not improve and you'll find yourself growing to enjoy the increasing absurdity of the miserable things that happen, and enlightened by the consistant hopes and failures of each of the many characters.Much better than I'd expected, I blazed through it in a workday and a half, just prior to taking a trip I had planned to read this book en route to."},{"Title":"Tobacco Road","review":"Deep, deep in the South and deep, deep into the Depression comes this tale of unsurpassable ignorance, decrepit behavior, and misguided ambition in the lives of a remarkably poor, lamentably disgraceful Lester family.The Lesters, starving tobacco &quot;farmers&quot; near Augusta, Georgia, develop a pitiful attempt to steal a bag of yams from their son-in-law, Lov. From there, the story spirals down into poor and impoverished lives, including the young son, Dude, who marries the &quot;hussy&quot; preacher, and Besse, the woman who was born without a nose. Their wild adventure, travelling into Augusta to try and sell &quot;blackjack,&quot; a cheap scrap wood, fails, as they are taken advantage of and return to their farm with much less than what they started out with. (On the drive to the city in their new Model-T, bought with Bessie's insurance settlement, Dude's neglegent driving kills an African-American on the side of the road, for which they have no more remorse than if someone had stepped on an ant!)This novel is brutally honest, depressing in its depictions of a mongrel family.

Is it worse to coldly allow such people to starve and abuse each other, or help them persevere and reproduce? A question for the ages - and for Republicans and Democrats to duke out... It would have been noble for Jeeter to keep his feet on the land if only he hadn't been too lazy and ignorant to do anything useful there. Do we need to build more poor houses for people too helpless to look after themselves? Or would / does this just help them perpetuate their gene pool? This question is certainly as valid now as it ever was."},{"Title":"Tobacco Road","review":"This is one of those novels that college professors value so highly. Erskin Caldwell was an expert at using coloquialisms and minimalist style to create word pictures that are hard to get out of your mind. He was a gifted southern writer who achieved much acclaim everywhere but in his native South. In the middle and south Georgia counties around Wrens, GA, the area depicted in TOBACCO ROAD, Caldwell's is a name that is still not mentioned in polite company.As far as representing depression era Southern reality TOBACCO ROAD was no more true to life in 1933 than it would be today. The Lester Family never existed and people in the rural South didn't live as the novel depicts them, at least no one I know did. Novels like this one and GOD'S LITTLE ACRE, also by Caldwell, reenforced a prejudiced opinion of this area of the country that is still held by many. We Southerners have been trying to correct this erroneous perception ever since.The area around Augusta, GA is nothing like that which is depicted in Caldwell's novel. It never was. I know.

I don't believe Mr. Caldwell could possibly have interacted on any personal level with any of the people whom he so cruelly and stereotypically portrays. As a resident of the South, I have had literally thousands of narratives of the Great Depression passed down to me through family and friends. None ever reflected anything in the realm of this book. \\"Tobacco Road\\" reflects a view that poverty equals inhumanity, and this could not be farther from the truth. As social parody this book is almost entertaining--but taken as seriously as the tone of the writing encourages, it is ludicrous."},{"Title":"Tobacco Road","review":"Erskine Caldwell while apparently wrote during a different time, apparently did nothing to promote anything other than stereotypes of the rural south. I myself am from a small rural town in Arkansas and grew up with stories my grandparents told of their experiences during the great depression. They were poor and lived by subsistence farming but they were proud and spoke with a sense of accomplishment of their home life. While their education and opportunities may have been limited it seemed to make them appreciate what they did have later. I was surprised to find out that Caldwell had actually lived in the South following my reading the book because he didn't seem to have anything pleasant to say about it at all. All regions of the country do have impoverished persons who have no ambition to improve themselves nor realize the situation that they're in but this I felt was an unfair take on what was not an easy time for anyone in America.If you like southern literature, I would much more highly recommend a Willie Morris book, Cold Sassy Tree by Olive Ann Burns, The Heart is a Lonely Hunter, maybe one of Shelby Foote's works of fiction, or Eudora Welty amongst others. In those stories, poverty and racism which are issues in the south are evident but portrayed in a more fair and consistent light. I will admit in closing that I was interested in the story and finished the book fairly quickly but I felt the content was not all that impressive and only served to deepen stereotypes and preordained views that wrongly exist about the South."},{"Title":"Tobacco Road","review":"The book is set in rural south in the 1930's.

The story of Jeeter Lester and family is one that I want to be filled with exaggeration, but I fear is realistic. It is hard to believe that anyone could be as ignorant, selfish, and uncaring as these people are portrayed to be. Of course the 30's were a far different time than today, and perhaps people really did stoop to such low levels. I found the book to be interesting, and I felt I became very well acquainted with the characters to the point I became angry at them for being so backwards and unable to better themselves.

This is a book that I needed to read!!!"},{"Title":"Tobacco Road","review":"When first published in the early 1930's TOBACCO ROAD was considered indecent, almost pornographic and was often banned. The short novel by Erskine Caldwell still has the power to shock even the worldliest reader with its depictions of the almost animal like existences the major characters live.The book tells the story of Jeeter Lester and his family who live on their ancestor's former tobacco plantation a few miles from Augusta, Georgia during the 1930's. Jeeter and his long suffering wife had seventeen children, twelve of whom reached adulthood (which in the Lester's world is somewhere around age thirteen) but at the time the story opens all have fled their poverty stricken childhood home to find work elsewhere with the exceptions of Dude, Ellie May and Pearl. The parents have had no formal contact with the departed children. Of the children still in the area Ellie May at eighteen has not yet married despite her eagerness because of a disfiguring harelip (cleft palate) her father has never gotten around to having repaired, sixteen year old Dude lives at home also and is apparently \\"half witted\\" though physically normal and Pearl at age twelve is unwillingly married to a neighbor who struck a deal with her father. The old television sit-com THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES seems to have gotten some inspiration from TOBACCO ROAD as Pearl and Ellie May are names used in that TV series and Dude bears more than a passing resemblance to Jethro Bodine. However though TOBACCO ROAD may have some dark humor it is totally different than that frothy 60's show.TOBACCO ROAD takes place over about a one week period in late winter when in more prosperous times the land would be prepared for a season of cotton growing. The Lesters are starving but Jeeter refuses to leave their decaying home which is without financial prospects for work in the city even though it is readily available there. During this one week period the Lesters are visited by a fortyish neighbor and former prostitute turned itinerant preacher named Sister Bessie who decides to marry the simple minded Dude and turn him in to a \\"preacher\\". Dude, Bessie and Jeeter have some misadventures in Bessie's newly purchased automobile that include among other things two deaths that the Lesters take very callously. All ends tragically and ironically but not before leaving an impression on the reader's mind of the vicious circle of poverty and the cruelty and selfishness that can result from it. The book sometimes tends to repeat itself though I assume this is meant to reflect the constrained and cyclical qualities of the Lester's very limited lives."},{"Title":"Tobacco Road","review":"Erskine Caldwell's \\"Tobacco Road\\" is a searing, poetic portrait of the southern rural underclass in 1932. Some readers will find it distasteful, some will find it offensive, but there's no denying its power.Lester family patriarch Jeeter lives in a dilapidated sharecropper's shack in the hills of Eastern Georgia near Augusta. He has fathered seventeen children with his wife Ada, twelve of whom survived, and claims to have fathered several children with another neighborhood woman. Three generations ago, Jeeter's family owned hundreds of acres of the land around him, but it's been lost to years of taxes and mismanagement. Now the soil is depleted, and the illiterate Lesters are no longer even sharecroppers because the man who bought the land at the sheriff's sale, Captain John, has abandoned farming. The Lesters are allowed to stay in the house rent-free, but no repairs are made. Seven years ago Jeeter borrowed $200 for seeds and fertilizer to grow a few acres of cotton. The loan company charged such high interest that the $300 Jeeter got for selling his crop was not enough to pay off the principal, interest and cost of renting the mule to pull the plow. He hasn't planted a crop since.Most of the neighbors have moved away to take jobs in cotton mills in cities, but Jeeter sees himself as a farmer and cannot bring himself to leave. He remains on the land with Ada, his mother Grandma Lester, his hare-lipped 18-year-old daughter Ellie Mae and his half-witted 16-year-old son Dude. The rest of the older children have left, and Jeeter has just sold his pretty youngest 12-year-old daughter to be the reluctant wife of neighbor Lov Bensey for $7, some fuel, and a few quilts. The novel opens with Lov, who makes a $1 a day working for the railroad, walking by the Lester place with a bag of turnips, which Jeeter plots to steal to feed himself and his near-starved family. Things go downhill from there. Jeeter dreams and hopes that somehow God will provide and he can grow another crop, and Ada dreams of being buried in a dress of a fashionable length when she dies. Otherwise their thoughts are focused on food, snuff and sex. They are lazy, stubborn, and stupid and they destroy everything they touch.At first you wonder why author Caldwell has the characters say and do the same things over and over, but then you realize he's showing you just how reduced these people's lives really are, like water spinning and spinning as it goes down a drain. He gets a great deal of very funny dark comedy out of his material, and spares just enough emotional truth and compassion that you can't quite hate the Lesters. Caldwell was the son of an itinerant Presbyterian minister and spent his childhood traveling around the rural American South among people like his characters. As the United States goes through its current economic upheaval, the middle class shrinks and the gaps between the rich and the poor widen, it's an interesting time to read \\"Tobacco Road.\\""},{"Title":"Tobacco Road","review":"Pathetic ignorance can breed innocent naivete, or - as is the case in this book - innocent abrasion.Focusing upon the tenant farming Georgian sharecropping family during the worst years of poverty delivered by the Great Depression, this book entails serious introspection of the ruthless, but innocent, corrosive elements of a grossly dysfunctional family. The patriarch is Jeeter Lester, whose wife, Ada, and he parented more than a dozen children, and alienated the same in number.Within the first pages, Jeeter conspires with Ada and hair-lipped daughter, Ellie May, to steal a bag of turnips from their son-in-law, Lov, who walked over 7 miles in the hot dry sands of Georgia, and spent a half day's pay for the edible treats. You then learn that Lov's marital relation is very suspect, as Jeeter delivered his 12-year old beauty Pearl - whose uniquity of being a blond is because she obtained her father's hair. All the others, including Ada and Jeeter, are brunettes. Jeeter is a sneak, and apparently Ada had her moments of sin as well.As the pages turn, you cringe and moan as the country-bumpkin ignorance proves to be greater than that held by the simplest elementary school student. A car hustler practically reaches his hand into the pockets of Jeeter's half-retarded son Dude who marries a woman his senior by 25 years, Sister Bessie Rice.And, while these miscreant adventures unfold, we learn more about the pathetic existence of Jeeter whose greed and lust make him more animal than man. And, from such example, the children do not fall far from the tree and have their respective vices and chinks in the armor of their soul.Ultimately, Jeeter's ignorance is his bane. He clears his fields with fire, which hits the winds and swoops back to burn down his home, with he and Ada in it. But, being burnt to ash and becoming part of the land is an appropriate finish for the pathetic man who would engage in poverty and starvation for his Don Quixote-like dream to farm. To farm, one needed credit, something Jeeter lost years ago. After years of being prohibited credit by anyone with money to deliver the same, he could only conclude that his ability to farm was ended by man, not nature. But, to this reality he would not submit.Delivered in a style of the southern eloquence of the impoverished soul - Stanley Kowalski ofA Streetcar Named Desirecomes to mind - the bullheaded ignorant folks of this novel too often commit despicable acts which any thought or conscience would commonly deter. But, these characters miss thought or conscience and commit acts which make those about them miserable, and the reader cry."},{"Title":"Tobacco Road","review":"Tobacco Road is an important, if not uplifting story that should have broad appeal. Being from the rural south, I struggle with the image stereotypical poor southerner, but, the Lesters make for a compelling composite of the worst elements of southern poverty. Pearl S. Buck's &quot;The Good Earth&quot; makes for a compelling comparison and contrast to &quot;Tobacco Road&quot;. Personally, I prefer &quot;The Good Earth&quot;."},{"Title":"Tobacco Road","review":"The plight of the Lester family is depressing, but humorous. Their stupidity made me laugh, especially the scenes involving the destruction of the brand new automobile. They practically destroy the car, and they do not seem to care. Additionally, it is amazing how people can lack consideration for other individuals. Specifically, the scene where Bessie and Dude run over the grandmother, and the family shows no concern. When they eventually take her to be buried, I wasn't truly convinced that she was dead. All in all I felt the book was quite entertaining."},{"Title":"Tobacco Road","review":"As a son of the south, reading another child of the south is always an interesting adventure, and \\"Tobacco Road\\" was one of the great forbidden books of my childhood, along with \\"To Kill A Mockingbird,\\" and forms a fairly neat flipside for that enduring and endearing tale of justice and innocence. \\"Tobacco Road\\" is that story from the Boo Radley house, plus some.Caldwell's grotesques (you can hardly call them characters) are clearly cartoons and yet speak to a sad Southern truth that those of us who grew up in the 1950s and 60s knows always dwells there right below the surface ... that maddening ability to hear at astounding and intricate length grand designs for success while the shingles fall off the house, as well as the tendency to blame every misfortune on everything short of one's own rotten front door. The sultry sexuality, which Caldwell no doubt used to move mountains of books, is about as natural and animalistic as it comes, while also having an odd whiff of indifference and inconsequent confusion to it. Caldwell takes his particular variety of stereotypes (that die-hard defenders of the South yowl long and hard about) down the same steamy, dusty, bloody road that such other great Southern writers as William Faulkner and especially Flannery O'Conner do, but at a wholly different kind of remove that lets you know this is the wellhead for this school of writing. It's lean, taut writing (imagine Hemingway reborn into the Piedmont) counterbalanced by a keening repetitiveness when the characters run up against the same old fences that they have day-in and day-out for years. Menace always hangs slightly above the ground like spring-burning smoke, and that is a genuine Southern thing. It doesn't play the same in the North or the West. Caldwell finds that distinct Southern nerve, and hits it with a ballpeen hammer.You may love it, you may hate it, but you cannot deny that with \\"Tobacco Road\\" you're at the very start of something lean, mean, and cruel in its unvarnished honesty. Mayberry be damned, this is the real South."},{"Title":"Tobacco Road","review":"I find it rather humorous to note that not only do the majority of the people getting offended by this work of literary brilliance hail from south of the Mason-Dixon, but also that no one seems to have a clue of Caldwell's primary intention. His always-controversial characters, particularly the men, represent not a backwards view of the South or an attept to persist a stereotype, but the abstraction that humans are little more than hairless animals. Caldwell reminds us that man is capable of regressing to a feral state when pushed to the very brink of survival. As we all have differing breaking points, so does each Lester, and each is depicted in varying states of \\"mental regression.\\"If you're interested in a book that you can read at face value and take a story and then go on to another book, look elsewhere. Someone else said it earlier: if you want a read that is basically a compendium of the post-depression South, read Steinbeck. If you want to take a look at the true, ugly, primal nature of man, pick this book up, especially if you're writing a paper...lots of material here!"},{"Title":"Lead the field","review":"We use several training cassette books in our company and this is the most popular.

When I heard his voice again, it was like I was transported back in time and a shiver went through me. With that said, in listening to \\"Lead the Field\\" during my Sabbatical there are still all the great ideas, but I think they are now packaged a bit archaically. The unspoken and unexamined notion that comes across to me is that a high title or high income is an obvious indicator of success and is what we all should strive for. It is pretty clear in this day and age that title and income may be captured by the successful but too many of these folks striving to be in the top 5% do so without a sufficient counter balance of integrity. With that said, one addition I would make to this work is that no amount of success is worth surrendering your honesty and integrity and the notion that while business needs to be profitable if the only reason you are in business is to make a profit you may be setting yourself up for disappointment even if \\"successful\\". The 2nd notion I would add is the emphasis that one can use all these great ideas to achieve any goal in one's life.

I consider that the topics themselves don't follow a &quot;grand plan&quot;, they are more like self contained. This makes it less obvious the roadmap.The reason for the 4 stars is because of the music that tends to be too much of it and loud, more like for a movie than for a serious developmental tape.

The remainder of the book focuses on the author and co-authors friendship, their desire to teach women to speak out against sexual crimes committed against them, and their lives following Bobby Joe Long, the convicted.

The storyline did have an unexpected twist at the end which redeemed this travesty of literature in my eyes. However the editing was non-existent, the characters were one-dimensional and unbelievable. (A woman as strong as Cynthia is portrayed would not stay in a domestic violence situation for 10 years.) There were numerous syntax errors which were very distracting and kept me from taking the book too seriously. The use of the different fonts was also distracting. An artist paints a picture and lets the viewer interpret for themselves what it means. A viewer of a fine painting tries describing what the painting is telling them. The author spent too much time spelling things out and not enough time painting her verbal picture, letting the reader explore the emotions invoked on Cynthia's roller-coaster ride for themselves."},{"Title":"Choices: Hers Were Deadly","review":"Cynthia Evans is recovering from a bad relationship.

Unfortunately, the editing could have been better. There were punctuation errors, paragraphs weren't aligned and it was difficult at times to tell if a character was thinking something or saying it out loud. It was also hard to follow who was speaking because no attributions were used. If those things were cleared up, it would be a top-notch book. (RAW Rating: 3.5)Reviewed by alice Holmanof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"Not Just Race, Not Just Gender: Black Feminist Readings","review":"Valerie Smith takes the reader through recent news stories and artistic works, both those written and those portrayed in film, to explore the need for an interdisciplinary and multi-perspective approach to society's analysis of various phenomena. Specifically, she discusses &quot;Intersectionality,&quot; a theory proposed by many Black Feminists, to critique portrayals and actual occurrences of events such as interracial rape and Blacks &quot;passing&quot; for white. This approach is unique because it recognizes the importance of understanding an event from the perspectives of race, gender, class, sexual orientation, simultaneously. Smith's discussion of contemporary events (e.g., the Central Park Rape Case, the OJ trial, and the Clarence Thomas/Anita Hill hearings) combined with the critiques of various books and films, shows the reader how film often portrays life, but more importantly, how real life events are often misinterpreted by what is portrayed in popular culture. Despite being a complicated book, Smith provides a convincing argument for the need for this multi-perspective approach. I personally found the chapter on &quot;passing&quot; to be particularly fascinating. I highly recommend this book for those who enjoy an academic, interdisciplinary approach to contemporary issues."},{"Title":"Not Just Race, Not Just Gender: Black Feminist Readings","review":"Prof Smith is one of the few contemporary academics who understands that writing can be simultaneously theoretically informed and accessible. This book proves this point. In many ways, the title of the book belies the level of involment in which this book engages: Smith works through the vicissitudes of race, gender, class, and sexual orientation in interesting, and frequently novel, ways. While her discussion of &quot;passing&quot; as a genre and trope of literary investigation/performance, in particular, is important and enlightening, her level of insight into the most &quot;mundane&quot; contemporary topic, such as the Supreme Court or murder trials, provoked my interest even more. It is easy to recommend this book to those interested in topic covered in the title (i.e., &quot;race&quot; and &quot;gender&quot;) but wholly another to recommend it to those interested in compelling, involved discussions of the ways class and sexual orientation act as markers of subjectivity. Smith's attention to detail, her desire to see culture anew, and her compelling arguments (sans jargon) make this book a &quot;must have.&quot;"},{"Title":"The three mustangeers","review":"This my favorite Will Rogers yarn.

Bobby Jobe is a professional golf player, playing the PGA tournament one day and being a pompous jerk to his caddie as usual, when suddenly a tragedy turns Bobby completely around. It doesn't help his caddie however, whom he calls &quot;Greyhound&quot; and whom he initially blames for the tragedy. &quot;Greyhound&quot; is actually our hero in this book and he is a figure to be reckoned with. He is as real and as life-like as an author can make a character, and he is also lovable and a great golf caddie. His real name is Henry Mote, he initially caddies for the arrogant and abrasive Bobby Jobe, until that one moment in time when a tragedy changes them both forever.

You know that feeling you get when you strike the golf ball perfectly: the club is light in your hands, you are squarely balanced, you smile slightly - pleased with yourself but not wanting to seem cocky - and everything feels good? Each chapter of this book will make you feel like that."},{"Title":"A Mulligan for Bobby Jobe","review":"Whether you're a golfer or not, &quot;A Mulligan for Bobby Jobe&quot; is a mighty fine read. Buy it and read it, and you'll soon be singing its praises among family and friends."},{"Title":"A Mulligan for Bobby Jobe","review":"Thought I was sending our youngest son a birthday present.....turns out this version was not the one my husband and I listened to in the car but an abbreviated version that requires a special CD that he does not have in his car."},{"Title":"A Mulligan for Bobby Jobe","review":"I mean, come on. A blind golfer? I thought it was an intruiging premise, too, until I tried to hit balls with my eyes closed. I'm a 2-handicapper, and I was completely hapless. So forgive me if my suspension of disbelief came crashing down.That said, Cullen writes a pleasant, if completely farfetched tale, with likeable characters. However, I thought the best parts of the book had nothing to do with golf. The subplot involving the mentally ill father was actually more interesting, believable and touching, and the best part of the book was a short bit about Allegheny men and their pickup trucks."},{"Title":"A Mulligan for Bobby Jobe","review":"This book has three things going for it: A great cover, the perfect title and GOLF. But that's about all it has going for it.The lightening bolt hitting a GOLFER'S upturned club on the cover is the worst nightmare in GOLF. Next, the very clever title sums up the book's premise perfectly by giving a mulligan, GOLF'S version of a second chance, in real life to GOLFER Bobby Jobe after he's blinded. And, as I appear to be the first to report, Bobby's last name obviously refers to Job, who was tested by God in the Bible. Both Jobe and Job passed their respective tests after leading hedonistic and selfish lives, although I think it must be harder to play GOLF blind than it is to endure all those biblical horrors.And finally, the book is about GOLF. Bill Clinton could write a book on GOLF etiquette and ethics, and I'd read the...thing. I wasted a beautiful Sunday afternoon watching those no-name GOLFERS fumble their way through the last round of the U.S. Open long after Tiger had fallen from contention. Tiger was on his way back to Orlando in his private jet after he finished his fourth round early. He was probably playing Nintendo, but I was still watching GOLF.This is all to say that Bob Cullen starts off with three stars in this review because of the GOLF aspect of his book. And I'm giving him one more star for keeping GOLF at the center of his stupid little story.But Bob, listen to me. You've tarnished the sacred game of GOLF with [garbage] situations, an unbelievable premise, a dumb romance and ridiculous subplots. You start with a mystical bolt of lightening and end with an earthquake. Aren't you a little heavy on the symbolism? I know, I know, I know. You got this lightening bolt thing from \\"The Natural,\\" right? Did you know that this great book by Bernard Malamud had dark undertones, with the hero actually throwing the big game in the end? Anyway, I'm talking here about the movie, which took the high road that you missed. You start and end \\"A Mulligan for Bobby Jobe\\" with beautiful symbolic and mystical acts of nature. But in between there's lots of good, old-fashioned garbage.Bob, you mix the mystical with the banal in your book. How about a little consistency? You know and describe GOLF as well as anyone, but you're not good at writing Harlequin novels. Go high or go low. Your game is all over the place. Stick to your knitting.You abruptly change gears from your mystical start into 300 pages of hillbilly shenanigans, [garbage] situations and municipal GOLF course nonsense. Then, you weave a love story into your plot with Greyhound, that dolt who caddies for Jobe. Let's face it, Bob, Greyhound missed the bus. You write nearly 400 pages and Greyhound scores a few kisses from Angela, the angel who's babysitting Jobe? A few kisses?!? This is 2001, Bob. Someone should score in this book, and I'm not talking about a great round on the GOLF course. What, you're trying to write a fairy tale? Don't tell me you're taking the high road here, Bob, since you sure throw around the profanities and try to expose the underbelly of the PGA Tour.All your little subplots detract from the main premise of the book, which is redemption. But you sure tie up all those distracting tangents. Does the blind Jobe return to the PGA Tournament, how does the odious Little Dickie do in the big event, does Greyhound get the girl, what happens to that ridiculous municipal course back home, how is the long-departed and insane father dealt with (his constant muttering about Ben Hogan gets old real fast, by the way), does the mother avoid the creepy car dealer, etc. I've never seen so many loose ends tied up so efficiently. If only real life was that tidy.Hey, Bob, you're a GOLF expert. Stick to what you know and avoid what you don't. Leave the cheap romance novels to authors who don't understand GOLF. Go high or go low."},{"Title":"Nos Comunicamos (Spanish Edition)","review":"This is a wonderful workbook for a wide variety of students. It can be used in conjunction with the text or alone as a supplementary study aid. The level is definitely for a beginner or for those who wish to teach their children Spanish in the home. The learning approach is extremely user friendly with plenty of pictures, short but beneficial practice exercises, a vocabulary builder section and many question and answer opportunities. There is some grammar taught but it is not the focus of the workbook. There is also a focus on reading and expressing one's ideas using the vocabulary taught in the chapters. This workbook is definitely geared towards a junior audience, grades 3-6 and can be used in the classroom or at home. With proper instruction and dedication the young Spanish student will increase his/ her reading, writing and speaking skills in Spanish. An important note there is no answer key provided however, there is a glossary at the back of the workbook."},{"Title":"A thousand ages;: The University of Wisconsin Arboretum,","review":"book was everything it said it would be and I was very satisfied with it."},{"Title":"Life Cycles: Your Emotional Journey To Freedom And Happiness","review":"I find this book to be such a good tool for self-analysis and working through hurts from the past.

What I truly admire about Ms. DeLorey's style of communication in this book is her compassion and warmth towards her reader. This respect stands out on every page as she guides you through each month and year of a nine year cycle. When I read the section on my particular life path, its accuracy was stunning and wholly affirming. Much of my life and early experiences made sense after reading this book. I use the book now to guide the theme of each new year on my journey -- this book has helped me to let go, start anew, be open to receiving, to forgive, to be efficient and strong, and, most of all, to develop the compassion I need to let others find and be exalted on their path, too. Just as the title suggests, freedom and happiness results."},{"Title":"Life Cycles: Your Emotional Journey To Freedom And Happiness","review":"The book is based on numerology but it's not about what numerology is or how it works. It's about where you were, where you are now, and where you are heading. The description of your emotional journey is so accurate that it's sometimes creepy - in a good way. What is revealed here can be, of course, taken in a subjective manner. But that's part of the process. What speaks to you, what you perceive as important at this point of your life, what you want to work on, all depends on where you are in your life. The book is written in a monthly calendar style, so you can use it for the rest of your life. And by the time you come back to the same month in 9 years (because you go through cycles of 9), you may be reading the same section, but I bet you are working on a different topic, struggle, task, etc. that is of importance at that time of your life. I read it at the beginning of every month to see what I want to work on and pay attention to. It's about your personal growth and, like the title says, about your emotional journey to freedom and Happiness. There are tons of hints and information in this book. What you do with it is up to you. Keep an open mind, for you will benefit more that way. Good luck with your journey."},{"Title":"Life Cycles: Your Emotional Journey To Freedom And Happiness","review":"Wonderful book. I recommend it.

Everything changed: my relationships with my husband and my teenage son and daughter, my relationships with friends and coworkers, and best of all my relationship with myself. Each chapter is like a monthly coaching session in which I feel increasingly better about myself and the poeple that make up my world.

She said the relationship between Diana and Dodi was not serious.Few months agao a priest broke his three- year silence to reveal how Princess Diana confessed her love for Dodi Fayed - and was going to marry him.Father Frank Gelli said the Princess even asked him if he could conduct her wedding ceremony. She confided in the highly- respected Church of England minister at secret meetings in the weeks before she and Dodi were killed."},{"Title":"Diana - Her Last Love","review":"Very little has been written since Diana's death which is new. Very little was written about her while she was alive that was worth reading. Many people believed she was an empty-headed, spoilt girl with a privileged upbringing, who went mad. But that isn't true. Most people only knew her as the woman on the front of every magazine in the world. Everyone was shocked to the core when she died, but surely that shared shock doesn't make sense if she was so insubstantial!This book fills in the missing pieces. It tells us things we never knew about Diana. It is not gossip, but fact, heard first-hand from some of Diana's closest friends and confidantes.We all knew, subconsciously, that Diana was more than just a face. In fact she was an amazing woman. Not many people could have survived the pressures she had to cope with and emerged as a stronger person with the ability to shake the world's governments. Nobody has ever looked for what inspired this great change in Diana. The answer is that she had at last found a man she wanted to marry; a man who inspired her in her quest to help the sick and suffering. He was a heart surgeon; she called him 'Mr Wonderful'. She took her love for him to her grave.Diana:Her last Love tells for the first time the complete story of Diana's love for Dr Hasnat Khan. It explains where Dodi fitted into the picture (she was certainly not in love with Dodi); how she and Prince Charles became great friends towards the end of her life, and how she came to terms with Camilla.It is a sad story, but also heart-warming, in that it makes you appreciate for the first time just how special this woman was.Unusually for a biography, this is a very easy book to read. I read it at one sitting. Although it is debatable whether anything else should be written about Diana, I believe that this book is fully justified; it sets history to rights, and above all I suspect Diana would have approved of it herself - it would certainly appear that some of her closest friends encouraged the author to write the book, which seems to be accompanied by a forthcoming TV documentary."},{"Title":"Diana - Her Last Love","review":"Based upon what other Amazon.com reviewers had to say, I didn't expect much from this book, but I was pleasantly surprised. The writing is good, a little hero-worshiping of Diana comes through, but that's tolerable. I notice the author only interviewed some of the more wacko or cheeseball \\"friends\\" of Diana (Simone Simmons, the faith healer, taken seriously?? but I guess Diana took her seriously at one time). However, at least you learn more about Hasnat Khan & his background (sounds like a really nice person, and all his family too). I can't agree with the author that Diana was a stronger person at the end of her life -- she seemed to me to be very immature still. Imagine taking up with Dodi Fayed to make another man jealous, sure he was a multi-millioniare but please, the guy had had so many women (what did he tell Diana about his fiance, Kelly Fisher??), and there was his drug habit...I wouldn't touch him with a barge pole. That's mature, strong behavior on Diana's part? I think she was so devastated when Dr. Khan finally broke it off, that she went into a tailspin & into her old, self-destructive, immature behavior. Manipulative, too, if you believe that she planned for the \\"Kiss\\" picture and the others being taken (which I believe). The author doesn't agree with my thoughts, but she doesn't force the issue, she just mentions that other friends thought Diana sounded strong at what turned out to be the end of her life. It's an interesting book, not the best one on Diana, but thoughtful and brings out some unknown background on her relationship with Hasnat Khan."},{"Title":"Diana - Her Last Love","review":"This is the most sensitively written book so far about Princess Diana, showing her as a complete and whole person seen through the eyes of her different friends. This tells the story of her last love, Dr. Hasnat Khan, a heart surgeon and a great man, whom most people will never have heard of, but who gave Diana true happiness in the last two years of her life. This book is 100% factual. Dr. Khan was Diana's last love with whom she found this pleasurable experience reciprocated for the first time in her life without any affectations.This is definitely a book to be read by all seeking the truth about Diana's final years and who want to read the detailed facts of one of the greatest love stories kept under wraps until now."},{"Title":"Diana - Her Last Love","review":"After reading this book, I am convinced that the author speaks the truth. Hasnat Khan's name comes up in several books, and they all state Diana felt strongly for him. I do believe she was with Dodi Fayed to make Mr. Khan jealous. I certainly can picture her with a heart surgeon more easily than I can with a playboy who didn't know what to do with all his money. I also read Paul Burrell's book, \\"A Royal Duty\\" and he alludes to Diana's true love, though he doesn't give him a name. He does say it was not Dodi. I believe that had Diana lived, she would have possibly married Hasnat Khan, or at least maintained a loving relationship with him. She didn't know Dodi well enough to even think of marrying him; the relationship was simply a summer fling. It's sad that she did not live to see that happiness with Dr. Khan come to fruition."},{"Title":"Diana - Her Last Love","review":"This book claims to demonstrate that heart surgeon Dr. Hasnat Khan of London was the last love of Princess Diana. Although the book contains a small amount information about Diana's friendly relationship and visits with the Khan family in both Pakistan and England, the book and author does not give any quotations from the Khan family to prove her assertions about Diana's supposed love for Dr. Hasnat Khan, and the doctor himself is not quoted, and the doctor has refused to say anything publicly about his relationship with Diana. Therefore, this book is nothing but second hand or third hand hearsay, not testimony. The author repeats some quotes from friends of Diana in earlier sources which suggest that Diana was not intending to marry Dodi Fayed, but that does little to prove Diana was in love with Dr. Hasnat Khan. The author suggests that Diana was being publicly and privately deceptive about her supposedly pretended relationship with Dodi Fayed, in order to make Dr. Hasnat Khan jealous, because Dr. Hasnat Khan had just recently rejected Diana's desires, and thus Diana tried to make Dr. Hasnat Khan return to Diana. The author suggests that Dr. Hasnat Khan was the true love of Diana, because it was a secret relationship, but that is not quite correct; it was not an entirely secret relationship, since it was reported in the tabloid newspapers, but just less public than her relationship with Dodi Fayed. The author quotes a few of Diana's friends who quote Diana as saying how much she admired Dr. Hasnat Khan, but it seems to this reviewer that Diana was just as likely to have been publicly and privately deceptive about her relationship with Dr. Hasnat Khan, and that Diana was not in love with Dr. Hasnat Khan either. This book is not worth much as a source of truth, because it lacks the direct testimony of the still silent Dr. Hasnat Khan. See my other reviews at Amazon."},{"Title":"Diana - Her Last Love","review":"This book isn't one to really enjoy. Ms. Snell uses other books(listed in back) as references, no real problem with that but then she goes further and uses anonymous sources. I never really like that because you have no way of knowing how good that source is or whether or not they might have a grudge against the subject. I suspect that some enemies of the Princess more than her friends contributed, that stuff about Diana trying to pay Simone Simmons with gifts instead of cash is an example of this. Anything I've ever read indicates to me that she most likely would not have done this (although she could be very generous with gifts), that would be a trait more of the born Royals. The love life details, are they true? I don't know, the Princess is dead and Hasnat Khan isn't talking. A person should also remember that in 1997 his relatives embarassed him by talking so much, sounds to me like they're still at it."},{"Title":"Diana - Her Last Love","review":"Hasnat Khan may have been Diana's last love, but from the state of their relationship at the time of Diana and Dodi's cruises, the good doctor may equally have been her last heartbreak. The relationship with Khan was longer, but her relationship with Dodi was cut short by the crash so we really do not know what might have happened over the next two or three years.I am not certain if at the time of her death if she was still contemplating a marriage to Dr. Khan. After all, he had pretty much made it clear he was not willing to take the necessary steps to marry Diana -- and I think this hurt her very much. Maybe by the time she cruised with Dodi, she was already thinking Doctor Khan was a lost cause.If Diana's love for the doctor was as strong as the Ms. Snell implies, Khan refusal to make the one big commitment may have ended what affection she held for him. The lack of commitment likely was interpreted by the princess as another rejection. At that point, she may have decided to wash her hands of him and start looking elsewhere.From reading the book I do not think Kate Snell is a particular fan of the late Diana, Princess of Wales. We all know Diana was not perfect since no one is, but I found the attacks on Diana's character to be rather harsh. Books on Charles typically are written with the approval of the palace, and penned by fawning supporters -- something most Diana books lack. The author made the point that Diana still maintained a friendship with Khan's family (to prove the seriousness of the Khan relationship) but maybe Diana truly liked and respected his family despite Khan's failure toward a marriage commitment with the princess.The last disagreement with Khan may have been the final straw for Diana. Although, the author feels \\"The Kiss\\" photos were designed to make Dr. Khan jealous, it is possible Diana simply was celebrating having a relationship with a man who did not care if the world knew he was seeing her. After being forced by royal requirements to sneak around, and be non-committal with the press when dating Charles, and then sneak around to date the private and secretive Khan, it is possible she was truly fed up with hiding. Dodi obviously was different, and this may have been appealing to the princess. Given time she may have continued seeing Dodi or found someone new. If Diana had lived, Dr. Khan may not have been an option any more."},{"Title":"Diana - Her Last Love","review":"Uninspiring, petty and boring. I adored Diana, and truly enjoyed the exhaustively detailed biographies that have come out in the last 5 years. This isn't one of them. It is neither memorable nor does it have any excellent new pictures of the Princess - except the one on the cover. We read nothing new about James Hewitt nor Camilla, nor Will Carling, and a lot of drivel about Hasnat Kahn. Yawn. Wait for something else to come out."},{"Title":"Diana - Her Last Love","review":"I think that the author tells the truth but I don't agree with her,I think Diana was manipulative, she planned several strategies to win Hasnat back including using the media and Dodi to make the doctor jealous.The pess describes him like a playboy, a bad man, but he was the only man who loved her so much, he was very kind with her.His life looked like her life: his mother leaved his father when he was 3 years old,he was a mediocre student,he loved to have beautiful women because he didn't like to stay alone , he believed women loved him only for his money.Sometimes he prefers to stay with a woman who did not really love him, because he didn't like to be alone.He has insecure behavior.in the past diana manipulated media in order to send a power message but this timesI think she really cruel woman because when someone was in love with you , you should't joke with his feelings, and used media to create illusion of love,it's really unbearable to an human being. I read a lot of books about Diana: her true story by andrew Morten death of a princess by Thomas sancton and Scott Macleod, the day Diana died by christopher andersen , shadows of a princess by p d JephsonIn fact I was a great Diana 's fan but when I read this book I didn't like her anymore. The media show us a superficiel dodi's picture. people have been influenced by the press"},{"Title":"Diana - Her Last Love","review":"There is no shred of evidence to back up this fantasy book.This pile of rubbish is aimed at wiping out the truth about Princess Diana's loving relationship with Dodi Fayed. And if you wipe out the truth about their relationship, then you wipe out the truth about how they were killed.British intelligence is behind the assassination of Diana and Dodi because their love affair was a shock for the British royal family. Prince Charles can kiss his two children good bye unless they are morons they will surely recognise the truth of what happened to their mother.Fortunately Mohammed Al-Fayed with deep pockets and a commitment to the memory of his son is out there speaking for truth."},{"Title":"Reality Check: A For Better or For Worse Collection","review":"This, like all the FBorFW books, is fine comfortable family viewing. It is such a shame that everyone who reads it can't see the simple beauty of having a family (though 'fictional')like the Pattersons who really care for each other, their friends and their pets. Some of the other &quot;reviews&quot; I have read of this book seem extremely bitter and anxious to put down those of us who enjoy simple comics and stories of families where no one is on drugs or in prison for a hate crime or murder. If you want &quot;gruesome&quot;, go watch TV and leave our Lynn Johnston alone!"},{"Title":"Reality Check: A For Better or For Worse Collection","review":"I became a fan of FBOFW after reading \\"Lives Behind the Lines\\". My favorite aspect of the strip is that, while Johnston generally sticks with chronicalling the so-called \\"normal, everyday day occurances\\" of nucular family life, she isn't afraid to write about serious issues. Aside from the well known (and VERY well done) story dealing with Lawrence, Johnston has dealt with such issues as the death of a parent and the ethics of journalism ( when Michael and Weed photographed a vehicle accident, then later learned that Deanna Sobieski had been involved). Lynn continues that tradition in ths book by addressing an issue that I, for one, have NEVER seen addressed in a mainstream, syndicated comic strip - sexual abuse. This story, which involves Elizabeth's roommate Candace, was published in December 2001. As usual, Johnston wrote the story well, and showed a great deal of sensitivity. As a survivor of abuse, this story has alot of meaning to me.Another issue brought up in the book is the fact that Elly's father is showing signs of Alzheimer's. I look forward to seeing how Johnston deals with this.P.S. : As Elizabeth continues her training to become a teacher, I was pleased to FINALLYsee the adition of some First Nations characters. Given that Johnston's strip is both Canadian and, usually multicultural, this omission had always struck me as odd."},{"Title":"Reality Check: A For Better or For Worse Collection","review":"Lynn Johnston and Robb Armstrong of \\"Jump Start\\" fame are comic geniuses in a class by themselves. No two ways about that.Johnston has created a believeable and appealing family who, unlike most strips contend with controversial issues such as homosexuality; divorce; infidelity; physical challenges; racial issues; crime; death. It is always a treat to read her strip in the daily paper and it makes for something to anticipate daily.Michael, the oldest Patterson child, now married has a child on the way. Readers follow Deanna's pregnancy up to the birth of daughter Meredith Anne. It makes for a riveting story line that is sure to delight most readers and maintain their interest.Middle Patterson child, Elizabeth, now an adult and working towards her teaching degree moves in with her boyfriend, only to discover what a mistake that was. Her way of exacting revenge upon him was funny and resourceful.April, the youngest Patterson child went from obnoxious pain to obnoxious teen and patriarch Grandpa Jim, a delightful character marries a woman whom he meets at a senior citizens' gathering.A truly delightful collection that will not only evoke smiles, but will undoubtedly remind readers of milestones in their own lives."},{"Title":"Reality Check: A For Better or For Worse Collection","review":"I always like seeing a new book by Lynn Johnston. Her comic strips find the humor in everyday things, and I think most of us can relate to at least one of her characters. Her latest book is funny, extremely well-drawn, and continues the adventures of the Pattersons and their friends and relatives. Buy it for the fun and insights that it offers."},{"Title":"Reality Check: A For Better or For Worse Collection","review":"This book picks up where &quot;With This Ring&quot; finishes. I was actually disappointed with this book after reading the first one. There was no introduction, and the book goes from Michael and Deanna adjusting as newlyweds, only to 1 strip after Baby Meridith is born. I thought that this book would be more towards the baby's birth, but it wasn't. I enjoyed it however, more so for the other storylines in the book."},{"Title":"Reality Check: A For Better or For Worse Collection","review":"Another Great book to visit the Patterson's with. \\"For Better / For Worse\\" has to be one of the best comic strips of all time. It really makes you think, \\"They are just like my family\\", and if you do not have kids, read the books so you know what to prepare for."},{"Title":"Reality Check: A For Better or For Worse Collection","review":"In alot of ways I was enviuos of these characters. It took me 4 months to find a OB who would take state medicade for my first pregnancy. They have national health care ensuring them prenatal care once the strip is positive. But Johnston outdoes herself showing us the chaos pregnancy can create in a marrriage, especially one as new as micheal and deannas."},{"Title":"Reality Check: A For Better or For Worse Collection","review":"Despite a brief period of being considered a cutting-edge cartoonist (with the infamous \\"Laurence is gay\\" story line), at heart Lynn Johnston likes things neat, tidy and relatively conservative. \\"Reality Check,\\" the latest \\"For Better Or For Worse\\" collection, continues that tradition.The main focus of the book is the gestation and arrival of the first member of the next generation of Pattersons, Michael and Deanna's daughter Meredith. Anyone with any semblance of intelligence will immediately roll their eyes when reading the initial strips where Deanna informs Michael that she's pregnant, claiming that \\"I wanted to change medications and wait for the first one to leave my system, and ... it just happened.\\" It's bad enough that this kind of \\"oops\\" is seemingly acceptable, but considering that Johnston has Deanna's profession as a PHARMACIST who (one would think) knows how birth control pills should work makes it that much more unbelievable. Johnston has often stated that her strips reflect either what is going on in her life or what she wants to happen--the arrival of April is a prime example of the latter--and apparently she has a screaming case of grandbaby rabies. Of course, after a token protest or two Michael and Deanna fall in love with parenthood, and everyone is delighted despite the fact the couple is portrayed as having major financial problems. But in Johnston's world, everything always works out for the best, because a baby always fixes everything, right?As for the Patterson daughters, idealistic Elizabeth gets her heart stomped on by her latest boyfriend--Johnston has the pair living together but ostensibly sleeping in separate bedrooms--while bratty April becomes more obnoxious and spends all her strips whining (at least that's somewhat realistic of today's kids). There is a neat little plot with Grandpa Jim's unexpected marriage, but Johnston still spends a few too many strips dealing with various Patterson animals, including the protracted death of April's rabbit, at the expense of John and Elly. Johnston isn't always sugary, but sometimes she misses great opportunities to be real and goes for the schmaltz. \\"Reality Check\\" is best suited for those who followed Deanna's pregnancy and Meredith's birth with baited breath (not to mention those who--yes, it's true--sent congratulatory e-mails to these fictional characters)."},{"Title":"Reality Check: A For Better or For Worse Collection","review":"It's the soap opera of today's funnies! Unlike most of the cartoon characters on those pages, the family is doomed to age and change just like us lowly human mortals.The funny little boy, Michael is now all grown-up and has a wifey of his own. Together, they have produced a preciousy-woo little cherub who has inherited collagen-puffy lips from her mommie. And it also looks like she would one day grow up to be a spoiled little princess who's the center of attention now that April is getting too old for it. Instead, she's now a teensybopper who's getting ready to arrogantly flaunt her perfect nails and midriff in the public and already, she's regarding her loving, doting elders as deadly enemies. As usual, big sister Elizabeth is still an innocent do-gooder who got duped by a two-timing boyfriend so handsome and dashing he should've been on the cover of a romance novel. And - the innocent little dame gets swept off her feet by ANOTHER boyfriend handsome and dashing enough to be on the cover of a romance novel. Grandpa may have lost his wife, but he now has a new squeeze to replace her memory. But at least she's as old as fossil. And both Elly and Connie are obviously on the way, though they think they're still pubescent young girls.Oh, and I almost forgot...the pet bunny croaked and a busybody landlady nearly cooked it up in her famous rabbit stew."},{"Title":"She's The One","review":"This is the second romance novel by Elda Minger I have read, and it will not be the last.When fate introduces Sam Cooper to the engaged Amanda Hailey he knows that she is the woman meant to become his wife. Unfortunately Amanda is engaged to marry a much older man to both pacify and escape her manipulative mother. Sam has to use all his knowledge and skill as a private investigator to convince her that she is making a huge mistake.Cute and diverting, marred only by an ending that seems rushed. Recommended for lazy Sunday afternoon time passing or curling up with in front a warm fire on a rainy evening."},{"Title":"Self-Defeating Behaviors: Free Yourself from the Habits, Compulsions, Feelings, and Attitudes That Hold You Back","review":"This book forces you to see how you think negatively about yourself and how that is deeply affecting our lives. You can call it anxiety, inferiority, insecurity, or low self-esteem, it's really one big thing in our mind saying \\"I am not good enough and people won't accept me unless I am better.\\" But we misunderstand what \\"better\\" means. It's not getting an \\"A\\" in school or getting a promotion at work or being Mr. Right or being smart enough to make fun of others. It's your own attitude! And if you don't understand that it turns into a vicious negative cycle that you can't stop. But it has to stop and the only person that can stop it is you yourself! Thanks to this book, I figured this out and I finally feel like I am on a road to recovery rather than a road to hell on earth. Another book that really explains this so well is called the \\"Ever-transcending spirit\\" by Toru Sato. It is one of the best books on life and human nature that I have ever read. If you read it you will know what I mean. But this book by Cudney was what started this. It is sooooo helpful!"},{"Title":"Self-Defeating Behaviors: Free Yourself from the Habits, Compulsions, Feelings, and Attitudes That Hold You Back","review":"What is your life like? Is it a relentless procession of empty days, an endless cycle of meaningless, frustrating work and unrelaxing sleep? Do you repeat the same pattern of joyless days and empty nights ad nauseam? Do you bounce out of bed eager to face another exciting day filled with opportunities for enjoyment, human contact and personal growth? Has the memory of the irrepressible you faded into dust? Has your life become an arduous and repetitive ordeal? Do you keep hurting yourself, and does this recognition keep haunting you, day and night? Are you acting on misguided choices, doing and saying things that virtually guarantee dissatisfaction and unhapppiness? If you answered &quot;Yes&quot; (or even &quot;Maybe&quot;) to any of those questions, have I got good news for you!The best book I have seen that specifically addresses how we can reclaim our mental, emotional and spiritual power from the traps we ourselves have built and continue to nourish is &quot;Self-Defeating Behaviors&quot; by Cudney and Hardy. On second reading, it is a truly phenomenal work. I have already purchased and distributed over two dozen copies. It provides a dynamic model of the way we construct, defend and nurture our self-defeating behaviors, while we simultaneously minimize the real pain heaped upon us and the people around us, and abdicate responsibility for the whole thing!We are each of us presented with a continuous stream of new moments of life, in which we exercise choices. Each of these choices can lead either to a self-defeating behavior or to a behavior that affirms and honors life. At certain times, we &quot;learn&quot; (i.e. we make an invalid association) that we can avoid work/pain/criticism or other fear by choosing a certain escapist behaviors or thoughts. This choice, expressed through various internal and external techniques, results in various prices that we must pay. In order to continue avoiding our fears, we proceed to minimize the prices (by saying, for example, &quot;It's not all that bad; I can stand the discomfort&quot;), and finally, to disown the choice we made (&quot;It's not MY fault; it was my parents/teachers/bullies/social conditions/the government/ghosts/the voices/...&quot;).That cycle, from our choices of developing internal and external techniques to avoid some (mythical) fear(s), and then refusing to pay the price, results in a full-blown self-defeating cycle, which feeds on itself, getting worse and worse, engulfing more and more areas of our lives. Even when new techniques are learned (such as NLP!!) which appear to offer the promise of positive growth, they quickly and effortlessly become swallowed up in the seething vortex of self-defeating behaviors, making it even bigger than ever! This black hole effect can easily escalate from disappointment to depression, food/alcohol/drug abuse, violence, murder and ultimately, suicide. Unless we recognize and terminate this vicious cycle, ALL of our other efforts can lead to naught, mired in our old habits of thought and action."},{"Title":"Self-Defeating Behaviors: Free Yourself from the Habits, Compulsions, Feelings, and Attitudes That Hold You Back","review":"From John Howard Prin, author of STOLEN HOURS: Breaking Free From Secret Addictions, Syren Books 2004This book made a major difference in my life. We all have many kinds of relationships and roles to play in life, and one of those relationships lasts the longest -- from cradle to grave. That's the relationship I have with myself. In my case, that means John Prin's relationship with John Prin. I can be my worst enemy or my best friend. What the authors showed me was that it is my choice. I choose how I relate to me, whether I acknowledge it or not.The main theme? When unhealthy choices are made, we choose self-defeating behaviors that separate us from our core attitudes, beliefs, feelings and values. When healthy choices are made, we choose \\"life-enhancing behaviors\\" that fit or strengthen our core being. Over time, depending on the mix of choices, our lives are either headed for breakdowns or breakthroughs. Thanks to the wisdom and clarity in this book, along with the easy-to-understand charts and diagrams, breakthroughs in my life are happening on a scale I never dreamed possible.The pace is methodical but not plodding. Every sentence and paragraph makes sense as you read it. The authors strive to help readers to define and to behave in ways that serve their own best interests, and to create better selves from the inside out -- as I have learned to do and described in my book STOLEN HOURS. For anyone who has dealt with puzzling failures or intense negative emotions, including addictions and crippling moods, the information and encouragement in this book are a godsend."},{"Title":"Self-Defeating Behaviors: Free Yourself from the Habits, Compulsions, Feelings, and Attitudes That Hold You Back","review":"I got this book based on the other reviews which were mostly positive and I have to say that I was very disappointed. I know reading a negative review isn't as appealing as a positive one, but I think pause should be taken before ordering this book. Self Defeating Behaviors is a great title with little content. As the other reviewers have noted, it does nothing but describe the problem with little practical insight as to how to address it. The description of the problem is also very dry and lengthy. It could have been done in 10 pages, the authors do it in 200 pages so you have to hear the same thing over and over and over again. I found that of little value, especially in light of the fact that there was almost nothing in regards to correcting such behavior.I'm guessing most people read self help books for the purpose of betterment. They want to improve their lives, not just read something 20 times over and over again about what the problem is. The authors simply believe that the problem is that the process of decision making becomes relegated to the subconscious mind over time and that the subconscious can make negative decisions instead of positive ones. There, that one sentence, gives you the whole gist of this book. They give no practical insight as to how to solve this problem, they merely describe it in dull, psychological text type writing. I was very disappointed. I am writing this review for the next person who might be tempted by the title, not realizing it has nothing to offer in terms of personal growth, merely description of a problem and a psychological description."},{"Title":"Self-Defeating Behaviors: Free Yourself from the Habits, Compulsions, Feelings, and Attitudes That Hold You Back","review":"This book IS different. I came across it when investigating a completely different thing from the computer field: data mining. And, well, this book is not so far from that. It is just like gold.Most people have problems, of one sort or another. Life is never so easy. Many people try the typical self-help books and believe that they found a way out. Only to discover later that things have not changed a lot, apart from the good feelings that these self-help books gave to them (probably the only major benefit and the reason why many are best-sellers!). Yet the problem endures and these people will suffer from it further.These books will tell you that you should need to overcome your problems and get to the magical solution (repeated over and over again in about every self-help book): check your values, decide what you want, from what you want make a list of achievable and measurable goals, and make an action plan on how to achieve each of these goals. Some books will add a little variation and tell you that you should not forget to set your priorities right in your action plan or that you should examine your values well. And that's about it. Your problems will be solved and you will be successful like the author(s).\\"The fear of a certain consequence leads to behavior that virtually assures the consequence. This is the way in which self-defeating behaviors are born and nourished.\\" \\"At each moment of life, an individual faces a choice between a road that ends in self-defeat and one that brings him or her closer to a breakthrough. We realize that this statement may seem dramatic, but we stand by it nonetheless.\\"If you have not noted it by now, the language and style of this book is different from the great majority of self-help books. Precise, clear and concise language describes a behavioral problem affecting millions of people and shows how this problem can be solved. Unfortunately solutions to most problems are too often hard to find. To understand yourself, your family, or your friends in trouble, you would better understand this book first.The theory developed and applied by the authors may be wrong or not completely accurate. But if it is just about right, then you may be just a little more than satisfied:\\"It is extremely unlikely for the results of a single self-defeating behavior or life-enhancing behavior to be alarming, exhilarating, or even noticeable. But a series of life-enhancing behaviors will, over time, lead to the sort of breakthrough that comes when our minds, bodies, attitudes and actions are integrated into the wholeness that is the source of our creativity, insight, usefulness, and contentment. On the other hand, a series of choices in favor of self-defeating behaviors will, if left unchecked, bring on physical illness, nervous collapse - and, in extreme cases, even death.\\""},{"Title":"Self-Defeating Behaviors: Free Yourself from the Habits, Compulsions, Feelings, and Attitudes That Hold You Back","review":"if you have ever emotionally fought yourself ( or are doing it now), in your heart you feel wrong but you stubbornly won't quit, get this book.

Although the end of the book offers a methodical process to analyze and change your behaviors, too much of the book is devoted to the clinical study of our behaviors. I would have benefited from the book had it included more case studies and client experiences and less scientific explication."},{"Title":"Self-Defeating Behaviors: Free Yourself from the Habits, Compulsions, Feelings, and Attitudes That Hold You Back","review":"The uncanny knack of these authors to address the \\"foregone conclusions\\" that everyone, even organizations and governments face, as well as individuals, as they process the mission and objectives that motivate them offers a new avenue of change - for both undesirable habits and desires, but also for those we rarely think about within this context, like sex, like racism, like self defense mechanisms, etc., and other \\"impressions\\" of expectations rooted in concrete memories.The \\"default\\" excuse is typically that \\"we do what we have to do\\" heard from the mouths of many men and hierarchially conditioned sources. The authors suggest that not only is this not true, but it is obviously false, an attempt to rationalize our way through life.The authors do acknowledge, however, that even by stripping away all defense mechanisms and achieving what could be called an \\"elusive perfection\\" of self control, and self discipline in adaptation, life may not be better, healthier, or more comfortable, but the goal of form over substance is apparently enough to conclude that doing so may be worthwhile. There are many who would disagree given the nature of the world today, and the probability of humans being poised strategically upon the brink of insignificance. The survival mechanisms that mankind has invented to appease the spirit may be well rooted in the recognition that perfect individuals cannot exist, and that more perfect ones are often seen as aloof and arrogant, the result of marketing the potential of a too healthy, too perfect a society.Though the process of self inquiry is limited by the authors to obvious ones associated to bad habits such as smoking, drinking, and excesses that require control to overcome obsesity-oriented conduct, for example, they hint at the greater altruistic value of examining our conclusions that perform traditional self defense like challenging our presumptions of race, age, gender, disability, etc. that may provide new avenues of progress.Worth the read just to question whether self defeatism is not a part of general society as we are born into it, and whether or not it must be that way. Most will see that the effort to fix it may not be worth the cost, however, especially when the perceptions we challenge are those created by society throughout history rather than by specific individuals themselves to deal with that society. In the growing income disparity of America, this \\"Big Fish\\" book may not offer the kinds of solutions that overcome such systemic problems of society for which unhealthy and sheeplike behavior has been adopted to use as that self defense."},{"Title":"Self-Defeating Behaviors: Free Yourself from the Habits, Compulsions, Feelings, and Attitudes That Hold You Back","review":"This is a great book if you want a thorough analysis as to why people develop and perpetuate self-defeating behaviors. However, as far as correcting these behaviors, I did not find this book to be specific enough. To correct these behaviors, the authors say to rectify faulty conclusions (which was very helpful) and then come up with a replacement technique (which was not specific enough.) I feel like purchasing a book about your own specific self-defeating behavior would be better for finding a replacement technique because this book discusses self-defeating behaviors generally. For example, for a behavior like procrastination, no real ideas were given as to what could be an effective replacement technique. You can't replace procrastination with another replacement \\"activity\\" because the whole point is to get back to studying. (ie: for a compulsive shopper, instead of going shopping, the example was that she spent quality time with her kids.) Though this book has its flaws depending on what your self defeating behavior is, it is definitely an informative read."},{"Title":"Self-Defeating Behaviors: Free Yourself from the Habits, Compulsions, Feelings, and Attitudes That Hold You Back","review":"This book presents a detailed behavioural model and spends over two thirds of the time building and explaining this model. With some thought on behalf of the reader this model can be applied to your own situations and seems to work well towards understanding your own patterns. In this regard, the book is a worthwhile read.As to actually fixing what's wrong the text is a bit thin. The author states that a thorough understanding of the behaviour is required before it can be addressed. It is also stressed that the process will take time and effort.

It describes in detail how people relate to culture and how the messages received by culture causes individuals to draw conclusions about life and develop protective behaviors. These behaviors which at first seem to help one to avoid psychological pain, eventually causes problems of its own when it is done unconsciously in all situations. The book clearly shows how faulty conclusions can be drawn by a person based on an experience and how fear keeps people locked in a cycle of behaviors that are self defeating and how testing the logic of conclusions and replacing self defeating behaviors with truly fulfilling behaviors can assist in breaking the cycle. My eyes were opened and my understanding of my decision making process broadened. One of the best tools that I received from this book is the concept of living consciously in every new moment, seeing new moments as new opportunities to make decisions that will bring me closer to my true self, and to slow down my decision making process instead of doing things automatically. Now I ask myself questions that I didn't ask before and I observe my own behavior and thoughts more often.

This volume presents a stunning architectural tour of the twelve governors' mansions of the Midwest. The unique grace and content of this book makes it a must-have for those who appreciate architectural style, as well as travelers and those who are native to the Midwest. Each mansion has its own chapter, complete with exquisite photographs that capture the impressive interior and exterior of each building. Each of the governors' mansions has a unique story to tell, and the author has captured the essence of each story through the details of the construction, the style, and anecdotes of the various First Families. Each mansion has had its share of First Ladies who have left their imprint and their sense of style. These mansions are far more than just dwellings for the governors and their families; they are cultural symbols for each state. Bravo to the author for writing a book of history, culture, architecture, and beauty. I hope we can look forward to more volumes on the rest of the fifty states.Sue Hall, Librarian"},{"Title":"Governors' Mansions of the Midwest","review":"What a great book on some wonderful mansions!

He does a good job showing how Revelation is written in signs and symbols (as Rev. 1:1 in the Greek clearly says) rather than being written as a literal account. Through consistently using the Bible to interpret the Bible (not simply prooftexting), Hendrickson shows that Revelation is not a book which appeals to our desire for the sensational. Dispensationalists would do well to seriously read this second best book I've ever read on Revelation. Hendrickson is not perfect though. He occasionally breaks out of his, and the Bible's, consistent method of interpretation in this book and uses some &quot;literal&quot; interpreting (such as that concerning the black plague). Overall, I recommend this book at an excellent starting point, but not as an ending point. There is a book which takes the technique of using the Bible to interpret the Bible to a much higher level (The Days of Vengeance by Chilton), but whereas Chilton's book is over 700 pages, Hendrickson's book is about a fourth the size. One would do well to begin at the shorter, simpler exegesis of Hendrickson before moving on to something so completely comprehensive as Chilton's book. More than Conquerors is a presentation of historic amillennialism and there are other forms of amillennialism to consider as well (futurist and post-millennial for instance). But the main issue is the refreshing approach Hendrickson restores to interpreting the Bible; that is, he uses the Bible, not the newspaper, to determine the meaning of the prophecies. For this one reason, I believe this book should be on people's reading list. And dispensensationalists would do well to put down the newspaper and turn off the evening news (which are never good commentaries on the Bible) and pick up Hendrickson's book. I personally do not ultimately agree with Hendrickson's specific interpretation in every area, but I agree with his method of using the Bible to interpret the Bible. Therefore, it's a good text book on Bible interpretation in process, even though one may not ultimately agree with the book's final conclusions."},{"Title":"More than conquerors: An interpretation of the book of Revelation","review":"This is a classic interpretation of Revelation and one that I recommend for the layman. The first edition came out in 1939. It is of the idealist and Amillennial School, which makes Revelation meaningful today and not just to the future. He recognises that the purpose of Revelation is to 'comfort the militant Church in its struggle against the forces of evil'. It is not a verse by verse commentary, he discusses one passage at a time, which means that the book is readable. He is, as you would expect, thoroughly biblical and avoids the speculative nonsense that surrounds Revelation today. If you want a scriptural interpretation of Revelation then I warmly commend this book to you."},{"Title":"More than conquerors: An interpretation of the book of Revelation","review":"The Revelation of Christ has been given to the people of God as part of God's Word for the purpose of comforting them as they pass through the trials and hardships of this foreign land. Certainly the book was directed to the Christians who originally received it, but the beautiful thing about it is that it was also designed to be meaningful to God's people living throughout every generation until the Lord's return. In reading this final book of the Bible, there will be no need to determine the meaning of its symbolism based on contemporary circumstances. Rather, the book itself, as it is understood in light of the Gospel truth and the rest of Scripture, is directly applicable to the day and age in which we are living as it was meant to be for such saints as Augustine, Aquinas, Luther, or Spurgeon.William's Hendriksen presents this view of the book in his commentary by the method of scripture interpreting scripture, not looking for prophetic fulfillment in specific events of his day (1939, when the book was written). Instead, he saw how needful it was to show the relevance of Revelation to every generation of God's people. The main theme of the Apocalypse, as he puts it, is the struggle between Christ and His followers (the Church) and Satan and his followers (the world), ultimately ending in final victory for the King and His faithful ones. Hence, the title of the commentary, \\"More Than Conquerors\\". It seems like a pretty simple idea, and perhaps this is why many stumble as they try to \\"figure out\\" the meaning of the symbols in the book, looking for their fulfillment in specific historical or future events (the latter being more guesswork than anything else).Finally, I would like to say that this view of Revelation would be especially relevant to those brothers and sisters who are suffering persecution right now as we speak for the sake of the Gospel. If they could know its significance for them and not be influenced by the unfortunately general misunderstanding of the Revelation that comes from American evangelicals today, their joy to press on would be increased even more than it is already! \\"And they overcame [the accuser] by the word of their testimony, and they did not love their lives to the death.\\" (Revelation 12:11). May the Lord bless them immensely with an added measure of his presence and joy, that many of us may never see in this lifetime!Overall, Hendriksen's commentary is a solid introduction to the Revelation, although there may be some details with which I would disagree. And, as others have already stated, it sheds much light on the most effective way to interpret Scripture (that is, in light of the rest of Scripture). Beyond this, you may want to obtain a copy of Lenski's commentary or a related book by Hoekema."},{"Title":"More than conquerors: An interpretation of the book of Revelation","review":"We have been preparing to study Revelation, and have been using excellent aids such as Steve Gregg's Revelation: four views: a parallel commentary, Michael Wilcock's I Saw Heaven Opened [in the Bible Speaks Today series] and Robert Mounce's commentary, but I had left my Hendriksen, which I bought 30 years ago, on the shelf.I have always been amused that the title comes from Romans 8, not Revelation!I am so glad I opened it again! This book is sane and helpful. Written in 1939, it would have been so tempting for the writer to identify the cataclysmic events of the time with what we find in Revelation, but instead he has begun by studying the time in which the book was originally written, and thinking about what it would have meant to the first hearers and readers.Hendriksen is one of those who sees the book divided into 7 parallel sections, each of which covers the same territory, but in a different way. His interpretation makes the book meaningful for all Christians in all ages, not just the original recipients and certainly not a select group who live just before the Second Coming of Christ.Whatever books you are using on Revelation, I highly recommend you include More Than Conquerors in your study."},{"Title":"More than conquerors: An interpretation of the book of Revelation","review":"Originally published in 1940, William Hendriksen's More Than Conquerors stands as one of the classic commentaries on the Book of Revelation available that combines excellent scholarship and a style that makes it accessible to the layman. Rejecting the sensationalism so common wth interpretations of the last book of the Bible, the author takes an approach that places the book in its proper historical and cultural context and remains faithful to the message of the Gospel. The result is so powerful that the often intimidating subject of the eschaton becomes clear and flows naturally from the Gospel message the Church has preached for two millennia.Rather than taking the book as a linear historical narrative, Hendriksen appraoches it as an example of recapitulation (common in apocalyptic writings) where passages go over the same time period repeatedly albeit with the emphasis given in a different place. He points out that Revelation is naturally broken into seven parts with the number seven appearing as a recurring them within the book. Each section goes a little further and ends with a vision of the victorious Lord. Numerous other parallels are also pointed out to add to the impression of a repetitive pattern in the book.An important theme throughout is that, contrary to the nonesense one hears from today's prophecy pundits, the main figure of Revelation is not the antichrist but rather is a revelation of Jesus Christ as the very beginning of the book announces. Thus in any proper interpretation, our attention should not be drawn to the antichrist, Israel, the Arabs, the Russians, the European Union, China, Iraq, America, or anything or anyone but Jesus Christ. Hendricksen keeps this firmly in mind and points out time and time again that there is comfort to be had in a proper Christ-centered reading of Revelation.One criticism one hears of this book by fans of the popular \\"prophecy experts\\" is that the book takes a \\"symbolic\\" rather than \\"literal\\" approach to the text. This surely misses the point of any reasonable interpretation as it cannot be denied that for a book replete with symbolism, the symbolic interpretation isthe literal interpretation. Thus there is no uncalled for \\"spiritualizing\\" of the text but only a sound exegesis.More Than Conquerors presents a sound commentary on Revelation that settles on an amillennial position grounded in a moderate idealism. Whether one agrees with every detail of the exegesis or not, a view of the text that is unmistakenly Christocentric is certainly a marked improvement from much of the drivel that gets passed off as exegesis on the end times. For both the insight and the comforting view of Revelation contained therein, it is essential reading."},{"Title":"More than conquerors: An interpretation of the book of Revelation","review":"It is apparent that Hendriksen did NOT write this book with Times magazine, Newsweek or the New York Times in his left hand. Using the analogy of faith and allowing clear, New Testament scripture to interpret the symbolical apocalyptic literature, Hendriksen gives us a refreshing rendition of the Idealist interpretation. Although \\"progressive parallelism\\" is no novel methodology, it is aptly defended and applied by this book. \\"More than Conquerors\\" is a good primer to the historic amillennial view of eschatology; other pertinent works the reader might be interested in is \`A case for Amillennialism' by Kim Riddlebarger & \\"Amillenialism Today\\" by William Cox. It is good hermeneutic to allow the Scripture to speak for itself; dispensationalists should quit using ad hominem arguments in their eisegesis i.e. anti-Semitism, liberal allegoricalness. I believe amillenialists did not arrive at their conclusion due to racist sentiments or other carnal inclinations. A good hermeneutic text would be Milton Terry's Biblical Hermeneutics published by Wipf & Stock Publishers. Get this book!"},{"Title":"More than conquerors: An interpretation of the book of Revelation","review":"This commentary avoids most of the major pitfalls of Revelation commentary-- minutiae, prognostication, current events speculation. It focuses on the true subject of ALL scripture-- the Lord Jesus Christ. Christ reigns is a message of hope for all time. End time speculators bow before your king, not an image of the future that glorifies any nation or ethnicity. The elect of all peoples will sing his praises for all eternity. Start now by reading this book."},{"Title":"More than conquerors: An interpretation of the book of Revelation","review":"Popular interpretations of the book of Revelation describe it as the consummation and culmination at the end of the world that center around particular isolated events and figures or characters that happen in isolated future time period. For instance, the beasts and the harlot are represented by some specific charming satanic influential powerful deceptive individuals or organizations. Similarly, the riders and the horses as well as the trumpets and the bowls represent specific horrific series of events that happen just before the Lord Jesus Christ returns.The critical, not total error of this school of interpretation is it disregards the key statement that Jesus made in verse 19 of the first chapter that the visions He was about to show John are \\"those that are and those that are to take place after this,\\" indicating that they represent the events, characters and conditions that were already going in John's days and continuing until \\"those to take place after these\\" referring the second coming of and the last judgment by the Lord Jesus Christ. In other words, the nature of most symbols and visions in Revelation, that Hendricksen exquisitely teaches with careful and extensive comparison and consideration with other prophetic Old and New Testament passages, is progressive and parallel, not culminative and isolated, except in a few cases. The parallel nature of Revelation teaches the events that happened, and are presently happening and will happen in the future in the physical visible world along with all the characters involved, are parallel to what is going on in the spiritual world, that is, the battle between God and Satan, the heavenly army against the army of darkness.The culminative interpretation of Revelation may entertain and satisfy intellectual curiosity and fancy without affecting the heart much, largely because it only shows things that happen in the future with little or no consequences or applications at the present time. The progressive and parallel interpretation, on the contrary, is both dead serious and full of hope. It is dead serious because the majority of the visions represents what is going on even today and therefore, has a direct implication to everything; the state of the world governments and every socio-economic structure, education, philosophy, religion, down to the personal level, the state of the soul of men.In interpreting the seven lampstands, it is sobering to learn, in light of the progressive nature of Revelation that every Christian church throughout the ages falls in the category of one of the seven churches the lampstands represent. They can be further divided into three sub-categories. The first one is the faithful church, with genuine and sincere devotions, sacrifices and services to Christ represented by Philadelphia and Smyrna, wherein Hendricksen included an incredible account of the display of the glory of Christ through the faith and martyrdom of the first bishop of Smyrna, a disciple of John himself, Polycarp, who was burned at stake (p.64). The second one is the church that seems to consist of serious genuine believers, yet as a whole, the church fails to discipline and disciple carnal worldly compromising members, represented by Ephesus, Pergamum and Thyatira. There are several passages in the Bible that warn against being lukewarm Christians, yet few are as serious or more serious than that given by Jesus to the churches represented by Sardis and Laodicea, the third sub-category. Their characteristics are described, as Hendricksen puts it as,\\"arrogant, confident, and sure. The self-satisfied and boastful inhabitants of Sardis had seen destruction coming upon them \`as thief in the night', most suddenly and unexpectedly. Sardis was a very \`peaceful' church. It enjoyed peace, but it was the peace of the cemetery!The forms were there, the ceremonies, the religious customs, the traditions, the services, but the real essence was lacking. The forms were empty. Faith, hope, and love, genuine and sincere, were lacking. In the sight of men, Sardis may seem to be a splendid church. But before God, this church is dead\\" (p. 73-74).Christians, of whom let me be the first to admit, but specially the mega-churches, have plenty to learn, examine and fear from Laodicea, as explained by Hendricksen,\\"It was the homes of the millionaires. There were, of course, theatres, a stadium, and a gymnasium equipped with baths. It was a city of bankers and finance. Even the church people manifested this same proud, defiant, conceited attitude. Perhaps they imagined that their wealth was a sign of God's special favor. They had imbibed the spirit that characterized the city as a whole. They boasted of their spiritual riches, ... were not troubled with any consciousness of sin, lukewarm, tepid, flabby, half-hearted, limp, always ready to compromise, indifferent, listless, \`we-are-all-good-people-here-in-Laodicea' attitude. Their entire religion is just so much sham and pretence, so much hypocrisy\\" (p.76-77).In regard to the rider of the horses, the readers may be stunned upon learning who the Rider of the white horse is by studying His color, and the fact that He receives a crown, and that He conquers, and the other three riders follow Him and they are subservient to Him, (p.94-96). I find it also striking to learn what the riders of the red and pale horses represent, whose main clue is found by identifying the type of sword they carry; the short sword used as a sacrificial knife (machaira) and the long, heavy great sword (rhompaia), respectively. One should only read world history and the news around the world, including what happens to Christians in hostile nations to understand the reality of the red, black and pale horses; past, present and future. Hendricksen commented, \\"No century is without its rider upon the red horse,\\" (p.101) on which I should add, \\"and the black and pale horses, as well as most importantly, the white horse.\\"The readers should not miss the details of the dragon, but more importantly the helpers of the dragon; the beast of the sea, the beast of the earth and the harlot, because of the extreme danger they present today. It is probably best summarized by what Hendriksen wrote,\\"The first angel is sent to those who \`sit on the earth.' That characterizes men in general on the eve of the judgment; they sit on earth. They are easy-going, indifferent, unconcerned, listless, and careless... Similarly, just before the final judgment people in general will be fascinated with earthly charms to such an extent that they will not realize that the judgment is creeping upon them, coming closer and closer. They are unconscious of their peril, until it is too late,\\" (p.153).The words that often describe Revelation are \\"cryptic, symbolic, advanced, for pro's only\\" which is ironic considering to reveal means to make known, or to disclose. Yet after reading Hendricksen's study, though it still doesn't solve some elements of mystery, I would not hesitate to recommend this book to everyone due to its solid exegesis, clarity, weight, breadth, depth, intensity and sobriety, for Christians; new and mature, ministers, even as an evangelistic tool for non-Christians because its focus is not to entertain the fancy, but it centers on the great Conquering and Conqueror Sovereign, of whom and in whom the apostle Paul rejoices in his epistle to the Romans, \\"No, in all these things, we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us. For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers, nor height nor depths, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.\\""},{"Title":"More than conquerors: An interpretation of the book of Revelation","review":"this is possibly the best single commentary to begin your study of revelation. the pastoral love that flows throughout the pages of this book is wonderful. dr. hendriksen makes every aspect of this book useful and applicable. once you start it, you will want to finsih it. this is the classic reformed amillennial idealistic interpretation.

It is amazing that so many self-proclaimed &quot;Bible prophecy scholars&quot; honestly believe Revelation is completely literal (although they can't even follow that all the way). The numbers are especially symbolic. Are we really to believe, as the dispensationalists tell us, that the 144,000 are a literal number of Jews? That exact, round, even number? (The number 144 also appears elsewhere in Revelation, but hey, perhaps that's literal too--of course not.) It is impossible for the futurists to be right. Hendriksen presents a clear, thorough case for a spiritual interpretation of Revelation, as well as the progressive parallelism view. Furthermore, he does an excellent job in the book of critiquing and showing the falsehoods of the postmillennial view (a false, carnal optimism) so trying to infiltrate Reformed circles."},{"Title":"More than conquerors: An interpretation of the book of Revelation","review":"This is quite simple far and away the best commentary on the Book of Revelation that I have ever read.

This book, More Than Conquerers, is a very studious and careful discernment of the truths contained in this marvelous book and the message that God intended for us to receive is, in my opinion, enlightened and made simple enough to apply to the life of The Church in the here and now and not altogether some event(s) we must await to take place in the some near or distant future.

For example, he interprets the 'angel to the church of Ephesus' as the minister of Ephesus. I think things like that may be said without any explanation from time to time...and that is a weakness of the book. Some of the material is dated and reflects views that are not as common among scholars any longer..for example he teaches that Revelation 3:15-16 to the Laodiceans contains the concept that the \\"cold\\" are the heathen who have not had any contact with the Lord. He misses the point (usefulness-not so much an emphasis on zeal) and would probably rewrite that if he were here today.Though it needs updating this book is not an exhaustive resource. It's more of a devotional, yet scholarly interpretation of Revelation.Along with Vern Poythress on this same topic, this one is up there at the top of my list.Another strength of this book I'd like to mention is the simple, yet informative summaries he gives of a situation. Following up on the Ephesus example above, when describing the Church in Ephesus he takes the time to go over some apostolic history with the city and also mentions briefly some history through the centuries as it is relevant. So his summary paragraphs can be very useful for teachers of any view on Revelation.

It makes very little reference to the domesticated Ringneck and White Doves (Streptopelia risoria), which make excellent, tame pets and have different requirements, in terms of caging and care. Also, what references it does make to domesticated doves is somewhat confusing and inconsistent.For example, photos of domesticated Ringneck and White Doves (Streptopelia risoria) are labeled, alternatively, &quot;collared pigeons&quot; on page 16, and &quot;collared doves&quot; on pages 37 and 40. However, on page 5, the birds labeled as &quot;collared doves&quot; are probably the Eurasian Collared Dove (Streptopelia deocato). I realize that both species may be described by the same common names. However. I think the author should have done a better job in describing which is which, since 'Streptopelia risoria' is extremely domesticated and suitable as a finger-tamed house pet whereas 'Streptopelia deocato' is a wild species suitable only for an outdoor aviary.This confusion is not only in the photos but in the text as well. For example, the sections on &quot;Housing&quot; and &quot;Doves as Pets&quot; make little or no distinction between the wild and domesticated species. It implies all doves are basically untamable and require large aviaries but then also gets into a discussion about cages. Cages are really only suitable for domesticated species but the book doesn't SAY this anywhere. There is also no mention, anywhere in the book, of the great pet qualities that domesticated Ringneck and White Doves have. So, in my opinion, this book would be very confusing for someone who purchased a tame, domesticated Ringneck or White Dove and want to know how to care for their new pet.I think this book would be fine if it just stuck to wild dove species. In fact, it should be renamed &quot;Wild Doves&quot;. Domesticated Ringneck and White Doves (Streptopelia risoria) really deserve their own separate book but, unfortunately, there really isn't one out there yet. &quot;Doves&quot; by Michael Gos makes a better distinction between domesticated and wild species but his book also tries to cover both types, in one one book, and can also be similarly confusing in text and photo labeling."},{"Title":"Doves (A Complete Pet Owner's Manual)","review":"As a dove owner,I have found this book to be a very clear treatment of dove species, behavior, and health needs.

I am so glad these 2 German classics had been translated and reprinted into English, I don't know what I would have done without them.~~EK"},{"Title":"Doves (A Complete Pet Owner's Manual)","review":"This book is great. I looked for the information in this book all over the place for months. This book has absolutely everything you need or would want to know about being a dove owner. This book should be in every dove owner's book collection."},{"Title":"Introduction to the philosophy of being","review":"As the book moves from chapter to chapter the reading gets easier. Klubertanz does an excellent job of writing for individuals to understand the philosophy of being. This book could be used as an \\"extra read\\" for the student to help understand \\"being\\". Klubertanz suggests the reading and rereading of particular chapters before proceding on to read the entire book, this I find is helpful. I'm glad this was my first book on the philosophy of being. I learned by seeing the \\"esse\\" and \\"abstracting\\" and identifying these \\"things\\" in an everyday argument. Abstraction, esse, and things will be understood by the time the reader finishes the second chapter."},{"Title":"Words of the Dragon: Interviews, 1958-1973 (Bruce Lee Library)","review":"The title of the book Words of the Dragon, Interviews 1985-1973\\" reflects a little bit a wrong impression of the book. A better title would be Words about the Dragon, Press Report 1958-1973\\". At the beginning of the book a few things are repeated over and over again. It seems that it would be difficult to investigate e.g. how old Bruce Lee was when his parents returned to Hong Kong. Only at the end of this book one could catch a small impression of Bruce Lee's philosophy. His carrier as an actor comes primarily up. The US Press didn't understand until Bruce Lee's death that his art wasn't Karate. I expected more philosophically thoughts and background knowledge of his martial art. The Bruce Lee connoisseur gained no really news and I thing the book isn't stimulating for beginners. I was impressed by the letter of Brandon Lee, which is printed at the end of the book."},{"Title":"Words of the Dragon: Interviews, 1958-1973 (Bruce Lee Library)","review":"It was a pretty good book, however, like people have mentioned, some of the stuff is repeated. A lot. I don't know how many interviews he did in that period of time, but I wish they had done better choosing what they did instead of repeating so much of the same stuff. The one I really wish they had put in there was his most famous interview. The one they video taped, where he talks about everything while trying out for a tv show. If you've seen the new Enter the Dragon 25 year anniversary, its the one before the movie that lasts like 15 minutes. They should have included a text version in this book.If you find this book on sale at a used book store or something, pick it up, it's worth it. But don't go spending full price for this, because it isn't worth it. If you find it on Amazon here along with another book (like Tao of Gung Fu and this together) then go ahead and get them. To buy this book solo though would just be a waste, you would have it done within a couple of hours."},{"Title":"Words of the Dragon: Interviews, 1958-1973 (Bruce Lee Library)","review":"I heard several of these interviews from other sources. If YOU haven't then the book might be worth your time and money, but then again even the interviews in the book get old. Each interviewer asks the same questions and Bruce gives the same answers. It's less thrilling than other Bruce Lee books."},{"Title":"Words of the Dragon: Interviews, 1958-1973 (Bruce Lee Library)","review":"for lee fans and martial arts fans alike, &quot;words of the dragon&quot; provides a unique perspective on the life of an extraordinary man. through newspaper articles, tv and radio interviews, etc. mr. little (with kind cooperation of linda lee cadwell)has pieced together a media history of bruce lee. readers find a chance to get to know the lighthearted and the intense mr. lee, the fighter, the artist, the family man. though we all realize how the media can turn words around, or add them, etc., the author has included corrections at the end of each chapter, which, in themselves, must be read to understand the full story.very well-crafted, and intelligently pieced together, &quot;words of the dragon&quot; will take the reader to a new level of understanding of the mind and heart of the great bruce lee."},{"Title":"Words of the Dragon: Interviews, 1958-1973 (Bruce Lee Library)","review":"Like all fans of Bruce Lee I always wanted to get closer to the &#34;Master&#34; of Kung Fu.

The only thing i do not like about this book is one peice of information which it gives without correcting it in the notes. He didn't die in hospital; he died in the house of an actress which he and Raymond Chow had gone to see about offering her a role in the film Game of Death. While they were there, Bruce got a headache and took a pill and retired to the bedroom. That's where he died."},{"Title":"National Geographic - December 2004","review":"\\"On the Trail of Bin Laden\\" tells of the environment along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border where Bin Laden is reportedly hiding from American forces. Though he has not been seen since Tora Bora, electronic intercepts, statements from captured al Qaeda fighters, and videotapes are persuasive evidence that Bin Laden is actually here.The author begins by visiting a Tora Bora home where Bin Laden stayed. Bribes to tribal elders helped him flee from the area with large caves. A great wall of mountains, a plethora of illegal weapons (assault rifles, grenade launchers, hashish, and opium are readily available), and 25 million Pashtuns duty-bound to help anyone seeking refuge complicate the search, despite a $25 million reward.A powerful household might have an antiaircraft gun mounted in the watchtower, a mortar or two, a dozen or so AK-47s, and a stack of RPGs. A tribal council of elders (jirga) provides final judgment on land disputes, vendettas, and sanctuary. Yet, family feuds continue on for decades - with a priority higher than most other issues."},{"Title":"Standard Meridian Points of Acupuncture: Charts","review":"If you are looking for a detailed description of acu points and are trained in the US perhaps this is not for you. These are the most affordable posters that one can buy. For others one expects to pay &#62;$60. It illustrates all 14 meridians, and extra points(EX). It nicely lists the names in PinYin with tones so the LACs can pronounce them properly. It also has the Traditional Chinese names. The Int'l Standard Org(ISO) designations (LU,ST,GB etc.) are not printed on the charts. Rather, they are included in the 44 page phamphlet.

On subsequent pages you will learn that he is our King. If he is not your King you probably should steer clear of this book."},{"Title":"i like winter","review":"I like this book very much. The book is written in verse and is very rhythmical and catchy...a small child could easily learn this little poem story if it is read to them often. It tells of all the fun things a child does in winter...making snowmen, sledding, ice skating, snowball fights, getting ready for Christmas, Christmas Day, and even makes mention of Valentine's Day, which IS a winter holiday! Yes, this book does mention Jesus and as a Christian I like that...He is my King! This book also mentions Santa Claus...we don't have our children believe in Santa, to them he is just a fun story, so Santa in this book isn't an offense to me. Like all Lois Lenski's books, she is very sensitive to a child's mind and what a child likes. Her books are always simple, calm, peaceful, kind, which is why I believe they have stood the test of time...this one is 55 yrs. old and still loved so much. A cute little book for any child and would make a nice Christmas present or even a stocking stuffer, as it is small and \\"child sized\\"."},{"Title":"i like winter","review":"My daughter loved this book from the library, so we bought our own copy. As a toddler, it was her absolute favorite. We acquired the whole Lois Lenski season series and like them all, but I Like Winter is still our favorite! We sing it when we read it out-loud, maybe that's what makes it so fun."},{"Title":"i like winter","review":"A lovely, short, rhyming book for children from toddler age to early readers. Children love the rhymes and the simple, pleasing illustrations. This is a bedtime favorite of my nephews aged 1 1/2 to 5. Nothing in here to give nightmares! I am so glad they are re-printing these Lois Lenski books we enjoyed in the 50's when I was a child."},{"Title":"Building Secure Wireless Networks with 802.11","review":"Wireless networking is the hottest technological innovation of the past few years, but the unpleasant fact is that security is its greatest weakness. In a crowded market of computer security titles, a niche exists for a book that lays out wireless security problems and couples them with solutions.Unfortunately, this is not that book. While well written, the book is thin on security matters; security is only first dealt with in chapter six. That coverage is interrupted by five chapters on building wireless networks. Discussion of security doesn't resume until chapter twelve.Despite its title, the book is more about setting up, configuring, and managing wireless networks, with occasional digressions into security issues. Only about 35 pages of this 320-page book directly deal with wireless security. The book would make a good introduction for designing wireless networks, but it falls short as a security reference."},{"Title":"Building Secure Wireless Networks with 802.11","review":"The book is easy to follow and doesn't include unnecessary information or page fillers. The book walks you through details of 802.11 deployment issues and security concerns. I was able to install a wireless LAN by following this book in about 2 days and was able to convince people at my work about the security concerns. The book also deals with 802.1x which I really needed to know (note: the review by publisher doesn't say anything about it). The best things I like about this book is that authors have presented facts and they have not taken any sides."},{"Title":"Building Secure Wireless Networks with 802.11","review":"The authors of this book have extensive first-hand knowledge of the technology and concepts they write about. Recently, wireless networks have exploded onto the home and business markets. The ability to network computers without having to string cables across your home or hire a 3rd-party company to wire new network jacks is very appealing.The problem is that if your network traffic is flying through the air to your wireless networked computers, it can also be intercepted by unintended recipients. If you are going to delve into the world of wireless networking, it is important that you read this book to learn how to do so securely.(...)"},{"Title":"Building Secure Wireless Networks with 802.11","review":"Home wireless networks are on the rise because of 802.11b, but the security for them is lagging behind.

Aviation in the formative years, particularly in the Pacific theater."},{"Title":"Flight to Anywhere: A Navigator's Life","review":"This is a wonderful read for those who shared some of the life of the early days of aviation in the transition from by guess and by God, and by the seat of their pants, to the mass transportation that airline travel has become. A peek into a little known part of the way it really was. An autobiographical account of an interesting part of aviation history. Highly recommended. Even if you are not interested in aviation, it is an entertaining account of an era that will never ever be repeated."},{"Title":"Hot Mamas: The Ultimate Guide to Staying Sexy Throughout Your Pregnancy and the Months Beyond","review":"I highly recommend this book to any couple that is worried about how to get through pregnancy without losing a healthy sexual aspect to their relationship. Paget's book does a great job explaining how you can remain sexual during pregnancy and it gives good advice on how to reignite a sexual relationship after the baby's birth once you are new parents. Paget has a very conversational and easy-to-read writing style that gets across important sexual health information. This is a great book for clearing up any myths or misinformation you might have about sex and pregnancy. It does a great job detailing advice and tips on safe sexual techniques during each trimester of pregnancy. The diagrams are effective too."},{"Title":"Hot Mamas: The Ultimate Guide to Staying Sexy Throughout Your Pregnancy and the Months Beyond","review":"For this newly pregnant health educator, this was a nice, solid read on this topic. Paget does a good job establishing herself as a resource (including that she conducted an online survey of 100 or so couples) and she incorporates expert and interviewee (preggies and their male partners) comments really well throughout. Her info is solid and intelligent, but... I wasn't blown away by it. I found her tone a bit on the stuffy side, and even a bit of a downer in parts, e.g., she actually goes after \\"frumpy\\" preggies. Paget does ack. the downers that can come along w/ pregnancy and she doesn't always try to give advice that helps lovers to deal beyond decent fashion advice. In hoping for something that would live up to its title, my husband and I were a bit disappointed overall."},{"Title":"Hot Mamas: The Ultimate Guide to Staying Sexy Throughout Your Pregnancy and the Months Beyond","review":"This book, while well-informed and easy to read, is a bit stuffy for my taste. If you can't handle \\"Your Orgasmic Pregnancy: Little Sex Secrets Every Hot Mama Should\\" know because you're offended by frank talk and womanly wit, this is the book for you!However, I daresay, that the voice in this book is hardly 'hot mama'-ish.

Then he goes into causes and effects. He explains the dangers and drawbacks of vomiting repeatedly and using laxatives. But that's just the first 1/3 of the book.The rest of the book is a plan for recovering from bulimia and/or binge-eating. It's a step by step procedure... everything in it makes good sense and has been tested and tried by others before, with success. The plan is the best part of the book... the author sets forth a plan for recovery, including a plan for what to do if you feel like going on a binge.Besides the plan, the author makes helpful points throughout the book, like:about alcohol-- \\"if you drink excessively you will not be able to make full use of this program\\"about overeating just once-- \\"no one meal can have a significant effect on your weight\\"about how you're not alone-- \\"enlist the assistance (with the meal plan) of a close friend or relative\\"about laxatives-- \\"laxatives are wholly ineffective as a method for losing weight or compensating for overeating\\"about binging and its effect on weight -- \\"the number of calories absorbed from binges, even after vomiting, is greater than what would have been absorbed in a binge-free day during which normal meals and snacks would have been eaten\\"about eating normal meals-- \\"it is usual that people who replace a pattern of dieting and binge-eating with regular meals do not gain weight.\\"The bottom line: this book by Peter Cooper is easy to use, and the points in it are sound, for those suffering from bulimia, binge-eating, even others who have unsound eating habits."},{"Title":"Bulimia Nervosa and Binge-Eating: A Guide to Recovery","review":"Whilst this book contained some good points, I felt that it left me alone too much especially in the first weeks.

Without it, I'd be stuck having to call someone in and paying good money to have the work done. This book is a great resource for homeowners (or even renters) and is all the home repair and improvement manual that many people would ever need.The book is broken into sections, organized by the type of work they cover. There's a chapter on Electrical, one on Plumbing, one on Power Tools, etc. The Emergency Repairs section at the beginning of the book could be invaluable in making your home safe and habitable if necessary until a professional can come in to make permanent repairs."},{"Title":"New Complete Do-It-Yourself Manual","review":"This book is extremely good at presenting a given home repair task to the novice and covers most of what you'll ever need to do to your home.It gives a general listing of the types of tools you'll use and includes some incredibly useful tricks of the trade like how to hide nail heads (aka &quot;blind nailing&quot;) and using wedges of wood to prevent pry bars from destroying more than you want.I especially like the supplementary material it provides. For example in the electrical section, it talks about how electricity is typically wired in a home. It further offers guidelines on such things as the number of receptaccles per (15 amp) circuit and how a layout of circuits might look around your home.A minor nit is the book lacks is a way to estimate how appropriate a given task is for you. For example, they talk about installing and removing a bathtub, but don't include any conventional warning like &quot;Are you out of your mind?&quot; or &quot;Maybe you should not attempt this.&quot; (Removing and installing bathtubs is considered to be both time consuming and labor intensive.)Overall, this is a great reference book for the homeowner and provides great diagrams and descriptive text of tasks you may soon need to attempt."},{"Title":"New Complete Do-It-Yourself Manual","review":"This book is GREAT for the beginning do-it-yourselfer.

I particularly liked the section on fasteners - it was something I didn't understand, although I thought I should!, and it gave a detailed description of what to use where, and why.

The illustrations are clear and the wording straight forward and easy to follow. If it's a Reader's Digest book, it sure to be worth every penny...and this book is. For the home handy-man, or woman (single woman will love this book,) this manual is a &quot;must-have reference guide&quot; to a ton of problems that could cost a fortune if you had to hire a professional to make the repairs.

That's why it's so amazing that I could use the instructions in this book to fix things! The water in my bathroom sink wasn't flowing properly, and by reading the instructions and looking (closely) at the illustrations, my friend and I were actually able to fix it! The book also gives excellent ideas on how to ensure your gutters are keeping water away from the foundation of your house, and how to do all sorts of other helpful things you'd never think of if you hadn't read it. I can't recommend it highly enough. I'm sure you'll save ten times the book's cost, even if you only prevent a single visit from a plumber or electrician!"},{"Title":"New Complete Do-It-Yourself Manual","review":"This book is a great reference for the \\"Do it yourself\\" crowd. The one thing I think it lacks is great illustrations, but what they do have is adequate. I'd honestly suggest getting another book, like the one by Black & Decker, to supplement this one, but this will help you quite a bit with any projects, even by itself."},{"Title":"New Complete Do-It-Yourself Manual","review":"I purchased this book many years ago and hadn't really bothered to look at it...until my grown son came over one day to do some repairs to the kitchen plumbing. He was complaining about not knowing how to do something, when I remembered the Reader's Digest New Complete Do-It-Yourself Manual. I pulled out the book and my son quickly found the answers he needed to finish the job. He then spent another two hours reading through the book, often exclaiming how \\"awesome\\" and \\"fantastic\\" it was. In fact, he expressly told me that he wanted his own copy for a birthday present. I ordered it for him and he was thrilled (seriously, he loves it).After that, I looked through the book and was amazed at not only the detailed yet easy to follow instructions for home repairs, but also the helpful tips and tricks to make life easier. One of the tips was to fashion a gutter scoop out of a plastic milk jug that easily scoops out wet leaves from the gutters and has a built in handle to keep your hands from getting wet.I recommend you buy the book...you will save the cost of the book when you do your very first repair or project.

Fisher, 1988This is not a technical history of RADAR, which is a shame, because the British science writers are among the best. Rather it is about people, their egos, the big decisions that they made, who got credit and who should have gotten credit (or blame). There is very little in here about the weapon itself and a lot about the calamitous events that it was part of. Without a doubt, RADAR was one of the weapons that ultimately allowed the British to win the Battle of Britton.Fisher suggests that the Battle of Britain could have easily gone the other way. Britain not only needed RADAR, but also needed the Germans to ignore it. And the Germans did. But that was nearly offset by bad decisions on the part of the British. Rather than being a sequence of moves and counter moves it was more a sequence of mistakes and counter mistakes.RADAR almost died before it was born. The RADAR sub-committee (also known as the Tizard committee) of The Committee on Air Defense Research, was forced by Churchill to accept a toxic personality into its midst. The RADAR committee fell into bickering and general dysfunction. All its members, except the Churchill appointee, resigned. Showing great political courage, the chairman of the Air Defense Research committee dissolved the RADAR committee and then immediately reconstituted it without Churchill's appointee.There was the famous Douglas Bader, who consistently disobeyed orders by refusing to engage until he had his wing formed up, which was consistently too late. His squadrons were supposed to protect the bases of the squadrons that were protecting London. Bader was allowing these bases and their squadrons to be wiped out. But then the Germans changed tactics and flew right into Bader's fully formed wing and got shredded. Bader looked like a genius.There was Goering who would not attack British radar because he believed it was too hard to destroy and that it did not work anyway.Although lean on technical details, this book is a good, interesting re-telling of the Battle of Britain, with more candor about big mistakes than admitted in earlier books."},{"Title":"Five Fair Rivers: Sailing the James, York, Rappahanock, Potomac, and Patuxent","review":"As a sailor who relishes using a shallow draft boat to explore remote water passages, I thoroughly enjoyed Five Fair Rivers by Robert DeGast. His modest 21' sailboat with 4&quot; draft brought him up the rivers on the lower western shore of the Chesapeake Bay to for a close-up investigation of the both the historical aspects of the Virgina Tidewater and their current state. DeGast's writings reminded of Tom Horton, another good writer who has poked about the Chesapeake Bay and shared observations about this fascinating estuary. Thoroughly recommended for all small boat explorers and those interested in the natural history of the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries."},{"Title":"Five Fair Rivers: Sailing the James, York, Rappahanock, Potomac, and Patuxent","review":"Robert de Gast was born in den Hague, Holland and came to the US at 22. He has spent his life around and on the Chesapeake, and raised a family of sailors. He tells a simple, innocent and inviting story about one of his many adventures.He describes the Chesapeake, the \\"five faire rivers\\" and other sights of beauty and wonder that Captain John Smith and the early settlers found and described in such exuberant terms -- and reports that much is unchanged.He mixes geography, geology, history and personal experience in a wonderfully entertaining and natural way, and makes the reader feel as if he were there too. From trivial detail (toast from a frying pan, two eggs and a banana for breakfast and the complexity of rigging his solar shower), to historic analysis (why chose Jamestown Island, when the natives knew it was inhospitable?) to profound observation (from the profound effect of clear cut colonial farming on silting of these rivers to more modern use as sewers), he spins a lively yarn.Like Jimmy Cornell in his \\"Passion for the Sea\\", de Gast sings the praises of shallow draft sailing and makes us deep keelers wonder if we are somehow missing something important. I think we are.This book is a delight to anyone who enjoys simply messing about in boats, or has a love for Virginia's beautiful tidewater region and its tributaries."},{"Title":"Five Fair Rivers: Sailing the James, York, Rappahanock, Potomac, and Patuxent","review":"De Gast, let's us see Colonial America from a hidden side seldom viewed from the freeway's blurr of contemporary homogeneity.The slowing down of the mind and the pace of the soul as he explores the rivers that feed Chesapeake Bay in a small sailboat is intoxicating.

To be messin' about in boats."},{"Title":"India, its life and thought,","review":"While researching books to read on India I came across this book published in 1908 and written by John P. Jones, Doctor of Divinity. While the book is over 100 years old, it is truthfully delivered, but quite naive in its premise. Of course, that is what made the book worth reading.Written by an Englishman during the time of the colonization of India by Great Britian it shows all the prejudice of a culture that considers itself to be superior in all ways. A lesson current governments might well remember.As Reverend Jones works very hard to bring an understanding of the culture, religion and day to day lives of the people he fails to see the vibrant enthusiasm for life and love it possesses. For Rev. Jones, who has lived in the country for 30 years, does not truly live within the culture of India. He sees India through the prism of his own culture and beliefs. Not really seeing the people as individuals who have been invaded and governed by an outside force. His sheltered life among the community of British ex-pats does not open him to full understanding.However, his book is so academically written and thought out it is a small gem in a field of full of countless stories written by well meaning but uninformed authors. He attempts through research and observation to give the reader a true insight into a world so far removed from their own as to be on a different planet.While the author does miss capturing the heart and soul of India he certainly gives us a treatise on his day to day observations and his research. I recommend this for people who are interested in India under British rule and the insights it provides into the beginning of the struggle for self rule from the colonialist perspective.Karen Bryant Doering,Parents' Little Black Book"},{"Title":"India, its life and thought,","review":"...India, Its Life and ThoughtGreat Documentary on India history and culture .

They create in their mind trough well organised conferences a very negative imagination of the religion and it certainly make them feel happy about them.Some times I wondered if they believed Christianity was great because Jesus was great or because other religions are nonsense. This book is a normal example of the kind of propaganda goes on there.None of these people I met have tried or bothered to learn about Indian religion from some Indian saints. It also seemed to me that to be a christian you have to believe that other religions are not the way. Looks like they believe in evil more than they believe in God and that is all they project onto all that does not go with their imagination. A consuming mind full of desire can will find it very difficult, if not impossible, to understand the doctrine of renunciation.

However when I opened it up the rules seemed...simplistic. When I played a few games I started to realize how awesome a game this was. It's a completely casual oriented game, with minor tactics, but for the most part it's aimed at being easy to play and funny. Since the deck is shared and boosters aren't part of the game at all (Its not collectable) people can easily join in. Also the collectible aspect is refreshing since every card has a use and there are no \\"crap\\" cards. Certain cards are better than others, but not the outrageous degree of most card games. While in theory two people can play, it will be fairly mundane. Games are only worth it with at least 3 people. While the box says 5 people may play the number is closer to 7, and at an absolute max 9. However the two expansion boxes raise that number. Its great for parties since you can learn to play within 5 minutes. Now of course I have emphasized how easy to play it is, the game itself is incredibly fun. As 2-5 (or more) college students living in one apartment you each get one job and try to get as many \\"Slack Points\\" as possible. Slack may come from RPGs, hanging out at a Caf&eacute;, nookie, books, friends to invite over, even sleep. What other game gives you points for sleep? As well as many way of gaining slack methods of hindering your opponents are key. For example take \\"Car Alarm\\", which makes an opponent's sleep card be discarded. Also \\"Hungry Girl\\", a person card, is played on an opponent and \`eats' one food card every turn. Even some of the cards that help you can be a double-edged sword. For example buying a user low rider, \\"Harold the Hoopty Car\\", lowers your income by 1 point a turn. Income and free time are balancing factors specific to each job. For example as a Slacker you have a high free time value, but very low income. As a corporate drone you have the highest income of any job, but suffer from only one free time per turn."},{"Title":"Chez Geek (Steve Jackson Games)","review":"This fabulous &amp; fun game is well worth your time!

Several are out of focus or suffer some motion blurring where either the model or photographer moved. Edges are poorly defined, the model often fades into the background on the edges. Detail is lacking, for example, it is impossible to distinguish the iris from the pupil in the eye. The lighting can sometimes be poor- throwing important features into deep shadow.There's only one model. And, while she is a good choice for a representative of the female form, the photography and printing do not do her justice. Generally, all you get are basic shapes and outlines- made me think of stick figures or those basic shapes people sketch before adding details to a figure. An exception to this is the small handful of photos toward the end with close-ups of face and shoulder detail. Those are quite nice but there are not enough.On the positive side the book has many different poses, so it has a good variety of poses.Alternative:Art Models Life Nudes- definitely the best model book I've seen.

In heels she strikes a totally different attitude, you don't see this in other books. No dull expressionless faces, she's alive from head to toe.

The lighting, quality of photography, choice of model, and poses are ideal for ALL types of study. Rather than an outright review, here is a list of suggested methods of study from this book.1) Buy a pad of tracing paper and some black Prismacolor pencils. Day by day, page by page, lay a sheet of tracing paper over the drawing and \\"artistically\\" trace the shadow patterns. Through this you will understand shapes, the rhythmic interplay between them, the importance of their design, the implications of soft and hard edges, etc. without being caught up on proportion and placement.2) Get a kitchen timer. Set it for 5 or 10 minutes. Flip open the book and work on your quick sketch figure notation. The form lighting lends itself to strong, well designed 6\\" sketches3) Do longer, fully rendered 18 x 24 figure studies. The detail and lighting in the book is also adequate for these.4) Paint from the photographs. Either directly (alla prima) or preparedly (underpainted/ underdrawn). The lighting is perfect for full rendering and the shapes and rhythms are perfect for alla prima interpretation.Try any or all of these. Or come up with your own variations on them. The point is that you can improve any and all aspects of your figurative work with this reference material. Of course, this requires motivated, systematic study. But, hey, if you're looking into books of this nature you must be at least halfway motivated to begin with, right?A more poetic way of saying it would be that this book functions like a excellent piece of musical manuscript. with it you can learn how to accurately manipulate an instrument, study the underlying harmony and counterpoint, or express yourself within a given framework through accents, intonation and dynamics. What more could you ask for from a book?The only negative--yeah, like another commentator has already written, a spiral binding might be more functional. But in the book's defense, spiral bindings look unprofessional. Rebinding it is one possibility. But even if you don't feel like rebinding it, the book photocopies very well (yes, that's still another sign that the photography is well-conceived)--go to kinko's for half an hour and you've overcome your obstacle."},{"Title":"The Female Nude I: A Pose Book For Artists","review":"The overall quality of the book is awesome.

There's also a plan for Male Nude pose book, too."},{"Title":"The British political fringe;: A profile","review":"_The British Political Fringe: A Profile_, first published in 1965, by George Thayer is a fascinating examination of some of the little known political fringe groups of Great Britain from this period. The book examines most of these non-mainstream groups; however, it leaves out certain groups of communists and a few other fringe groups because they have been discussed elsewhere. The book argues that while the fringe is largely rejected by most mainstream individuals in Great Britain that nevertheless it has some important role to play in bringing forth new ideas and in challenging pre-conceived notions of government. Thayer defines the political fringe as follows: \\"By political fringe groups I mean all those relatively small political parties and pressure groups outside the two-party system whose primary objective is to alter all or part of the existing political institutions and attitudes in Great Britain.\\" As such, the book focuses only on those groups who intend to fundamentally restructure the British political scene and not those who intend to work within it. Further, it should be pointed out that while this book is certainly dated, it does offer much for those who want to learn more about various obscure movements within the history of Great Britain, particularly those following the Second World War.The first chapter of this book is devoted to what Thayer refers to as \\"the neo-Nazis\\". These are individuals and groups who largely maintain that National Socialism as put into effect by Adolf Hitler is a viable political system. Thayer distinguishes such figures from other fascists who often do not have the same reverence for Hitler. Some such as Colin Jordan have gone as far as to say \\"Hitler was right!\\", while others merely maintain that Hitler provided a guide to their political beliefs. Thayer examines such shadowy figures as the post-war neo-Naziism that sprang up around Arnold Spencer Leese, Colin Jordan and his National Socialist Movement, the British National Party of John Edward Bean, and John Tyndall and the Greater Britain Movment. Thayer notes the role of street violence and virulent racism and anti-Semitism among these figures. Thayer maintains that many of these individuals are eccentrics and may be highly mentally unbalanced in certain cases. Following this, Thayer discusses Sir Oswald Mosley who began the British Union of Fascists which became the post-war Union Movement. Thayer discusses some of Mosley's bizarre ideas concerning fascism, the reality of race and racial conflict, and his anti-immigrant sentiment. Thayer also shows the complicated relationship of Mosley to anti-Semitism and the role of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories. Further, Thayer shows how various other fascist and other movements arose from Mosley's original movement. Following this, Thayer turns to a rather eccentric group of people referring to themselves as The League of Empire Loyalists. As one individual put it, \\"These people have never really believed that Queen Victoria is dead.\\" The League of Empire Loyalists, an ultra-right wing movement, was founded by A. K. Chesterton, a cousin of the famous writer G. K. Chesterton, who had previously been involved with Mosley and other right wing movements. The League was staunchly patriotic and frequently disrupted political meetings. The League also had a complicated relationship with the more conservative Tories. Thayer also discusses the role of anti-immigrant sentiment and anti-Semitism among the League. Following this, Thayer examines the Freedom Group led by Edward Drewett Martell. The Freedom Group is largely considered a right wing group (to the right of most Tories) that advocated for economic freedom, against socialism, and pro-monarchy. Thayer discusses some of their political activities and publications, their opposition to trade unions, and their rather interesting economic and social proposals. Thayer maintains that this group is not fascist (despite what some of their left wing detractors have maintained) but certain members of it may have rather fascist-like sympathies. Following this, Thayer examines the \\"Yellow Star Movement\\". This group is largely pro-Jewish and anti-fascist. Many members of such groups have actively confronted fascist and neo-Nazi groups and frequently have even been found to engage in violence. However, as Thayer shows there is a tendency among such groups to see fascism and \\"anti-Semitism\\" everywhere and their political power is growing. Following this, Thayer devotes a chapter to examining the literature of political fringe groups. Thayer considers literature found in two bookstores: the first is Britons Publishing Society specializing in far right wing literature and the second is Collet's Bookshop specializing in far left wing literature. Thayer discusses literature focusing on eccentric economic theories, fascism, racialism, and anti-Semitic and anti-masonic conspiracy theories found in Britons. Thayer also discusses literature focusing on Marxist economic theories, anti-fascism, and Trotskyite literature found in Collet's. Thayer also devotes some discussion to the economic theory of Social Credit, developed by C. H. Douglas, and the Social Credit Party of John Hargrave. Thayer discusses some of the bizarre theories of Hargrave concerning economics, but also concerning solar mysticism (what he calls \\"muck and mysticism\\" philosophy) and spiritualism. Following this, Thayer discusses \\"the outside left\\". Here, he examines various pro-communist parties, the schism that has occurred between those parties who advocate for the pro-Moscow versus the pro-Peking party line, Trotskyite parties, and anarchism and anarcho-syndicalism. Thayer discusses some of the conflicts between these parties, their demographic make-up (largely middle and upper class as opposed to working class, contrary to their claims), and the role of Marxism versus anarchism. Thayer also discusses the relationship of these parties to the Labour Party and the attempt of some to enter into this movement. Following this, Thayer discusses the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. Thayer mentions the role of philosophers and thinkers such as Bertrand Russell in helping to develop these movements. Thayer shows how opposition to nuclear war has been developed by pacifists, leftists, and communists who argue that nuclear power should be abandoned. Thayer shows the complicated relationship such movements have with the law, other leftist groups, and environmentalist politics. Following this, Thayer turns to the various nationalist movements in Great Britain. Thayer discusses Plaid Cymru (the Welsh nationalist movement) and Mebyon Kernow (the Cornish nationalist movement). Thayer shows how the preservation of language and culture remains an important component of these movements. Thayer also contrasts the generally pacifistic approach of both these movements with Scottish and Irish nationalisms. Thayer next discusses the Scottish nationalists showing the various different forms such nationalism takes - romantic, pragmatic, and revolutionary. Thayer mentions the role in particular of Wendy Wood in the promotion of Scottish nationalism and the attempt to reclaim Scottish language and heritage. Following this, Thayer turns to the Irish nationalists, mentioning in particular the Fenians of Sinn Fein. Thayer shows the conflicts that have developed between Catholics and Protestants in Ireland and the role of violence that has erupted in some of these conflicts. Thayer also notes the role of the ultra-Protestant Orangemen who oppose the \\"papists\\", as well as mentioning the relationships of Irish nationalists to the more mainstream political parties. Following this, Thayer includes a discussion of the Protestant Party, noting how anti-Irish sentiment in areas such as Liverpool has led to the formation of radical Protestant and anti-Catholic groups. Thayer explains the hatred such groups express for \\"papists\\" and \\"Jesuitism\\" in general. Thayer concludes with a final summing up of the political fringe, explaining the role the fringe has to play within politics and the development of new political ideas and ideals.This book offers a fascinating picture of the British political scene as it existed in the 1960s. Following the Second World War, various obscure political movements developed within Britain and came to play some role in influencing larger individuals. While the political fringe was ultimately rejected by mainstream Englishmen, it did play an important part in challenging the status quo among them. As such, it provides a fascinating though eccentric look into the British political culture."},{"Title":"Mr Weston's Good Wine.","review":"Although not one of the towering books of the twentieth century, this is surely one of the most satisfying. The Mr. Weston of the title is no one less than God Himself, who visits the English village of Folly Down in the guise of a travelling wine vendor. Accompanied by his assistant, the Archangel Michael, he makes his way among the inhabitants of Folly Down, doing justice to the wicked and comforting the afflicted as far as he is able. However, Mr. Weston finds sorting out the problems of human merit and desert as puzzling and difficult as do the rest of us. But in the end good and justice, of a sort, prevail.While this is definitely a novel about God and His relationship to His creatures, it is far from orthodox. In fact, although Powys takes his subject quite seriously and movingly, he writes with a sly, down to earth humor. Unfortunately, this may work against the book's ever becoming popular--it's too irreverent and racy for the piously stuffy, too thoughtful and honest for the facile unbeliever. However, anyone--believer, agnostic, or atheist--who is curious about how a benevolent God might manage His less than benevolent creation, or how such a God might even become accountable to His creatures, will find this book rewarding. Heck, even this good ole Southern Baptist boy from Cut and Shoot, TX, liked readin it!"},{"Title":"Mr Weston's Good Wine.","review":"Theodore Francis Powys was the son of an Anglican clergyman, one of three writers in the family. Most of his best work is in his short stories; the novels are inclined to be shapeless and uneven. This is the exception.T.F. Powys made his fiction out of his life-long quarrel with God. He was haunted by the beauty of Jesus and the Gospels; tormented by their irrelation to the Way of the World; unable to accept any known theological \\"solution\\" to this disparity. Living almost all his life in a small village in Dorset, he saw plenty of human stupidity, brutishness, violence, exploitativeness, selfishness, cruelty. Like Job he looked up at the massing clouds and asked, \\"Why?\\"In some books he gives human wickedness heart-breaking shapes; but here he paints almost entirely in bright colours, shadowed only by his acceptance that, for some people, and for some problems, darkness and dissolution may be the kindest or the only answer.This story radiates magic; while you read it the world is suspended like the Courtiers in \\"Sleeping Beauty\\". Mr. Weston the wine-merchant arrives in the village of Folly Down. Mr. Weston is... well, it doesn't take much guessing. Luke Bird embodies the Gospel; Tamar is unbound natural goodness, a figure from Blake. Her father the Vicar is sorrow that can never be healed.Mr. Weston's coming precipitates the solution to all the villagers' intertwined problems; the good end happily, the bad end unhappily, and the author smiles wistfully as he ties up the loose ends. It would have made a wonderful movie back in the 30's or 40's, a kindly, grave, wise comforting fantasy brushed at times by dark shadows like blackbirds' wings."},{"Title":"Mr Weston's Good Wine.","review":"An old Ford labelled 'Mr Weston's Good Wine' and apparently driven by a commercial traveller and his young assistant pulls into Folly Down village in Dorset. It soon becomes apparent that the old man with 'hair as white as wool' and his beautiful and respectful colleague are divine beings.The inhabitants of Folly Down are an assorted bunch- a vicar who has lost his belief in God since his wife was killed; his elfin daughter left to run wild and yearning to meet an angel; the arrogant and immoral farmer's sons who enjoy deflowering the local pretty maidens; the old woman who serves as procuress for them; and the humble Mr Bird, a Dissenter who preaches to the animals and is universally scorned...but who is madly in love.Mr Weston writes his motto on the sky in shining letters. Then time stands still for an evening as he moves among the villagers bringing his wine to those who will accept it.I would stress that this is in no way a 'goody-goody' morality tale. The village seems very dark and pagan- and considering this was written in the 20s very outspoken on lust- and Mr Weston himself struggles with the suffering around him'Not a death happens in all the world but I wish it were mine own and I would have every dying one to know that I long to die with him.'The scene at the end when Mr Weston administers good wine to the vicar is exquisitely written. And throughout Powys' familiarity with the Dorset countryside brings this world to life."},{"Title":"Mr Weston's Good Wine.","review":"It is a very good book. It is a pity that is almost impossible to find it, even in english (italian would be better).Kind regards"},{"Title":"Mr Weston's Good Wine.","review":"I was lent this book by a friend of mine, who said that something I had written had reminded him of it. I know nothing of the author and for the first 30 or 40 pages really didn't like this book: I thought it was poorly written, showed the author's opinions too grubbily, and had all the marks of those early-twentieth century dilletantes - the upper classes, country vicars, blue rinse spinsters and retired soldiers - that believe that because they can write words they can therefore write novels people will want to read (celebrities are the modern equivalent). But then my attitude changed and its true charm overtook me. As a naive, if not too subtle, allegory it works well. The characters that start off seeming shallow, crude and generally unbelievable, grew to become sturdy archetypes straight out of folk tale: yes, Mr Grutter may be stupid, but so is Jack of the beanstalk. The religion it pushes rather too hard is of a peculiar kind, which seems to advocate sex before marriage as long as it is between two loving hearts. It also avoids gawky sentimentality by portraying an evil of a particularly disarming and frank kind: a bitter old woman pimping the young village girls to the squire's sons. I'm sure that the book is no longer available, and I'm certain that the religious theme would grow very tiresome very quickly if used in his other books, but I enjoyed this book and perhaps wish that I'd read it with a different attitude from the very beginning."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"I loved reading this book!

Buy it if you are trying to advance from an intermediate speaker to an advanced speaker ... very useful"},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"Perhaps the only book dealing with spanish grammar I enjoyed reading. The author does a wonderful job of not bogging down in technical jargon while instilling the difference between knowing the technicalities of a language and being FLUENT in a language. It was profoundly helpful!!"},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"This is a good book to get one beyond the \\"como estas Senor Lopez\\" many text books start with. It contains common pitfalls, words that are cognates, and words that aren't (embarazada anyone?) - and lot of good examples of these. Highly recommend this book to unlearn some of the things you learned from your Spanish textbook."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"This is the perfect book for people who are trying to achieve some semblance of fluency in Spanish who have not had the opportunity of living in-country for any substantial period of time. I'm so grateful for this book, the author is to be applauded for producing one of the most useful books ever written on learning Spanish. A MUST HAVE for every student of Spanish. PLEASE do yourself the favor of owning this book."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"This book is AWESOME! It's a must have for all who are determined to get past the basics and really start talking like a native Spanish speaker. I recommend it to all of my friends who head overseas to Spanish speaking countries."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"Good reading. I've learned alot from this book and found it to be very interesting. It is quite entertaining; the author is very humorous."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"I am convinced that you can't find another book like this anywhere. I never expected the book to be so invaluable when I ordered it. I am in University Spanish, and have been studying the language for six years now. This book provided subtle tips that I have never been told or read about! It is well worth the money. If you really want to correctly use your verbs and adjectives, get this book. It is designed for the American learning Spanish, and it is perfect for us. I honestly can't say enough good stuff about this book. I'm just finishing reading it. I will read it again, but take notes. I know that I'll refer back to it alot."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"I purchased this book 3 years ago and I clearly remember my first impressions. I thought to myself \\"how handy this is the first of its kind\\". This Spanish reference will definitely give you the finishing touches to your Spanish in terms of authenticity and helping your day to day Spanish sound natural and on the level of a native speaker.I bought the book to find out the greatest challenges that students who are studying Spanish face outside of grammatical, pronunciation and phonetic issues. Although the title of the book is: Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish, the topics covered and the information offered is definitely beneficial to the advanced student and to those who have travelled around Latin America or Spain. Chances are these students will have heard the numerous verbs, phrases and expressions used and have had difficulty understanding the meaning, nuance and how to use the verb or expression correctly in everyday speech.The book's intent is to clarify traditional errors that non-native Spanish speakers make and to offer an explanation and the logic behind the usage in Spanish. The book covers a broad range of topics such as: tricksters (also known as false cognates which are words that look similar to an English word but have a completely different meaning),verb usage and key exceptions, tips for correct usage of the subjunctive which always proves to be problematic for non-natives, a special look at sixty-four verbs with a complete analysis of proper usage, key phrases typically used by native speakers, making the right choice of words and anglicisms.The book answers questions that grammar books and dictionaries don't offer. As an educator of the Spanish language I am familiar with and have read numerous reference material in English and Spanish and this is the first of it kind. Finally, a book that focuses on problematic concepts in Spanish that need to be addressed in order to speak correctly, avoid blunders, to know when you have been insulted, increase cultural awareness and to sound as authentic as possible when speaking Spanish.The book is definitely beneficial to those who have advanced knowledge of Spanish and a solid command of its grammar, those who have travelled to several Latin American countries and those who have specific queries about an idiom, verbs, \\"must know\\" vocabulary and terms. I suggest reading the book thoroughly for understanding of the its objective and then re-reading the book with a focus on your own queries that need clarification. I think the book is great and true to its objective, unfortunately I have yet to use the concepts with my students because of their level but it has been put to good use thus far as I enjoy reading it from time to time because it has such a wealth of information beneficial to all. I strongly recommend this purchase to all students and those who have an interest in Spanish. This was a carefully compiled reference material."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"This book gives so many interesting pitfalls to avoid that I found myself laughing out loud. Some of the mistakes were things that I would have never guessed and I know that I will be a much more fluent and interesting speaker due to this book. No more keeping quiet for fear of using a word incorrectly and offending someone. I recommend this book for anyone who has taken at least some intermediate spanish and is looking for ways to make their conversation more colorful."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"I bought this book as I was in that upper beginners stage; knowing the pronunciation and basic grammar but lacking the crucial knowledge of the nuances of Spanish to call myself a true intermediate or advanced. This book helped me make that transition, though it is lacking in some places.The good:-A lot is written in this book about conversation, so when you talk you sound like a real person and not like a student. There's a chapter on manners and politeness, a very useful rundown on filler words (Spanish \\"umms\\", \\"uhs\\", etc.), one word answers, and even cursing. Very handy.-The chapter on 64 common verbs, how to use them, and common expressions on them-The mindset behind the subjunctive is explained well, not just when to use it but WHY it's used. This is the right way to learn the subjunctive as it's very fluid and broad.-Other common verb subjects that trip up learners are explained thoroughly here: the conditional, ser vs. estar, imperfect vs. preterite-Chapters on English concepts or words that are hard to translate in Spanish. \\"Fear\\", \\"maybe\\", obligation, back/front, and many other things.-The book is written in a friendly colloquial way.The bad:-No por/para explanation. This is a common difficulty in Spanish, especially for beginners, and there's no reason to leave it out-Explaining the different subjunctive tenses and how they interact would have been great too-Some explanations on various prepositions-Why is there no index in a reference book?-Keep in mind the writer is using Mexican Spanish, in the early 90s, so some slang terms might not be relevant anymore.Overall this is a pretty good book for taking your Spanish to the next level but it doesn't teach everything. Dedicating a chapter to the history of Spanish but leaving out an index is perplexing."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"This is a witty and cleverly conceived book to help the reader take the important step up from \\"beginner\\" to \\"intermediate\\". It is divided into 14 chapters which deal with Spanish linguistic issues, as well as manners and culture. Two of the chapters at the beginning deal with different usage of verbs and words which are similar in English and Spanish but have different usage (and meaning), underlining the possible (and frequent), pitfalls. Others deal with tenses, various expressions, conjugation (with focus on irregular verbs), and there is even a chapter on slang and obscene words and expressions!!It is fun to read and to learn from. I highly recommend it to intermediates in Spanich."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"This is not a book for beginners in Spanish. Rather, it's for someone who has achieved good fluency (not me!) and wants to take their Spanish to the next level, where you're not making gaffes and other boo-boos in verb choice or idioms. There is a valuable chapter on which verb to use (such as saber) and of course, a chapter on curses and idioms. I'm not yet at the level in Spanish where I can even converse fluently, but when or if I get there, this will be helpful to refine my grammar and vocabulary."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"I have been studying Spanish for several years. I live in a little community in the hills of Georgia near Chattanooga Tn with many local Spanish speaking people. I try to meet new people every week and to learn new expressions. I have spent a lot of time reading Spanish Text & help books. But this one is really great, it truly takes you to the next level, especially if you cannot travel or spend time in a Spanish speaking country. The author deserves much credit for his enlightened focus on a beautiful language."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"Not for the beginner, it's for people who are sick of the same B.S. in traditional books, it picks out fine details that you would normally get in a college level course...I van say that because I am in a college Spanish course."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"This book is sure one of the best I have read on learning spanish. But I agree that its not for complete beginners. But if youre ready it can help take you to a higher level of understanding. It's surprising because it's mainly in english, but it tells you things about verbs and other words that you don't get from the practice and text books. It could only have been written by someone who speaks english natively but is completely bilingual and really understands a lot about spanish language and culture. I plan to read it a second time."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"Most readable and applied Spanish language reference I have encountered.

I wish I could find a similar reference in French or other languages."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"If you just want to get by in Spanish, or pass a college exam, don't bother. But if you really want to participate in the culture of a hispanic country, this is a very useful book. Worth re-reading as your skill with the language grows. Intended for a native English speaking adult. Explains aspects of the language that only make sense once they are explained in the context of hispanic culture. Helps you avoid some of those embarrassing faux pas that come from understanding \\"la letra\\" of the word but not \\"el matiz.\\" I only wish it were more comprehensive."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"I agree with the review by Fred Fresno (February 17, 2002): this is a very good book, but it's not perfect. A few improvements (especially an index) in a future edition will make it outstanding. The author's advice on manners, body language, and \\"how to avoid being taken for a gringo\\" is especially valuable: Latin Americans are much more likely to help the beginning Spanish speaker if he or she hasn't made a bad first impression. And their help will make a world of difference in the student's progress."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"Well, I think a lot of people have said it, so I will keep it brief. I wish there was an index. There is a lot of English explaining and no exercises or memorization drills, so the information is just thrown out there. There is a LOT of information and good tips on when and how to use things, and it's very readable. Maybe some day they will add an index???"},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"This book is not a dictionary or a grammar lesson book. Nor is it for a total beginner.It is a supplement to your other spanish lesson books.It helped me relax and not be uptight about making a mistake when I speak spanish. The author is a journalist and he writes easily with wit and charm, something not found in the many other spanish lesson books I have purchased. He tells you how not to come across as a \\"gringo.\\" He tells you how to use slang and even swear if you are inclined to do so. To relieve frustration you might one day want to say \\"damn\\" and that is \\"maldicion\\".What school textbook will tell you such useful words?Think of it as learning the tricks of the trade more than learning the trade, or language as the case is here.I enjoyed the book immensely and I recommend it.The book is easy to understand, not professorial. It will make you laugh and you will remember what you read.The only criticism I have of the book is there is no index, but it is a small book of 213 pages and easy to thumb through to find what you want. But I find it so interesting that when I thumb through to find something I have to stop several times to read something totally unrelated to what I am seeking because every chapter is compelling.Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish is published by the University of Texas Press and they have a reputation for publishing excellent writing. And this book is never boring.Down here in Texas we don't tolerate boring."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"Entertaining and fun, this very worthwhile book discusses the subleties and nuances of certain Spanish phrases and words, clarifying their meaning and use. Invaluble for a beginner or an intermediate Spanish student and, I believe, helpful to the sophisticated or advanced student as well. It helps that Mr. Keenen is a very good writer; thoughtful, lucid, and funny. I'd love to hang out with this guy or have him for my Spanish teacher."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"Helpful for me - gives lots of examples of what NOT to do when speaking Spanish, includes common beginner mistakes! I am teaching my kids Spanish but am not a native speaker, and so this avoided many embarassing situations for all of us."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"I purchased this book when I was already at a rudimentary level of conversational fluency, and the book helped immensely in beefing up my Spanish. It covers numerous things that are never mentioned (or only briefly touched upon) in traditional textbooks, such as filler words, colloquial phrases, false cognates, profanity (surprisingly useful to know what words to avoid in polite company), common mistakes and useful, everyday verbs. It truly lives up to its name in helping you break out of beginner's Spanish and move towards a more native-level fluency. Most helpful is how it continually points out the difference between legitimate spoken Spanish and dictionary, textbook Spanish that's technically correct but sounds stuffy and wrong to anybody who speaks natively.I also appreciate that the book has a sense of humor, making it a fun read as well as informative. It's not indexed like a reference book, but it's not really written like one either. I still review it again and again and learn something new each time. I cannot recommend this enough to intermediate to advanced Spanish students.(Do note that if you are a real beginner and don't have the basics of Spanish down, most of the book is going to be too advanced for you and is going to fly over your head, although the first couple chapters lay out what you should already know so you're on the same page.)"},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"This book is awesome. You learn about all those little things that you never learned about. You learn about small differences between words like bueno, pues, and venga. You learn useful filler phrases that help you sound like a natural speaker like lo que pasa es que... You learn slang and colloquialisms. Basically, you learn everything you needed to know but never got taught.The book is written in an easy to read style. It makes you think and it makes you smile. Reading this book isn't like reading a language learning book. It's actually fun.Reading this book changed the way I see the language and help me improve my spoken Spanish dramatically. I can confidently say that I am no longer a beginner. This book deserves 5 stars, 100%, 2 thumbs up and an A+. It is a consistent recommendation to my Spanish learning friends and a must buy."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"As soon as I received the book, I started reading it while sitted on the kitchen floor, and I could not stop laughing. This a very entertaining book to learn every day Spanish out of the writers' anecdotes.

Nevertheless, some words will definitely will stick to your learning brain (se te pegara a tu cerebro). Enjoy."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"The book really did live up to all the hype! I am an American college student who has been studying Spanish for 5 years, but felt as if I had plateaued with my speaking abilities. I recently came to Spain to study abroad for a semester, and this book has been indispensable. Joseph Keenan explains in detail so many of the things I had been confused about with the language, and I have caught many of my bad habits that I previously was not aware of. Plus, the book is in English and is very entertaining so all of the material sinks in very well and is easy to remember!The book's value is worth 100 times the price you pay for it!"},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"I have read a lot of the reviews and agree that this is one of the best tools to add to your learning process. I have completed a full year of Spanish on the college level and know a lot of verbs and vocabulary. I would not recommend this book for the novice since so much of the text has spanish sentence examples which I understood but a novice would get lost and discouraged. The college course books are totally bad since the explanations are so brief and all the examples are strictly in Spanish. The learner needs to have a whole library of different books to aid in moving along. I use the \\"Practice Makes Perfect\\" series, the 501 Verbs, 1st readers and of course the spanish/english dictionary as my library tools and the internet as my forum questioning and listening devices. I have 3 sites I use exclusively. This book, which I just finished from cover to cover, is one where you must find time to sit down and make lists from or you will not get the true benefit since you cannot easily go back and find that key verb or expression you need to remember to start off a conversation. I am not conversant in Spanish but with this book and my notes and lists, I am starting to feel a comfort level to jump in there and begin."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"Easy and fun to read, this book contains excellent advice on how to avoid common mistakes made by Spanish learners. I especially like the chapter on choosing the correct verb for the situation. I have already read the book cover to cover twice, and I know I will refer to it frequently until I internalize the information."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"This is a must-have for motivated students of Spanish. True, the lack of an index is a serious flaw, but does not diminish the fact that what is between its covers is a gold mine.As a professor of Spanish with 30 years of experience, I can say with confidence that the toughest period for students is that time when they are trying to get beyond the beginner level. It is at the intermediate level where all the morphological errors (patterned or fossilized errors) need to be rooted out. The uses of tenses and other grammatical details have to be consolidated at that time. Each student has his or her own particular area of difficulty. Keenan is very correct to warn his readers that \\"...there's no magic formula or secret recipe to speed you on your way to fluency,\\" so expect to work at it. His section on the subjunctive is short, but useful, although it does perpetuate a few misunderstandings that result from traditional approaches.Typically, the problem areas for English-speaking students of Spanish who are seeking to move from intermediate to advanced speakers fall into categories that require separate and more in-depth treatment than any general grammar overview can offer, simply because they cover so much.Enjoy learning Spanish!Eric W. Vogt, Ph.D."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"As a Spanish major who has also spent several summers in Mexico, I have read pretty much every Spanish text I have come across. In all that reading, I have never found another Spanish book that even comes close to this one (in accuracy, helpfulness, readability, and other key areas).Keenan does an excellent job of picking out the specific Spanish words and phrases that cause English speakers the most problems. I have several friends who are also studying Spanish. It seems like 9 times out of 10 when they ask me a question, it is an issue that was covered in &quot;Breaking out..&quot;This book was written with the reader's attention span in mind. Imagine: a Spanish text that is actually enjoyable to read! I read this book cover-to-cover at least once a year. Every time I glean some new pointer that I can implement in my constant quest to sound like less of a gringa.Sections include a discussion of the subjunctive, a chapter on cursing (!), cultural info, general language learning tips, useful verbs to add to your repertoire, and discussion of the evolution of the Spanish language. To me, the most helpful sections were those dealing with word choice: a couple of chapters that deal with stuff like &quot;what is the difference between regresar, volver, devolver, etc.?&quot;If you have a general grasp of the basics in Spanish but feel like your learning has kind of reached a plateau, this book is an excellent resource for learning how to get your Spanish to the next level.The only negative I can think of is that the book is not indexed. As a result, after reading the book initially, when you find yourself with a question that you know was answered somewhere in the book (a frequent ocurrence), it sometimes takes a moment to flip through the book and find the exact paragraph where he talked about it.If I could only have one Spanish book, it would be this one. I would even choose it over 501 verbs and probably even my dictionary."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"You may as well be trying to learn Latin with most Spanish books. Not only are they dry and boring, they are absolutely lifeless! Keenan presents Spanish as a living language, full of real life examples and situations (and I don't mean asking the maid in your hotel room for more towels!) I have read this book until the pages have fallen out. Take it from someone who followed Keenan's advice, went to Mexico, and started talking to the locals - you will never find a more helpful resource for your sojourn. The section on invectives and obcenities is worth the price of admission. You may never have an inclination to use any of these words, but I guarantee you it is very, very useful knowing when they are being used toward you. Finally, never have I encountered a Spanish language book which enlightens one as to why everything in Spanish is reversed, e.g. blanca y negra for black and white. Keenan's wonderful book helps you get inside the Spanish speaker's mind and world to the extent that you might just realize it is the English speaker that has everything backwards."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"I moved to Mexico two years ago and enrolled in a language school right off the bat. I also bought this book. After reading it, I thought it was helpful, but not excessively so because I didn't quite \\"get\\" everything it was trying to tell me. I stuck it on the bookshelf.Now, two years later, I'm going through it again and discovering a virtual gold mine of information. My point being: Take the book's title seriously. It is a book for people firmly at the intermediate level or above. For these people, it answers a ton of things that have proved baffling. For these people, the book is a gem. If you are departing the beginner stage, this stupendous book will answer lots of those things you've been scratching your head over. Immensely valuable.But don't buy it for Spanish 101."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"I would have given this book 4 stars, but with all the 5-star reviews one needs to take another off to get across the point that this book is not perfect. Given all the justifiable good things everyone says about this book, it's worth mentioning a shortcoming and making some contrarian points.First, the LACK OF AN INDEX is a BIG SHORTCOMING. This is a reference book written by a journalist, with an entertaining style and interesting anecdotes and verbal illustrations. It's therefore easy to forget that it is, first and foremost, a reference book. After my first quick read through this book I recall wanting to check back on a fine distinction between a couple of similar verbs (I don't remember now which ones). They might have been in chapter 7, \\"Sixty-four Verbs\\", or in chapter 11, \\"Which is Which\\". I couldn't find what I was looking for by skimming, and an index would have been greatly appreciated.Second, a number of reviewers keep emphasizing that this book is for intermediate or advanced speakers. If you're interested in this book, I wouldn't let that stop you from getting it. I've been seriously attempting to learn Spanish for about a year and a half. From my perspective, that of having been a university student a long time ago in a place far, far away, terms like \\"beginner\\" and \\"intermediate\\" are of more use to academic bureaucrats than to teachers and learners. I consider the community college courses I've taken have been auxiliary rather than primary means of learning Spanish. A few months ago I was in Bogota for a week and surprised myself with how well I was able to communicate with the locals. More recently here at home in California I sat in on a reading course in which most of the students were, to some extent, native speakers. I had the realization that I still sound VERY awkward trying to speak Spanish (or more accurately, trying to read it aloud to a group at conversational speed), and that there's a reason that bilingual speaker (there are more of them in California than Colombia) tend to switch me back to English. From this perspective, some of the items in this book struck me as useful. My reaction to other items was \\"well, duh!\\" This book could have been quite useful to me 6 months or even a year ago. And the nice thing about a reference book is that it can sit on your shelf, ready for when the need for it arises.The third \\"yeah, but...\\" this book does not offer magical solutions. Of course no reasonable person expects magical solutions, and the blurbs for this book do not explicitly promise them. Still, all hyper-positive reviews for this book could create very high expectations. In the introduction Keenan offers a few suggestions on picking up the language, but precedes this section with the warning: \\"...there's no magic formula or secret recipe to speed you on your way to fluency.\\" That might be as good as any piece of advice in this book. It is, nonetheless, well worth having."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"I am a 52 year old spanish student. I began my spanish education in the summer of 2002 with a two week stint at a language school in Oaxaca,Oaxaca,MX. I have followed that up with the Pimsleur Speak and Read CD set and a private tutor once a week. I have purchased Dorothy Devney Richmond's excellent books on spanish verbs and suffixes. BUT the book that is providing me with the most fun and an indepth insight into the spanish mind as expressed in the spanish language is Joseph J.Keenan's &quot; Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish&quot;. My biggest coup to date was when I used an spanish expression that I had learned from the book and immediately was &quot;corrected&quot; by a more &quot;knowledgeable and fluent&quot; student of spanish. Happily, when the more &quot;accomplished&quot; student of spanish had finished telling me how wrong I was... a native spanish speaker quietly and graciously stated that my expression was absolutely correct. As I read through this book and practice my ever growing spanish language skills, I am deeply grateful to Mr.Keenan for having paved the way and assisting us all in avoiding some of the potholes and gaining important new insights into the age old question..&quot;But why is it like that?&quot; Muchas Gracias a Senor Keenan."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"If you've been studying Spanish courses and feel confident that you could ask where a hotel or restuarant is but do not feel that you could get into a real conversation with a native speaker, this book will help. It gives you a good way of looking at the subjunctive verb that other books would only confuse you with. Lots of everyday ways of saying things where conventional teaching aids give you ridged ways saying the same thing. If you want to sound like you know what you are saying then this book will help. It will help you stop saying &quot;um&quot; &amp; &quot;uh&quot;, and show you spanish stuble-words cause let's face we are all going to stammer reaching for the right word so why not sound a little more fluent doing so. The obscenity section is helpful, even if you don't want to curse(I don't) it is good to know if someone says something to you and there are words that are harmless in some Spanish speaking countries that are dangerous in other and you'd be wise to know the difference as to not offend anyone or embarrass yourself."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"This is the best book I have ever read for learning Spanish. I have almost a whole &quot;libary&quot; full of useless theoretical Spanish books that I bought hoping to increase my skills. This is the first (and really the ONLY) book that I have read that takes a whole new approach to teaching Spanish--a PRACTICAL approach.I have even felt like writing the author to congradulate him on such a well-written book, but I haven't had the time. (How many people feel like writting the author of Spanish books?)If you're Spanish skills are just a bit above beginner, then I recomend this book. This is one of the only books in my whole &quot;collection&quot; that I have read over 5-6 times. I have lived in Mexico for more than 2 years now, and I owe much of my language mastery to this book. 5-Star without a doubt!"},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"...tells how to hem and haw in a foreign tongue?I am a serious student of Spanish. I own more text books and grammar reviews than any of the professors I know. This book taught me more about *speaking* the language than all the others combined. It is unique and indespensible. I have recommended it and continue to recommend it to anyone I meet who is studying or has studied Spanish. No matter your level of linguistic competency, if you are not a native speaker of Spanish, this book will help you.You simply must have this book."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"This is a great book. Among the chapter highlights are:- Ten Ways to Avoid Being Taken for a Gringo: Excellent things to think about if you want to fit in and not insult people by your actions.- Minding Your Verbal Manners: Things Spanish-speakers would take for granted that any considerate, well-groomed person would know.- The Secret Life of Verbs: Almost everything you need to know about verbs in general. (I like the summary of the future tense: for the most part, forget about it. But he does give a good summary on the use of the \\"Future of Uncertainty\\" construction.)- The Twilight Zone: All about that beautiful, nasty subjunctive mood. Those who have studied Latin or Greek will not find the subjunctive terribly scary, but for everybody else... well, that's probably another story. I find Keenan's categorizations of the subjunctive usages very, very helpful. He does it differently than any grammar I've ever seen; taken together with a grammar, you have two different ways of looking at the same thing, which greatly helps you remember. For example, one of his categories is the \\"Traveler's Subjunctive\\"; when in Costa Rica, it was because of this book that I asked \\"&iquest;Hay autobuses que vayan a Birri?\\" instead of the incorrect \\"... van a Birri?\\".- Sixty-four Verbs: Better descriptions on their range of meaning and usages that the one-liners usually provided in dictionaries don't cover. Coverage varies from short to comprehensive. Has many good parts but some of the treatments are a bit weak. This is a common place for unexpected things to be thrown in due to his train-of-thought writing style (see below).- Cranking Up Your Spanish: All those sentence starters (\\"En fin,\\" \\"Es que,\\" \\"A ver,\\" etc.) that don't show up in grammars and can drive you crazy since they set the scene for the rest of the sentence.- Snappy Answers: Quick responses to things that may catch you off-guard.- Invective and Obscenity: Survey of forceful, rude, and obscene speech (with the obligatory warnings about things that may get you in a fight)- Which is Which: Words that English speakers often confuse.- Influences of Spanish on English and vice-versaFrom my point of view, among the good points of the book are:1. It helps with many problems the beginner is likely to have. Most language books are written by native speakers of the language. In this book, Keenan takes a different approach: he is going to explain all of the problems he had himself while learning the language and using it for many years among native Spanish-speakers. Since I expect I will have most of the same problems, having them laid out is very helpful.2. It is extremely engaging. I have spent many nights up late reading it. Yes, you read that right. Don't think in terms of your typical grammar book: think in terms of an long article where a fellow Spanish learner says \\"Ok, here's everything I learned about the language.\\"3. It has filled in my experience with my other Spanish courses. Often, idiomatic words or phrases will come up in them that don't make a lot of sense. Keenan explains virtually all of them, including which sound stilted or odd to Spanish-speakers.4. It has excellent sections on the difference between ser and estar, between the imperfect and the preterite, and the subjunctive. These are some of the bugaboos that traditionally plague us Spanish students. The ser/estar treatment in particular is better than any book I've used: he goes far beyond the typical \\"estar is for things that change\\" explanation - which is true but incomplete. I finally understand, for example, why you say \\"est&aacute; muerto\\" instead of \\"es muerto.\\"5. It has good sections on how not to give offense to people from different cultures. In every culture, people do some things completely innocently that are interpreted in other cultures as aggressive or insulting. Although there is no single \\"Hispanic\\" culture, Keenan helps by pointing out some things that are commonly considered negative that I might not expect. I should note that Keenan's experience is primarily in Mexico, so most of the cultural and localized language usage tips are centered on Mexico.I really, really, wanted to give this book 5 stars, but I can't. So what's not to like? Just two things, really:1. It has no index. This makes it difficult to find words or phrases. I would expect this kind of book to have a fairly extensive index, but none is provided. As I use this book more and more, I find this to be a bigger and bigger problem. Often, I'll find I need to use some verb or construction and want to look it up. Unfortunately, it's very difficult to do because it could be in one of several chapters. Let's say I'm trying to remember something about a given verb: do I look in \\"Tricksters,\\" \\"The Secret Life of Verbs,\\" \\"The Twilight Zone,\\" \\"Sixty-Four Verbs,\\" or \\"Spanish Roots?\\" Or, let's say you are trying to remember a word or expression that you seem to recall is sometimes misused, and you want to use it right. Do you look in \\"Tricksters,\\" \\"Invective and Obscenity,\\" \\"Which is Which?\\", \\"Say it Right,\\" or \\"The Big Mix?\\" I have spent more time than I like leafing through the various chapters looking for a word that could have been indexed.This problem is made worse by Keenan's train-of-thought writing style. He introduces verbs and expressions in places where they don't at all fit, analytically speaking. Now, don't get me wrong - the writing style works, and very well. A more rigorously outlined writing style would not be nearly as easy and fun to read. But it makes it darn difficult to find what you're looking for. I have taken to writing cross-reference notes in my own copy.2. Keenan uses obscenities more freely than I'd like (even outside the chapter specifically on obscenities). Now, I'm not a \\"schoolmarm\\" (Keenan's words); but I don't think this kind of language is really necessary. Not that the book is full of obscenities: it's not. But they pop up here and there (again, the train-of-thought style); it would have been fairly easy to substitute non-obscene language in most of these places, but he doesn't.For these reasons, I could not give this book five stars. But, overall it is an excellent book, and one that will greatly enrich both your understanding and your fluency.By the way, I've read other reviews and lists saying that this book is more for advanced students of Spanish. &iexcl;No es verdad! While I'd agree that it's probably not for rank beginners, I believe one of the keys to really learning a language is to get out there and starting speaking to people as soon as you can. And this book gives you the tools to get out there, speak confidently and semi-fluently, and not give offence when you don't mean to."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"What a find! Unbelievable: somebody who really clues you in to how Spanish is REALLY spoken. Everything from exposing archaic phrases you've been taught as acceptable, to how to say &quot;I like you&quot; en Espanol without giving the, um, wrong idea (you thought it was me gusta Ud., didn't you?)EVERY person planning to use their newly-learned (or even long-known) Spanish ought to be required to read this first.Best part: the author is dead-on hilarious! You'll die when you find out what doing the &quot;shave and a haircut, two bits&quot; knock on somebody's door means in most Latin countries!I give it TEN STARS."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"The only thing wrong with this excellent book is the title. This is not for beginners - the author assumes that you already have a good working knowledge of the tenses, and that you have at least made a few forays into the subjunctive. 'Breaking out of Intermediate Spanish' would have been a more accurate title.Intelligently written, accessible without being patronising, the the best way to characterise the book would be as a companion to learning; it is not a textbook and does not try to be.It is however a godsend for people who, like me, find that their conversational level lags behind their academic knowledge of Spanish. The author gives you the all-important sentence starters (es que, resulta que, fijate, la verdad es que ... etc) and explains exactly what they mean in context and when to use them. He also shows you how to get a grip on those almost-meaningless but indispensable fillers (pues, bueno, lo que pasa es que...) which serve the dual purpose of giving you a breathing space while making you sound more fluent and natural. Other chapters include a focus on 64 of the trickiest verbs, how to develop automatic 'snappy answers' (imaginate! no puede ser, da igual), as well as the notorious falsos amigos.The author is particularly good at illuminating concepts that resist direct translation from English to Spanish ('to become' springs to mind) and encouraging a real understanding of the difference in perspective between the two languages.Unlike many language-teaching books, which often have a irritating tendency to imply that somehow you 'ought' to know this or that, this author gives the impression that he is entirely on your side, as a learner - he acknowledges all the the frustrations, puzzles, ambiguities and irritations, as well as the excitements, of learning another language. He admits to having learnt Spanish 'the hard way', and there are none of the usual boasts about how he became fluent in a few months or whatever, which can be so discouraging for those of us who find the spoken language difficult. The emphasis is on South American Spanish, but if you are learning European Spanish, don't worry, because where there are differences, the book points them out.Finally it is never boring - you can sit back, relax and enjoy it - quite an achievement for a book on foreign language acquisition! Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"Essential for sounding natural while speaking with native Spanish-speakers. I am still just a beginner, but already it has helped me, and I know that I will be able to re-read this book at least twice more as I progress and get more out of it each time. A bargain for anyone really trying to learn the language."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish is a terrific book. I recommend it to all my second-year Spanish students, and to all students who travel with me on study abroad programs. It contains a wealth of down-to-earth grammar, vocabulary, and cultural material, presented in a friendly and nonpedantic way. (My favorite chapter: &quot;10 Ways to Avoid Being Taken for a Gringo&quot;. My students' favorite chapter: &quot;Invective and Obscenity&quot;)It contains some of the clearest explanations I've ever encountered to help students deal with tricky distinctions like ser/estar, preterite/imperfect, and indicative/subjunctive. In addtition, there is a whole section on false cognates, designed to keep the unwary traveler from declaring himself to be pregnant, or asking to be served food without condoms in it.Don't leave home without it."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"I only wish Joseph keenan would expand this book to cover the dictionary. He explains some of the most important and most used nuances of the language that have been glossed over by all the classes and books I've read. His English wit and colorful writing style will keep you smiling as you read. PLUS, you can actually sit down and casually read this book front to back without getting bored or brain dead. An excellent supplement to your Spanish studies"},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"I am just finishing this informative and interesting book. I would reccomend it to anyone wishing to become more fluent in Spanish and knowledgeable about the surrounding culture. I especially enjoyed the section on invective and obscenity. This is an area that, most often, out of necessity and sensitivity gets ommitted from formal Spanish instruction. The author has a real passion for the language and gently leads the reader into unknown territory. If you want to take your Spanish to the next level, get this book"},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"What's really great about this book is how it teaches one to interact in a spanish speaking country without being rude - or what will make you come off rude! I really enjoy how it has a down to earth approach to visiting or staying in a spanish-speaking country, learning more how to remain polite, and knowing some of the idiosyncracies of your host nation. Not everyone thinks like the english, thankfully! My hat is off to Mr. Keenan for bringing to light important aspects one won't learn in a text or classroom."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"In my case, I have a good working knowledge of Spanish in all its forms. I travel in Latin America frequently and I always take this book. I use it to expand my ability to communicate using different expressions to gain greater fluency. You can tell that Mr. Keenan struggled to learn the language and he's sharing the road he traveled with us. If I could only buy one book besides a grammar book, this is it. You don't need another one. Este libro es un gran exito!"},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"This is THE BEST book that I own on learning spanish and I own about thirty books. I would not be without this book. I read it over and over and over and over again. This is not, and does not attempt to be, a shortcut to fluency. You have to study hard, memorize a lot, and speak to anyone who'll listen to you in spanish to get fluent. Do not go another day without buying this book. You will thank me."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"I've had this book for several years now, and I can only echo what many other reviewers have already said:- I've read and re-read it. The pages will probably start falling out soon. In addition to being packed with info, it's just fun to read. I'd give it ten stars if I could.- While it would be most useful to those with a grounding in Spanish, even beginners will enjoy reading it, and it'll always be there for future use. And even very fluent students will find useful stuff.- It has the best explanation of the subjunctive I've seen.- The only weakness is the lack of an index, making it hard to look up stuff you run across in the real world. (I only put this in the hope that the author may read this and fix it in another edition)- Please, please, please write another one Joe!!!!"},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"Everyone else has said it all: the book should be a Spanish language student's second purchase after either a Collins Pocket Gem dictionary or a FSI course.It's a particularly interesting read for its explanation of *why* you use the phrases that you use. Sometimes knowing that a different mindset is required can be the difference between an adequate word choice and the correct one."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"I actually bought this book a couple of years ago and it has not only helped me with my Spanish major but I have also gained knowledge that one cannot find in common textbooks. Because of my studies, I can say that I have probably, 60 Spanish books (some texts, some novels) and this one it one of the best, if not the best I have."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"I would give this book 7 stars if possible!If you are ready to start speaking colloquial Spanish, the way it is really used, rather than the way the text books teach.. then this book is for you.This book is written by an anglophone, fluent in Spanish (obviously) and directed toward the anglophone student of Spanish who understands the basics, can converse in Spanish basics, but wants to take their abilities to the 'next level.' This book is a must-read (multiple times) that is sure to produce many an 'ah ha!' as the lightbulbs go on. Appropriately titled, this book will help you break out and advance to the next level.Readers will learn how to avoid the common mistakes generally made by native anglophones speaking Spanish. Also very helpful is a section that explains when to use certain verbs in situations instead of another. There is even a short section on obsenities for those interested.Your conversational Spanish partners will definitely notice an improvment when you start applying some of the lessons from this book and using all your newly learned colloquialisms.Quit speaking like a text-book-trained-Gringo and start sounding like a native today!"},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"There are several good reviews of this book already and I won't repeat much of what has already been stated.I do want to voice my support for this book if you are studying spanish, however. At a minimum, you will need to understand verb conjugation, as well as the basics of subjunctive/preterit/conditional tense. Unless you're actually living or studying in another country, some of the content is a bit tedious, but it allows for insight into how the language is actually used by native speakers. The author makes good use of humor along the way, which is refreshing. I'm not sure why a whole chapter is geared toward the use of obscenities/crude language, but it may prove useful for those who have to interact with a 'rougher' crowd.I read the book on my Kindle, but wish I had the hard copy. There is a lot of good information in this book, and rather than flag the content on my Kindle, I just wrote it down on a piece of paper. Kindle works well for linear material--like a novel--but not for a 'hands-on' book such as this, where you want to flip back and forth between the pages/content.Anyhow, this book provides a fresh and interesting approach to learning Spanish. It helps the reader to appreciate the nuance and subtlety of the language, while understanding its evolution through the years. It's a great adjunct resource to all the dictionaries, audiotapes, Spanish-language DVDs, and verb conjugation books that dominate the lives of us trying to learn the language."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"Not only outstanding in content but fun to read. Keenan combines practical information with comical/sassy and memorable usages for Spanish words and phrases. This is a fabulous companion to formal classroom Spanish. I recommend this book for anyone who has taken Spanish 101/102 and has some familiarity with the basic past tenses and the (all important to Spanish) subjunctive. The chapter on the subjunctive should be included in all textbooks. I've been addicted to Amazon.com for years but have never felt the urge to write a review until now. Kudos to Mr. Keenan."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"I cannot say enough about this book. It is by far the most useful book I have ever owned. I pick it up at least three times a week to peruse, and I've had it for years. This is the information that English-speakers really need when learning Spanish. I wish I had owned this book when I went to school in Mexico because it is jam-packed with truly helpful tidbits of information. Every time I open it, I discover mistakes I make on a regular basis when practicing Spanish. Anyone who is attempting to learn Spanish should have this book (and carry it with them wherever they go). The author learned Spanish as an adult, which inspires and comforts me because I know he learned the hard way all he wrote in this book--by making mistakes, just like me. I know I will wear out my copy in the near future and will happily buy a new one. Do not hesitate to check out this book!"},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"This book is worth its weight in gold. When I saw it on Amazon[.com], I thought, \\"For this price, what the heck?\\" and when I got it, I could not put it down (still haven't)I have hundreds of old and new Spanish textbooks (French, Hebrew, English and many others, for that matter) but I have never seen anything like this book. It tells you the real deal. Sure, there's no substitute for immersion, but this is the next best thing and the perfect companion to associating with native speakers, listening to music and watching Spanish TV. It doesn't drill you to death on verbs -- it guides you through a living lanuguage, the one we are all trying so hard to learn.I read it like a person of religion would read the Bible -- when I get to the end, I start all over again. It reads more like a how-to book than a textbook; it keeps me turning the pages. It just gets better each time. You need the basics first, but this is the one and only book to get you off that beginner to intermediate plateau and really explain the language. It has a Mexican slant (most books seem to come from a certain region) and it is important to be aware of that, but all the information has turned out correct according to my friends from varying countries, and the author tells you when something is Mexico-specific -- he won't steer you wrong. If you only have a few bucks to spend on your Spanish library, spend it here."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"The book is a joy and we recommend it to all of our US and Canadian students. It is for native English speakers wanting to learn to SPEAK the Spanish language. The humor in the delivery comes across clearly. But, it is serious subject matter and Keenan does a remarkable job making it entertaining."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"As a Spanish teacher, I know I can't expect my students to really be motivated to seek out their Spanish errors and correct them. This text is great, because it allows me to remind them of possible pitfalls AS THEY LEARN the lesson the first time around. If you're a motivated Spanish student, YES, BUY THIS BOOK!You will absolutely hear the mistakes in many classrooms (sometimes from the teachers!), and that will help you to remember not to make the error yourself.I would say this text will go along well with any Spanish text out there. It is definitely aimed toward high school and older, I'd say. For the younger students, give Flip Flop Spanish a shot!"},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"This book was so much fun and so useful I keep re-reading it, and learning something more each time. The author doesn't neglect grammar, but neither does he present grammar as a list of dull rules. Rather, he guides the reader through examples of how Spanish grammar and structure reflect how Spanish speakers think. It's practical, but not in the hackneyed &quot;Can you direct me to the nearest bathroom?&quot; mode. Rather, this book tries to help gringos learn how people really speak Spanish. There's much emphasis on traps which frequently snare native English speakers learning Spanish. The book is well organized, and written with a great sense of humor. My only minor quibble is the absence of an index. I agree with others: this isn't a book for those just starting out, pero cuando quieras aprender un poco m&aacute;s, &iexcl;debes comprar este libro!"},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"I am currently a Spanish major in college and this book has been invaluable to me. It has given me more in-depth definitions for some words, taught slang and profanity (rarely done in school). It also shows some distictions between words (such as more ways to say 'no') Some grammar explainations are here as well, but I would advise having a decent grasp on the language first.I only know the 4 main verb tenses and have a decent sized vocabulary, but this book aided me immensely. The information never seems to get old. I've read it 4 times and it stays informative and entertaining each time!"},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"I recommend this book to those who have learned a fair amount of Spanish words... those used commonly in Spanish magazines and on Spanish television. That is not to say, that you are fluent in Spanish, but can conjugate most verbs easily if given the time. It's a great stepping stone to get to the next level of understanding. It really pinpoints the \\"actual\\" usages of words and without the multitudes of definitions in dictionaries that are rarely if ever used. It focuses on the real-world usage. I only wish there were a sequel to this book."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"I recently picked up this book at my library because of the excellent reviews on Amazon. Let me tell you, this book is as good they say it is. I'm a beginning Spanish speaker, and I picked up so much advice from this book that I plan to read it again and take notes! Trust me, when it's time for it to go back to the library, I'm purchasing my own copy."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"BOBS is a great reference for students of Spanish who are approaching fluency. It points out common mistakes that English-speakers make and explains how to avoid them. It also helps people find the right word for the right situations.

You won't regret adding this book to your references."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"My wife grew up in Mexico. When I met her I didn't really speak much Spanish. I learned quite a bit by hanging out with her and taking classes. But no matter how hard I tried, no matter how much I paid attention and asked for help, I still made the mistakes that all gringos make: the dreaded &quot;gringaso.&quot; This book isn't a cure all. It won't make you speak Spanish perfectly. But it has pointed out some of my mistakes and has made it simple for me to correct them. I'm in Mexico right now as I write this review and have even used many of the lessons that I learned in this book in order to avoid getting laughed at by all her friends.DO NOT get this book if you are not conversant in Spanish.DO get this book if you are able to hold a conversation in Spanish and need to get rid of those incessant small mistakes that you make that make it obvious that you are a gringo.This is the most helpful book that I have in helping me learn Spanish."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"This book deserves all five stars!

I am now also teaching free learning-Spanish Webinars (web-based seminars).\\"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish\\" is an interesting book. Unlike many of the Spanish books that you can buy this book was NOT written by a native Spanish speaker. It was written by Joseph Keenan, a native English speaker who has lived and worked in Mexico for many years.And unlike many of the Spanish books that you will find, \\"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish\\" is a book that is written with humor.One of my favorite chapters in this book is called \\"Ten Ways To Avoid Being Taken for a Gringo.\\" In this chapter the author gives helpful tips to avoid making many of the common mistakes that English speakers make when learning Spanish. This chapter will also give you helpful tips to make your Spanish sound more authentic . For example, he says that if you want to improve your pronunciation in Spanish, then you should practice repeating the vowel sounds - a, e, i, o, u. He also recommends that you cut the vowel sounds short. This is very helpful advice because one major difference between Spanish vowels and English vowels are that the vowels are cut short in Spanish.Another helpful tip that he gives in this section is to avoid excessively using pronouns when speaking in Spanish. Americans and other English speakers have a tendency to use pronouns excessively when speaking in Spanish. It is not necessary to always use pronouns in Spanish because in many instances it is obvious from the way a verb is conjugated what the pronoun or the subject of the sentence is.One of the most important pieces of advice that you will find in this book is a reminder to use formalities in Latin America. For example, the author tells the reader that when leaving a shop in Latin America you should always say \\"gracias\\" or \\"muy amable\\" or at the very least \\"hasta luego.\\" And that you should greet store employees, waiters, taxi drivers, receptionists and guests with \\"bueno d&iacute;as\\" \\"buenas tardes\\" or \\"buenas noches\\" whichever is appropriate. As the author mentions, Latin America is a lot more formal than United States. And Latin America is especially more formal than the big cities in the United States. And if you attempt to avoid the formalities in Latin America it will make it obvious that you are a gringo.This book is very fun and interesting to read. I recommend this book for students studying the language in a classroom. And I also recommend this book for adults who are learning the language on their own. Besides helping you to improve your ability to communicate in Spanish, it will also give you some interesting insight of the culture of Latin America."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"The book is great but beware, it is really designed for those Spanish learners who have plateaued. I actually had to put the book on the shelf for 3-4 yrs. Just picked it back up recently and can only now really appreciate it's usefullness. It isn't written for the academics but answers those nagging doubts which are always in the back of your mind... \\"do I sound like a dork when I use this textbook phrase\\".So if you speak spanish and just want to be more fluent and refined jump on it. If you are truly a beginner, buy it now in case its off the market in a few years, but just have moderate expectations."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"After entering a rather discouraging stage in my attempt to learn Spanish, I picked up my copy of BREAKING OUT OF BEGINNER'S SPANISH, once again. It is still, as it was when I first read it years ago, amazing! The author has a knack for talking to us, almost individually, and I get the sense that he actually understands my personal struggles with learning Spanish. As such, the book has taken me out of my phase, and I am reinvigorated. I have bought lots of books on learning Spanish, but this is most certainly my most valued. I won't even lend it to anyone, for fear that it will be lost.One favorite part, on this re-read, is from the introduction, pages 5-6: Joseph Keenan writes:\\"It took me 10 years to reach a level that I am still reluctant to call 'fluency'--though friends, family...are easily wowed by my prowess. Even kind-hearted native-speakers will tell me that I have 'no accent'.... But deep down I know better. I still make little mistakes, even frequently when tired or in a hurry....I'm fluent enough for most purposes, but I know there's a next level, and I'm striving to get there.\\"I, too, live in Mexico, and am surprised that so many of my fellow ex-pats do not understand this \\"next level\\" idea.Thanks so much, Mr. Keenan.Alinde OMalley"},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"This is the bridge from classroom spanish to Real World spanish.

It's a must to keep beside your Spanish dictionary. Breaking Out will definitely help you pick the correct words and phrases to avoid sounding dumb or offending someone. It could use an index, though. It's meant to be read and studied more than to be used an a reference."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"Having read only the first few chapters, it has taught me quite a few things about the hispanic cultures I have experienced and read. Combining this book with other cultural experiences like TV, songs.... Paid sites like LomasTV, free sites like Livemocha, and other sites like the University of Texas spanish online references..... One realize that this book summarizes regional customs and vocabularies quite well. I would disagree about this book is only helpful for intermediate users. While it is of excellent value for intermediate and advanced Spanish speaker - it would equally be beneficial for a beginning Spanish student in an immersion program, or to supplement the teachings of a college spanish course. It is nice to know, for instance, that there are over a dozen way to say \\"how is it going?\\", and how to be polite in Spanish culture. While one pick up bits and pieces here and there, this book does a good job of summarizing the daily phrases that one encounter on the street, walking into a store, or as you meet hispanics along your way. I would say it is an excellent read before you head off to Europe, central or south America - even if you are still a beginning Spanish learner.Once you've gone through the first few chapters, the book really is loaded, and will give you a royal headache to absorb the content if you read it from cover to cover. I would suggest jumping around a bit. Read about ser and estar. Read about proper use of the verb tenses. Then read the hard to memorize stuff last. It is very loaded..... Tonnes of good information that is not touched on by college spanish year 1 or 2. And lots of stuff that is explained in an easy to understand way that is often too dry and boring in standard textbooks. Although it is a thin book, don't expect to read it in 1 week. It is loaded with facts and didactics, that will need to be read again, and again.In term of needing a brief index - it would be very helpful, especially for the beginner who will use it as a supplement to their spanish textbook. As reading it from cover to cover would be difficult without an intermediate spanish background. However, it is small enough that flipping through it will often get you to the chapter you'd want to be in. I think this book goes into more detail the details of spanish language than many introductory spanish texts.For the advanced spanish user, chapters on cognates, spanish verbs etc. are invaluable to help develop that instinctive sense in speaking thee language.I would suggest a brief index with the next edition, but the book still deserve a 5 star.Addendum: I've read through about half of the book. This book is intense. It is like the equivalent of a 300 level college spanish class I've taken, plus more. My guess is that I will continue to refer back to it, and reread it again. It is of value to a beginner who is doing an immersion course, or a spanish major at any level of spanish. Don't expect to plow through this book. I would select a chapter, and focus on it for the week."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"enjoyed the author's sense of humor and his knowledge of colloquial spanish in mexico and south america. good value for the student who wants to speak (rather than write) spanish."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"I purchased this book when I was diving into learning the Spanish language. Although not fluent, this book is a tremendous reference source indicated which word to use when. I still use the book to this day. The author makes it interesting and fun. I'd recommend it to anyone wishing to explore and break out of their gringo culture. I've written my own book and I've included some Spanish dialog that is not \\"proper spanish\\" in it."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"I bought this book on a recommendation. I took Spanish in high school, and even got a high enough score on the AP exam to qualify for college credit. But that was about 15 years ago. Since then I don't get much opportunity to use or practice Spanish, but I still enjoy trying to learn the language by occasionally attempting simple novels in Spanish, watching movies, etc.This book conversationally and entertainingly explains a lot of subtleties that you will not find in your standard language text. Basically, it will help you avoid making particularly embarrassing mistakes. I also thought its explanations of the subjunctive mood and when and how to use it pretty good."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"This is a great book! I have studied Spanish for 10 years and didn't think there was anything I could get out of a book for \\"beginners\\". My friend had the book with her when we went to Guatemala to study Spanish and I started reading it on the plane because I had nothing else left to read. I read the book from cover to cover and enjoyed every page. The author does a great job of explaining false cognates; it made me laugh out loud at the stupid things I have said in the past, and was embarrased by some vulgar things I've said and not realized it. I recommend this book for Spanish students of all levels."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"Great insight on concepts underlying the language and common mistakes English speakers make (Ser/Estar, Traer/Llevar). I came to Argentina to learn Spanish and I've been carrying this book around with me everywhere - if I can only take a few books with me when I go out, I take this one and my guide book and leave the dictionary/verb book at home. Best book I bought for this trip!!!!"},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"This book really helps people who have taken a beginner Spanish Class, and want to not sound like they just did. There are many chapters (even one dealing with the not-so-polite words of the language!) dealing with pronunciation, subjunctive, and other problems for Spanish-as-a-Second-Language Students. I use this in a class I teach, and highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"I bought this book a few days ago (kindle version) and enjoyed reading it so much that i finished it in no time. But the beauty about this book is that i will have it for life and read it over and over and over and ...... so on. I know i will keep having to go back and read over it again and i will love the thought of having to read this book again picking up on stuff i missed the last time i read it.My background. i am on the verge of breaking out of beginners spanish and i reckoned I would give it a try. Now here are my reasons as to why you should buy this book / or are you ready to buy it. (even if you are not ready for it, buy it, because you may never be able to find this gem of a book again.)Here is my review.1) It is a highly enjoyable read and there is humor throwing into it which will bring a smile to your face. Hard to believe that you could be smiling while learning but it's true. Example in one chapter named 64 verbs up close and personal (the best and most used) the writer gives great uses and explains them so well. way better than any dictionary i have ever seen. The writer says \\"it could be worse, you could be reading a dictionary and who wants to read a dictionary\\". Very funny.2) I have been to Spain (many times, too many to count). i have a lot of spanish friends and even when i don't go to spain to see them i go on holidays with them to China, India and so on. Now i know the writer is bias towards Mexico. thats ok with me because i have often said something very mexican to my friends and they tell me how to say it the european way. The information in this book is like finding a gold mine, my friends will be impressed. But the general gist is, you must go to a spanish speaking country too. I met an Irish girl (I am Irish too) in Spain once, she had a degree in Spanish and guess what, she couldn't get a word past her lips and she was struggling listening to people speak spanish too. She needs this book for sure. What good is a degree without experience. This book is one she could read over and over.3) I love the note taking feature of the Kindle i can underline and write my own notes. when i want to review these notes they are dead easy to find. I also know that the next time i read this book i will create new notes.4) Swear words chapter -- to be honest i am not ready for this just yet, but i will study those in the future. I think it is great he has this chapter and again like all chapters the way it is explained is outstanding.5) The history of the spanish language is very interesting at the end and the words that get mixed up in foreign translations, it is very important to know this stuff for sure.As a reviewer above said this book deserves 10 stars, true. 5 stars does not do it justice, 10 stars i say too."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"Excellent book for insight into the nuances of the language. Well written and very funny."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"I read this book during my 4th class of Espanol at the university level. This is not an introductory book, so don't bother to read it unless you have a solid understanding of Spanish basics, including basic conjugation, the subjunctive mood, etc.This book has a lot of tips to sharpen your Spanish. Chapter 8 has \\"sentence starters\\" to help you start off your spoken Spanish; evidently these are the equivalent to English's \\"well...\\" or \\"the thing is...\\" Chapter 9 has \\"snappy answers\\" organised according to how you want to respond (e.g. in disbelief, with surprise, etc.) The answers for affirmation are quite useful (e.g. esta bien, claro, de acuerdo). Of course, you can easily get this information from any college-level textbook, but the distribution of these words into nicely organised categories is quite useful. There is also a chapter on how to swear effectively (evidently chingar is a strong word), which I never did in my classroom. An earlier chapter on how to use 64 key verbs was invaluable as well.One particular chapter I loved was how to choose the correct Spanish word for particular English verbs. This can get tricky for some English infinitives like \\"to become\\" and \\"to happen.\\" Another chapter on the history of the Spanish language was very interesting to read.One thing I didn't like was the treatment of the subjunctive mood -- it left me a bit more confused, and my Spanish teacher actually told me that some information was incorrect. Finally, one glaring omission that I hope the author writes about in any later edition is the use of \\"por\\" vs. \\"para\\". To me, this trickiness is right up there with \\"ser\\" vs. \\"estar.\\""},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"Joseph Keenan has brought a bit of humor in the trudgery of learning the Spanish language. While reading this book I was constantly saying, &quot;Oh, that explains why I get such-and-such response when I say (ask) such-and-such&quot; His candor with common errors and the implications of such errors promoted a forgiving environment to develope the courage needed after realizing what you have been saying really means!In a very friendly manner, Joseph Keenan highlights motivating reasons to learn the finer details of the Spanish language. Additionally, I appreciated his graphic explanations of things that otherwise have been unexplainable by native speakers. He often used the phrase, 'a native speaker will not be able to explain the difference between...but this example will help....'This book, in whole or in part, is beneficial for all levels Spanish language students."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"In today's multi-cultural world, I think everyone should be bi or even tri-lingual. Of course, for us in the States, Spanish is a natural second language since there are so many native Spanish speakers in this country. Though not for beginners since it does require the reader to know the mechanics of the language, this book will teach the intermediate speaker how to actually communicate in Spanish. The author doesn't just teach you a series of idioms, but explains the reasons behind how and why to use them: It also clears up tricky distinctions between words. By learning Keenan's simple tricks, you will quickly gain fluency in conversational Spanish, and sound less like a hapless \\"Gringo.\\""},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"This book is fantastic. Amazing. Unbelievable. Lo mejor.I was looking for a book to help me improve my usage of Spanish; this is exactly the book I was looking for. Don't let the title fool you--while it describes the objective of the book perfectly, it's far funnier and easier to read than you might think based on the cover... (I guess that's why they say, don't judge a book by it's--well, you know.)I think that some people who have found this book unhelpful were expecting things from it that it wasn't intended to give. It's true that the book doesn't teach you tenses; it isn't supposed to. It's also true that it's not a comprehensive dictionary of idioms; it's not supposed to be. But what it's supposed to do, it does very well: It goes through some the most common mistakes that English speakers make on the road towards fluency in Spanish and helps you overcome them, while teaching you a little history and making you roll on the floor laughing at the same time. It helps you begin to stop sounding like \\"a small, semi-literate child,\\" as Keenan says in the introduction.The only problem I had was that I was cringing with embarrassment as it points out to me those silly mistakes that I have made in conversation. But that's my problem, not the book's. And it's certainly not going to make you fluent. For that, you need to spend some serious time and effort speaking Spanish day in, day out. However, it really gave me some of the confidence that I needed to let me feel comfortable using my Spanish at every opportunity that has come my way.This helped me grow so much more as a Spanish speaker than I could have done on my own--or with any other book I have found, for that matter."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"This book was required for a university class in Spanish conversation. There is so much information in this book that is invaluable to the Spanish student. It is written to show the intermediate student how to &quot;break out&quot; of the textbook Spanish into real, conversational Spanish. It tells you what aspects of the language are really used in common language and speaking, and it tells you what you should and should not say in order to sound more like a native speaker.This is a book that can be read over and over again, and it is a very good reference tool. You should not expect to be able to remember everything, because there is so much information. It will tell you everything from how to vary your speech, to how to better learn and improve your Spanish, to how to recognize profanity. It gives you information that you cannot get anywhere else - information that they do not teach you in the classroom. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"I am a native spanish speaker and I got this book for my boyfriend who is learning spanish. Sometimes I find it difficult to explain the logic behind things that are second nature for me but this book does it very nicely and from the point of view of an english speaker! I think it is great and believe it or not, he is learning real-life spanish and I am learning a lot of english!"},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"This is a true treasure of a book. For an intermediate student, it answers many question that you ask yourself, but are never answered in text books.The author didnt learn spanish as a hard core academic, he learned it the real way. He went through the same struggles you go through, and is able to help from that point of view.I've bought many books on spanish during my self led quest to learn the language; some very good, some bad, but none compare to this one.I just wish the auther would consider writing a second and even third book and expand his unique insights into a series."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"I have to disagree with those describing this book as not for beginners. Other than the 5% or 10% that deals with imperfect vs preterite tenses and subjunctive tense, the other 90%+ is an excellent guide for beginners, covering many areas where beginners typically struggle. Keenan is a very entertaining writer and fun to read. He does not offer any guidelines or rules on how to conjugate verbs, so consider this book a supplement to other learning methods. Keenan does however, zero in on a number of important topics that other Spanish textbooks tend to overlook, and he does so in great detail regarding understanding of the subtleties. For example, he points out that the \\"d\\" in nada, comida, etc. is pronounced more like \\"th\\" or \\"dth\\", not a hard d. Few spanish books or teachers mention this important pronunciation detail. Also, Keenan makes a point to explain that present tense verbs are often used to express future events too. For example, &iquest;Vienes ma&ntilde;ana? I'm not sure why, but few if any textbooks mention this dual-use aspect of the present tense. Keenan is at his best in focusing in on these kinds of details and subtleties where beginners and intermediates are most likely to stumble.Having set the bar so high in the areas he does cover so well, I was a little disappointed in a couple of other areas. Although Keenan does an above-average job in covering the important, but often confusing ser vs estar distinction, I wished he had gone into more of his characteristic level of detail when tackling the ser vs estar faceoff. For example, he doesn't address why you would use ser rather than estar when talking about an event. Why do you say \\"Donde es la fiesta?\\" Nor does he spend much time in the often confusing area of ser and estar in the preterite. These are hot-button areas of confusion for most learners of Spanish struggling with estar vs ser. Having said that, Keenan does give the best explanation I've ever read as to why you use estar instead of ser when referencing the dead, another ser/estar issue where many beginners and intermediates scratch their heads. Similar to ser vs estar, his explanation of the subjunctive in the \\"twilight zone\\" chapter was better than most I've read, but lacking in the kind of thoroughness that Keenan uses when approaching other topics.Keenan gives one piece of bad advice(my opinion)telling readers to avoid using the future tense conjugation because, according to him, it will make you sound too formal and less fluent. This advice, I'm guessing, is a result of his having learned Spanish while living in Mexico, as most native speakers there do seem to use ir (voy, va, etc) to communicate future events and actions rather than conjugate in the future tense. Outside of Mexico, however, this is not the case. It is common among native spanish speakers in South America and the Carribean to conjugate using the future tense in casual everyday conversation.I thought that the chapters on Spanish obscenities and the history of the Spanish language, although interesting, were a squandering of Keenan's considerable talent, and together they take up close to 1/4 of the book. The history part in particular seemed like a \\"page filler\\" and that's the main reason why I didn't give this book 5 stars. Those pages could have been better used to address other areas which so often trip up those trying to learn Spanish: por vs para, word suffixes, que vs cual.. these topics aren't mentioned at all in the book, and would have been perfect for someone with Keenan's insights. Nonetheless, this book is very good. Most of the topics which Keenan does cover, are well chosen and covered very thoroughly with insights you won't find elsewhere. He offers a somewhat unique perspective coming from an English speaker who learned Spanish as an adult living in Mexico, helping readers avoid many of the pitfalls in learning Spanish which he undoubtedly experienced himself."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"People who study linguistics distinguish between syntax (the study of how words work together to make gramatically well-formed sentences), semantics (how well-formed sentences come to mean things), and pragmatics (how utterances elicit responses when spoken and used between speakers). Lots of Spanish grammar books are strong on syntax and semantics, but this is just about the only one I know of which is about pragmatics, the kinds of responses that you may (inadvertently or intentionally) elicit from native speakers when making utterances in Spanish. This includes, for example, the fact that (irrelevant to syntax and semantics) the habitual use of 'yo' to refer to oneself is perceived as rather snotty, grammatical though it may be. Nonverbal behaviors are also discussed in helpful ways; the reader may not be aware that tapping out the &quot;shave and a haircut, two bits&quot; rhythm is the equivalent of sticking your middle finger in someone's face. Knowing this can save one serious problems in a Spanish-speaking culture. Information like this makes Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish a great resource."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"Have you studied some--or perhaps a great deal of--Spanish, but find yourself falling into the same traps that peg you for a gringo year after year? Ferret out this book and get to know it very well. Despite the unassuming title, this dynamic book will teach at least a few things to everyone learning Spanish, no matter what their level, and Keenan's lighthearted style makes it pain-free. Learn the &quot;crutch words&quot; to use if your Spanish is halting--the Spanish equivalents of &quot;um,&quot; &quot;er,&quot; and &quot;you know.&quot; He has pondered over the subtleties and shadings of communication and happily invites us to crank up our skills. Chapter 9 gives you &quot;Snappy Answers&quot;; the stock phrases and comebacks you hear constantly in Spanish conversation, e.g., &quot;de acuerdo,&quot; &quot;?en serio?,&quot; and &quot;!imaginese!,&quot; but which may require some background to use properly.

Most textbooks are boring sleep inducers. Most books confuse rather than enlighten when it comes to explaining grammar and vocabulary. Not this one. Keenan's explanation of the subjunctive mode is soooo easy and simple. It's the best I've ever seen and I have been teaching a long time. His answer for the future tense is great also.

Most students get disheartened at some stage of their learning. For many, they reach a plateau just after the basics when they struggle to move to the next level. After the initial introductory phrases, words and verbs have been learned it can be tough to push yourself to keep learning.This book does a wonderful job of highlighting the most common stumbling blocks encountered by new Spanish students, and then provides help in getting over them.Written in a friendly and information tone, the book is accessible to everyone, never sounding condescending and always offering encouragement to the learner. The text is lively and fun to read, revealing some of the \`secrets' of the Spanish language, such as why everything seems reversed, and the difference between some common words.You will even learn some Spanish \`filler' words to use in place of the typical English \`um' or \`er' while you are searching for the right word.This is just one of the lessons that are included in the book which can help you to feel more confident in speaking every day Spanish in real life situations. The book allows you to take your studies and use them in a practical and meaningful way.Each lesson is delivered in short, manageable chunks so that you don't feel overwhelmed. This format is also great for students with short attention spans or who have difficulty concentrating on challenging topics.As well as useful grammar and vocabulary topics, the book also deals with some fun subjects such as culture which all add to the enjoyment of the text. Reading it feels less like learning or studying and more like discovering extra ways to enjoy learning Spanish.And if you are still frustrated, then the chapter on how to swear and curse in Spanish might come in handy! If nothing else it is a light hearted look at how, despite the differences in language we are all alike, with the same need to express ourselves.There is an emphasis on moving you outside of the classroom, and taking your knowledge into a practical environment. After all, do you want to be able to read Spanish newspapers or be able to chat to the man selling them? This book helps to bridge the gap between academic studies of grammar, vocabulary, sentence structure and verbs and the desire to put that knowledge to use by communicating with Spanish speakers.The book also offers tips on learning as well as suggesting the best vocabulary and verbs to study to help you feel more confident in your Spanish.In closing my review of this product, I'd like to share with you the three Amazon products that I have found most helpful in my pursuit to learn Spanish. If you are truly serious about achieving fluency, I'd recommend getting all 3 of them if you can afford it.1.Lights, Camera, Spanish (Book + DVD): Learn Conversational Spanish by Watching a Romantic AdventureThis is actually a 90 minute movie for Spanish-language learners. It gives the option to watch the movie with subtitles but I'd recommend not using them to improve your Spanish. This \\"movie\\" also includes a workbook so that you can reinforce the Spanish vocabulary words and phrases from the film. The workbook also has lots of exercises to keep you engaged in the film. But be prepared to hear Chilean accents. Although pleasent to the ear, the accents from Chile are very different from most Latin American accents.2.Verbarrator Version 1.1 (Windows Version)This software replaces the traditional verb conjugation books and makes learning how to conjugate Spanish verbs an interactive and fun activity. This should be a required resource for anyone who wants to improve their ability to conjugate Spanish verbs. Especially anyone who is challenged by the drudgery of learning how to conjugate Spanish verbs and who is looking for a new way to make learning how to conjugate Spanish verbs an easy and fun activity3.Diccionario esencial de la lengua espanola de la Real Academia Espanola (Spanish Edition)If you are really serious about speaking the language fluently, then at some point you will need to replace your Spanish-English dictionary and get a pure Spanish dictionary with both the vocabulary words and the definitions entirely in Spanish.

I first read this book after I was living in Guatemala for 7 months and although I leaned a ton, in retrospect I wish I read the book 7 months earlier. I think that this book is a must have as a supplement to any Spanish classes or Spanish grammar one is using at any level of Spanish learning.

If you read this book, and pay attention, you will go from sounding like a gringo to a person who has actually listened to the Spanish language, not just read grammer books. This book best serves folks who've had a least two years of grammer but it's also helpful for those just beginning to avoid some really terrible mistakes that beginners typically make."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"This is a wonderful concise book for taking your ability to speak Spanish to a higher level quickly. This upward movement is usually painful and requires a tremendous amount of work. However, this book gives you what you need to know in a relatively painless manner.You will about many common mistakes that non-native speakers make and correct them by following the well-organized, short lessons presented in the text. Specifically, you will overcome the bad habits that are holding you back and replace them with new ones that will boost you to the next level.I own many Spanish books, software, audio tapes and CDs. This text is one of my top \\"must have\\" choices for moving forward quickly and enjoying the ride along the way!"},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"This isn't your run of the mill, text heavy, boring kind of language book. I found this nugget in my local public library and bought it from Amazon after I had read it. Why? because I'll be reading it again and again. The author is engaging and makes many references to his own failures and mishaps while learning Spanish himself. Now my goal is the same as his was - learn to speak Spanish well enough for others to ponder my accent and wonder exactly what Spanish speaking country is this guy from? This book will definately help you keep your pie (y zapata) out of your boca. Or I should say it fully \\"Esto ayudar&aacute; a guardar su pie de su boca.\\""},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"This is a fantastic book.

I have so many I almost didn't order it, but I'm so glad I did!"},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"Notwithstanding my recent romantic desires for a certain woman of Latin origins, and that I am a student of Spanish, I am not compelled to \\"speak Spanish like a native\\". The \\"gotta get it right\\" tone of this book (and many courses oriented to the beer-swigging tourist) isn't a selling point for me. But this is a good read, very informative and entertaining. Worth every penny. The discussion about the subjunctive is maybe a bit off-putting, not because the author fails to grasp the Spanish application of that somewhat unecessary tense (all you need is \\"maybe\\")--but because he seems confused about the English non-use of it in similar \\"situations\\" for which, he says, Spanish requires it.It is not a good idea to ever over-concern yourself with idiomatic expressions, in any language. They come, they go. Like, read some dialog from an aging novel:\\"Dig this,\\" says one character, holding up a glittery item.\\"Far out!\\" says another character ...I am left, by Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish, with the feeling that Spanish, deep down in the nitty gritty grammar, especially compared with English--whose main \\"problem\\" is its spelling--see, for example,The Future of Fonics: Spelling and Literacy--might be a bit too fraught with ancient cultural freight for a foreigner to worry much (not anymore, say, than using the big fork for salad) about ephemeral idioms and uttering shamefully quaint constructions. One asks himself how much of his personality, at home and away, is the result of his use (choices) of idiomatic speech, and, for that matter, perfect grammar? In other words, wherever your travels take you, just put your heart in the right place and &iexcl;hablabla!"},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"This book didn't increase my vocabulary or make me feel more confident in my spanish speaking ablilities. It can help improve how you communicate the spanish you already know. It doesn't help you learn knew words, and only helps you learn some general sayings and help with words you choose to say depending on who you are talking to. It's very long and boring, worst of all he explains almost everything in English! How can I build on my spanish if all I'm reading for the most part is English? I've read many spanish books and I must say it's more boring then any other book I've read thus far! Which I know is opposite of other posts I've read. weird. One example the book gives is for the word adios! I think everyone has a general idea of when to say adios and in what context after begginners spanish.

There was no introduction, and most of the instructions in the book were in English, so i wasn't helpful to me trying to learn Spanish."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"I bought this book thinking it would help me improve upon my basic Spanish skills.

It is at the top of my list for breaking out of beginners Spanish."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"I recently bought another copy of this book as the first one has fallen to pieces from much use. It's not your typical language text and not for rank beginners but it certainly gets the points across in an easy and often humorous manner. The lack of an index is a minor annoyance, and who has ever died from having to flip through the pages of a book?"},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"This is a book that I have been searching for. Most of the books I have come across only give very \\"stiff-sounding\\" vocabulary and idioms. The author of this book seems to be someone similar to me in how I learned Spanish; 10 years of school and college and then going to Spanish speaking countries and dating Spanish women. He is very good at explaining a lot of things that are culture related. For example, the difference between \\"nice\\" and \\"not so nice\\" people in Spanish are differentiated as buen educado and mal educado.What I hate about most Spanish/English dictionaries is that words are not necessarily translated properly and I noticed that reverse lookup from the Spanish and the English sections sometimes don't correlate (saca puntos, which is pencil sharpener is incorrectly translated in the English section of many dictionaries to corta lapices). What I really find more valuable at my level is a Spanish dictionary with Spanish translations. This book is a valuable as that type of dictionary.So far this is the best book I have found for my level of Spanish."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"Your mama probably told you that life isn't fair. This axiom is well-illustrated by the fact that this book seems to drift in and out of availability while many other offerings that are far worse just seem to keep hanging around. This book won't do you much good if you've never had a Spanish class but if you have had a year or two of high school or college Spanish back there somewhere in your past, it will well and truly take you to the next level. I lost my first copy in a recent move and just replaced it with another copy. It is that good."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"I think most of the other reviews on here say it, but this book is written well with some funny thoughts from the author.

Especially for gringos or 'gringas' like me.That is the strong point of the book.The weak points are obvious. Incomplete in every way, from idioms to adequate presentation of the past, present and future tenses. The book is 'good' not 'great'.I recommend you buy this book and use it. It would be an invaluable but incomplete asset in your learning Spanish arsenal.If you really want to learn to speak the language and want a comprehensive and easy to learn from complete text on Spanish complete with translations and answer keys, I would have to recommend you buy Behind the Wheel Spanish with 8 CDs and the book.Awesome and practical.I have used both Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish and Behind the Wheel.But for me, Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish is the backup.Behind the Wheel is the main course."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"Very informative and interesting book.

When the book arrived, I could not find \\"subjunctive\\" mentioned in the table of contents. A quick skim of the book revealed that there was indeed a chapter on the subjunctive; it was titled \\"The Twilight Zone\\" (most of the other chapters also have cutesy, fatuous, vague titles). I began to read \\"The Twilight Zone\\" and noticed, in the second sentence, that the author refers to \\"the subjunctive mode,\\" not \\"the subjunctive mood.\\" Immediately suspicious of the author's knowledge of grammar, I discarded the book and went looking for another."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"This book really provides a unique insight into a realm of a foreign language that you probably will not find in your textbook.

I find myself referring back to it over and over again. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"This book is written wonderfully. Its funny, its direct and delivered to the Beginner in a comfortable, knowledgeable manner. I purchased the Kindle version initially. Then as I began to realize that me and this book were going to be old friends for the duration of my sorre' into learning the language, I purchased the paperback version. I knew there was going to be highlighting and annotating important pages plus writing the page numbers with a short reminder of what was an important items on the beginning page. Then, once the book is finished, I knew where to go for review and study. My bonding with this book is tight and is getting tighter."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"Of course I jumped right to the dirty words and their uses. I loved it! Such insight on how different cultures who speak Spanish use the language. There should be a book like this for English learners or users too!"},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish is the language book I've been looking for.

It's superfun to read and makes Spanish even more entertaining, while giving very real insights from the author's direct experience!"},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"Its title say it all. A very good book but its up to the person reading that should know that with anything one has to practice n u will get to the level u need to be. I recommend this"},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"I don't know how anyone who is involved in self-teaching the Spanish language can advance without this book. It answers virtually every question one can imagine that was not answerrd in beginning Spanish. The author is especially good in his clarification of the subtle uses of many of the common verbs and nouns. Overall, the book, once you've studied it, gives you a greater sense of confidence in your speaking and writing the language."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"In a change of pace from most foreign language instructional texts, this book was written not by an academic but by a native English speaker who at the time of publication had lived and worked in Mexico for 10 years and whose wife (I am guessing from the acknowledgments) is Mexican. This is a \\"Been there, done that, don't make the same mistakes as I did\\" kind of book.The book is written in a straightforward, conversational style that is often as amusing as it is educational. The book will help you in your quest for fluency (but of course, you won't become fluent from reading the book any more than you could learn to ride a bicycle from reading about it).Perhaps I can save you some time in reading the reviews by summing them up. Almost everyone loves this book. Most people wish the book had an index (and you will too). Most like the fact that the book has a chapter on vulgarities (if only to know what to avoid saying) while a handful flinch at seeing the topic broached in the book. Everyone agrees that this is no stuffy textbook.This book will suit a wide range of learners, from those just beyond beginner Spanish to those who are nearly fluent. As you progress in learning the language, you will continue to find things of value in the book.OK, so the book is great, you could learn a lot, but is it right for you? It is if you know the basics of the language and want to learn to speak more colloquially. If you need to know how to conjugate verbs, then you're still a beginnner, not ready to break out. If you're looking for a book to help you pass the next quiz in your Spanish class, this is probably not for you. But if you are ready to converse with native Spanish speakers, this could be your passport to travel out of the classroom and into the real world."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"I have enjoyed this book for a couple of years now, but think a more appropriate title would be &quot;Breaking Out Of Intermediate Spanish&quot; or even advanced Spanish for that matter. It is really a grammar book disguised as a very funny, entertaining read about how Spanish is actually spoken in Latin America. The &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; section on the subjunctive mood is the most understandable explanation of a verb form that continually confuses and confounds English speaking people. I am fluent in Spanish but go back to this book every once and a while to find things that can still help me improve my conversational Spanish."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"I have studied Spanish for 14 years, and am currently student teaching in a middle school Spanish class. I bought this book to help me tutor another person and found instead that the book helped me far more than anything else. The author has explained concepts in such a way that suddenly things which have troubled me since the beginning of my studies (such as the subjunctive) are clear. In one reading he helped me more than 14 years of teachers. I just returned from living in South America, where this book was a frequent resource."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"This book has a gold mine of great spanish to learn. I had read over 100 spanish books trying to learn spanish and was mostly disappointed with them all until I read this one. This book took me from a beginning intermediate level to an advanced level. My extended family only speaks spanish and after reading this book I was able to understand most of their jokes and carry on conversations with them with little stumbling. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is on an intermediate level and who is serious about becoming an advanced speaker. Also it's hard to find spanish books that focus on the spanish slang/phrases spoken in Mexico, but this one teaches a lot of phrases from Mexico, and includes other countries as well."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"This book is an invaluable resource for the person who knows the basics of Spanish but wants to be able to converse more colloquially and fluidly. I bought it to use as a reference, but I sat down and basically read it cover-to-cover like a novel--it's that well-written and fascinating. It contains great advice on common pitfalls English speakers make, uses of words that the dictionaries don't tell you about, and particularly helpful, translations of those verbal tags you put on sentences in normal conversation--\\"y'know,\\" \\"well,\\" \\"and so on,\\" etc. I found this to be extremely valuable because, as the author says, you can throw these phrases in while your brain is grinding into 1st gear and throwing together the sentence ahead.However, I can't give it the full 5 stars because:*I wish the author would have treated the \\"trilled rr\\" issue a little more fully. Other than TV and radio announcers, I have never heard an actual Hispanic person use the trilled rr. To me, accustomed to the speech of Puerto Ricans, Colombians, and Dominicans, it sounds stilted and affected. Also, like a lot of people, I can do the trilled rr as an isolated sound, but I just can't get it as part of a word. It would've been neat if the book had given alternatives for the rr-impaired--at the very least, a quick review of how to make the \\"flap\\" r sound so you at least won't be using an American English r.*The book doesn't have an index, which it really should. Yes, you should read the whole thing; but an index would really be handy when you are practicing your Spanish and you can't remember how to say \\"no wonder\\" or what verbs you should use instead of \\"coger.\\" This is the major reason I have to dock them a star. I would definitely go up to 5 stars--6 if I could--if the next edition would have an index.But buy the book, because it's terrific and it will take you up a level in your spoken Spanish!"},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"I absolutely love this book! Who would have thought a required text for school could be funny?! Chapter three \\"tricksters\\" or false cognates is vital for those unfamiliar with the nuances of he language. I knew most of them but it is always good to rewiew. I highly reccomend this for anyone interested in improving their Spanish."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"I own many spanish books, but this is the only one I pick up and read again and again. From the section on tricky words that look like English words but mean something TOTALLY different in Spanish to healthy advice on grammar, to lists of useful verbs (including new twists on old verbs ... who knew you could &quot;puedo con&quot; something or that &quot;penso ir&quot; was planning to go). To round out the full experience the author even included a comprehensive section on swearing (and how to avoid it). Well worth the money. I especially enjoyed the section on how NOT to sound like a gringo.My only beef with the book was the grammar section. After explaining what a subjunctive was, when it was needed, why you needed it and thoroughly sold you on your dire need to master this portion of the language he left out HOW to make a verb subjunctive. Fortunately a bit of looking on the internet popped up that information for me.I've had the book for about 6 months and still read it again and again getting new phrases and insights from every read. Worth every penny."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"My personal thanks to Joseph Keenan for this book, which has been most helpful and invaluable to me. If you are looking for a step-by-step guide to the nuances of grammar, this is not it! :o) This is an entertaining cultural guide to the language! It is funny, which helps me to remember the material presented. Another plus for this book is that the author goes to great pains to teach you how not to slip up, sound stupid, or unintentionally offend. Joseph Keenan remembers what it was like to be the gringo struggling with the language, and plays the part of the fluent friend you wish you had with you on that last trip to Latin America! Thanks Joseph!!!"},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"The world really needs more writers like Joseph Keenan. I just returned from Mexico, studied spanish for three weeks in a school. Everything I read in this book worked, with pleasant results. People thought I was a lot more fluent than I really was, and I shined above other students at my own level from studying this book before I went. This book gives verb usages and phrases that you're not going to learn in the language class. It also helps you get around English verb/preposition concepts that don't have a direct translation in spanish, that's what you need to start thinking in your new language. If you want to learn spanish, you should study this book right along with your verb conjugations and grammar constructs. This book is totally useful."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"This book avoids the dull approach and concentrates mainly on providing practical advice so as to make it easier to communicate effectively with native speakers. The most common words, phrases and idiomatic expressions not generally covered in standard textbooks or taught in schools, is the main focal point.Several snappy filler and transition words designed to initiate or continue a conversation are offered to help reduce the problem of becoming entangled in a web of confusion which often leaves you speechless or embarrassed. Many commonly used verbs, etc. are presented in context with enough examples explaining their usage, with a view to eliminating the situation that can arise where some statements, though said in good faith and innocence, can be construed as obscene or insulting.Popular expletives, as used among native speakers, are included to add a bit of spice and variety since these expressions form a part of every living language. Therefore, each student ought to become familiar with these everyday expressions, if only for the sake of knowledge. This book is worth the price."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"I cannot say enough good things about this book! It is written by a native English speaker who has lived in Mexico for years. So he understands the common pitfalls of the English-speaker and understands (better than most native-Spanish speakers) what concepts are confusing to the English-speaker.In my experience, your average Spanish textbook presents grammar as a set of rules and uses dry, academic language to explain them. They use a lot of grammatical terminology to explain the rules (\\"Use the subjunctive in clauses with an indefinite antecedent\\" and terms like \\"adverbial clauses\\", \\"coordinating conjunctions\\", \\"gerunds\\", and \\"objective case\\"). So you spend as much time trying to understand the jargon and English grammar rules as you do learning the Spanish grammar. As Keenan proves, you DO NOT have to teach a foreign language this way!In this book, Keenan gives simple explanations of Spanish grammar rules. And he does so in a way that is much more intuitive (and humorous) than typical Spanish textbooks. His chapter on idiomatic expressions that help your speech sound more natural and less stilted has really helped me improve my spoken Spanish. The chapter on the 64 most common Spanish verbs is far more helpful and explanatory than any dictionary or verb book that I have used in the past. Rather than list 4 or 5 meanings for the verb \\"quedar\\" with no explanation, Keenan gives you the most important/common uses and in what contexts people use them.A major focus of the book is on mistakes that English-speakers often make in their Spanish--whether it be false cognates or trying to decide which word to use when there are 3 or 4 slightly-different words to pick from.Keenan's writing is always humorous and easy-to-understand. It's never overwhelming. I highly recommend this book for students who've had about 1 year's worth of Spanish study and have a basic understanding of the various verb tenses. If you are taking a conversation class, DEFINITELY buy this book!"},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"I personally think i bought this book to early, becuase there was alot of grey area when i first started reading the book. but i have to say while there was alot of grey i still learned alot. This book teaches you, but not like you are probably thinking, and that is why i say that you should hold off on buying this till you are getting into different tenses, etc. Because at that point you should have a decent vocabulary built along with a decent understanding of the language.Now, on to what the book does teach you.It makes sure that you are saying things, i guess you could say \\"Politically correct\\" things. Becuase it explains how some words in spanish and english look the same they dont mean the same thing for example, \\"emberazado\\" you might naturally think of using that word becuase in english that is what you felt, but in reality, what your telling the other person is that you are pregnant!this book gives great explainations, and tackles all the confusing things, and also gives clarity on many others. It teaches you cussing words, and also words that might seem harmless such as huevos/eggs which could be easily seen as profanity in spanish (example: quieres mi huevos? you want my eggs? now think of male genitils, you get the idea.) anyway this book i would buy again, but i wish i had saved it for later when i had a better grasp on the language. You wont be dis-appionted with it, keep a spanish-english dictionary nearby though becuase there are some words that you might have not seen yet, and since this books has no definition index in the back you may need one."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"I loved this book. I've been studying spanish for about 5 years, and I'm currently in college level spanish. I loved the author's sarcasm, it added some spice to the writing, and it allowed you to understand the context for which the words were meant to be used."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"This book was very valuable to me in increasing my fluency and ability to think in Spanish. I learned Spanish \\"fillers\\" for when I can't think of what to say, so that I sound more Spanish. I think that this book is comical, insightful and entertaining as well as very well thought out. Kudos to the author who presented Spanish in a very easy to learn format."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"I recently purchased this book because of the enthusiastic customer reviews on this site and am so pleased with it that I feel obliged to add my comments. I own several shelves of language books for several different languages and I believe Keenan's is easily one of the most useful and useable for someone who has the basics of the language. The fact that it is also a delight to read puts it almost in a class by itself."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"I bought this book while living in a small Mexican town with a high Gringo population. (There's probably not a higher concentration of Spanish courses and dog-eared study guides anywhere on the face of the planet). This book is far superior, in both readability and depth of insight, to anything that I have ever encountered, whether in Mexico or the United States. But heed my warning: If you make the mistake of loaning this book to friends, you'll never get it back!!!!"},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"As the title implies, you are breaking OUT of beginners Spanish, but not BEGINNING Spanish. This is a very good book for the intermediate level learner but too advanced for the novice learner.For real beginners, the best book I have found is Conversational Spanish in Nothing Flat which came with 8 CDs."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"Usually I don't write reviews, but this book is that good. If you are on the intermediate level and need that boost into near fluency, this is definitely the book. It covers a ride array of topics to do that.

Its not that its syntax is unsupportable, a dictionary and grammar will uphold it, but people do not actually speak the language that way! Keenan helped me overcome the clip and paste nature of do-it-yourself Spanish, and classroom Spanish, in favor of the language of the people who speak it. With candor, clarity and wit, his is a book you'll refer to as you gain fluency."},{"Title":"Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish","review":"I have been studying Spanish for about 40 years. I knew the basics and could communicate, but I took a great leap forward 5 years ago when I married my Mexican husband. I can so relate to Keenan's experience of learning by being around native speakers. I find it extremely interesting to read things in his book that I, too, have \\"learned the hard way\\". Of course, I'm referring to idioms and other expressions that one doesn't learn in a grammar book. He is so on-target with his usages. I don't know where all he has lived, but his \\"Mexicanisms\\" are right on the money. I really admire the way his mind cuts to the important points and leaves out all the details that confuse. It's kind of like talking to a friend. They give you the scoop. They tell you what YOU want to know. I'm not through reading the book. I'm taking my time and savoring it. I'll probably read it again when I finish it. Probably 80% of what I've read so far I already knew, but it makes it easier to connect the new knowledge. This is a great book for anyone who's familiar with Spanish, but wants to feel more at home with native speakers. I noticed on the back cover that Keenan lives in Brazil. I've been studying Portuguese, on my own, (and with the help of some Brazilian penpals) for about a year now, and I hope he has plans to write a similar book for the Portuguese language. I, personally, would buy it in a heartbeat."},{"Title":"Sedimentation Engineering (Manual and Report on Engineering Practice Ser., No. 54)","review":"Its really a very nice book I have ever read on sediment transport and mechanism.

The story of Nathan and Shelby, best friends as young children until the mystery of the river monster creates circumstances that ultimately causes Shelby and Nathan to part. When they are reunited in the same small town many years later, they rediscover each other, as well as the mystery of the river monster, the suspicious activities of the lab by the river, conflict from Shelby's uncle, and the secrets each of them carry about the lives they led since their early departure.The romance between Nathan and Shelby is sweet and innocent from the beginning to the end. My only complaint is the emotional connection of the two never seem very climatic, no desperation or urgency to be together.This is a touching story of friendship, love and loyalty. Most of all, danger and very unpredictable mystery. Any hopeless romantics will love the surprise ending!!!"},{"Title":"Nighttime Guardian (Harlequin Intrigue 607)","review":"This is one of the better Amanda Stevens books that I have read.

As a pre-teen and teenager, it was my favorite Tarzan book simply because of Jad-Bal-Ja, the golden lion of the title. Heck, I had a pet dog I ran around with; Tarzan got to run around with a lion.In the book, Tarzan finds himself in Opar, a remnant of the lost city of Atlantis (he's bee here before in &quot;Tarzan and the Jewels of Opar&quot;). He's not exactly a popular guy in Opar and is rescued from certain death (is there any other kind in these books) by La, the High Priestess of Opar who just happens to be in love with Tarzan. They are forced to flee together into the Valley of Diamonds, which just happens to be ruled by some very nasty gorillas. Fortunately for Tarzan, Jad-bal-ja is on his trail and arrives in the nick of time.While this is still a favorite of mine, it contains a plot twist that I always thought was one of ERB's worst. Estaban Miranda is a Spaniard, who happens to look just like Tarzan, and somehow keeps managing to fool a lot of other characters. It just never made much sense that even if he looked like Tarzan, he could so easily get away with imitating the Lord of the Jungle."},{"Title":"Tarzan and the Golden Lion","review":"The first thing you have to consider when deciding to read this book is that is has language familiar to the vernacular of the era, but not so much in use now in polite society. Natives are called \\"boys\\" and the N word, and even tho it is by somewhat villainous characters, it may not be something you want the kids to read, at least without a discussion beforehand.In addition to the language issue, this is sort of a step down in the Tarzan series. Burroughs got too busy in this book. In just the previous book he described a very interesting three pronged society. Here, he comes up with another \\"hidden valley society\\", but he's so busy with another set of villains that he gives it very little attention. It could have been an interesting society, but with few details and plotting that has it gone almost by the time it is introduced, its left unfinished compared to his very successful \\"world building\\" in other novels.As the first reviewer mentioned, there is a very hard to take plot which has a double for Tarzan fooling people you're pretty sure he could not have fooled into thinking he was either Tarzan or Lord Greystoke. A former employee also decides to mount an expedition to loot Opar, and seems to find it just a bit too easily.Burroughs worked hard to make frustrating and complex sequences of events that kept the reader wondering how it all could end well, but in Tarzan and the Golden Lion he may have over-reached that technique. Burroughs didn't mind writing formula once he had a success with a story, and this book has \\"quickly turned out formula\\" written all over it.If you are reading the Tarzan series you don't want to skip this by any means, but you'll find yourself rolling your eyes from time to time. We do get the introduction of Tarzan's unique pet, the Golden Lion. He'll show up from time to time in future Tarzan adventures."},{"Title":"Words, Texts And Concepts Cruising The Mediterranean Sea: Studies On The Sources, Contents And Influences Of Islamic Civilization And Arabic Philosophy ... His Sixty- (Orientalia Lovaniensia Analecta)","review":"Words, Texts And Concepts Cruising The Mediterranean Sea: Studies On The Sources, Contents And Influences Of Islamic Civilization And Arabic Philosophy and Science Dedicated to Gerhard Endress on his Sixty-fifth Birthday edited by R. Arnzen, J. Thielmann (Orientalia Lovaniensia Analecta: Peeters) Excerpt: The present volume of the series Orientalia Lovaniensia Analecta contains studies and editions in honor of Gerhard Endress, Professor of Oriental Philology and Islamic Studies at the Ruhr University Bochum since 1975. They are dedicated to a scholar who well deserves the credit for having revolutionized the study of medieval Arabic philosophy and science by combining painstaking investigations into its contents and historical development with meticulous systematic studies in its language and terminology based, in turn, on a careful philological examination of its Greek and Syriac sources and the ways and modes of translation and transmission into Arabic. Gerhard Endress's fundamental studies in these fields have set landmarks for any future research through their masterful and well-balanced synthesis of profound doctrinal investigations, inimitable bibliographical richness and accuracy, and complex and demanding historical contextualization. Based on an exhaustive variety of methodologically reflected research instruments they form in their entirety what might be called a systematic archaeology of medieval Arabic philosophy and science. Apart from this immense service to our knowledge about Arabic philosophy and science it is due to Endress's research work that Graeco-Arabic Studies finally have emerged from their exotic and shadowy existence within the discipline of Classical Arabic Philology. Practised by a growing circle of scholars they are today a recognized epistemological instrument and prerequisite for any diachronic study in medieval Islamic intellectual history whose fruits and results fertilize not only other branches of Near Eastern Studies such as Arabic lexicography but also various allied fields of research such as studies in the history of philosophy and science or Classical Studies.Despite his numerous and most influential works in these fields, Endress never lost sight of and scholarly interest in the whole range of historical, intellectual and cultural phenomena of Islamic civilizations, from their very beginning up to present-day developments. His minute and precise monograph on the history of Islam, translated into English and Italian and at present in its third revised German edition, has become a standard introduction to Islam providing a huge bibliography for research and academic teaching. As former students we know from our own (fortunate) experience that he taught, and still teaches, his students 20th century Arabic literature no less competently (and exactingly) than Classical Arabic or Syriac languages and grammars or medieval Persian poetry, the core curricula of Islamic theology and jurisprudence no less eruditely than the political and social history of 14th century Maghreb or colonial Egypt, not forgetting his famous slide-show supported lectures on Islamic arts and architecture.It is the aim of this volume to mirror this immense versatility in a compilation of studies contributed by friends, colleagues, and former assistants of Professor Endress at the Bochum Department of Oriental Studies. It was the uniquely disciplined and serious manner, with which G. E. familiarized himself with nearly all facets and epoches of Islamic history including those far beyond his special fields of research, which guided us in our decision to leave the subjects of these contributions totally to their authors' choice. Being heterogeneous with respect to their topics and the modes of scientific approach, these contributions, nevertheless, form an overall unity by exploring the preconditions, lines of development and border-crossing effects of more than one thousand years of intellectual, social and political Islamic history. While some articles are intended to shed light on specific segments, problems or manifestations of this history that have been hitherto neglected, others emphasize the importance such historical developments may have for our present-day approaches to and concepts of Islam, while yet others contribute to our knowledge of this intellectual history by providing careful critical editions, translations or hermeneutic clues.While there can be no doubt that the days of the classical \`old Europe' polymaths of Oriental philology is over, this Festschrift is also intended to underline that extreme specialization narrowed by historical, cultural, methodological or language blinkers cannot be a reasonable alternative either. As is hopefully shown by the numerous points of contact, inter-section, and - in some cases thoroughly controversial - dialogue of the following 35 contributions, studies in Near Eastern languages, Arabic intellectual history and Islamic civilizations are still, if not even more so today, in need of the learned vol d'oiseau, in order to see the numerous important specific objects of research in their appropriate context, as well as of a methodical corrective only a holistic approach such as the one pre-dominant in Endress's studies can provide. The arrangement of the contributions we have chosen here is, as a consequence, only one of various possible approaches. Others certainly would reveal other points of contact and intersection, and readers are invited to create (supported, as we hope, by the indices attached) their own appropriate re-arrangements."},{"Title":"My Jerusalem: Secular Adventures In The Holy City","review":"Yes, it takes audacity to live in a place for only two years and then start calling it &quot;yours.&quot; Drainie admits that from the start, and then happily explains the uniqueness of this city that causes visitors to claim it as their own.As an observant Jew, I was wary of Drainie's approach from the start. She went to Israel as a non-Jew, covering up the fact that her mother was Jewish. Otherwise, as she correctly suggests, religious Jews would lay claim to her through matrilineal descent as one of the &quot;clan.&quot;Nevertheless, she does discover some of the spirit of Judaism, while also objectively exploring the other religious traditions uneasily cohabiting in Israel. Her stance towards the Palestinians is the kind of common-sense approach we need to hear more of, and surprisingly enlighting in terms of the current situation.Regardless of whether Drainie's Jerusalem sounds like your Jerusalem, this city belongs to all of us, and her book is a clear-eyed vision both of what Jerusalem is and perhaps what it should be."},{"Title":"My Jerusalem: Secular Adventures In The Holy City","review":"Lovely walk down memory lane for those who have been a part of this experience."},{"Title":"Discoverers and explorers","review":"The stories are very interesting but a bit short and end rather abruptly. A little more information about the explorers would help."},{"Title":"Discoverers and explorers","review":"This book is a quick entertaining and informative read about the main explorers of the Americas. However you have to keep in mind that this book was written almost 100 years ago so a lot of the information may be inaccurate. As an example, none of the stories about the Conquistadors mention anything about diseases having to do with the death of whole civilizations.That said it is still a fun read. It would be good as a starting point to learn the basics about the main explorers but if you want to get detailed and accurate you would need to download another book.The formatting is good for a free book."},{"Title":"Arctic National Wildlife Refuge: Seasons of Life and Land","review":"It's not too often that a book of nature photographs gets to fuel a congressional debate or lead to the Smithsonian being accused of being politicized but this book has done that.Subhankar Banerjee, an engineer from India, took these pictures because he wanted to move public opinion to save the coastal plain adjacent to the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as a wild place. This book was displayed on the floor of Congress by a debating Senator who agreed with Banerjee. Shortly thereafter the Smithsonian, which had scheduled a showing of Banerjee's pictures in the museum's main hall, moved the pictures to a far less desirable location and cut the captions to almost nothing. Accusations of political tampering have been flying fast and furious since then.There is little doubt that this is a book of advocacy. From the introduction by President Jimmy Carter to essays by the Pulitzer Prize winning nature writer Peter Matheson and bird artist Allen Sibley, among others, the book makes a plea for preservation of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, with particular note of strong attacks on the refuge by forces supporting the petroleum industry.The various essays describing travels in the refuge will be of interest to those who enjoy reading about trips through the great outdoors, although you have to be ready for a big dose of anti-oil rhetoric. However, I expect that no one who reads this book will be a strong supporter of the energy industry, so that much of the writing will be preaching to the converted.I can be counted as supporting preservation of the refuge, and I'd love to give this book a high rating, but I thought there were far too many pages of essays and not enough pictures. And, ultimately I think this book must be judged by the author's photographs. Unfortunately the photos are of only of so-so quality.Some of Banerjee's shots are spectacular, like those of herds of oxen against the midnight sun. Others are as subtle as the textures of the refuge itself, like the pictures of lichens growing on rocks. But most of the pictures are straight forward record shots with little sophistication. They provide information but not inspiration. Banerjee is not a great photographic artist. If that's what you want get Art Wofe's book of highly saturated, incredibly composed photographs, \\"Alaska\\". Wolfe's picture of a single Dall Sheep looks majestic. Banerjee's looks, well, moth-eaten. Banerjee's shot of a herd of Dall Sheep is a bunch of sheep in a green field. Wolfe's is an environmental photo of a herd amongst precipitous mountains.If you want a book dedicated exclusively to the refuge, and you want to show support for the refuge, and it's not important that you have great pictures to inspire you, you may want this book. Otherwise, look elsewhere for great photography of the refuge."},{"Title":"Arctic National Wildlife Refuge: Seasons of Life and Land","review":"I spent more than a week above the arctic circle last summer and actually stayed with the same people the author stayed with. The Gwich'in people live a sustenance lifestyle that is fragile and deserves deeper consideration from us than a simplistic drill-baby-drill soundbite. This book lays out solid arguments and asks tough questions, and Banerjee's images are compelling. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Arctic National Wildlife Refuge: Seasons of Life and Land","review":"This book was published in large part to disabuse people of the notion that ANWR is a white wasteland. In that it succeeds. I was surprised at how much red and green I saw in the photos. The landscape is stunning and certainly not a mere whiteout. Subhankar also gets up close to the bird life.Unlike other coffee table books of this style, the text is actually interesting. The book discusses the history of ANWR and displays maps showing the refuge, bird migration patterns, etc. The book features writing from an all-star cast, including former president Jimmy Carter and Peter Matthiessen. It's worth reading through.Fortunately, Congress seems to have gotten over its bout of insanity and is no longer trying to open ANWR to oil prospectors. However, with another election, that could well change. Hopefully, more of our representatives will take the time to at least flip through this book and see the wilderness and wildlife whose future they control. In fact, it should be required reading before any future votes on ANWR."},{"Title":"Arctic National Wildlife Refuge: Seasons of Life and Land","review":"Some amazing photos, I think the photographer got an award for one of them. The pictures speak of a land serene, pure, open. The photographer also lived in Artic village and managed to communicate the integrity of the native way of life and nature. The writing peaces are very strong! Excellent book!"},{"Title":"Arctic National Wildlife Refuge: Seasons of Life and Land","review":"If you want to read a book about the environmentalists fighting big oil interests in NE Alaska, this book is for you...As was promised, it has very little to do with a computer scientist/photographer who supposedly quit his day job and barely avoided bankruptcy to write/photograph this book...The author is nothing more than a pawn of the Sierra Club to save the environment in NE Alaska who has thrown in some very nice pictures for effect...It's obvious that he has been heavily financed by outside interests with their own agenda...They are worried about drilling for oil and saving the pristine area...That doesn't stop them from driving their gas powered quad runners/snowmobiles through the previously pristine tundra...To top it off the Alaskan Eskimos show there appreciation for the animal kingdom by having their children dance on top of a dead whale while wearing a L.A. Lakers jersey...This book is hypocrisy at its finest...No thanks..."},{"Title":"Arctic National Wildlife Refuge: Seasons of Life and Land","review":"With the stunning pictures and essays, it's like you are there. It shows the beauty of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in winter and summer. The wildlife and native people are seen as they live their lives. The essays provide guided tours into the Arctic by six conservationists.One thinks of the Arctic as all white. It is not, even in winter. The snow covered ground makes moose, grizzly, musk oxen, porcupine, willows, and many birds stand out. The ptarmigan changes plumage twice a year to blend into the two Arctic seasons. The sky can be brilliantly blue during the day, and green or red with the Aurora Borealis at night.The summer brings a greater variety of color to the land and draws the migrating birds through our parts of the country to their nesting area in the Refuge. The Porcupine caribou herd is drawn to the Coastal Plain to give birth and to fatten up for the coming long winter. The pictures and essays tell the story of the people, polar and grizzly bears, the caribou, the musk oxen, a variety of smaller animals, and the large number of bird species that live all, or part of, their lives there.The book has excellent maps. Some illustrate the migration paths of birds from North and South America, Asia, even Africa. Others show: caribou and bowhead whale migration routes; where the people live; and the major geological features.Banerjee's pictures range from the broad expanse of mountains and rivers to the color and detail of the lichen on the rocks. I've learned much. One would have to spend many months in the Refuge to see what is in this book."},{"Title":"Arctic National Wildlife Refuge: Seasons of Life and Land","review":"Take a four season journey through the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and discover the great diversity of life that hallmarks this spectacular refuge. Subhanker Banerjee's photographs capture the wildlife, the people, and the landscape in a way that has not been done before. Essays by Peter Mathiessen, David Sibley, Fran Mauer are heartfelt and beautiful.I went to the exhibit at the Smithsonian last week. Despite the political pressure to keep the pictures and the captions hidden from the public, the exhibit is inspirational and uplifting. Too bad the Smithsonian doesn't even have a sign to the exhibit, you have to search for it down in the basement. Get even with those who would keep you from seeing this book--buy it and decide for yourself if this place is worth protecting."},{"Title":"Arctic National Wildlife Refuge: Seasons of Life and Land","review":"I bought this book because there was no other way to understand the photos that were on display at the Museum of Natural History. I was not alone; several people walked around Banerjee's exhibition with their books in hand. The curator had removed all descriptive labels, and the introductory plaque emphasized how small the Arctic refuge is compared to other such reserves throughout the country. The photos were mounted in a corridor leading to an elevator. It was poorly lit, and crowded with people passing through. It was in the back of the building, and hard to find. It was a startling contrast to the Eliot Porter exhibition in one of the main exhibition halls above the ground floor. That exhibition was well designed, well described, and included copies of books like &quot;Silent Spring&quot; by Rachel Carson, hardly a neutral text. The only message I could take away was that environmentalism is &quot;safe&quot; to the Smithsonian curators only when it's at least 30 or 40 years old.The treatment of Banerjee's photos was so troublesome that Congress held hearings on the matter. But no news report could compare to the feeling of being there, near the elevator.I took the book home with me, trying to understand whether or not the poor installation was due to poor material or to poor museum administration. Banerjee's photos, and the stories and writings around the photos, are greatly compelling. The story of how hard he worked to get those photos, and of how in the process, he became a better photographer, stood out to me. I highly recommend the book, but I hope I have helped some enthusiasts know just how controversial the notion of natural beauty can be, and how the Smithsonian does play politics. Apparently, reading Banerjee's book can be considered an act of protest."},{"Title":"Arctic National Wildlife Refuge: Seasons of Life and Land","review":"The is not a true review: indeed, I have not yet recived the book for Amazon.I just came home from a dinner with Peter Mattiessen at the University of Tulsa, at which he spoke passionately of the phyiscal and finacinal effort Mr. Banerjee undertook to create this work, the reaction in Congress to the book, the pressure upon the Smithsonian and the American Muesum of American History to quash display of Mr. Banerjee's photographs, and his personal fears of deportation or worse by the Justice Department under the Patriot Act. A most frightening portral of the reach real or reasonably feared of this Adminstration when an individual, spcially an alien, dares question its motive. As Senator Stevens(R)Alaska, chair of the Senate Appropriate committee was reported to say to his colleages after Banerjee's testimony, and the Senate voted 52-48 against drilling in ANWR, \\"I know who you are and you will pay\\".To cause such a reaction--it must be worth having."},{"Title":"Arctic National Wildlife Refuge: Seasons of Life and Land","review":"I am struck not only by the photographs but also the essays that convey just a sprinkling of what the ANWR is really like. But, what a sprinkling. I have had the opportunity to spend a lot of time in the ANWR and many photographs are ones from places I haved hiked and people I have met. Many of the rivers shown are rivers I have been on. What I have not done is been there in the truly cold times and his photographs and words do great justice to those times. The drawbacks are few and perhaps it is nitpicking but there is a concentration of pictures taken on the Hula Hula. While the Hula Hula is a wonderful river to do, the Jago covers the heart of the calving grounds and the pictures there were in short supply. However, the pictures are inspiring and the only thing not captured is the sense of vastness that one gets setting foot in the ANWR. But, I have never seen a photograph that can capture that. For those who may never set foot in the ANWR, or even for those who have been there, this book is a must add to anyone's collection. The book does make me want to seek out the hot spring on the Okpilak River, however.Kongakut, Icy Reef, Bernard Spit, Jago, Hula Hula, Kaktovik, Arctic Village, the bird life and animal life --all places I have been and things I have seen, and a wonderful book with which to revisit those places."},{"Title":"Arctic National Wildlife Refuge: Seasons of Life and Land","review":"The photographs are stunning. It tells the story of a place that the proponents of oil drilling in the Refuge called &quot;white nothingness.&quot; Banerjee proves how wrong they were. The photographs have upset the White House or the Republicans so much that they somehow managed to drain a scheduled exhibition of Banerjee's work at the Smithsonian of all its value. See the New York Times article of 2 May 2003, p. A22 This utterly fascinating book deserves extensive circulation on its merits. In light of the administration's attempt to suppress this work at the Smithsonian it is an act of defiance to see that it has maximum circulation!"},{"Title":"Arctic National Wildlife Refuge: Seasons of Life and Land","review":"As an occasional visitor and fan of the high Arctic, I found the photographs of the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in this book to be among the most beautiful images of the Arctic that I have seen -- whether with my own eyes or in pictures. The photographs of the land and wildlife as well as the accompanying essays by the photographer and some of the leading nature writers of our day, all speak eloquently for full protection of this great wilderness. In particular, that the controversial Coastal Plain area should be granted wilderness status and thus permanently protected from industrial development.In my opinion, this book is environmental advocacy in its finest form. As always, advocacy is controversial. Another \\"reviewer\\" of this book, Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska, who is an avid supporter of oil drilling in the Refuge said in a Senate speech \\"This book is pure propaganda.\\"Developing and preserving the more than 500 National Wildlife Refuges have been contentions political issues since Theodore Roosevelt established the first one in 1903. There have been continual battles between using the Refuges for activities such as mining, military exercises, grazing, and use of motorized vehicles and their primary purpose of protecting wildlife. In that sense, the ongoing ANWR debate is \\"simply\\" the latest and best known of a long series of struggles between development and conservation in the Refuges. (The recently published Smithsonian Book of National Wildlife Refuges contains an excellent account of this history.)The case for development can be quantified in terms of dollars and cents, jobs, and taxes to be collected. By contrast, the case for conservation is impossible to quantify. It depends on softer almost spiritual arguments -- demonstrating the value of natural beauty; understanding that preservation of the diversity of all species is almost certainly crucial to the preservation of our own, and preserving for future generations small portions of the planet untrammeled by man.Reconciling these objectives for the ANWR is ultimately a matter of judgement for it's guardians -- the American people and their elected representatives. To decide wisely we need to be informed about the land and the issues that surround it. Thus I encourage you to buy (or borrow from your library) this important book, read it, and share with your fellow citizens what you have learned."},{"Title":"Arctic National Wildlife Refuge: Seasons of Life and Land","review":"The entire US Congress should read this book before voting to allow oil drilling in ANWAR.

In the first, a cynical promoter of s&eacute;ances is brutally murdered while in a locked room, and a legendary local ghost is seemingly the only suspect. In the second, a young man agrees to spend the night in a haunted room, and when the room is unlocked after two hours he is dead of no apparent cause, and had been for more than an hour--though he had seemingly answered calls from his friends waiting outside the room during that time. The mysteries baffle everyone, including especially the readers--no detective fiction writer ever produced mysteries that, while being fair in the presentation of clues, were harder to figure out--but H.M. is always equal to the challenge.While in some of his later (postwar) appearances H.M. became a more comic figure, given to tantrums and buffoonery, this tendency was as yet under control in these works, which established the character's well-deserved reputation as one of the greatest literary detectives of the so-called Golden Age of mysteries. His introduction in Plague Court Murders is classic. The \\"Maestro\\" welcomes old friends and colleagues who he worked alongside as espionage agents during the \\"Great War\\" into his shabby Whitehall office, unapologetically drinking brandy and smoking cigars while at work, and in his inimitable cranky, intimidating style, begins to get to the bottom of gruesome, baffling, seemingly supernatural crimes.But there is a real sense of sadness as well as fun about H.M., whose loud antics thinly veil his regret over the deaths and disappointment his cases invariably bring to light, and his keen, watchful intelligence--he is like a poker player (and H.M. is mentioned off-handedly as being a fine one) whose bluster and jokes are intended to distract his opponents and observers from figuring out what he is really thinking and planning. One can readily see how H.M. could have been a formidable intelligence officer (where deception is so critical) as well as a masterful detective. But what really sets him apart from the Holmeses and Queens and Wolfes is perhaps that he seems immensely more sheer fun to spend time with. At one point in The Red Widow Murders (Chapter 11) H.M. insists that his \\"Watson\\" spend a late night with him at home, drinking whiskey and coffee, conversing interestingly and intelligently but rarely to the point, and playing board games (\\"what looked like children's pursuits\\") until the sun comes up. There likely has never been another fictional detective as amusing, interesting, and impressive, and he was never more so then in these two classic novels."},{"Title":"Merrivale Holds the Key: Two Classic Locked-Room Mysteries (Ipl Library of Crime Classics)","review":"Although these mysteries were written over 60 years ago, the plots are still clever and fresh. The author's use of language is also very good.

Her third book contains arrangements from the whimsical to sassy and she breaks them down step-by-step, like a big floral arrangement cookbook. I have attempted the Checkerboard Flower Box (about half the size of the one in the book) and it lasted nearly two weeks, thanks to the wonderful conditioning tips. My other favorite section is the Welcoming Windows, about making the all important first impression.

Nonplussed, Orlando decides that it is \\"better to be quit of martial ambition, the love of power, and all other manly desires if so one can more fully enjoy the most exalted raptures known to the human spirit, which are . . . contemplation, solitude, love.\\"There follows much discussion of gender and gender confusion. Woolf tells us that:\\"The difference between the sexes is, happily, one of great profundity. Clothes are but a symbol of something hid deep beneath. It was a change in Orlando herself that dictated her choice of a woman's dress and of a woman's sex. And perhaps in this she was only expressing rather more openly than usual - openness indeed was the soul of her nature - something that happens to most people without being thus plainly expressed. For here again, we come to a dilemma. Different though the sexes are, they intermix. In every human being a vacillation from one sex to the other takes place, and often it is only the clothes that keep the male or female likeness, while underneath the sex is the very opposite of what it is above.\\"There are many other themes in this imaginary biography which spans centuries. One is comical examination of English society and culture:\\"Thus, stealthily, and imperceptibly, none marking the exact day or hour of the change, the constitution of England was altered and nobody knew it. ... The muffin was invented and the crumpet. Coffee supplanted the after-dinner port, and., as coffee led to a drawing-room in which to drink it, and a drawing-room to glass cases, and glass cases to artificial flowers, and artificial flowers to mantelpieces to pianofortes, and pianofortes to drawing-room ballads, and drawing-room ballads (skipping a stage or two) to innumerable little dogs, mats, and antimacassars, the home - which had become extremely important - was completely altered.\\"This \\"biography\\" is also metafiction, and there are several humorous references to the act of writing. In fact, Orlando herself writes prolifically throughout the novel (carrying with her a poem, \\"The Oak Tree,\\" that must constantly be revised as she changes).and encounters many literary figures, among them the revered Alexander Pope who makes a big impression: \\" ... \`How noble his brow is,' she thought (mistaking a hump on a cushion for Mr. Pope's forehead in the darkness).\\"Sometimes I don't get Virginia Woolf, but I was very entertained by this novel."},{"Title":"Orlando : a biography","review":"This experimental and unusual novel by Virgina Woolf spotlights the rhythm of her prose as no other work of hers can do. The flights of fancy, the descriptions, the tongue-in-cheek humor flow like poetry from the pages--and it's possible that this book is absolutely at its best when read aloud. My favorite Woolf novel is not this one; it's \\"To the Lighthouse\\" which has an incredible sadness and beauty that is difficult to imagine being put down in words. But for sheer fanciful imagery, this novel is quite amazing--let alone the amusing twist of the main character turning from male to female in the first third of the book. Other than that unusual event, the book rather reminds me of Voltaire in the way it fails to take anything seriously, except, perhaps, poetry.The narrator conveys the subtle, arch sense of humor well, and makes the most of the rhythm within the paragraphs. Other than the film that was adapted from the novel (with wonderful Cate Blanchett, who was about the best person imaginable to play Orlando) this audio book really displays Woolf's talent to the max. For lovers of literature, it's like enjoying a box of Turkish Delight and it melts away on the mind with the same soft and liquid sweetness."},{"Title":"Orlando : a biography","review":"I was attracted to Virgina Woolf's modernist ORLANDO through its bizarre premise of a protagonist starting out as a young man in Elizabethan England and then, changing sex halfway through, living as a female novelist in 20th-century London. ORLANDO is Woolf's love letter to Vita Sackville-West, with whom she carried out a relationship in the 1920s, and the novel is a roman a clef with Orlando living out West's bisexuality. If gender queering is your thing, then this is the literary classic for you.It's not mine, so were the novel only focused on Sackville-West's sexuality, then I probably would have gotten bored with it quite soon. Happily, Woolf focuses very much on how one appreciates literature, with the protagonist making some insightful observations on how readers go about choosing their favourite books, how critics can be so woefully wrong, and how the artist struggles with the creative urge. There's a great deal of laugh-out-loud moments in the book. Also, the plot anticipates magical realism, with so many fantastical developments that nonetheless remain part of a believable narrative.For the most part, ORLANDO is a tame work from Virgina Woolf, not displaying the stream-of-consciousness style of her other major works. Things do get a great deal more avant-garde in the last 50 pages, but for the most part the narration is quite traditional. Although brilliant at first, Woolf's twee and effusive style can become exhausting two thirds of the way through, the main reason I cannot award this book a full five stars. Still, I enjoyed ORLANDO and the novel has many memorable elements."},{"Title":"Orlando : a biography","review":"By far Virginia Woolf's most lighthearted and appealing book. But it is also by far her most profound meditation on reading and writing, identity and art, history and time.Strictly speaking \\"Orlando\\" is a pseudo literary biography that mocks literary biography (and representation in general). In place of a person Woolf creates a fantastic hybrid and the metamorphoses that occurs simply underlines the unreality, the utterly fabricated nature, of her creation and of all writerly creations. But its also much more than that for Orlando allows Woolf the opportunity to comment on one of her own creations as she is creating it. The writer transforms the world with her words but she is also transformed by the words that she uses. In this way one can view reading and writing as ongoing metamorphoses.No other book in existence so proudly announces what it is not: real. No other book calls attention to the fact that it is merely literature--a figment of a writers fancy-- in such a graceful way. And yet few books have the imaginative power to so transform the readers who encounter it as this one."},{"Title":"Orlando : a biography","review":"Written in 1928, this book clearly sought to shock the reading public. For every repression delivered by Victorian authorities which surely hampered Woolf's freedoms, this book delivers a defiant rebuke to the same.Orlando - it states in the beginning - is a man for whom \\"there can be no doubt of his sex.\\" He is rich, handsome and lives a life even Hugh Hefner may be jealous of. But, scandals lead him to isolation, to public ridicule or upbraiding, which led him to sequester himself to his 200-bedroom hermitage-castle. In his hermit's existence, he does not pass time philandering, but instead pulls books off the library's shelves and romanticizes with fiction.Eventually tedium compels Orlando to ask his friendly king to deliver him overseas where he can perform the duties of ambassador. He ends up in then Constantinople, now Istanbul, Turkey. While living there, he ends one exhaustingly long night of debauchery and partying with a seven day sleep - and awakes a woman.This was a \\"good thing.\\" As a man, he could not appreciate Tennyson, Shakespeare, Byron and the like. As a woman, their written word touched her greatly. She could be red eyed, she could be lachrymose. As a man, he never loved. Wollf says, \\". . . love - as the male novelists define it . . . has nothing whatever to do with kindness, fidelity, generosity or poetry. . .\\" Orlando the man had no love? Maybe, with Sasha (a Russian seductress) - but maybe Sasha ruined him so that he could never love again.As a woman, Orlando knows love. Wolff explains, \\"Love is slipping off one's petticoat and - \\"Can you imagine the Victorians reading that?!Orlando's life continues not for decades, but centuries. And, some other characters do as well. \\"The true length of a person's life . . . is always a matter of dispute. Indeed, it is a difficult business - this time-keeping thing. . . \\" Indeed, it was for Wolff who quite intentionally delivers this novel as a time-challenged writer.More obscurities arise - androgynous lovers, angels' visits, children born from or for Orlando - and splendor with these very biologically-defying events.This is not written in the weaving masterful language which Woolf delivers in \\"To the Lighthouse\\" or \\"Mrs.Dalloway.\\" Instead, here the schizophrenia lies with the main character, not the writing style. Probably, a better story than \\"Lighthouse\\" or \\"Dalloway\\", but I am partial to the writing style of those masterpieces.In any event, anyone wondering just how throttled Woolf felt in the stifling moral norms of her country, read this book.

Okay, so it takes a certain sense of humor to really enjoy it, but if a satire on writing throughout the ages sounds like fun to you, you'll probably enjoy it.

I learned about all that stuff while researching for a 15 page paper on the book. Getting a little to much Orlando due to that paper made me lower my rating from five to four stars. It is fun and liberating. Oh, warning: it has a very odd ending. I'm not sure I'll ever understand it. I read it before I finished the book and thought, oh, It will probably make sense after I've read everything in between. Nope. But it was definitely worth the read."},{"Title":"Orlando : a biography","review":"After that light title for the review, allow me to stress that *Orlando* is one of my favorite, favorite books. I've probably read it 20 times. I'm always astonished again by how much character and life and plot and gorgeous prose that Woolf packed into so few pages.SUMMARY: Orlando, the title character, begins life as a lad in Elizabethan England in 1588 and ends the book as a woman thirty-six years older in 1928.Much has been made of the fact that Orlando changes gender and ages magically slowly during the 340 years that the book covers. The effects of the gender switch play beautifully against society and society's changes. Orlando the character is probably based on Vita Sackville-West, Woolf's lesbian lover who cross-dressed, and the gender switch is seen to embody both the masculine and feminine aspects of her. Modernism, the art movement that best characterizes Woolf, is concerned with society and the person's role in it. Woolf managed to play both sides by introducing a character who was both male and female.All this is true, but I believe that there is another layer to the book beyond mere gender role exploration and modernist games. Orlando is a book about being a reader, about a life spent as a reader. When one reads great literature, one experiences what it is like to be both a man and a woman, to live the span of many lifetimes, to have experiences as varied as traveling to Istanbul by ship and giving birth to a child and hacking at the head of a Moor swinging from the ceiling and being the lover of a queen and being in love with a man. Of course, a writer is a reader moved to emulation, and Orlando is a writer. After centuries of composition (and that's what it feels like sometimes!), *The Oak Tree,* Orlando's epic poem, is finally accepted for publication.Most of the time, when I read a great book, I understand the mind and the soul of the writer better when I'm done. Reading a book about being a reader may seem a tautology, but in this case, I feel like Virginia Woolf understood *me,* and my life as a reader, almost eighty years after the publication of *Orlando.*TK KenyonAuthor ofRabid: A NovelandCallous: A Novel"},{"Title":"Orlando : a biography","review":"This novel stabs at society's defining roles of the sexes in a way that is humorous, yet thought provoking as Woolf entertains her readers in this biography of herself. The author begins with her birth in the sixteenth century, and ends in the twentieth century. She starts as a young man and ends up a woman at the end of the novel, she most definitely makes appoint of showing how women have been oppressed throughout the centuries which is not something no one knows, but a good reminder. Throughout the novel, Orlando rarely changes in appearance with an eerie androgynous look as she/he sees monarch's come and go, and changes along with every forthcoming style.

Nothing is any longer one thing! I take up a handbag and I think of an old bumboat woman frozen in the ice&quot; (305).Orlando examines how experience creates meaning. It is a discussion of intertextuality where metaphors are created diachronically. Meaning is created, however imperfectly, by the piling up of associations with a particular image. The book illustrates both the creation of imperfect meaning, but also the undeniably human desire to communicate those ideas.By repeating images, Orlando supposes, we give them meaning. The oak tree, for example, evolves meaning through time. At the beginning it's just an image: a boy alone on a hilltop contemplating the way that the roots feel. Then Orlando removes it from reality by making it into a poem. He adds things in the margin, reworking, elevating the image until it is not a boy under a tree at all. He takes the real and compounds it until it becomes abstract. When Orlando finally lays down under the tree at the end, having &quot;given birth&quot; to the manuscript, the action has a completely new meaning. It is attached forever to Turkey and gypsies and the whole life that preceded it. It transcends image and object to become allegorical. When Woolf describes it she is not merely describing an image, she is attempting to communicate a life.By layering the image in the text, adding meaning on top of meaning, the number of interpretations grows exponentially. The novel would submit that this is the way of language and life. Like metaphors, people are not just as they are at the moment but are also everything and everyone that has preceded. They are the past: the trees that they have sat under and the words that they have spoken. The whole of a person can never be communicated, only approximated in images and metaphors. And yet it's &quot;a curious fact that though human's... have such imperfect means of communication, that they can only say \`good to eat' when they mean \`beautiful'... they endure ridicule and misunderstanding [rather] than keep any experience to themselves&quot; (144).ORLANDO is, definitively, Good to Eat"},{"Title":"Orlando : a biography","review":"This book proves that Virginia Woolf could write what she damned well pleased - she had a family publishing house that published all her work (is that the same as self-published these days?) and a literary salon that the who's-who of literature at the time frequented. An enviable position to be in and not have to risk the inevitable rejection letter from a publisher who wanted more of the same that sold. At one point she even celebrates the unpublished or self-published writer by saying \\"while fame impedes and constricts, obscurity lets the mind take its way unimpeded.\\"That said, Orlando is, in my mind, Woolf herself, taking a bold romp through history, spanning the centuries from Elizabethan to Edwardian times, free of the limitations of thinking in a particular sex, yet being bound by the conventions of his/her times depending on when Orlando was either a man or a woman - all the while letting us experience life in those particular times through the lenses of Orlando's thougths and through his/her biographer's descriptions and ruminations. Woolf's descriptioons of changing landscapes (London going from a clump of derelict buildings and muddy streets in Elizabethan England to a modern metropolis during the Restoration), political systems, customs (wearing a ring and being married became prominent during Victorian times), food ( crumpets and muffins were invented in the 19th century), women's sizes (\\"slim was in\\" in Edwardian London),speech (evasive conversation was espoused in Victorian England) are told in rich flowing prose that does not stint in its use of dashes and semicolons.Time transitions take place during sleep, while thinking or while on a long voyage at sea, where our hero(ine)remains unaged (albeit, at times sex changed) as the world changes around her.The pompous biographer that Woolf chooses as her device for rendering the story is also a free spirit, free to comment, jump from place to place, ruminate and sidebar - all needed in order to deliver a story of this vast time sweep.I wouldn't read this novel for entertainment, but rather as a study of what experimental fiction must have been in Woolf's day.My one regret is that with all this going for her ( no rejection slips, write whatever she wanted) our dear Virginia had to load herself up with stones and drown herself in a river. Oh, if she would only know the travails of the writer, let alone the experimental one, of today!

Based on Orlando's identity, the society she lives in expects specific behaviors from her in the areas of business, society, and love, \\"that each man and each woman has another allotted to it for life.\\" Her search for meaning amidst those expectations is what ends up being Orlando's pursuit for meaning in life.Reviewed by Jonathan Stephens"},{"Title":"Orlando : a biography","review":"This \`roman &agrave; cl&eacute;s' is very original.

A wild ride through four centuries, the novel shows Orlando aging, magically, only thirty-six years between 1588 and 1928. Even more magically, he also changes from a man to a woman. As she explores Orlando's life, Woolf also explores the differing roles of men and women in society during various periods, ultimately concluding that one's role as a man or woman is determined by society, rather than by birth.From the Elizabethan period, during which Orlando works as a steward for the queen and also serves as her lover, he progresses to the reign of James I, experiencing a profound love for a Russian princess, Sasha, who is herself exploring the role of a man. When the relationship ends, he retreats, devastated, to his estate, with its 365 rooms and 52 staircases, which he redecorates over the next few years. An interlude in which he is wooed by the Archduchess Harriet/Archduke Harry leads to his ambassadorship to Constantinople, a period spent with the gypsies, and his eventual return to England--as a woman. New experiences and observations await her there.Throughout the novel, Woolf matches her prose style to the literary style of the period in which Orlando lives, creating always-changing moods and sheer delight for the reader. Some constants continue throughout the four centuries of Orlando's life. Orlando is always a writer, always recording his thoughts, and always adding to a poem he has begun as a child entitled \\"The Oak Tree.\\" He is always returning to his 365-room house whenever he needs to recuperate from his experiences, and some characters repeat through time. (Orlando is betrayed by Nick Greene during the reign of James I, but he is encouraged by Nicholas Greene in the Victorian period.)Literary historians make much of the fact that Woolf modeled Orlando on Vita Sackville-West, Woolf's lover, and that this study of gender roles was an early exploration of lesbianism, bisexuality, cross-dressing, and transgender identities. The novel is pure fun to read, however, and though it raises serious and thoughtful questions about sexuality and the ways that it controls our lives, there is no sense that Woolf wrote the novel specifically to make a public statement or prove a point. Her themes of gender and its relation to social expectations, of imagination and its relation to reality, of the importance of history in our lives, and of the unlimited potential of all humans, regardless of their sex, transcend the specific circumstances under which Woolf may have written the book.

All attempts to describe this book must fail. Read it."},{"Title":"Orlando : a biography","review":"My first book by Ms. Woolf, and it was an amazing, surreal read. Orlando is a love story, a wonderful mess-up of gender and all the questions about love that gender provokes, and an ode to creativity.The story begins with Orlando as a romantic youth, lacking in wisdom, but not in appreciation of beauty and lust for life. His vibrancy catches the eye of the elderly Queen Elizabeth, who then, falls in love with his beauty and graces him with a court appointment and takes it upon herself to protect him from the usual pains that would befall someone of his status. [It is at this point, in the movie (with Tilda Swinton), that Queen Elizabeth (Quentin Crisp) cryptically tells him, \\"Do not fade. Do not wither. Do not grow old.\\" I did not find this quote in the book, but the sentiment is the same. There is a special immortal something about Orlando that others recognize and he is doomed and blessed to tumble through the ages in one guise or another.]Orlando falls from the queen's grace when she spies him with one of the many girls he courts. Three years after the queen's disapproval, Orlando finds himself madly in love with a Russian princess, who will not marry him. He falls asleep heartbroken, only to awake 50 years later in a different role, as an aristocratic poet. And so go Orlando's series of romances and heartbreaks. After several failed romances and the seeming death of his beloved poetry, Orlando reawakens as a woman, without skipping a beat. We then follow him/her through subsequent decades and see Orlando grow in wisdom and knowledge of love. One could say that perhaps his womanly incarnation is what Fate has thrown at him in order for him to understand what it is to be on the other side of the mirror. Yet in either form he is admired.It's an odd story and plotwise, difficult to track, which is perhaps besides the point. Certainly full of humor. The only contemporary author to whom I can compare it is Jeannette Winterson and her novel The Passion--she has a similar interest in characters and love, and an equal disregard for rules of space, time, and gender roles. Winterson may be our modern day Woolf.If you haven't read Orlando, and you are unsure, try the movie first. It is what prompted me to read the book. The production is gorgeous and Tilda Swinton is perfect as Orlando. And when you decide to read the book, there's plenty to be discovered that the movie can't touch on--for instance the writing nuances and styles.

People who review books often review the ones they love especially, but I review each one, good or bad. I started this novel in high hopes. I had never read the famous British author and I looked forward to a special treat. The background to the rich and handsome Orlando seemed promising, his adventures interesting, but then weirdness grew and became overpowering. I didn't mind that he turned into a woman, but even so, whatever the sex of the protagonist, we need a plot in the novel. The descriptions of his doings seemed less and less relevant, his/her gender fluctuations assumed more and more importance, and I finally decided that I just didn't care. What I really didn't like about ORLANDO is that there is a sub-text, closed to those of us of this day and age, who are not privy to the intimate doings of the Bloomsbury set, who did not sit together with V. Woolf and listen to her read her latest chapters, chuckling knowingly as they recognized the models for the various characters. I felt excluded. And why would I read a novel from which I was excluded ? Well, the answer, dear reader, is that I wouldn't.

He calls her faithless when he's bedded every wench in town and is engaged to marry someone else when he meets her. Hard to sympathize with the guy. It's only a tragedy when he's the one hurting. Throughout Orlando's lives, he/she strikes me as a spoiled rich kid who wants to be useful and good but can't help being a punk sometimes. Very true to real life.Woolf takes the reader through history fantastically; every scent and sense is unique to the years. Her observation on clothes being related to the person within is great. And even though people put a homosexual spin on the subject, I felt it was more about what a person is capable of and why a 'man' or 'woman' label is slapped on certain traits and abilities. If a woman is mechanically inclined, does she have to give up being feminine? If a man has a fashion sense, must he forfeit his masculinity?In the end, I found myself wondering how Orlando would have turned out if he/she weren't so rich. Maybe it's my working-class distaste for pampered complainers that made we want to smack Orlando. But as a non-traditional woman, I also heard my thoughts echoed in Orlando's, especially when she 'yielded to the spirit of the age' and got married. That entire description of the pressure to marry was brilliant because it comes from without and within.All in all, there are perks and drawbacks to being male or female. But Orlando shows we're not the only one who finds our talents stretch beyond what is considered a man's job or a woman's. Did Orlando have to become a woman to know love? Did his maleness make him a better ambassador? Nowadays we say 'of course not'. But Orlando personifies those questions, makes the reader aware of the chains of tradition. And just like Orlando's ancestry, are they anchors or dead weight? Or both?"},{"Title":"Orlando : a biography","review":"\\"He -- for there could be no doubt of his sex, though the fashion of the time did something to disguise it...\\"Late-Elizabeth fashions were so flamboyant that you couldn't sometimes tell who was male and who was female. And that time frame sets the perfect tone for this witty and strange gender-bender. Orlando was sixteen at the time, and his boyish good looks made him quite popular at Queen Elizabeth's court. But his poetic sensibilities cannot handle heartbreak very well. A deceitful Russian princess has left quite an impression on him, and he broods over the fickleness and faithlessness in women. So time goes by, Elizabeth is followed by King James, and as generations pass Orlando becomes not only a nobleman of high rank, but he's also courtier, then an ambassador -- until he leaves it all behind when he becomes a woman. The new gender brings confusion. All of the things Orlando once took for granted -- his freedom, his power, his lands and rank -- are all jeopardized. But at the same time, she -- for now it is she -- discovers other pleasures and joys, and sometimes boredom, in the eighteenth century parties with celebrated noblemen and writers, and in Victorian times, when she experiences her first night with a man. After many centuries, it is in 1928, when this immortal being realizes that she is essentially the same person she has always been.It is impossible to summarize this novel. Written in the form of a biography, Orlando covers quite a number of themes and discussions, and you'd have to read the book in order to appreciate it. You'll have to read it not only once, but several times. I think I will have to reread this in the near future in order to completely get it. This is a unique gender-bender, with feminist undertones, and a voice full of satire and magic realism for great measure. There are some wonderful passages here, full of humor. Take this one, for example:\\"All of her estates are put in Chancery and her titles pronounced in abeyance while the suits were under litigation. Thus it was in a highly ambiguous condition, uncertain whether she was alive or dead, man or woman, Duke or nonentity, that she posted down to her country seat, where, pending the legal judgment, she had the Law's condition to reside in a state of incognito or incognita as the case might turn out to be.\\"The \\"incognito or incognita\\" is what made me laugh. Virginia Woolf was a great writer. I had once read To the Lighthouse and was indifferent about it. However, Orlando has compelled me to read other books by Woolf. Her wit, combined with the passage of time and historical references, made this an absolute delight to read. The one thing I do find confusing is the passage of time. For example, Orlando opens her window and stares out into the courtyard and beyond in the year 1712. After a series of descriptions and whatnot, the chapter ends with, \\"The Eighteenth century was over; the Nineteenth century had begun.\\" And that is more or less how it occurs every time. In one sentence, it is still Victorian times, then it's Edwardian the next. Also, the whole gender change is too complicated to describe. As said earlier, you will have to read and reread the book in order to understand it. Some people don't get this book at all and hate it; others might enjoy Woolf's take on society norms and love it. I'm the latter. Orlando is a must-read if you're into some rather thought provoking and somewhat complicated literature."},{"Title":"Orlando : a biography","review":"Orlando is a gender-bending-twisting-conflating biography in which the eponymous hero begins as an Elizabethan nobleman and ends, over 300 years later, as a liberated woman.There are many reasons to read a classic work of fiction, but to be totally honest, doing so is not always a purely enjoyable experience. Sometimes it is more like work, worth the effort, but not easy or even totally pleasurable.This book is simply a gas: a high speed, surrealistic excursion through four centuries of the role of women and men in English society, and Woolf's writing is in turn caustic, brilliant, lyrical, funny, transcendent and astonishing.If you are going to read one great work of 20th century literature, this should be on your short list."},{"Title":"Orlando : a biography","review":"I thought Orlando's trip through the ages was wonderful and exciting.

That tribute was \\"Orlando: A Biography,\\" a magical-realism tale about a perpetually youthful, charming hero/ine who traverses three centuries and both genders -- and Woolf's writing reaches a new peak as she explores the hauntingly sensuous world of Orlando.Orlando was born a young aristocratic man in the time of Queen Elizabeth I, and when the dying monarch visited his home she became his new court favorite (and briefly lover). His passionate, curious personality attracted many other women over the years -- until he fell in love with Sasha, a mercurial but faithless Russian princess (supposedly based on Sackville-West's ex-girlfriend). Bereft of true love, he devoted himself to poetry and entertainment.But then he's assigned to be an ambassador to Constantinople, and something strange happens -- while a bloody revolution rages, he sleeps for a full week... and wakes newly metamorphosed into a woman. With the same mind and soul but a female body, Orlando sets out on a new life -- and discovers that women aren't quite as different from men as she once thought.\\"Orlando: A Biography\\" is a very weird book, and was even more so when it was written since \\"magical realism\\" didn't exist as a literary style in 1928. Virginia Woolf makes no explanations about Orlando's immortality or unexpected gender switch. It's simply accepted that once he was a man, and then she became a woman, and that s/he has lived from the Elizabethan era until at least the 1920s (and who knows, maybe Orlando still wanders among us?).And Woolf's writing is at its peak here. Her prose is soaked in luxurious descriptions that constantly tease the senses -- silver and gold, frozen flowers, crystalline ice, starlight and the exquisite expanses of nature's beauty. At times the sensual writing seems almost feverish, and Woolf adds an almost mythic quality by inserting spirits of feminine virtues (Modesty, Purity and Chastity appear to try to hide Orlando's feminine body), and by having her hero/ine encounter great poets, queens and men of the sea.And Orlando him/herself is a truly fascinating character -- s/he can be sweet, passionate, romantic, wild and melancholy, and s/he has an almost magnetic charisma. He starts off the story as an elusive romantic teenager, suffers a heartbreak that matures him as an artist, and post-metamorphosis she becomes a woman of the modern world. Both in mind and body, Orlando is a very different woman at the end than the boy s/he began as.\\"Orlando: A Biography\\" is a truly spellbinding book -- Virginia Woolf's prose enthralls the senses while her main character explores the boundaries of gender.

Don't read this book as a treatise on sexual identity or societal roles. Woolf describes the book as a biography, and that's what it is. Orlando makes his (then her) way through the world, trying to make sense of it and, from time to time, trying to fit in. It wreaks havoc with your love life when you don't age over the centuries (just ask Anne Rice's vampires). But it does give you perspective, and that is why we read."},{"Title":"Orlando : a biography","review":"Virginia Woolf is often a difficult author for students to become familiar with. Her _Orlando_, which strikingly defies placement in a single genre, introduces the reader to Miss Woolf's language, her symbols, and the themes common to her many equisite works. However, _Orlando_ is bereft of the beautiful and detailed stories and ideas which enrich her other works, making the novel on the whole a simple enough read for the beginner.Compared with the span of her works, _Orlando_ stands out as an original among originals. Nowhere else does Miss Woolf so successfully tell a fabulous tale, and nowhere else does she render concrete locations, times, and events so beautifully."},{"Title":"Orlando : a biography","review":"The most brilliant portrayal of a transsexual experience in modern history. Even when Magnus Hirshfield was publishing his treatise on the transsexual phenomenah, Woolf relates an account of the intracies of gender identity undiscovered by social scientists and biologists. Published in 1928, Orlando has been billed as one of Woolf's best imaginative works however, such criticism was never seen in the light of reality but a surreal depiction of the writer's portrayal of a young man who wakes up one day as a woman, as if in the ordinary course of his life. As Woolf suggests of her character's reaction to the change \\"Orlando herself showed no surprise at it.(Woolf, 139. Modern transsexuals have explained only recently in their writings, their internal thinking stays the same, only the external body appears different to others. ALthough Woolf's work set the precedent for post modernist literature, infusing elements of fiction into biography, she weaves the internal stuggle of her former lover, Vita Sachville-West's life, together with her own perceptions of gender and sexuality, with an historical account of a young transsexual aristocrat's adventures over the span of centuries. Unlike a biography of her time, the action is secondary to the internal story. This is more of an account of how her lover (and as suggested by this author--Woolf herself), struggles with her own gender identity; a thinking so similar to transsexualism and conflict with a Eurocentric binary gender system. Here, the biographer (narrator) describes: the reaction to Orlando's change of sex, as it may appear in a scientific journal today;\\"[b]ut in every other respect, Orlando remained preceisely as he had been. The change of sex, though it altered their future, did nothing whatever to alter their identity. (Woolf, 138). Woolf captures the failure of the general public to grasp the concept of gender reassignment when she has the narrator express dismay in the lack of Orlando's reaction where \\"Orlando was a man till the age of thirty (Similar to our understanding of modern transsexuals who start their transition at middle age) when he became a woman and has remained ever since.\\" (Woolf, 139)'. Woolfe's use of metaphor and foreshadowing is uncanny. The pyrotechnic displays prior to the deep sleep of Orlando depicts change. She puts Orlando on a ship called the 'Enamoured Lady,' and she is suddenly the object of the Captain's and other males' attention and realizes that the sexual fantacies of men creates a dillemma for her as a woman, where she must sheild her own desires as a woman. Woolfe precisely proclaims that '(Orlando) remembered how, as a young man, she had insisted that women must be obedient, chaste, scented, and exquisitely apparelled... (and) \\"Now I shall have to pay in my own person for those desires ... for women are not (judging by my own short experience of the sex) obedient, chaste, scented, and exquisitely apparelled by nature.\\" Woolfe does not stop at her proclivity to undress Orlando's gender identity but lays bare the confusion of sexual preference. Although a woman herself, Orlando proclaims that \\"it was still a woman she loved; and if the consciousness of being of the same sex had any effect at all, it was to quicken and deepen those feeling which she had had as a man.\\" (Woolf, 161). Where she gives in to sensual thoughts of a man, the Captain on whose arm she trembles and remembers that she had once been a Duke and Ambassador, \\"that she, who had been lapped like a lily in folds of paduasoy, had hacked heads off, and lain with loose women amoung treasure sacks in holds of pirate ships...\\" Woolfe reveals a metaphoric character, the Archduchess Harriet Griselda of Finster-Aarhorn and Scan-op-Boom in the Roumanian territory, seen in chapter three as a woman, and in a later chapter is shown to be a man, the Archduke, who suddently professes his love for her. Woolfe's ability to produce a character like the Arduke Harry who today would fall somewhere on the transgendered scale, is amazing, for a woman in her time. Yet through all its carefully crafted language and delightful parody, the gender message she professes is much the same today as it may have been then, that \\"Clothes ... change our view of the world and the world's view of us....\\" Orlando challenges the Eurocentric binary gender construct of the world she lived in. Here, the writer's own indictment of the unrealistic bounds placed on women is evident and transposed by her narrator and Orlando's own expository reflections, \\"In every human bing a vacillation from one sex to the other takes place, and often it is only that clothes that keep the male or female likeness, while underneath the sex is the very opposite of what it is above.\\" (Woolfe, 189). Here, Woolfe appears to challenge more than the unfairness and imperfections of gender traditions on women. She uses comparaisons of the formalities of being a nieteenth century man and woman to make her point. Additionally, the most introspective journey in Orlando, is of a person who is not questioning her own gender identity, but defining it. Woolfe appears to depict, not confusion, but knowledge by the transsexual main character of her own identity, and chosing to adapt to it by changing the way the world looks at her, by changing sex. It is the world that suffers the confusion. Woolfe makes generalities about other persons hiding their sex in the clothing of the other gender, suggesting there are numerous persons in her era that suffer from some sort of gender dysphoria. After reading Orlando, and comparing it with the writings of transsexual, transgendered and social scientists,Woolfe describes so clearly the struggle a transgendered person experiences, that critics should look more closely at this writing. Woolfe's narrator states: \\"Of complications and confusions which thus result every one has had experience;\\" and as though afraid to delve deeper, she leaves this general question to \\"note only the odd effect it had in the particualr case of Orlando herself.\\" As Woolfe so eloquently portrays the posttranssexual eptiome, \\"having now worn skirts for a considerable time, a certain change was visible in Orlando, which is to be found even in her face...\\" and where the narrator wonders, had both the man and woman of Orlando's time.worn the same clothes (in other words, different sexes but same gender) it is possible their outlook may have been the same too.\\" (Woolfe, 188). Yet the most profound statement made in the text reveals Woolfe's secret exposition: \\"The difference between the sexes is, happily, one of great profundity. Clothes are but a symbol of soemthing hid deep beneath. It was a change in Orlando herself that dicated her choise of a woman's dress and of a woman's sex. And perhaps in this she was only exprssing rather than mor openly than usual---openness indeed was the soul of her nature---(Woolf, 189). Thus, Woolfe explains that Orlando chose to change his sex because he was in fact a woman, a woman's soul in a man's body. This book is highly recommended to all who are ever wonder what it is like for a transsexual to alter his sex, and begin living as the gender opposite of his or her sex. And for those who never wondered, it is a great read, full of insightful commentary on the possibility of a gender continuum and expanding the boundaries of a binary gender system of a phallocentric society."},{"Title":"Orlando : a biography","review":"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? This Guy. I'm probably going to have to turn in my English Lit Major membership card over this, but man. I slogged through this, and didn't enjoy it at all. I'm not sure when I was last so bored by a book whose core concept intrigued me so much. Orlando is virtually immortal, changes gender mid-book, has a group of core household personnel who also seem to be immortal. The story starts in Elizabethan times and moves to the early 1900's. So much of that is fodder for great storytelling, not to mention the ability to comment on societal norms, gender reversals, etc. I won't deny that Woolf manages to pack a lot of social commentary into the book. I won't deny that she experiments with form in a way that makes most students and professors of English literature salivate. But in a book that is over 300 pages long ... nothing happens! Sure, there's the sudden deep freeze and equally sudden thaw of England that provides a momentary rush, but other than that, the protagonist spends pretty much the entire book sitting around depressed over the slights he receives from a woman, a fellow poet, and other varied personalities. I'll say it again: I was bored. And based on my reaction to this, which is supposed to be the most accessible of Woolf's works ... I can honestly say I don't think I'll be trying to read anything else by her.Also, It is interesting to me that when I looked on Amazon, BN and Goodreads, none of the product descriptions I read attempt to describe the plot of ORLANDO. These are product descriptions now, not reader reviews. They all talk about how original and influential the book is and what a great movie Tilda Swinton was in a few years back. But none of them even attempt to describe the plot beyond what's quoted in the premise above.

Much has been written about the startlingly experimental nature of the book's treatment of its hero/heroine. Especially for its time, Woolf's daring literary gambit puts this novel head and shoulders above most others.But her writing, more than any experimenting, is what endeared this book to me in the first place, and continues to do so. From the opening passages in which young Orlando engages in fencing practice with the decapitated head of a Moor, to the incredible descriptions of the ice-bound Thames finally thawing and carrying away with it the multitudes who have encamped on its frozen surface, Orlando weaves a hypnotic spell that lingers long after the reader has closed its covers."},{"Title":"Orlando : a biography","review":"Orlando is perhaps the most entertaining of Woolf's works that I have seen.

First there is the fact that it is a Woolf book that is purely fun and romantic, and void of the trenchant tone of her other books. It is gorgeous, challenging farce, nothing more. Then there is the typical Woolf language, a stunning eye for detail, and rare and particular introspection about gender and identity. Then there is the novelty of the story itself, and how it embraces its matter-of-fact peculiarity. Woolf only rarely goes off the deep end here, and the story overall is mostly beautiful and keenly interesting. Fans of the wonderful Tilda Swinton movie will be reassured at its fidelity to the book. Fans of Woolf's canon will find this one of the more simply enjoyable books out there, but also a worthy addition to world literature in spite of its breezier attributes. Full recommendation."},{"Title":"Orlando : a biography","review":"This novel has aged in many ways and remains the testimony of an author and a period. To imagine a character who could survive Elizabeth I up to modern times is at least bizarre. We wonder what the objective is. When the originally male character turns female somewhere in Turkey, we start understanding the aim: to study the male personality and the female personality respectively as confronted to a person of the other sex. What's more when later that female Orlando finds her supreme pleasure in dressing and behaving like a man in her transvestite personality we understand she is trying to recapture the pleasures of being a man, though it is artificial. This can only be dealt with if we consider sex the way it used to be considered, as a private secret you have to keep hidden and unseen. Today, all that is trite and without much interest in the post AIDS generation. Literature is entertainment and if a book is only interesting for its historical value in literature it is no longer entertaining, an entertainment. And that's just the problem. Then the vanity of those who try to psychoanalyze Virginia Woolf through her works is just what it is a vanity, and what's more a useless and fake vanity that seems to ignore that an author is able to go beyond that kind of psychoanalytical determinism if not vulgate. Too bad because that book could have been a historical depiction of these three centuries it covers, but it is not.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID"},{"Title":"Orlando : a biography","review":"Orlando is adventure, comedy, gender study and literary commentary all rolled into one.

(I also liked Mrs Dalloway--See my Amazon review.) When we lived in London my family and I spent a day at Knole. It is supposedly the largest private house in England. Much of it now belongs to the National Trust. Knole beggars description--it is a vast mansion, brooding, and dark, but also eminent; it is a castle, a factory, mills, breweries, a village, and menagerie. I remember the deer as being especially numerous and friendly. Orlando the novel is dedicated to Vita Sackville-West who sadly was unable to inherit Knole although she grew up there. Only males could inherit.The novel Orlando is a tour through English history from the mid-15 hundreds to 1928 always from odd perspectives. It is also a subtle and searching exploration of gender roles, social roles, and artistic and creative efforts. Themes interweave with lightning speed. It's crazy, funny, satirical, wild, and moody. I found parts to be incoherent, post-modern stream-of-consciousness, but most is entertaining and illuminating.But this novel always comes back to Knole just as Orlando does. He/she (there is a sex change mid-novel) tours her house, thinks about it, ponders it, worries about it, and is always focused on it. Orlando lives for hundreds of years, but somehow I think he/she is a metaphor for the great house. Knole is not mentioned by name in the novel, but that's it. Knole is also the setting for The Edwardians by Vita Sackville-West. Knole is very worth a visit if you get to London or Kent. On the web at the National Trust website.A visit in person however would help bring the novel Orlando to life. The novel is titled Orlando: A Biography. I think it is the biography of Knole.One other odd feature: My edition (Signet Classics) has in index. This is the first novel I've read with an index. This suggests to me that Orlando is more than a novel, it is also a history of sorts."},{"Title":"Orlando : a biography","review":"This is a review among many reviews and will leave out the tale of the story assuming it has already been read here.

The reader becomes a traveler through a society, culture and location while watching time fly by at a rate 2-5 times that of the lives we actually live. Both stories give the reader a sense that judgement about experience can extend to generations of experience and not just to one's single, private, say, 80 year period. The benefit of reading these books, to young readers who are trying to stretch their own personal horizons, is beyond belief.Each story is a gift from it's author on a level seen almost no where else.

Virginia Woolf's earlier books are also constrained by plot and she is at her best when she discards it or uses it only loosely enough to allow her sprawling style to make sense. Orlando, for me, is too caught up in the gender and time changes. Perhaps the book can be read while subtly ignoring these aspects and experiencing the book sentence by sentence (like in The Waves say). However, that might not be doing this book justice either. Perhaps I simply did not understand or buy into the premise of the book or some of the plot details.

It was a strange tale of adventure and romance, with Orlando seeking the beauties of life and poetry throughout the centuries."},{"Title":"Orlando : a biography","review":"Throughout history, women have always been the subject of oppression and stereotyping. Today the world is finally beginning to accept women as intellectuals, workers, writers, and other occupations other than housewife. However, women have not always been so fortunate, and history clearly shows their oppression from the lack of information left behind by women. Some of the greatest writers who ever lived may not of gotten anyone to read their writing, because they were women and it was not \\"politically-correct\\" for them to do anything but raise the children. Gradually, near the beginning of the century, women were able to start pushing away these stereotypes, and they started to receive more rights and were allowed to publish their writings. Virginia Woolf is able to wonderfully express the struggle of women, in a way in which men could easily relate. By Orlando starting as a man and then seeing all his rights and respect taken away when he becomes a woman, the men reading could understand what they have and take for granted. One example of the unfair way in which the women were treated can be seen when Orlando goes back to England for the first time after the change. She went to get her house but encountered a few problems, \\"The chief charges against her were (1) that she was dead , and therefore could not hold any property whatsoever; (2) that she was a woman, which amounts to much the same...\\" (pg.168) The women of the day were given rights no better than those of a dead man were. Also as soon as she got back, she was expected to settle down and start looking for a husband, instead of writing or working, \\"In short, they acted the parts of man and woman for ten minutes with great vigor ...\\" (pg. 179) This is how her life was, secretly hiding herself from society, and also dealing with the courting of men. It is ridiculous how little respect or rights that she received. The best angle of the book, however, is reading through and noticing the growth of independence in woman and how their world expanded. Gender should never be a consideration in decisions or cloud the minds of those who decide, it should be an equal chance for both men and women. Everyone is stuck on this planet, and we might as well try to get along together with as much peace and equality as we can."},{"Title":"Orlando : a biography","review":"This is a comic \\"biography\\" about Orlando, who starts off the book as a 16 year old boy in the Elizabethan era, and ends the books as a 36 year old woman in 1928.

This is an interesting book that allows Virginia Woolf to make witty observations about English society and the differences between men and women."},{"Title":"Orlando : a biography","review":"\\"Orlando\\" is a fictional biography whose subject in the beginning is a sixteen-year-old boy in the Elizabethan era and in the end -- three hundred years later -- is a thirty-six-year-old woman. This is not a novel about transsexuality, as such a premise would indicate, but it is a statement about sexual identity and gender roles in English society as only an author like Virginia Woolf could make, territory not even the brazen D.H. Lawrence could traverse with much confidence. It is a lyrical tour de force in which Woolf displays her considerable talent for subtly describing moods and scenery, but most surprisingly, it demonstrates her sly sense of humor and satire.Orlando's gender alteration is naturally the central event of his preternaturally long life, but his aging only twenty years over a course of three centuries is certainly no less bizarre. To describe the circumstances under which he becomes a woman or explain the logic by which he ages so slowly would be giving away too much in this review, nor would it really help to recommend the novel to one who is not yet persuaded to read it, so I will be silent on that account, saying only that these outrageous devices fully succeed as vehicles to explore Woolf's theme of femininity with respect to English cultural and historical frames of reference.The novel examines the effect of gender alteration on Orlando's amorous and professional capacities. As a young nobleman in the Elizabethan court whose interests are swordsmanship and poetry, he is engaged to an aristocratic Irish girl, has a torrid affair with a Russian princess, and meets a silly woman who, resembling nothing so much as a hare, calls herself the Archduchess Harriet. After serving as an ambassador in Turkey, Orlando becomes a woman, joins a band of gypsies, and returns to England where he (she) must handle the legalities regarding his dukeship because of his new gender. As a woman, he manages to gain the romantic attentions of famous writers like Pope, Dryden, and Swift before eventually marrying and having a son. Some surprises ensue, but let it suffice to say that Orlando is not the only androgynous character in the novel.An underlying, and highly controversial, implication is that every human being harbors aspects of both genders, mainly psychological, but Woolf goes so far as to make them physical in order to press the point. Although the idea may seem tame now, \\"Orlando\\" may have set a precedent for cross-gender role-playing when it was first published in 1928. The novel is very much ahead of its time; it has a sort of nonchalant sophistication that characterizes the type of magical realism that was to become a large part of European-influenced literature throughout the rest of the twentieth century. My admiration for Virginia Woolf only increases with each novel of hers that I read, and \\"Orlando\\" is in my opinion the best yet."},{"Title":"Orlando : a biography","review":"John Irving (&quot;World According to Garp&quot;) wrote an essay onCharles Dickens book &quot;Great Expectations&quot; in which he saidthat that book was the first book he had ever read that hewished he had written. For me the first book that I had read that I wishedI had written is &quot;Orlando&quot; by Virgina Woolf. It blew meaway. I had seen the movie version a few years ago, andrecently found it in a bookstore, so I decided to check it out.It's subtitle is &quot;A Biography&quot; and although it is based (veryloosely, I'm sure) on someone's actual life, it becomes clearto the reader that this is definitely a work of fiction.The reason that I enjoyed it so much is, well, let me put itthis way...Charles Dickens and John Irving were and are storytellers,very wonderful, brilliant storytellers, but Virgina Woolf is (well, was)an amazing artist. I don't go for poetry that much, I'm a prosekind of guy, but &quot;Orlando&quot; for me, was the very best kind of poetry butwritten as a narrative. Read this book. And let me know what you think..."},{"Title":"Orlando : a biography","review":"Orlando is simply wonderful. In the novel, Woolf uses the character of Orlando, a person who lives through four centuries as man sometimes and woman sometimes. The term biography might throw you, since Orlando is no normal biography. Woolf personifies literary thought as a person (hence the timelessness and gender changing capability). She depicts Elizabethan times through the early twentieth century with wit and sarcasm. The more that you've read of English literature from Shakespeare forward the more you will catch the little jokes and the reason for why certain things happen. A very enjoyable read. The film version is not exactly the same, so I recommend sticking to the book."},{"Title":"Orlando : a biography","review":"&quot;Orlando&quot; served as my sweeping introduction to the incredible writing of Virginia Woolf. (For anyone who has seen the movie, do yourself a favor, and read this amazing book!) One is forced to wonder what sort of genius mind Woolf possessed; only a mind of the finest tuning could have produced such a work! &quot;Orlando&quot; is truly representative of superior literature and demonstrates the art of writing at its finest! No review does the novel justice...any topic imaginable is covered..of course, all is reviewed from the standpoint of five passing centuries and multiple backdrops ranging from the exotic to the droll. Woolf's treatment of sexuality, intelligence, consciousness, time, and the human psyche is poignant. &quot;Orlando&quot; is definitely worth the read. No matter the reader, &quot;Orlando&quot; is sure to be an unforgettable novel, its author's genius surely to be admired."},{"Title":"Orlando : a biography","review":"_Orlando_ is Virginia Woolf's mock biography of her friend Vita Sackville-West. It follows the title character through English history from the Elizabethan Age to the 1920s, when the novel was written. The writing is different sections of the book mimics the styles of different periods of English literature. Most of the book is firmly tongue-in-cheek (Woolf can be very funny), but it does brush lightly upon issues of art, gender, and history.I think _Orlando_ is the most purely entertaining of Woolf's novels. Orlando's various adventures are highly laughable, and Woolf's dry commentary rarely fails to elicit a smile. It is also one of Woolf's less experimental and ambitious novels. She wrote this novel as a lark, for amusement--it is a very different project from, for example, _The Waves_. This is not to say this is in any way a conventional novel--but it is rather different from Woolf's other works of the 1920s.I would definitely recommend this to most readers--it is more accessible to the general reader than Woolf's other novels. Readers familiar with the history of English literature will find it particularly amusing. If you are a first-time Woolf reader looking to really experience her more important works, however, I would suggest _Mrs. Dalloway_ or _To the Lighthouse_ first."},{"Title":"Orlando : a biography","review":"Virginia Woolf's \\"Orlando\\" is unique in form, being a mock biography of a fictional character. We are introduced to Orlando, a protagonist based partly on Woolf's close friend Vita Sackville-West, as a 16-year-old boy, the son of noble parents, in the latter years of the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. By the end of the book, more than three hundred years later, he has become a 36-year-old woman living in \\"modern\\" times (meaning 1928, the year of publication).Woolf uses Orlando's sexual transformation and long life as a vehicle for investigating influences on and consequences of gender and sexuality through history. Her commentary is pointed and often right on the mark. But at the same time, the book is infused with Woolf's dry wit, giving everything a humorous overtone. For example, when Orlando returns to England after his transformation, everyone at home assuming him to be dead, she finds herself embroiled in a legal battle to get her property back: \\"The chief charges against her were (1) that she was dead, and therefore could not hold any property whatsoever; (2) that she was a woman, which amounts to much the same thing\\" (168). One can tell that, while these issues were obviously important to her, Woolf was having fun when she wrote this.Now, as far as my personal reaction, I am going to be among the minority of reviewers here in saying that overall I really didn't much care for the book. In talking to others who have read it, I've noticed that \\"Orlando\\" seems to be one of those \\"love it or hate it\\" works. Perhaps I went into it with the wrong expectaions, this being my first Woolf novel, but it just kind of fell flat for me. I certainly wasn't expecting it to be the kind of book it was. Thinking it was going to be a historical fiction piece with a serious tone, I found it to be much more like a more emotional version of \\"Candide.\\" Much of it is farcical, and certainly far from being believable.Though Woolf makes some very insightful and worthwhile social commentary here, her presentation, I felt, detracted from its impact. The fantasy-world feel that permeates much of it makes it seem unreal, and therefore less applicable to our own world. In addition, the narrative tone changes from time period to time period, which makes the book feel disjointed. Just as you get used to one style - BAM! - it changes to a different tone and you're left feeling disoriented all over again. And furthermore, Orlando her/himself doesn't feel like a real person. No matter how much I tried, I couldn't empathize with her/him. All of this, I found, got in the way of the actual story and its intended impact.In summary, I do commend Woolf's experimentation in style, and as I noted the underlying messages are important, but overall the book just wasn't as strong as it could have been. If you're a fan of Woolf, go ahead and give it a try. You may well find that you like it after all. But if you like more reality-rooted and tonally serious stories, this probably won't leave you very satisfied. Try it, but calibrate your expectations first."},{"Title":"Orlando : a biography","review":"This fake biography (complete with counterfeit photographs and an index) is not Virginia Woolf's greatest novel by any means--but even the least of her works must rank among the finest of early twentieth-century fiction.The \\"plot\\" seems more appropriate to a Heinlein novel: a boy raised during the Elizabethan period becomes a woman, lives until the 1920s, and ages only 36 years. During the past century, the novel's reception has evolved much like its lead character: while early critics and readers praised the book as a literary parody bordering on farce, later generations have regarded the novel more as a commentary both on sexual roles and on the oppression of women. Some readers will see Orlando as representing, in human form, the evolution of literature (it\`s telling that the only other character who lives as long as Orlando is a critic); some will focus on the novel's presentation of gender and sex. Both interpretations (and others) seem to be equally valid--which is why this book is so powerful even today.One of the most charming (and surprising) qualities of the novel is Woolf's refusal to take herself or her book seriously. At times, the novel is laugh-out-loud funny. She mocks her own style (she interrupts one of her infamous run-on paragraphs with \\"nature ... has so much to answer for besides the perhaps unwieldy length of this sentence\\"), and she even makes fun of the book's very concept (when Orlando is not doing much of anything, Woolf exclaims: \\"If only subjects ... had more consideration for their biographers!\\"). \\"Orlando\\" infuses everyday life with both wit and elegance; or, as Woolf puts it, \\"when the shrivelled skin of the ordinary is stuffed out with meaning it satisfies the senses amazingly.\\""},{"Title":"Orlando : a biography","review":"Woolf's skill of imagery in writing is amazing. Her love of her character Orlando is apparent in the gentle way she carries him/her from the 15th century to 1928. I wanted to jump into the story, sit beside Orlando, ride a horse beside him, and kiss him as a man and then again as a woman. A stunning read and one that should be on any well-read person's read and read again list...enjoy."},{"Title":"Orlando : a biography","review":"\\"Orlando\\" is the only Woolf novel that engages in fantasy. The main character, Orlando, lives from the Elizabethan era to 1928 and transforms from a man to a woman somewhere along the way. That detail in itself promises an intriguing plot.Woolf's prose often resembles poetry, and in \\"Orlando\\" this is no exception. She cleverly renders Orlando's (and the first-person narrator/biographer) feelings and experiences with a myriad of seemingly useless details. It may take some time to get used to and make sense of how these details fit; yet, that is the beauty and brilliance of Woolf's language that makes this novel (and her other works) such a pleasure to read.\\"Orlando\\" is referred to as Woolf's \\"holiday\\" novel and one that Woolf herself said she wrote in preparation for the next (and often considered best) book, The Waves. While \\"Orlando\\" does seem more light-hearted and comical than her other work, and this is partly due to the fantasy and her use of satire and parody, it can also be quite political in the issues it addresses, particularly those related to gender, literature, and modernity. Orlando as a character conveys her emotions but does not reflect much on their implications. However, we as readers who witness her transformation and her lifestyle, who are made to read to about Orlando's existence and position in the world, would soon find ourselves thinking about Woolf's recurrent themes and how they relate to humanity.As a whole, \\"Orlando\\" is very thought-provoking. Every time I pick it up, I find something new to marvel at."},{"Title":"Orlando : a biography","review":"No lover in the world ever wrote a valentine more exquisite than Virginia Woolf's tribute to her lover Vita Sackville-West. That tribute was \\"Orlando: A Biography,\\" a magical-realism tale about a perpetually youthful, charming hero/ine who traverses three centuries and both genders -- and Woolf's writing reaches a new peak as she explores the hauntingly sensuous world of Orlando.Orlando was born a young aristocratic man in the time of Queen Elizabeth I, and when the dying monarch visited his home she became his new court favorite (and briefly lover). His passionate, curious personality attracted many other women over the years -- until he fell in love with Sasha, a mercurial but faithless Russian princess (supposedly based on Sackville-West's ex-girlfriend). Bereft of true love, he devoted himself to poetry and entertainment.But then he's assigned to be an ambassador to Constantinople, and something strange happens -- while a bloody revolution rages, he sleeps for a full week... and wakes newly metamorphosed into a woman. With the same mind and soul but a female body, Orlando sets out on a new life -- and discovers that women aren't quite as different from men as she once thought.\\"Orlando: A Biography\\" is a very weird book, and was even more so when it was written since \\"magical realism\\" didn't exist as a literary style in 1928. Virginia Woolf makes no explanations about Orlando's immortality or unexpected gender switch. It's simply accepted that once he was a man, and then she became a woman, and that s/he has lived from the Elizabethan era until at least the 1920s (and who knows, maybe Orlando still wanders among us?).And Woolf's writing is at its peak here. Her prose is soaked in luxurious descriptions that constantly tease the senses -- silver and gold, frozen flowers, crystalline ice, starlight and the exquisite expanses of nature's beauty. At times the sensual writing seems almost feverish, and Woolf adds an almost mythic quality by inserting spirits of feminine virtues (Modesty, Purity and Chastity appear to try to hide Orlando's feminine body), and by having her hero/ine encounter great poets, queens and men of the sea.And Orlando him/herself is a truly fascinating character -- s/he can be sweet, passionate, romantic, wild and melancholy, and s/he has an almost magnetic charisma. He starts off the story as an elusive romantic teenager, suffers a heartbreak that matures him as an artist, and post-metamorphosis she becomes a woman of the modern world. Both in mind and body, Orlando is a very different woman at the end than the boy s/he began as.\\"Orlando: A Biography\\" is a truly spellbinding book -- Virginia Woolf's prose enthralls the senses while her main character explores the boundaries of gender. A must-read, for everyone."},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"This book is really a must for all baseball fans... it is really an engrossing read and a good look into what baseball was... back in the glory days. If you love baseball, and not just modern baseball, but the spirit of the game, you'll love this book."},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"Lawrence Ritter wrote \\"The glory of their time in 1966 and then updated it somewhat in the 1980'sBeing a baseball fan this was an interesting read because it was the story of 26 big name players in the game from the 1900's to the 1940's. Ritter personally interviewed these players so what the reader gets is the player reminiscing about their careers. There weren't as many teams in the American and National leagues so what you get are different players talking about the same games and situations. It's interesting that in many cases these guys are 50 or 60 years removed from the game/play but they all recall them in the same way even down to the players involved. What you also get is a lot of history of the teams their name changes and how they moved to different cities. As an example there have been a few teams named the Washington Nationals and the Washington Senators. The St Louis Browns became the Baltimore Orioles not to be con fused with the baltimore Orioles of the 1900's. Through the players the readers gets a real sense of history. Players talk about getting raises by holding out and not signing contracts when there were no player agents and no unions. This is all a fascinating part of the history of baseball in the first half of the last century.In The glory of their times the players compare the people that they played with like Napoleon Lajoie and Babe Ruth to the players of the day in the 50's and 60's like Willie Mays in Hank Aaron. Current players are compared to the great ball players of the 50's and 60'sRitter had hundreds of hours of these players talking because he recorded everything they said in the interviews. The reader doesn't really know what questions were asked of the players word for word but you can figure it you be the players response. Reading The glory of their times is like listening to a one way conversation, a very interesting one way conversation.The entire tape collection is in the Baseball hall of fame what the reader gets in a condensed version of the tapes. I suspect that there was a lot of editing that needed to be done and what wound up in The glory of their times was excellent. It's important to read both the original preface and the new preface to get an idea of what it took to compile the book.The Glory of their times really helped me round out some of the history in the late 1800's and early 1900's 5 stars all the way"},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"This is a series of first-person interviews with players from the early 1900s reminiscing on their experiences in major league baseball.

Detroit Tigers outfielder Sam Crawford talks non-stop on all kinds of topics, including his days playing with the great Ty Cobb. There's Smokey Joe Wood going from the greatest right-handed pitcher in baseball to sore-armed hurler, who goes stir crazy sitting out an entire season on his farm. Also, Bill Wambsganss, who pulled off the only unassisted triple play in World Series competition, a man who agonized over giving up his family's dream of being a clergyman to become a ballplayer. Lawrence Ritter let these men who played so long ago talk. These are their stories in their words. They were old men by the time Ritter caught him with them, nostalgic about their playing days, happy to have been a part of baseball in an era well before big money and endorsements and free agency, when playing ball literally could mean escaping the mine or the farm. Not surprisingly, some of them took a dim view of the modern player. Things don't really change over the generations in that respect. Beyond baseball, their stories help capture snapshots of America during a much simpler time.

We are both avid baseball fans and I thought this would be fun for us to listen to together. The sound quality was pretty good. I really enjoyed the first disc, (the only one we have listened to so far) but my grandson not so much. My grandson had only heard of some of the players being interviewed. The other thing I did not take into account before buying this CD set was that the interviews were old and so were the players being interviewed. My grandson did not understand some of the slang and expressions the players used, so he asked me several times, \\"What was he talking about?\\". I think he will really enjoy the CDs when he gets a little older, but right now he enjoys watching DVDs of old ballgames more.

The book is actually a collection of reminiscences of old-time baseball players compiled by their interviewer, Lawrence Ritter. The original book was written in 1966 with additional chapters added for the revised 1984 version that I read. What comes across first and foremost in all the recollections is the joy and dedication of the long-retired players. At a time when labor strikes, hold-outs and escalating salaries are standard sports stories, this book takes Baseball nostalgia to a new level. It isn't just about the joy of the game, however. This book brings to light a lot of forgotten Baseball history. I fancied myself a bit of a Baseball historian but there were a number of major events in Baseball's early history that I had never heard of before. I think the most memorable was Fred Merkle's \\"bonehead\\" play that cost the Giants the pennant in 1907. That was a situation where he forgot to touch second base and thereby cost the Giants the winning run. It is told (and referred to often) with better embelishment than I just gave it but, then, that's the point of my praise; the whole book is a poetic look backwards at the game we sometimes take for granted these days. It's no accident that the best parts of the book are the earliest recollections. You can almost see the corrupting effects of popularity creep up on the game in the 1920's. The stories that these veterans tell and the details that they give make you feel like you've been there yourself. If you're a Baseball fan, you'll love this book. If you're not a Baseball fan, reading this book might just make you one."},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"This is a book that is near and dear to the hearts of most baseball fans, frequently cropping up on lists of the best baseball books of all time. Inspired by the example of Alan Lomax, who recorded old blues singers down South in the 1930's, and motivated by the recent death of Ty Cobb, Lawrence S. Ritter, an economist and New York University professor by trade, spent several years (1961-66) tracking down and interviewing old ballplayers, recording their memories of the game for posterity before they too passed away. The book presents these sessions as extended monologues, alternately amusing, proud, defensive, and wistful recollections of their own careers, of the times they played in, and of the characters they knew.But now, as if the book weren't enough, the tape recordings of the actual interviews are available in audiobook form. Each is introduced by Ritter, who came to know many of the players quite well. And in his introduction, Ritter reveals that it was only years after the project that it occurred to him that one of the things driving him was the death of his own father. Recapturing the memories of the players his father had loved served as a final filial connection.The interviews include those with : &quot;Wahoo&quot; Sam Crawford, &quot;Rube&quot; Marquard, &quot;Chief&quot; Meyers, Hans Lobert, &quot;Smokey&quot; Joe Wood, Davy Jones, Ed Roush, and Fred Snodgrass. The stories they tell range from Hans Lobert racing a horse around the bases while barnstorming through Oxnard, California, to Fred Snodgrass defending his infamous muff; to a first hand account of the beaning death of Ray Chapman at the hands of Carl Mays; and finally a wonderful recital of Casey at the Bat by Chief Meyers. At the end of many of the interviews Ritter asked the old timers if they had any regrets, and not a single man did : of how few professions would this be true ?I can't recommend the book highly enough and even if you've read it several times, be sure to give the audio a listen. This is oral history at its very best and an invaluable resource for baseball fans. It does for all of us what Ritter only belatedly realized it was doing for him, it provides a vital connection to an earlier time, to the world of our fathers and grandfathers. It is truly wonderful.GRADE : A+"},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"Being a die hard baseball fan, I am always on the look out for great baseball books. And after reading numerous lists of favorite baseball books by Amazon.com readers, it seemed that there was one unanimous choice, The Glory of Their Times, by Lawrence Ritter. And let me say, that I wasn't dissapointed in the least. The beauty of this book is that you feel like you yourself are sitting down with the different players interviewed and having them regale you with stories about playing baseball in the early 20th Century or earlier. The players interviewed are not all household names which adds so much to it. Most of us know the exploits of Cobb and Ruth. Not as many know the stories of Harry Hooper, Wahoo Sam Crawford, and Paul Waner to name just a few. This book is a pleasure to read through and all I can say is thank God that Mr. Ritter wrote this book when he did as all of the players interview here have since passed on I believe. Don't miss this book!"},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"The names Ty Cobb, Babe Ruth and Honus Wagner don't resonate as much as they used to. As the decades go by even the old-timers among us haven't been around long enough to remember them. They've pretty much become historical, iconic figures, like the stoic-looking George Washington on a dollar bill. It's a bit of a sad reminder of the inexorable march of time, but what a great relief to know that this treasure chest of a book is around to keep their memories alive.The author got the idea for it in 1961 when he read that Ty Cobb had died. Realizing that many of Cobb's contemporaries would soon suffer the same fate, he set out to meet as many of them as he could and record--literally with a tape recorder--their stories for posterity. Twenty six of them are recounted here. Some of these guys are hall-of-famers, some of them not even close, but all of them--every single one--had a load of interesting tidbits to share. Baseball was a different game back then. America was a different place.The first great thing about the book is that you get at least several takes on the great ballplayers. One of the fellows, for example, playing Detroit, talked about being a little nervous about Cobb, whom they had all heard would sharpen his spikes. A Detroit player, however, mentioned that Cobb never sharpened his spikes. Not that they didn't discourage the other team from thinking so.Walter Johnson had an arm like a bullwhip, but he was a nice enough guy and a friend of Sam Crawford. Late in the game, if his team was ahead by enough runs, he'd toss a meatball in to Crawford and let him belt it. He never did that for Cobb, though, who he hated. Cobb could never figure out why Crawford was able to hit him.Honus Wagner is recalled by many as the best of all of them, with great quickness, great hitting and great fielding. A couple of the fellows recall that you could usually count on bits of gravel to be flung at you along with the ball he had just scooped up. Tommy Leach described him as the best fielding third-baseman, shortstop, first-baseman and outfielder in the league--he played all of them--and since he won the batting title eight times between 1900 and 1911 you couldn't really argue that he wasn't the best hitter in the league, either.For some odd reason, there aren't that many memorable gems about the great Babe Ruth, although there are at least a few. Harry Hooper (a guy I'd never heard of and a hall-of-famer) remembers Ruth in the first year he came up with Boston as a, \\"big, overgrown, green pea.\\" \\"Nineteen years old, poorly educated, only lightly brushed by the social veneer we call civilization, he was gradually transformed into the idol of American youth and the symbol of baseball the world over . . . If somebody had predicted that back on the Boston Red Sox in 1914, he would have been thrown into the lunatic asylum.\\"Along with these detailed sketches, including a ton of characters I haven't even mentioned--Germany Schaeffer, Rube Waddell (who didn't like to wear underwear), Lefty O'Doul, Dazzy Vance--the book is also, naturally, loaded with baseball anecdotes. Some of the more famous plays of the time, for example, are recounted in different ways and with different perceptions.Take the \\"Bonehead\\" Merkle play. For those of you who don't know, what happened was this. The Giants were tied with the Cubs for first place with one week to go in the season. In a game against each other, in the bottom of the ninth of a 1-1 game, the Giants had men on first and third with two outs. Merkle was on first. Birdwell hit a single to center, McCormack scored from third, and Merkle . . . ran to the clubhouse. Without touching second. The Cubs retrieved the ball from center field, Evers tagged second, and the run didn't count. Because of the crowd on the field the game had to be replayed on a later date. The Giants lost it, and lost the pennant. From then on and forever more, Fred Merkle became \\"Bonehead\\" Merkle.But it's actually a little more complicated than that. For one thing, Merkle was only nineteen. It was the first game he'd ever started for the Giants. And running into the clubhouse when the game was over was something all the guys did--whether touching second was necessary or not--because of the crowd pouring onto the field after the ushers opened the gates at the end of the game. The players ran off to get away from them. And Evers never did tag second base with the ball that was hit out to center because someone had heaved it into the left field stands. Fred Snodgrass doesn't think he ever tagged second with any ball at all. The umpires weren't around to know this, though; they had already left the field! Funny how the mists of history tend to simplify things. The detail in this book brings these stories back to life. And there are a ton of them recounted.Along with all of this baseball lore, you get a pretty good glimpse of America a hundred years ago, too. People were more humble, but in general confident, and much more direct. It's fascinating just to consider their nicknames: \\"Wee Willie\\" was the nickname for a short guy, \\"Specs\\" was the guy who wore glasses, \\"Chief,\\" (at least two of them) were American Indians, and, \\"Dummy\\" was the guy who was deaf and dumb. Nobody meant anything by it; nobody apparently took offense. Stuff like these speaks volumes.Here's Jimmy Austin: \\" . . . they didn't have clubhouses in most parks, especially not for the visiting team. We'd get into uniform at the hotel and ride out to the ball park in a bus drawn by four horses. They used to call it a tally-ho in those days. We'd sit on seats along the sides and ride, in uniform, to the ballpark and back.\\"That ride was always a lot of fun. Kids running alongside as we went past, and rotten tomatoes once in a while. Always lots of excitement when the ball club rode by, you know.\\"Yep.

We were heading for the AAABA National Baseball Tournament in Johnstown, PA. and was amazed that these existed and I did not know of them. I got myself a set and then came across the 1984 New and expanded book. I had met several of the gentlemen at different times at Old Griffith Stadium in Washington, DC. I remember going home in the late 50's and telling my Dad I had met an old ballplayer at the stadium who said he was &quot;Big Poison&quot;. My Dad laughed and said, &quot;Old Paul Waner, he wasn't very big but he could sure play Baseball.&quot; I now know the full story of Paul Waner and wish I did then. You are able to hear and read stories of the greatest players of their generation and players that are still known today. If you have a budding ballplayer or a budding baseball fan, do them a favor and get them this book as soon as possible. In a review on the back cover of my edition, Ted Williams summed it up for me as well when he said, &quot;Warm, happy, exciting - what a great feeling I got as I read it. The day I finished it I started reading it all over again.&quot;"},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"I have heard so many stories about Babe Ruth and Ty Cobb, I can't tell fact from fiction. Lawrence Ritter and undertaken an extremely long journey to bring you a true record of the early days of baseball.Packed with stories from legends Goose Goslin, Harry Hooper, Joe Wood, Hank Greenberg, Sam Crawford and others the spirit of baseball past comes to life. Ritter's ability to bring baseball alive is nothing short of spectacular.Probably the best baseball book I have ever read, The Glory of Their Times, is more than a amazing collection of stories. You'll read about how baseball has transformed from a love of the game to love of money.Each story has so much packed into it that I found myself re-reading each chapter just to make sure I got everything. I am so very proud that I have had the opportunity to read and review this extraordinary work on baseball. Thank you so very much Lawrence Ritter!"},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"Words alone cannot describe what I have read. Smoky Joe Wood, Rube Marquard, Wahoo Sam Crawford, and many others. We are talking legends of a game gone by. True hero's when a baseball world needed hero's. Many thanks to Lawrence Ritter for capturing moments in time with these baseball legends. I'm sure that they all had a million stories to tell, but I'll settle for just the few that are represented in this book. In today's baseball world of outright sheer greed and selfishness, it was so refreshing to hear stories about baseball's yesterday when times were simpler and the game was just a game. How I miss those days. How I miss those players. Thank you to them for allowing a little boy to dream the dream. Thank you for a memorable look at a simpler time, Lawrence."},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"It doesn't get much better than this. And I've read most of the top books in this field. If you have an interest in Baseball -- and want to read about the sport when it was really a &quot;game&quot; try this book. The book is truly told by the men who played the game in the early 1900's -- as transcribed in oral history fashion -- one chapter devoted to each player. Ritter brings to life players that most of us have always read about (Ruth, Cobb and Walter Johnson) and many more greats from that era -- Harry Hooper, Paul Waner, Rube Marquard, and Goose Goslin. (And yes, the author is my Uncle, but the book is STILL a great one!)"},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":". . .for those interested in baseball history or for those who are curious how the game was played a hundred years ago. Life was different: society was different, the players were different, the game was different, and the perception of the players were different. In the decades in between, a lot has changed, mostly for the better, but there are precious few books that can give us an insight to how the game of baseball was played by the major leaguers back then. There is no opportunity to learn from them any more - they're all gone. All we have left are treasures such as this book, which gives us an insight to the game and personalities who played back then: no one can describe a Walter Johnson fastball, an Ed Walsh spitball, a booming shot off the bat of Sam Crawford, or the way a certain player stood, batted, fielded or threw. Lawrence Ritter created the standard for the oral history of baseball and it's been imitated many times, but never as well (Don Honig came close, though). It's a wonderful book, well worth the time and money to read it."},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"Right around when pitchers and catchers report, I dust off my well-worn, oft-borrowed copy of Glory of Their Times. I've probably read it a dozen times all the way through and each time I'm charmed all over again. The beauty and genius of Glory is in the fact that Ritter had the sense not to interfere with the players' stories. You get a feel for their voices and personalities, and how their experiences helped shape them as individuals. In its own way, the book is a vivid and important portrait of American life at the beginning of the twentieth century. And it's a dang good baseball book."},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"Excellent and enjoyable--a wonderful trip back in time through the memories of those who played baseball almost 100 years ago. Just wish the full interviews were available. Any \\"true\\" baseball fan will treasure this set and listen to these great stories again and again!I have the book and read it years ago and will reread soon."},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"With an idea birthed in 1961 after the death of Ty Cobb, \\"The Glory Of Their Times\\" is filled with first-person interviews of some of the most note-worthy baseball players of first quarter of the 20th Century Baseball (such as Stan Coveleski, Sam Crawford, Fred Merkel, Rube Marquard, Smoky Joe Wood, Fred Snodgrass, Goose Goslin - to name only a few) and several from the second quarter (such as Hank Greenberg and Paul Waner). Also included are interviews from many baseball players that you've probably NEVER heard of including Davy Jones, Bill Wambsganss, Tommy Leach, Hans Lobert, and Jimmy Austin - all great players in their own right but for whom time has largely forgot. Not only do these players talk about growing up playing baseball, their sometimes circuitous and or tortured routes to the major leagues, and their playing careers, but they also talk at length about their peers, memorable events and games, and such immortals of the game as Ty Cobb, Babe Ruth, John McGraw, Walter Johnson, Christy Mathewson, Grover Cleveland Alexander, Frank Chance, Honus Wagner, and even Jim Thorpe and the 1919 Black Sox. Recorded over a five-year span, the interviews that author Lawrence Ritter taped are both unforgettable and irreplaceable. Back when baseball was more a team sport and the men played for the love of the game and not the money, the stories in the book make for an interesting and telling comparison to many of today's players who seem to have trouble talking about anything other than themselves.Many of the stories I liked best in the book were of the \\"challenged player makes good\\" variety. Read about Smoky Joe Wood going from lights-out World Series champion starter to useful outfielder. Or Chief Meyers' & Hank Greenberg's stories about overcoming racial prejudice. Or 19 year old Paul Waner showing up at training camp with the San Francisco Seals and going from a sore-armed starter into a Hall of Fame outfielder. Or how Sam Crawford could be one of the most under-rated players in Major League history (despite being in the Hall of Fame) due to sharing the same outfield with Ty Cobb. Or how the deaf and mute \\"Dummy\\" Hoy overcame his seeming disabilities to craft a very good 14 year career. Stories like this are very seldom found in baseball books which focus on the stars of the day to the almost complete absence of everyone else.As if the book needed anything else, the pictures that are included in the book are fabulous. One of the reviewers has already mentioned a photo of Walter Johnson casually standing next to friend Clyde Milan and almost all of the interviews include at least one photo of the player in question and also included are many of the players, teams, plays, and places that these old timers describe in almost unbelievable detail 30-40 years after the fact. It's useful to read the author's notes and the forward and he illustrates the path that he took in creating the book and states that much time was spent in corroborating the stories, plays, and stats that the players seemingly threw out off the tops of their heads. The glossary at the end of the book is also useful as a reference if you want to go back to a story about a particular player or team.All put together, this book is an engrossing page turner which every baseball fan should own!"},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"Reading this book was like watching a good baseball game on a nice spring day. Very relaxing. Very engrossing. Very pleasant. This is a book of memories by a number of old time baseball greats from the late teens to the early 1940s. Each tells of his career, its high points and low, and the many characters that inhabited the game during those years. Baseball was different then. Less intense. More tedious travel in buses or Pullman trains. Each player tells how he got into the game -- most attracted attention while they were on the sandlots in small American towns. To a man, they are humble in their descriptions of their own achievements and generous in their comments about teammates and opponents. Ritter has done a superlative job of drawing from these greats their observations and memories. The blurb on the back cover of the paperback version carries a quote: \\"Easily the best baseball book ever produced by anyone.\\" That's probably no exageration."},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"My late father was an excellent sandlot player back in the 1920's and was scouted by major league scouts but never made it to the big leagues. He did, however, know several old time major leaguers and as a result I did too. Reading this book put me back to the days of my youth when I would sit around and hear old time baseball stories by the hour. Even though I heard many of them over and over again I never tired hearing them. I think the reason for it must be that, for the most part, these old timers played the game because they loved it and their stories illustrate that. Also, the players back then were real characters that often carried descriptive nick-names (whatever happened to nicknames?). Life was tough for these old timers as well. I remember one friend of my dad's (a onetime all star pitcher) tell me that he was always looking over his shoulder because someone was always trying to take his job. When you consider that back then, most of the players made very little money (unlike today)and had to work in the off season in order to make end's meet, it adds a completely different dimension to the game of their day. This book is an excellent history of what it was really like back then to be a major leaguer because it uses as its source the unique characters that lived it. What better way to learn about what it was like than to hear from those that played the game when it was a game?"},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"Mickey Mantle said he never understood why grown men idolized him and why they would cry at times when they met him. I'm sure he knew why. Because baseball, the game of our youth, and the men who played it, take us back to that wonderful, simple time like nothing else. As our lives fly by baseball can always instantly transport us back to those carefree days. The Glory of Their Times does that with every page and every character. If you love baseball this is a must read. A simple pleasure that will make you smile, put a tear in your eye and let a sense of calm and nostalgia envelop you."},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"Any and every true baseball fan deserves to know and read this book of 1st hand reminiscences from players in the early days of baseball. This book is a \\"bridge\\" to the 19th century, and anyone who harbors a belief that today's players are tougher, stronger, smarter or throw harder and faster than their earliest forebears is strongly advised to read this book carefully. Also strongly recommended -- the tape or CD collection of the actual interviews recorded in the early 60's by Lawrence Ritter and produced for audio release by Henry W. Thomas (grandson of Walter Johnson, the best and hardest-throwing pitcher of all time). This book is highly enjoyable."},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"This is a great book for anyone interested in the early years of baseball. It is based on interviews with the actual players which took place in the 1960's. These were the days (1890's to 1930's) before televised sports, huge contracts, and inflated egos. It's a must read for anyone interested in early baseball lore."},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"Lawrence Ritter has taken names & statistics off dusty old pages of forgotten books and turned them into real, breathing men. I was struck by how normal, how completely human these men where. My favorite passage was Fred Snodgrass' explanation of Fred Merkle's actions in a game that was, and still is, widely misunderstood, and was the basis for the unfortunate man's (Merkle) name becoming something of a maladiction. My favorite picture - in a book full of great one's - was the casual shot of Walter Johnson sitting with his arm playfully draped around the neck of his teammate and friend Clyde Milan. It could have been shot yesterday.If you love baseball, you have to read this book."},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"I gave this book as a gift to my grandson..he was happy to have the book about ball players from th past..he is a big baseball fan ."},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"This is an amazing audio book for even the most casual lover of baseball. The audio book is a compilation of original recorded interviews made in the early 1960's with pro baseball players in the early days of the game. What an opportunity to hear from their own mouths stories of baseball from the men who played with and against Ty Cobb, Babe Ruth, Walter Johnson and many others.The interviewees include several hall of famers in their own right, including Goose Goslin, Sam Crawford and Rube Marquods. Fabulous; simply fabulous!What a treat this was to share with my son on a drive up to Cooperstown."},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"The glory of their times is ,simply the greatest baseball compilation ever recorded{Roger angel's books are better,different,in that they are ESSAY'S]Reading and re-reading this book,I wondered what it actually sounded like to record this,to expierence.Well, after purchasing this cD,I know. This is the greatest baseball find I could imagine.the quality of the recordings is uniformly good[some parts are less audible then others].The content is pure joy.How wonderful to HEAR sam Crawford, Lefty O'Doul[were there any finer men to play baseball?]One can only wish that someone had done the same with the great Negro League players ...alas,though that does not detract from this Brilliant recording{s].I would give it 6 10 a pantheon of stars...it is that good"},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"This book is simply the greatest ever written. Because of the fact that it was taken from conversations, the words ring with realism. The reader will learn what other player's perceptions of the stars were. What other book would have shown the intellect of &quot;Wahoo&quot; Sam Crawford? none. This book is realism to the core. Also it is interesting to see several perpectives on certain key events like the Merkle incident. I read this book all the time! It is simply the best book on baseball ever published."},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"A book like this can never be written again. This is your chance to hear from several of Baseball's stars from the &quot;Dead Ball&quot; era firsthand in their own words. Included in this book are Rube Marquard, &quot;Wahoo&quot; Sam Crawford, Smokey Joe Wood, Edd Roush, Paul &quot;Big Poison&quot; Waner and many others. This is the only book I have ever read two times, back-to-back. The tapes of the actual interviews will be my next purchase."},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"I'll be brief and to the point: This is the best book ever written on baseball. Nothing even comes close. The first time I read it, I went right back to the front and started reading it again. I've never done that in my life. Try it. It will change your perception of what baseball really was in its infancy."},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"Once a year, I buy my dad a book on baseball for Father's Day. Every year I do research to find something original with a well-written take on the game. I don't know how it happened, but after 15 years I had not bought him this book! I can't believe I missed it but I was thrilled to find an overlooked gem. All the five-star reviews are not exaggerating: this is THE book about baseball history . . . laugh-out-loud anecdotes, glimpses into the early rough-and-tumble years of the game, all giving a new perspective on the game we watch day-to-day. It's that joy of listening to old men sharing a drink and telling stories of the old days that go from funny -- to WOW -- to \\"I can't believe these old guys did that. I can't believe they're saying that!\\"We have all passed it around and all summer, when a game was on, we found ourselves sharing jokes and anecdotes we read from this book. These stories have made a family of baseball fans love the game even more."},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"I am not a fan of audiobooks, but this unique presentation of the early days of baseball might make good reading but I do believe most will benefit from getting it on CD. The author is a pleasant but thorough interviewer and the men whose stories you will hear are unforgettable. If you aren't particularly interested in baseball, THE GLORY is still fascinating, an oral history of America as the 19th turns into the 20th century."},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"Others have given stellar, well written reviews of this book, so I'll be short as always: It's full of great anecdotes and facts.The reader should be aware that Dr Ritter seems to have two small sub agendas in this book. First, in many chapters he veers the reminiscing tangentially at best towards the Fred Merkel incident, and always attempts to portray it with a bias towards clearing Fred's name. A nice gesture, I guess. Second, it's pretty clear that Willy Mays was Dr Ritters favorite contemporary player (1960's), as he is mentioned incidentally almost as much as many times as Merkel.But a fine read, for sure, about the middle history of baseball, in a very non-scholarly way."},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"The Glory of Their Times is a wonderfully put together book. Each ballplayer's story is unique and interesting. I literally couldn't put the book down. I have read a lot of baseball book's and this one is certainly at the top of my list."},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"This is a must-read for any baseball historian or baseball buff. It's amazing to hear first-person stories from players, some of whom started their professional careers in the 1800s. I especially enjoyed the anecdotes about Babe Ruth, Jim Thorpe, Sam Crawford, Ty Cobb, Walter Johnson, and others."},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"I've read this book twice, and will probably read it again. It consists of a collection of oral interviews with old-time ballplayers such as Bill Wambsganss, Lefty O'Doul, Goose Goslin, Paul Waner, and many others. The men speak in their own words about their lives in baseball. Highly informative, and very entertaining reading because you can \\"hear\\" these ballplayers talk about the game. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"I've owned three copies of this book, read it cover to cover a half dozen times, lent it to a couple dozen friends over the years, and it STILL is my favorite book to pick up and read. The stories, told by players from the 1900-1920 era, are priceless, as are the many fabulous photographs. You'll love this book like no other."},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"Nobody can truly claim to know baseball history until they read this book. The stories are first-hand accounts of players like Rube Waddell, Cy Young, and Walter Johnson as told by the men who played with or against them. I thought I knew baseball, then I read 'The Glory of Their Times' and I found out that I knew nothing at all. Seriuosly recommended for anyone even slightly interested in baseball. Better than Ken Burns' and Geoffrey Ward's 'Baseball.'Niklas Grundstrom"},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"It has been a long time since I read this book, but no other book on baseball or even on America during the first half of the century revealed so much about our character. Told by those who played at the time, it is an astonishingly literary work, with a rythym much like the game itself. A slow ride that somehow takes you in. the best baseball book I have ever read, by far"},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"The Glory of Their Times is a great Baseball book. The revised edition adds four player interviews to the originals. It covers those who played from the early 1900's such as Sam Crawford (who played with Ty Cobb) to the 1940's with Hank Greenberg (who played against Jackie Robinson). Player memories allow us to &quot;see&quot; again famous plays such as the 1912 'muff' of a fly ball by Giants' outfielder Fred Snodgrass which cost his team the World Series. Such 'word pictures' along with vintage photographs make this poignant and memorable book one you will treasure and want to read again and again"},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"When I was young, I wasn't interested in hearing about the \`old times'. Now that I'm older, the old folks are gone and I've missed out hearing their stories forever. In a way, this book is a second chance. Lawrence Ritter has made a Herculean effort tracking down all these players and getting their stories. Baseball fans owe him many thanks for the job he's done. There are many interesting stories told between these pages, but one of the most surprising to me was that these players called the games themselves most of the time. No coaches and the managers sat back and let the players play, for the most part. I especially enjoyed the story by Rube Bressler about three players ending up on third base at the same time. This is a must have collection for baseball fans. I thought \\"The Greatest Baseball Stories Ever Told\\" by Jeff Silverman was a little more entertaining, but this collection held my interest too and is a book worth keeping."},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"It is awesome to hear the real old-timers talk about baseball's early days. They are old enough to be candid, to be sure. The interviewer does an admirable job of staying in the background, asking prompting questions only when needed and these are show his excellent preparation without making him seem like he's their (baseball) equal.My only complaint, having heard this on CD (and I did that because I very much wanted to hear their actual voices) was that the audio was not done too well, mostly too faint except on extreme volume settings. Anyway, it was definitely worth the effort."},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"As soon as I checked this out from the library I could not put it down until I was done. This book is good for those looking to learn a little more about baseball, but it shines in its ability to transport current readers to a different time and place. What we know as modern day baseball today looks very different than the game played in the early 20th century. This book, told through Lawrence Ritter, but in the words of old ball players, has funny stories, great anecdotes, and a personal glimpse at the game long before it became a worldwide business. For me, something was added to the stories because they were in first person and not simply an old writer recording what he had heard, it made me feel as though I was joining the player in the action. Each chapter has a different tone and together they combine to give a varied and authentic picture of the game which is unlike any other."},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"I am a huge baseball fan, and really appreciate the history of the game. I've watched Ken Burns' Baseball probably a half-dozen times. As such, I'm the exact target audience for Lawrence S. Ritter's book, The Glory of Their Times: The Story Of The Early Days Of Baseball Told By The Men Who Played It. This book was absolutely fantastic, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone with any interest at all in baseball. Even if you aren't currently interested in the game's history, you will be by the time you finish The Glory of Their Times.Originally published in 1966 including interviews with 22 players from the early 20th century, and expanded in 1984 with an additional four player interviews, Ritter sets out to capture the memories of the earliest players of the game for the ages, and does so brilliantly. The book consists of a chapter for each player interviewed, and Ritter lets the player tell their own story in their own way. It's absolutely fascinating to hear these players echoing through the decades and describing the way they played the game, their careers, their teammates, their managers, the business of baseball, and even the fans of the day as seen from the player's view.One of the aspects of the book that I enjoyed most is that many of the players discuss the same events or players, including each other, and it's great getting different takes on all of that. You'll hear all about what the players of the day, including his teammates, thought of Merkle's Boner, or what it was like to play with or against Ty Cobb, or what manager John McGraw was like to play for. By the time you finish the book, you'll feel like you've gotten to know all these other players just as well as the men interviewed, who range from Hall of Famers like Sam Crawford or Paul Waner to a career utility player like Specs Torporcer.Baseball fans who, like me, have enjoyed Ken Burns' Baseball documentary should read this book. In fact, I re-watched Baseball (once again) only a couple months before reading The Glory of Their Times, and I recognized many of the stories and quotes from the early episodes of Baseball as having come straight from these interviews. So, if you enjoyed those, there's a lot more like that here for you.Another part of the book that is well done is the inclusion of many, many photographs. Ritter gives the reader pictures of all the interviewees and many of the people they talk about, and the pictures are included in the text when relevant, instead of in a glossy insert in the middle of the book, so they're very effective in helping the reader visualize the events being described.I highly recommend The Glory of Their Times. It's a magnificent book that does a wondrous job of drawing the reader into the early days of baseball."},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"I have been a baseball fan all my life, but I'm only 30 years old. So there is a whole lot of baseball history that I missed out on.Reading TGOTT is like sitting at the feet of players from the turn of the 20th century. The stories are fascinating. The interviewer just let the players talk about what they wanted to and the result is pure entertainment.I was also struck by how humble the players were - they wanted to give credit to teammates and managers as much as they wanted to talk about their accomplishments.I loved this book. I highly recommend it (and I also recommendEight Men Out: The Black Sox and the 1919 World Seriesif you are interested in baseball history)."},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"I am a sports nut who also loves to read American history also. This is far and away my favorite book as it meets both needs. Anyone that loves to read about the early days of baseball should read this book. The author gives you a first hand view of the ear heroes of the game through the eyes of the men who played it. I recommend it highly and re-read it every view years."},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"I've read this book six times now. Listened to the CD version at least a dozen times. Each time it draws me in, closer and closer to the game that I still love. Although the names and faces of the game have since changed, I cannot help but credit Lawrence Ritter for always rekindling my love for baseball. I smile always and have a warm feeling in my heart when I experience this masterpiece over and over again.To Lawrence Ritter: Thank you so very much for allowing this little boy to continue to dream his dream."},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"I've been a baseball fan for as long as I can remember (40+ years) and have read a number of great baseball books during that span. \\"The Glory of Their Times\\" certainly ranks with any of them. Lawrence Ritter traveled the countryside in the 1960's to interview and record the thoughts of some of baseball's greats from the early 20th Century. His goal was simple: record the anecdotes and thoughts from these great players before it was too late. He definitely achieved his goal.Ritter allows the players to do the \\"writing\\" of the book by just holding the microphone in place and editing the volumes of information that he gathered from these former stars. Most of the names (Waner, Greenberg, Goslin, Wood) will be familar to baseball fans, but even the obscure (Leach, Austin, Lobert, Torpocer) are given their due. The stories don't just revolve around the baseball careers of these players. Snippets of what life was like in our country between the two great wars can be found here as well. In that regard, any reader who appreciates history or good human interest stories will enjoy \\"The Glory of Their Times\\" as well.The photos that accompany the book are just as impressive as the stories themselves. There are a number of pictures of other baseball greats not featured in the book including, Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb, Christy Mathewson and Honus Wagner, just to name a few.Reading \\"The Glory of Their Times\\" is a great nostalgic trip into baseball's early history and I give it my highest recommendation!Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"Sometimes the best histories are the ones where the participants in that history are allowed to talk and the history's author just listens. Such is the case with this book. And oh the stories these old ballplayers tell. Stories of an era in baseball from long ago: what it was like to play with Honus Wagner or Ty Cobb or Lou Gehrig; what it was like to play for John Mcgraw; or get a new persepctive on an infamous play like the Fred Snodgrass muff or a dropped ball that led to a World Series win. And funny how you get a sense too from reading this book of what life and the people in it were like back in the early part of the 20th century, as well as what the baseball was like. I was highly entertained and intrigued from the moment I opened the book to reading the last page in it. And I'm thankful the author thought to preserve this era for all of us before it was too late.Dick Dobbins used this \\"oral history\\" approach to great advantange in his now out of print book about the old Pacific Coast League called The Grand Minor League. It's an approach I used to a lesser extent some years ago when I wrote a history of a local volunteer group in the late 1990s.I've wanted to read this for years, and I'm glad I did. If this isn't the greatest baseball book of all time, it's pretty darn close."},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"After plowing through more than two dozen reviews that say this is the best baseball book ever written, you might be inclined to dismiss those sentiments as the worst example of hype. Don't. You will be the loser for it.This book is superb for its baseball stories, but it is more than that. The men in its pages talk about what it was like to be young and alive in America at the turn of the century. You don't even have to LIKE baseball to enjoy this book, but it certainly helps.Jacques Barzun has said that someone who wants to understand America must learn baseball. In the movie &quot;Field of Dreams,&quot; James Earl Jones says, the one constant in America has been baseball. To understand what they're talking about, you must buy and read this book. And you'll enjoy yourself while doing so."},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"This classic book provides any baseball fan, from the casual to the truly obsessive a real treat. Baseball at its most beautiful, told in the voices of ball players who truly loved playing the game. Their stories will make you laugh, learn, and more than anything wish you were with Lawrence Ritter when he sat down to talk with these baseball greats. I have read a lot of baseball books and this one is an absolute must for any baseball fan."},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"Statistically, baseball back then couldn't be more at variance with the game now. Cy Young threw 511 career victories, and 750 complete games. In 1909, Ty Cobb led the majors both in batting average (.377) and home runs (9). Cobb's teammate Sam Crawford hit over 300 triples in his career.What to make of such numbers? Lawrence S. Ritter's \\"The Glory Of Their Times\\" strips away the statistical confusion by getting to the heart of Major League Baseball's early days, the players themselves. An economics professor, Ritter invested his downtime from 1962-66 in interviewing elderly men, baseball players all who knew what it was like to face a Walter Johnson fastball, or have Ty Cobb slide into the base they were covering.\\"People were more unique then, more unusual, more different from each other,\\" says Davy Jones, who played on the Tigers with Cobb and Crawford. \\"Now people are all more or less alike, company men, security minded, conformity - that sort of stuff. In everything, not just baseball.\\"Transcriptions of Ritter's interviews with Jones and 21 other former players, including Crawford and two others then in the Hall of Fame, makes up the whole of \\"The Glory Of Their Times,\\" published in 1966 and later extended with four more interviews in 1984. Nearly all the interviews offer both testimony and color for the game as it was then.Bill Wambsganss tells us about his unassisted triple play in the 1920 World Series, and how Ring Lardner once used his last name to rhyme with \\"clam's chance\\" and \\"Ray Chapman's pants\\". Fred Snodgrass tells us about his famous muffed fly in the 1911 World Series, and how his New York Giants tried to psyche out the Philadelphia Athletics by sitting on the dugout bench, ostentatiously sharpening their spikes.You hear so much about another famous World Series moment, the Merkle \\"boner\\" of 1908, that you feel like you were there on the field, too. There's a Rashomon-like quality to hearing various interviewees give their different takes on such things as the character of John McGraw and whether \\"Giant Killer\\" Harry Coveleski was run out of the league when he was caught chewing on bologna. (Snodgrass says so, while Harry's brother Stanley, a major-league pitcher himself, calls it \\"a lot of bull\\".Not all the interviews are riveting. One wishes Ritter could have pushed some of the old players more, like the rumors that swirled around Smoky Joe Wood involving fixes. But allowing the subjects the reins probably drew more color out of them than a Grand Jury could have. I love how Crawford keeps telling Ritter he hasn't much time to talk, while giving Ritter one of the longest and most entertaining interviews in the book, describing how players would allow themselves to be rubbed down with \\"Go Fast,\\" a noxious combination of Vaseline and Tabasco sauce that made them sweat like a sauna.\\"I hope I haven't said anything I shouldn't,\\" Crawford says at the end. \\"There are a lot of the old-timers still left,you know, and they're liable to say, 'That fathead, who the hell does he think he is, anyway, popping off like that!'\\"If you like baseball even a little, you will enjoy \\"The Glory Of Their Times\\" quite a lot."},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"I first read this book as an 11 year old and i have treasured it since. This is how all children should learn about the game. Mr. Ritter deserves a place in the Hall of Fame for preserving the storys of these players. At the time the book was written these men were elderly and most were long forgotten. Some had stayed in the game (Hans Lobert), some were successful in other fields (Fred Snodgrass) and some like Bill Wambgnass and Stan Coveleski barely scrapped by. But from their memories you understand that they are all intellegent men who were, in their youth, the best ball players in the nation. They paint a vivid picture, as only men who lived the llfe can, of what baseball was like at the turn of the century. The storys in this book are gems. You get to hear about the greats of the game not from some sportswriter (most of whom usually get it wrong) but by the players. And they pull no punches. Ty Cobb was a bastard, Bugs Raymond was a drunk. From their memories you get a REAL picture of what Hans Wagner, Babe Ruth, Chrisy Mathewson and Walter Johnson were like not just as players but as men. It should be noted that almost as a direct result of this book Goose Goslin, Rube Marquard and Stan Coveleski were elected to baseball Hall of Fame."},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"I'll be blunt. This is the single greatest baseball book I've ever read. I wouldn't be surprised if it were the best baseball book ever written. This book conveys the tone of baseball's early days. The players tell their stories in their own voice, oft-times a considerably different manner of speaking than we use currently.I greatly enjoyed the slang words the old ballplayers used. They taunted rookies by calling them 'bushers'. One player warned another (speaking of Nap Lajoie) 'Watch out for the Frenchman.' Priceless!Outside of the words, the stories themselves paint a glorious picture of baseball at the beginning of the century. The lesser ballplayers, the Hans Loberts and Chief Meyers', give their impression of the all-time greats; Wagner, Lajoie, Mathewson, Cobb, Jophnson, Bender, Waddell, and Shoeless Joe. Much of what we now know about these legends came directly from the recollections in this book. This is a baseball treasure and belongs in every serious fan's library."},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"Words alone cannot describe what I have read. Smoky Joe Wood, Rube Marquard, Wahoo Sam Crawford, and many others. We are talking legends of a game gone by. True hero's when a baseball world needed hero's. Many thanks to Lawrence Ritter for capturing moments in time with these baseball legends. I'm sure that they all had a million stories to tell, but I'll settle for just the few that are represented in this book. In today's baseball world of outright sheer greed and selfishness, it was so refreshing to hear stories about baseball's yesterday when times were simpler and the game was just a game. How I miss those days. How I miss those players. Thank you for a memorable look at a simpler time, Lawrence."},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"Unlike other sports, professional baseball tries hard to maintain continuity with the past, so that today's accomplishments can still be ranked on a scale with those of a hundred years ago (after adjusting for steroids).But there's more to continuity that just being able to compare statistics across generations. What if we could compare baseball personalities and anecdotes? Does Buckner's error at first base have any parallels from Babe Ruth's time? How does Barry Bonds compare with Ty Cobb as a teammate?In the mid-1960's, the deaths of Ty Cobb and of his own father led Lawrence Ritter to realize that direct knowledge of the early years of major league baseball had a finite life span. In order to preserve some of it, he set out with a tape recorder to interview twenty-six baseball players who played in the major leagues between the 1900's and 1920's. At least seven of them are now in the Hall of Fame. The result is like no other sports book -- a real picture of the game in its early years, told from multiple perspectives by the players themselves. We learn about the personalities, the contracts, the managers, the travel, the food, the stadiums, the reporters and the fans. For several famous plays, we get to hear the versions of players from both teams who were on the field or in the dugout at the time. Amazingly, almost all of these men tell their stories as if they happened yesterday --- the details were still fresh and vivid in their minds, decades later.If you have an interest in the history of baseball, or of grass roots America one hundred years ago, this book is a delight."},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"Lawrence Ritter's captivating look at baseball in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, directly from the players themselves, is a stark contrast to the game the modern players play; which in reality, is more of a business than a game. And like much of corporate America, the game of baseball has evolved into a cold and calculating endeavor, where the fan seems to be enjoying the game less with each passing season.It didn't use to be that way. Players were largely underpaid employees of the rich and unscrupulous owners, and most of them had to find work in the off season just to make ends meet. These guys had to fight their way through each season, as if their lives depended on it; certainly, their livelihoods were at stake.The players certainly had a zest for the game which hasn't been seen in modern baseball since the Gashouse Gang---The rough and tumble bunch of ballplayers that comprised the 1934 St Louis Cardinals; they fought hard, they played hard, and their great spirit captured the imagination of fans across the country during the Great Depression. They were simply a throwback to an earlier era---around the turn of the 20th century---when the players played the game with a competitive ferocity, but also had fun doing it.The tales of the old days are a refreshing look at what the game was like before it became tainted by the almighty dollar; and well before there was any notion of political correctness getting in the way. Can you imagine calling a guy \\"Three Finger\\" Brown or \\"Dummy\\" Hoy nowadays?Any fan of the game will cherish this masterpiece; it brings back to life an era of baseball's past that was certainly flawed; yet at the same time, filled with the glory that is baseball in its purest form."},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"This is an enormously engaging book on baseball, when it was still a game and in the process of becoming the national pastime in the early 1900s. Players from that era reminisce about their youth, how they became involved in professional ball and how they played the game. Fascinating stuff for anyone who considers himself a baseball aficionad."},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"\\"The Glory of their Times\\" is a book of personality, a book of passion, in which 22 baseball players of the 1890s to the 1930s tell their stories. Originally taped by Lawrence Ritter in the 1960s, these oral remembrances are now very valuable. There are no longer any live witnesses of the earlier times. The later times are fast escaping conscious memory, setting aside the contribution of Paul Waner, the only interviewee who played past 1938.I met Rube Marquard, the first interviewee presented, in 1975, during induction week at the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown. Marquard, who had been inducted four years earlier, had a cane. He told me that New York Giant manager John McGraw was the greatest manager ever, and that Marquard's Giant teammate, pitcher Christy Mathewson, and others of his day played for the love of the sport. \\"Today, all the players want is money,\\" he said. What would he say about the players of 2009? Giant catcher Chief Meyers also emphasized the love of the sport argument to Ritter: \\"Most of us would have paid them just to let us play.\\" Regardless of the veracity of these statements, modern players benefit from a huge legacy the old timers bequeathed to them. Ritter states in his preface that they were \\"men who chased a dream and, at least for a time, caught up with it and lived with it...They were pioneers...They entered an endeavor which lacked social respectability, and when they left it, it was America's National Game.\\"The years 1905-1914, after baseball's rules became relatively settled, are particularly special for me. With the home run a rare treat, bunting, contact hitting, good baserunning, and stolen bases were the keys. The Chicago Cubs had their \\"peerless leader,\\" Frank Chance; Three Finger Brown and their other great pitchers; and their Tinker-to-Evers to Chance double play trio. They won the pennant every year from 1906 to 1910 except 1909, when Honus Wagner's Pittsburgh Pirates beat Ty Cobb's Detroit Tigers in the World Series as Wagner vastly outplayed the nasty Cobb. In 1908, Giant Fred Merkle's boner, recounted in detail here by teammate Al Bridwell, forced a playoff between the Giants and Cubs. The Cubs won and beat Cobb's Tigers in the World Series. This was one of the greatest seasons ever, and together with the 1909 season represented a peak in fan interest.The famous action shot of Cobb sliding into New York Highlander third baseman Jimmy Austin is in this book, and Austin discusses Cobb, spikes and all. Sam Crawford, Cobb's teammate, picks Wagner over Cobb as the best player he ever saw (plus, for what it is worth, Tris Speaker over Willie Mays in centerfielding). Tommy Leach, Wagner's teammate, picks Wagner as \\"[t]he greatest everything ever.\\"Rube Bressler tells us about the great pitchers and the \\"$100,000\\" infield of the Philadelphia A's. That is $100 million today. Red Sox outfielder Harry Hooper and Smoky Joe Wood himself tell us about the Red Sox fireballer's 1912 season, in which he went 34-5 and won 16 straight games. Wood was the only pitcher of the time who could throw as hard as Walter Johnson, and Wood beat him 1-0 in a regular season game that was one of baseball's biggest draws (Johnson also won 16 straight that year). Wood was almost the loser in the World Series finale, but Fred Snodgrass dropped a fly ball in the 10th inning with the Giants ahead, and they and their beloved Mathewson went down to a heartbreaking defeat. Poor Snodgrass describes how, to no avail, he made a great catch on the next play that only detail-minded baseball fans know about. Hooper tells us he sure did remember, and he also recalls Babe Ruth as a young pitcher.Bridwell states the best modern players are in the league of the best old timers, but we can still appreciate the humor of Lefty O'Doul. He recounts how he was at a dinner in about 1960 and acknowledged that Willie Mays was a great fielder and quite a good baserunner but could not carry the bat of Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb, and some other old timers. Cobb hit .367 lifetime when the spitball was legal, along with the emery ball and the shine ball. A youngster asked O'Doul what he thought Cobb would hit today. O'Doul replied, \\"about the same as Mays, maybe .340.\\" The kid asked, \\"Then why do you say Cobb was so great if he could only hit .340 or so with this lively ball?\\"O'Doul replied, \\"You have to take into consideration, the man is now seventy-three years old.\\""},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"There is nothing better than hearing directly from the people who are part of history. This is a great collection."},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"It is difficult to add to the justifiable praise that has been accorded to Lawrence S. Ritter's book \\"The Glory of Their Times.\\" This remarkable book served as the template for many other baseball writers. It is required reading for any serious student of the game.What makes this book an important contribution to the field of oral histories is that Ritter persuaded numerous surviving baseball stars from the latter stages of \\"The Deadball Era\\" to relate their recollections fifty to sixty years after they had retired as active athletes. In effect, he recorded not only their personal stories for future generations of readers, but he left a record of a distinct period in the history of the sport that was eclipsed by the introduction of the lively baseball in the Twenties and the home run production binges that revolutionized the game immediately afterwards.Here you have the stories of baseball as it was played during the first twenty years of the Twentieth Century. Most of the ballparks were wooden stadiums without most of the modern amenities. Here you will find the likes of John McGraw, Frank Chance, Tris Speaker, Ty Cobb, Sam Rice, Honus Wagner and Christy Mathewson.I wish that I could experience the pleasure of rereading this book for the first time again."},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"I had read where this was considered by many as \\"the best baseball book of all time.\\" Well, you know how hype like that works; rarely is anything as good as it's built up. Not in this case. This really IS fantastic baseball material. It's so good that several people have copied its format since but nobody has come close to duplicating it. It's the content, though, not the form that makes this so entertaining.The \\"it,\\" by the way, refers to letting former players talk into a tape recorder and write down exactly what they say. In this book, we get ballplayers who played in the wildest era in baseball history: the Deadball Era. Thus, you get some incredible stories, many of which are just jewels, things you will treasure if you're a fan and you love baseball history.If for nothing else, the story about Germany Shaefer's pinch hit home run is worth the price of the book. It is the funniest baseball anecdote I have ever heard or read.Baseball great Ted Williams said when he finished reading this book, he started over and read it again. I believe it.Lawrence Ritter recorded and wrote what has amounted to an instant classic, from the year it was published in 1966. All the hype, folks, isn't hype: it's the truth - a fabulous collection of baseball stories."},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"Never got this book when it came out in the '60s and I was a kid. Sorry now that I didn't!Fascinating tales of baseball now almost a century old. Back in the '60s many of these early players were still alive and Ritter interviewed them. He did a great job and you can learn so much from them. How much different baseball was a hundred years ago. Fans used to seeing any time a ball touches the dirt it's taken out of play would be amazed to find they often played games with one ball in 1908. Stained with tobacco juice and often lopsided after being smacked with a heavy bat, the ball was used until it was hit too far into the stands to get back. Catch a foul ball in the second row? You'd give it back, or else.And games were often played in less than two hours. None of the pitcher's staring all arround and adjusting his uniform between pitches. Likewise the batter. No gloves to adjust, just step back in the box and wait for the pitch.Al Besser"},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"Lawrence Ritter in his original Preface describes his book as about the early days of baseball. I'm going to make a correction. Mind you it is the only one I will make. His book is about the early days of modern professional Baseball.With that being put aside , I must praise Mr. Ritter for his most original idea for a book. He took upon himself to travel the U.S.A. in search of the very players who established our National Pastime in the early part of the 20th Century. People talk of Shakespeare and Churchill as prolific writers of the English language. What Mr. Ritter has done is an epiphany for writing a book. His concept was indeed very simple. Why not seek out the very best living Baseball Players of the early 20th Century, and ask them to please describe their experiences.In the early to middle 1960's when Mr. Ritter did this, he was able to talk to these pioneers of modern baseball in the twilight of their wise years. These 26 men had time to reflect on their careers and describe an age unknown to us. Mr. Ritter traveled to these men and I'm sure asked the correct questions and let these gentlemen record their responses on tape. What he captured will stir the heart of each true Baseball Fan.For the record my two favorites are Stanley Coveleski and Bill Wambsganss. You can guess from these selections what my favorite team is."},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"I really enjoyed listening to the stories from some of our classic baseball heros.

There isn't a season that goes by that I don't read it again. When you read the interviews of the ballplayers, recorded by Lawrence Ritter, it's as if you are a fly on the wall hearing the conversations first hand and the ghosts of seasons long past are brought back to life.You get a first person account of some of the most famous moments in early baseball history through the fond recollections of some of the participants. Merkle's boner, Snodgrass' muff, Wambsgan's unassisted World Series Triple play are all recounted. The most entertaining parts of the book recount tales of Germany Schaefer stealing first base, the chronicles of Charles Victory Faust, and Wilbert Robinson attempting to catch a grapefruit dropped from an airplane. You get a glimpse of Ty Cobb from his teammates Davy Jones and Sam Crawford. You get several different takes on the great manager John McGraw from several different players who once played for him.This is hands down the greatest sports book I have read. It's not only a great history of the early days of 20th century baseball but a wonderful piece of Americana. The book breaths humanity and paints a portrait of the ballplayers of the past who played for the love of the game unsullied by steroids and multimillion dollar contracts."},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"I can unequivocally state that this book is one of the greatest books about baseball that I've ever read. Each player offers information, anectdotes, and humorous tales of the wonderful world of life between the foul lines.

Truly outstanding."},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"In the era of John Rocker, Rickey Henderson, Pete Rose, and other &quot;baseball role models&quot;, this book is a refreshing look at the men who made the game better than it is today. The book doesn't focus on the usual heroes of the day, but rather those near the heroes--and their stories are fantastic. Take a break from today's headlines on arbitration, strikes, and players missing eight weeks with hangnails and stubbed toes.

I not only enjoyed the book more, I understood their love of the game and who they really were. Mr. Ritter's style not only told me a story but I felt as if I was in the room listening to them tell me their own baseball glory."},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"Tired of players being grossly overpaid who are mediocre compared to the greats of the recent past?

Had Ritter only known more about the history of the game and the careers of individual players at the time, he had an umatched opportunity to get right to the heart of the matter on any number of issues. But he spoke to them as a fan, and it shows. In the end the book teeters more toward nostalgia than hard core history. While it gives a wonderful sense of the times and of the personality of the players interviewed, one is left wishing for more and mourning the lost opportunity as most of these men have since passed on."},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"Decent book.

He wanted to preserve their memories while it was still possible. He did us all a favor - The Glory of Their Times is one of the finest books ever written about baseball history. Ritter was a good oral historian - he knew how to draw his subjects out. Where else can you read first-hand accounts of what it was like to play with Ty Cobb?"},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"The interviews form a tapestry evoking the baseball era before WWII and the feel of the national pastime is captured. Brilliant journalism. Warm yet realistic, and laugh out loud funny."},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"I am not sure what I can add to the numerous reviews already here except to strongly encourage you to read this book. When I first got it out of the library I was a little hesitant because I really only recognized a few of the names in the table of contents, primarily Hank Greenberg. But right when I started reading I was hooked.First of all, the players profiled here spend a lot of time discussing other greats of their various eras from the late 1890s to the 1940s including Ty Cobb, Honus Wagner, Walter Johnson, Jackie Robinson, and Babe Ruth. That helps to ease you into their own stories, which are pretty great. One player gets to explain why the ball he dropped in the World Series did not cost his team the World Series despite everyone's memory. Another guy talks about the time he saw somebody steal first. And another play tells the story of his unassisted triple play. Some of these stories we get to hear a few times from the perspectives of different players.It is also interesting to hear the voices of these players in old age. Many of them were keeping low profiles when this book came out. Some totally forgotten and not in the Hall of Fame. Others still hooked on every play by Willie Mays and Sandy Koufax, the stars of the day when this book was published.The game was really different back then of course. The games were shorter, home runs were rarer, and in the early part of the period covered the trades were more frequent especially with all of the competing leagues. Reading this book will give you the feeling you get watching Ken Burns' Baseball or Field of Dreams. It will take you back to a different time for baseball, maybe a time that never really existed. And of course it had its problems with almost slave wages for the players and racial intolerance, but the game itself and a lot of its stars look pretty great from where I sit in the asterisks era of somewhat overpaid and over-pampered professional baseball."},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"This superb oral history of baseball circa 1900-1920's contains many priceless tales. After Ty Cobb died in 1961 author Lawrence Ritter (1922-2004) took his tape recorder and traveled the USA to interview 22 surviving players from that remarkable era. We hear from top stars and established players, including Ed Roush, Sam Crawford, Smokey Joe Wood, Chief Meyers, Sam Jones, Bill Wambsganss, etc. Each player reminisces in his own way, recounting games, teammates, owners, managers, crowds, ballparks, etc. Some talk at length while others are briefer, but each is articulate and illuminating. I particularly liked Rube Marquard's memory of visiting the Chicago firehouse where he'd once slept as a transient, Stan Coveleski's view that baseball kept him from the coal mines, and the remembrances of Davy Jones and Jimmy Austin. It was also interesting to see how these players viewed superstars Honus Wagner, Christy Mathewson, Ty Cobb, and Babe Ruth. This book provides readers with a superb sense of baseball before night games, air travel, TV, radio (except after 1922), farm systems, and in some cities, Sunday baseball.Ritter set a standard with this superb oral history. The players interviewed here have all departed (the last, Specs Toporcer in 1989), but their memories live on in this superb book. Fans might also enjoy BASEBALL WHEN THE GRASS WAS REAL, a similar effort about a later era by Donald Honig."},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"In short: There has never been a book that made me feel as justified about my love of the game as &quot;The Glory Of Their Times&quot;. Lawrence Ritter gets the job done by getting out of the way and letting the greats of the game from 1900s-1930s tell their stories. Review after review of this book calls it the best baseball book ever and let me add my voice to that chorus.Baseball in the deadball era when the fences were so far out that the league leading home run hitter hit 4 home runs; all of them inside the park runs. Baseball when you got one ball to play with. Fred Snodgrass' story *alone* is worth the price of the book, but you also get to hear what it was like to play with Walter Johnson, Babe Ruth (with the Red Sox), lots of dirt on Ty Cobb and Christey Matthewson.......Each of these stories is like a summer day and makes you feel like grabbing a ball and mitt and heading outside.What else is there to say? Pick it up!"},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"This is, and will always be, my most favorite baseball book ever. Read all of the previous reviews and you will understand why so many readers love this book. Read the book and you will realize why you love baseball so much.If you are debating whether or not to read \\"The Glory of Their Times\\" ask yourself this question, do you know who Charles Victory Faust is? No? Then read the book. That alone is worth the price of admission.I have reread this book a number of times and there is still a Germany Schaefer story I love to tell any baseball enthusiast who hasn't heard it. But that is just one of many great stories told by a colorful collection of great players who help make baseball the great game that it is."},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"The players interviewed for this book, some 50 years after playing the game, have got wonderful stories all over this book. It is interesting to hear how almost all of them got their break in baseball by playing for a city team, and just happening to get noticed one day when one would just happen to have a good day when the owner of a team was around. You learn more than just about the players interviewed since they tell stories about guys like Christy Mathewson, and even about an deaf mute outfielder that called for the ball by making an odd squeaking sound. Great stuff!"},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"I am very interested in baseball history. I created a game that allows me to manage the best players who ever lived, to get to know them by putting them in lineups and playing out games and seasons. It was fun to read the autobiographical stories of some of these old players. It is also great to see their photos, and every contributor to this collection of stories has a photo in the book. Many of them appear in my game.There were two famous bad plays discussed in the book, the time that Merkle failed to touch second base, costing his team an important game, and the time Snodgras missed a fly ball, costing his team an important game.In the pages of this book we learn that Merkle's failure to touch second base was a result of fans storming onto the field, believing the game to be over with Merkle's team winning, causing Merkle to rush for the locker room instead of blasting his way through a crowd to get to second base.We further learn that the defense never threw the ball to second base to get Merkle out, so in a sense, that play still has not been resolved. There's still time for Merkle to touch second base. And we also learn that a similar play had occurred shortly before that game, and the umpire ruled in favor of the runner, not insisting that he fight his way through a crowd of fans on the field.With regard to the fielding error by Snodgras, we learn that immediately after that error, Snodgras made an exceptional play in the field, robbing another batter of a hit, so Snodgras wasn't such a goat after all. The media is blamed for making goats of these two players.The baseball players have conflicting opinions about the famous New York Giant manager John McGraw. Almost all of them revered him, but one spoke up against him, saying that he was excessively critical of his players, abusive, and that the player refused to play for McGraw until McGraw actually gave assurances that he wouldn't treat him like garbage.I enjoyed the Hank Greenberg chapter. Contradicting claims made about him, he said that he was not prevented from breaking Babe Ruth's 60 homerun record by the antisemitism of opposing players. While he admits that he was walked a lot during the last days of the season, he also points out that Bob Feller struck him out a few times, and that the pitchers in the American League were throwing him hittable balls. His reason for failing to hit more than 58 homeruns in a season was that he ran out of gas.It's nice to know that baseball was not corrupted by antisemitism. Greenberg admits that some opposing players shouted antisemitic remarks at him, but he says that this was no different from the way they would always pry for sensitivities, trying to get every opponent rattled, standard procedure by the bench jockeys of the time, nothing personal in their abuse.Though Babe Ruth was not alive to be a contributor to this book, a number of the contributors mention him, and it is always with fondness, with adoration. He was beloved by his contemporaries.I found it interesting to read descriptions of Walter Johnson and some of the other all time greats. Johnson was blazing fast, with an easy, smooth delivery, like Koufax. He was also beloved by his contemporaries, a modest and wonderful man.For those of you who aren't up on your baseball history, Babe Ruth was by far the greatest player who ever played the game, and Walter Johnson was by far the greatest pitcher of all time.For modern fans, think in terms of Pedro Martinez in his prime as a fastballer. Project that out to 20 years of it, and you have Walter Johnson.Some of the oldtimers in this book compare players of their day to more modern players. One conclusion is that the old timers were smarter. Another conclusion is that the modern players are bigger, stronger, faster.The main difference is that in the old days the ballparks were bigger, the baseball was deader, and the three run homer didn't win nearly as many games as the single slapped beyond the infielders. It made sense in those days to play a smart version of little ball. It made sense for batters to choke up on the bat and hit like Pete Rose. These days it makes more sense to swing free and shoot for the fences, because they are much more attainable than they used to be.If you found these comments interesting, you will really enjoy this book. If not, it's not for you."},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"If you enjoy old timer baseball and the behind the scenes stories, then you will love this book.

What an incredible work!"},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"Ritter spent six years tracking down professional baseball players from the early 1900s, then stepped aside to let them tell their remarkable stories in their own words.

If you enjoy baseball history this is a must read."},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"Mr Ritter's time was well spent for all to enjoy! His efforts have made an unbelievable event for many to think upon. The times past thru the voices of the men who kicked up the dirt of the old ball fields live on thru his work!

You can imagine yourself sitting next to the old guys listening to their stories of baseball in the days of dead ball. It's not necessarily what you would think...it wasn't all hard drinking and hard living.Even a casual fan will enjoy this book. I'm hoping my kids will soon be picking it up and reading it because I know it will deepen their love of baseball, still the greatest American game in my mind."},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"I read this as a teenager in the '70's, and wrote to author Larry Ritter as part of a school assignment. He sent me back an autographed version of the LP, which I believe is now available on CD. Both a history and a baseball lesson. Memorable."},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"If you have even the slightest interest in the history of baseball, you must read this book! Ritter spent hours and hours interviewing the greats of the game and then was able to make these interviews come to life in this splendid piece of history. You will feel the excitement of the contests, laugh at the off field stories, and learn what it was like to be a big leaguer during the formative years of the majors.So many books using first hand accounts tend to be dry, but this book is the exception. There is not a dull moment in this book. This book sort of proves Eddie Matthews' review of modern baseball - the guys playing now may be better, but they didn't have as much fun as the guys in the old days. This book will allow you to enjoy the days gone by of the glorius grand game!"},{"Title":"The glory of their times","review":"That's what they call it. After reading it, I think they're right.

It is beautiful and original in its content and format. Players often forgotten today share their memories with us of days long gone. I also recommend the audio edition of this book.

One other reviewer already gave a big part away about the ending, and I hate when that happens!Suffice it to say it is a very fun read - I thought it was pretty entertaining up until the watermelon fight, which seemed a bit silly and unrealistic, and by the way, how can so many people hate watermelon?! I don't even know one person who doesn't like it, especially dieters. Everyone knows melons are a big help in a weight loss diet. They fill you up not out. I can see where some readers would take issue with the authors calling a size 14 and 16 \\"fat\\" - but I think it is amazing that readers can get so bent out of shape by that and take it so personally - remember it is a FICTION NOVEL - written for entertainment - 9 rolls of blubber on ones body does describe adequately an incentive to lose weight.I loved the characters, all of them, even the leechy husband she booted out on the night she won the lottery, his character was one you loved to hate. Everyone of us needs someone like Luna Mae to keep us in line, she was hysterical. I agree that it would have made a better story to develop some of the other characters, such as Curly, Luna Mae's colorful boyfriend who only shows up late in the book. Us readers wanted to know him better, but the dog, and the senior citizens helping out with the \\"weeds\\" business all added fun to the story. I enjoyed cheering Rosie on towards her goals.

Truth be told, Rosie knew the marriage was a mistake a week after their wedding but did not give up trying to make it work. Kent Bliss did not love his wife and cheated on her frequently. He fully enjoyed life on his wife's credit card. Her best friend Vickie had tried to convince her that marriage was a mistake but Rosie would not listen and the two did not speak for three years. She and Vickie had co-founded a business together, making unique arrangements out of the local native weeds they found in and around Savannah. Once Kent was out of the house, Rosie became determined to lose her extra weight and prove him wrong. Kent called her all sorts of names for a woman a size 14. Rosie had dreams of being a size 8. This gets into a tricky area of what is a person's ideal weight. Jack her trainer reminds Rosie what's important is inside. Rosie on a whim decides to buy a lottery ticket and hits the jackpot. Her friends question whether she will give Kent a part of the winnings. Shallow Kent is determined to find out where she hid the ticket and breaks into her house twice.

The characters were so wonderful, I wanted to jump into the book and be friends with them all (well, except for Kent). I loved the part about Martha and the tree and swing, so sweet.

The least she could have done was look up some facts and tried to make this heroine's \\"weight problem\\" a little believable.

Words are far too cheap to describe how badly I detested this book.

Their emotions turned on a dime, and they did complete life-changes from one chapter to the next. The dueling plotlines - from the main character's speedy weight loss and perfunctory slips to what to do with a winning lottery ticket - rang false and made-up to me.There were also too many distracting subplots to even care about, and the gratuitous mysticism was ludicrous.In the future, I will not feel any kind of obligation to waste my time reading another Fern Daniels book."},{"Title":"Pretty Woman: A Novel","review":"I got to page 13 before I did something I've never, ever done before in my long life of reading - I threw this book away."},{"Title":"Pretty Woman: A Novel","review":"In Savannah, Georgia Vickie Williams warned her best friend and business partner Rosie Gardener not to marry the philandering Kent Bliss.

She asks him to be home for their anniversary dinner, but he gives her a lame excuse. Rosie has had it with Kent. She takes his name off of everything and when he finally comes home she kicks him out. Rosie is beginning to regain her self esteem when she runs into Vickie, who is back in town following the death of Adeline. They hug and pick up the friendship as if nothing happened. Meanwhile Rosie obtains a physical fitness trainer widow Jack Silver and has won the three hundred plus million dollar lottery, but refuses to acknowledge her victory if Kent gets even a cent. Kent knows she won and plans to take it all.Though Rosie makes the weight loss seem too easy (the easy is putting it on), fans will enjoy her retaking control of her life with the help of friends. Rosie is the focus of the story line as she gains courage to finally confront her errors. Although Kent is unhinged when he blames her for his total fall from grace, contemporary fans will enjoy seeing him receive his comeuppance even if the story line seems too simplistic.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Pretty Woman: A Novel","review":"This reviewer would hazard a guess, bourne out by previous reviews here, that author Fern Michaels offends the very reader base for whom she writes \\"Pretty Woman,\\" a very predictable bit of beach reading romantic fluff wherein the reader knows from the get-go that the heroine is going to do the ugly-duckling-into-beautiful-swan thing and get the guy.

I am amazed that this caliber of writing is considered worthy of print! There are several things that bother me about this book. For one thing, there is a severe lack of character development. To be honest, I have 90 more pages to go before I finish the book, and yet I do not in any way feel an ounce of affection for Rosie. She is whiny and demanding. There was no effort made to develop believable chemistry between her and Jack. As a matter of fact, most of their interactions have been merely glossed over after the fact. We are told that there exists a spark between them, but I want to read about longing glances or unintentional touches--the build-up is what makes a great romance novel. Sadly, there is none of that here. Also, the dialouge is atrocious. No one speaks like that! It is very distracting!I guess the thing that bothers me the most about this book is that it doesn't know what it wants to be--a romance novel? A friendship story? A mystery? Self-help perhaps? It would appear that Fern Michaels wants it to be all of the above, but in the process has made a jumbled mess that does justice to none of them. She would have been much smarter to leave many of the peripheral characters (including Vickie Winters) out of the story. It wouldn't have made it a 5-star novel, but it would have been a heck of a lot shorter, and that alone would make it immensely more readable."},{"Title":"Pretty Woman: A Novel","review":"When picking up this novel at my local bookstore, I was excited to get to reading it after an enticing description. Rosie is a character that many people can relate to, obese, low self esteem. And as the villian, Kent was deliciously bad. I read anxiously as to what was going to happen to these characters.But in the end, I was very dissappointed. Maybe I'm idealistic, but the sudden, and I mean sudden change of heart by Kent gave me whiplash. I wanted for him \\"to get what's coming to him\\" and have the heroin triumphant and rub it in his face. Also, Vickie, Rosie's best friend has such a minor role in this novel. The character of Luna was hysterical to me.Over all it was a dissappointing ending, but a very easy read. Maybe good for the beach.But hey, it's only my opinion."},{"Title":"Pretty Woman: A Novel","review":"About this book:Rosie Garderner and her best friend Vickie Winters were extremely close but when Vickie, who only wanted the best for her friend, tries to tell Rosie the man she is about to marry is a loser, things go very bad, so bad they quit speaking. Rosie finally realizes, after three years, that Vickie was right. She throws her husband, Kent, out. Unfortunately the next day she finds she had purchased a winning lottery ticket, one worth $302 million! How can she keep Kent's hands off the money? How does she rebuild her self-esteem? How does she move on?Rosie reconnects with Vicki and starts on a new life by hiring a trainer to help her lose weight and shape up!.My take:While listening to the book, the first thing I noticed is the author had no clue as to what size and weight woman wears what dress size. I realized this when Rosie admitted being 25 pounds heavier than Vicki but Rosie wore a size 14 while Vickie wore a size 6. Really? I would think any woman would know that, for smaller sizes, each size translate to about 15 pounds difference. It made me wonder if Fern is a woman or not. And a size 14 to 16 has nine rolls of fat? Really?Beyond this, the plot is okay. Rosie gets in shape, maybe a little too fast, and competes in a triathlon against her husband. Every divorced woman's dream is to best the creep who made her life miserable. (Same for a divorced husband, I suspect.)I liked this book and found it entertaining. I especially enjoyed Vickie and wished that she had more of a role in this book. The story does move in an uneven pace where some things make sense when and how they happen, while other things happen too fast or without enough background to support the action, Anyone who likes light romance, may well enjoy this."},{"Title":"Martial Arts Are Not Just for Kicking Butt: An Anthology of Writing on Martial Arts","review":"north atlantic's latest martial arts anthology _martial arts are not just for kicking butt..._ is great reading for anybody with an interest in martial arts. all sorts of people, from trained martial artists to historians seeking a better understanding of the roots of this noble tradition, will find what they're looking for in this comprehesion volume. even those who do not intend to practice the martial arts, but seek the wisdom of its teachings, all the same, will benefit from reading it! the editors do an incredible job of bringing together essays that are both informative and entertaining."},{"Title":"Martial Arts Are Not Just for Kicking Butt: An Anthology of Writing on Martial Arts","review":"This incredible anthology contains some of the very best martial arts writings of the twentieth century.

The book uses lots of colour, is fascinating to go through even after you have read it. It has some helpful tourist information as to hotels, shops, restaurants, but is not a primary source for booking reservations information. If you have any interest in this area or these people, this is a great book to have for a really good price. It is a treat to look at."},{"Title":"Route of the Mayas (Knopf Guides)","review":"Lots of informative text and splendid pictures make this portable guide well worth its relatively modest price. The book deals with almost every aspect of both ancient and modern-day Maya life, as well as with practical travel information. I have been through La Ruta Maya on five different trips and am a fan of travel literature on Central America, but I still learned many new things from this book, especially about present-day Maya practices. There are a few typos, but still, it's perfect for actual or armchair travel to La Ruta Maya."},{"Title":"Route of the Mayas (Knopf Guides)","review":"This is simply a spectacular accompaniment for anyone who is planning, preparing for, in the midst of, or who has returned from a trip to the Mayan regions; particularly Guatemala and southern Mexico (i.e. Chiapas and Yucatan), though also Belize. It is also a wonderful book for an armchair traveler or reader interested in these regions and their setting, history, and culture.Though the book is practical enough to fit in a handbag or larger pocket, the design is elegant and can easily serve as a coffee-table book. The paper, printing, and layout are lush and lavish, and chock full of useful photographs, and illustrations. There are several sections that fold out, and the book has a cloth bookmark built in. It is simply a beautiful book, especially for a travel book.The focus of the book is on the sort of deep background information which enhances understanding but isn't essential for getting around. The 50 pages or so of \\"practical information\\" at the back are useful enough to think about planning a trip - the calendar of local festivals and events is particularly useful - but overall this section is not adequate for planning or logistics of travel across the wide region covered. You will want to supplement it with a more ordinary and up-to-date tour book. But the value-added in this volume is incredible, and is not the sort of information that will go out of date any time soon.Approximately the first half of the book is taken up with general historical, cultural, and contextual detail focusing on the region (with a particular emphasis on things Mayan). Chapters include Nature, History, The Maya Today, Mayan Textiles, Architecture, and the region as seen by both artists and writers. Here the book really shines. The sections on history and architecture provide a foundation for archeological sites. However, the 40+ pages covering The Maya Today and textiles really make the book provide wonderful enrichment for day-to-day travel. The colorful and thoughtful illustrations and photographs, combined with a keen author's eye to understanding the connections between past and present, add essential meaning to what visitors see as they head through these places.The second half of the book is focused on the regions and places that a traveler is likely to visit. The topics covered are similar to the first half, but focus a bit more on the particulars of the region, including illustrative sections on topography, rich photographs and discussion for particularly important sites.One practical note: Amazon currently (11/10) lists this book as being published in 1995. The copy I bought from Amazon (in 2003) lists the book as being \\"Completely updated and revised in 2003.\\" Comparing the 2003 edition with the edition on Amazon (i.e. the Table of Contents and Index), the only differences appear to be the cover and the small \\"practical information\\" section in the back. Since that's not the strength of the book, I'd be really surprised if a reader would go wrong with any edition of this treasure, provided they supplemented it with a more practical guidebook."},{"Title":"Route of the Mayas (Knopf Guides)","review":"I love this book.

The printed editions have pictures, which this Kindle edition and other e-book versions do not have. The printed edition has 96 pages, the Kindle edition has 1182 locations, so it can easily be read in one evening.This book takes you back to the city of Bombay (nowadays officially called 'Mumbai'), 100 years ago. The first 19 stories in this book were first published as a series of essays in the 'Times of India', the 20th story was added in the second edition, this story was first published in the 'Bombay Gazette'. These stories show you a lot about social life and customs of Bombay in the early 1900's; it tells about religious practices of the many different religions in town, the culture practices, and places that the author visited. In describing his observations the author gives a lot of background information. There are also a few stories about real people from Bombay and some myths in this book. It is wellwritten and interesting, I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in India or in history. At the botom of this review I will copy a few lines from the second story as a sample.It was written by Stephen Meredith Edwardes, who had worked as a a Government official in Bombay.

The setting: Amboseli National Park, Kenya. This is, however, much more than a simple story. Throughout, Altmann engages the reader with his elegant analysis - rich with ecological detail - of the costs and benefits primates must negotiate in their daily pursuit of requisite nutrients and energy. Baboons are exemplary eclectic omnivores; still, as Altmann quotes, \\"there is no such thing as a free lunch.\\" Bearing this in mind, he sets out to evaluate the balancing act baboons must achieve in maximizing nutrient intake, while at the same time minimizing toxic accumulation of plant secondary metabolites.At the outset, Altmann describes what the baboons ate, how they ate it, and what foods they avoided altogether during the study period (1975-1976). He then identifies what baboons should eat. A foraging strategy is an ultimate endpoint, achieved via an array of potential tactical routes. Altmann evaluates both the feeding tactics and the eclectic foraging strategy of his young baboons by identifying the degree to which they deviate from an optimum model of adaptive feeding traits. The baboons' actual dietary intake is compared to the specifications of adequate and optimal diets; this is done for both an average yearling's diet, as well as on individual variance from the predicted diets.Deviations from the optimum are viewed as indicators of potential differences in reproductive fitness. Although the feeding data stem from research undertaken in the mid-1970s, Altmann takes advantage of the two succeeding decades to relate differences in juvenile diets to longevity and fitness outcomes later in life. This historical depth is particularly valuable because it tests the model by evaluating whether those baboons that come closer to the optimum as juveniles have higher fitness as adults.Altmann expands on the extreme selectivity exhibited by baboons, providing details on the toxic load, protein, carbohydrate, water content, and load of various plant species and the manner in which baboons maximize (or minimize) their intake of these food components. Finally, he assesses the anatomical and behavioral attributes that may contribute to making baboons one of the most successful and broadly distributed primate species. To complement the main body of the text, Altmann includes a series of appendices and tables in which he evaluates various methodological and definitional issues relating to calculating feeding bouts and dietary intake. Here, he presents additional detail on diet composition and the nutritional and toxic attributes of plant foods.The work's emphasis on juvenile feeding behavior is an unusual yet valuable feature. This developmental stage is often overlooked in studies of non-human primate behavior and ecology, despite the fact that this period, and the transition from a milk diet to an adult diet, are undoubtedly critical to our understanding of adult fitness and life history patterns.However, some caution is warranted: This book was not intended for the casual student of animal feeding behavior, nor for those new to optimal foraging theory. Altmann's models, food intake calculations, and feeding bout formulae are exacting, and quite abstracted from the experience of observing feeding behavior. Before embarking into this volume, non-modelers will have to review the technical terminology that necessarily accompanies Optimization Theory. In addition, I do not view the generalizations (outlined in Chapter Two) based on the relationships among body size, patch size, and dietary selectivity to be particularly illuminating. Too many exceptions to his proposed relationships can be found for such generalizations to be of much explanatory utility.Nonetheless, this book is destined to become a classic in primate feeding behavior. It is exhaustive in its breadth, a pleasure to read, and sets the standard for amalgamation of modeling theory and ecological observation."},{"Title":"Foraging for Survival: Yearling Baboons in Africa","review":"A review of this book has been published in the following journal:Houle, A.

Major firms have long favored a fundamental approach emphasizing a nuts and bolts approach to company revenues, use of capital, and innovation. Scores of fundamental analysts closely follow individual sectors of the economy, scour SEC filings, and comment on daily developments pertaining to individual companies. Meanwhile a smaller cadre of 'technicians' churn out charts, graphs, and statistics that follow the ebb and flow of investor capital. Recently two well known full service brokerage firms decimated their already small contingent of technical analysts and another firm let go their star technician.Academic studies on the efficiency of the markets to digest news and quickly reset the market value of securities have long questioned the value of Wall Street analysts to forecast future prices. If news is unpredictable, by definition, and the prices of securities adjust immediately, what is the point of a forecast. These studies have been particularly harsh on technical analysis. Technical analysis may not have helped its cause with a coded language of triple tops, head and shoulders patterns, Fibonnaci retracements, etc. It all begins to sound more like the Occult than analysis. This book blows away a lot of the smoke.Tom Dorsey has given us a straight forward (if somewhat breathless) introduction to his method of technical analysis. His X and O charts record trends of buying (demand) and selling (supply) in the market. It is this dynamic imbalance, he contends, that is the primary determinant of value in the marketplace. The tendency for these trends to repeat over time represents the psychology of investors to buy or sell at critical junctures. For Dorsey fundamental analysis is useful in determining what company stocks should be owned. Then it is the role of the technician to determine when to buy and sell. Fundamental analysis identifies good companies. Technical analysis identifies good stocks. Good companies do things well. Good stocks make investors money.The value of Dorsey's work is to help investors find sectors of the economy and securities that may be due for a reversal of fortune after extended periods of under or out performance. The bottom line is that he has developed a useful toolkit for the investor. A look at his Dynamic Asset Level Investing model [12/2004 - not in this 2001 book] that recommends areas to allocate assets (small capitalization stocks, Latin America, natural resources, energy, etc.) seems prescient just about a year later. Using ETFs (exchange traded funds) to develop a portfolio based on Dorsey's model would have inevitably led investors to a chunk of the best returns available for the period. This book should certainly be read by all investors who want an introduction to technical analysis and a better understanding of one of Wall Street's savviest minds. You may not want to be on the other side of too many of Tom Dorsey's trades!"},{"Title":"Point and Figure Charting: The Essential Application for Forecasting and Tracking Market Prices, 2nd Edition (A Marketplace Book)","review":"If you do not already know Point and Figure (P&amp;F) charting, you cannot learn it from this book. The author's explanations of how to do it often use terms that he has not yet explained, and key concepts are often forgotten until later applications in which they are mentioned parenthetically. For example, when a stock is moving down, P&amp;F charting requires you to track the daily low. Dorsey does not mention this detail for pages, rather he simply keeps stating you should see whether &quot;the stock moved lower.&quot; Only much later does he mention that &quot;moving lower&quot; means the low for the day, rather than the close, moved lower--meaning that until that point all his examples make no sense and the charts cannot be correlated to the text.Another example: his initial explanation contains a flowchart. This flowchart is confused. For example, one box, which is not a decision box, has a single exit arrow marked &quot;yes.&quot; Leaving you to wonder, is the &quot;yes&quot; spurious, or does the box contain an incorrect explanation?And on it goes.Consistent with the above, the author explains easy points in elaborate detail, while brushing over difficult topics.Avoid this book."},{"Title":"Point and Figure Charting: The Essential Application for Forecasting and Tracking Market Prices, 2nd Edition (A Marketplace Book)","review":"Tom Dorsey's book provides the most important elements in learning Point &amp; Figure (P&amp;F) Charting, also known as Dow Theory. Yes, fundamental analysis is important in determing what stock to buy (or short), but P&amp;F tells one *when* to buy or not, and provides the probablity of a certain gain or loss based on certain patterns. Dorsey also applies the same methods to chart technical attributes of the entire market as well as sectors, making the salient point that sector and market trends are responsible for 80% of moves in a particular stock's price. P&amp;F is a much more useful theory in today's age - it's not graph paper like once upon a time - though with Dorsey's clear and thorough explanation of techniques one could perform it by hand either daily or via readily available data.After reading Dorsey's first edition and observing the market I wouldn't touch a stock without consulting or constructing the P&amp;F chart. The second edition builds on the first.

Long before the advent of modern computers, a simple method of guaging the relative strength of these forces and their impact on prices was devised. This method, called Point and Figure charting, is the classic origin of all technical analysis and is just as valid today as it was in the 19th century. Tom Dorsey is the foremost modern proponent of this near-forgotten discipline and takes the reader step by step through its methods and application. There is no complex mathematics in this method, just simple measurement and a lot of common sense. Think of the markets as a seashore. There are lots of distracting waves and spray, but what ultimately matters is whether the tide is coming in or going out. Point and Figure charting focuses on the tidal forces that drive prices while ignoring the spray.

Mr. Dorsey's book is first rate. I read this book when it was first released, and I find myself using it as a reference tool quite often. Mr. Dorsey's explanation of the NYSE Bullish Percent chart and how to use it and the Relative Strength charts in conjuntion with your stock selection is as plainly presented as if you were having a conversation with the man.When you consider that he also has weekly podcasts that help explain how the P&F; charts are used, I consider Mr. Dorsey to be THE authority on the subject of Point&Figure; charting and this book is an excellent source for learning how to start P&F; analysis."},{"Title":"Point and Figure Charting: The Essential Application for Forecasting and Tracking Market Prices, 2nd Edition (A Marketplace Book)","review":"I found the investment strategy proposed in this book made a lot of sense. However, I doubt Tom's strategy would be very useful for short term traders. This is because you may have to wait months before making a decision to buy or sell. I was also really disappointed that his investment strategy requires you to chart every single stock on the New York stock exchange on a daily basis. Individual investors don't have the time to do this if they have a daytime job. Thus, the book is really a subtle promotion for his company which is an investment advisory firm using his strategy or for a company called Chartcraft which provides this kind of charting for a monthly fee. Finally, the book is dated. It is 5 years old and downplays the importance of NASDAQ stocks."},{"Title":"Point and Figure Charting: The Essential Application for Forecasting and Tracking Market Prices, 2nd Edition (A Marketplace Book)","review":"With a plethora of investment books circulating the world these days, finding a book that simply described supply and demand and trading techniques was a God send. Tom Dorsey's book &quot;Point and Figure Charting&quot; was like a breath of fresh air. I quickly understood how supply and demand worked and how stocks were influenced by market risk and direction. I had been operating under the impression that stocks moved on their own, an impression that proved wrong and that was reflected painfully in my portfolio. Point and Figure Charting is in itself very &quot;user friendly&quot;. Tom Dorsey presents it in such a way that the average investor can understand and easily grasp the Point and Figure Charting concept. At no time did I feel it was over my head or that I'd never understand the concept. By the time I finished the book, I understood how the market worked. I keep the book by my side constantly and refer to it as an investment bible. The chapter on the Point and Figure indicators alone is invaluable. Once you know where the market is going, the real market not the Dow, it makes selecting stocks incredibly easy. My trading and portfolio averages have increased over 50% by reading this book and by applying everything I've learned. It may be too much to say I've found the Holy Grail in investing with Tom Dorsey's book....but I have proof in my portfolio and for me, that is all I need.

There are no more than 3 pages in this book regarding Commodities, and only insofar as they are underlying indicators for stocks that rely on commodity prices. So, if you want to learn about Point and Figure Charting, this is an ok book. There may be others out there that are better, as that aspect of this book served its purpose for me....which is P&F Charting APPEARS to be an excellent methodology for Trend analysis (big picture) for Futures/Commodities.

This is a style of investing where you look first at the market, then the sector, and finally the stock itself. This answers the question of when to buy, whereas fundamental analysis answers the question of what to buy.It's true that much of this information is available elsewhere, a good deal of it on the dorseywright web page, but not all of it. This book is a great book for putting the pieces together in a sensible way.This is a book for longer term investors, not day traders or swing traders who like to be in and out of a stock in a few days or a week.This book goes very well with Pring's how to select stocks using technical analysis; this method is easier to use, and more sensible in my opinion, but elements of both fit very well together.Note: This book has nothing to do with dow theory, which is concerned with identifying the primary trend of the market as represented by the DJIA. In this theory, the DJTA is used for confirmation. This has nothing to do with point &amp; figure charting; indeed, Dow Theory, while credited to Charles Dow, was actually first put together by S.A. Nelson in the book The ABCs of Stock Speculation.

One can learn Point and Figure charting for free at the dorseywright dot com web site (just look for the point n figure university link at the bottom of the home page). Dorsey knows his stuff but the more easily bored one is, the more one will find this book aimless and boring. Point and Figure is superior to bar and candlestick charts because it records meaningful market movement while ignoring the small stuff. Another Point and Figure book, published in the 1930s by de Viller (?), is also very hard to read and not worthy of buying.

Dorsey explains all the concepts in a very clear and concise manner. It is very easy to understand but don't let that mislead you into thinking that if it's so easy why isn't everyone doing it. That's the beauty of it. Not too many people know about this. It is uncanny how profitable your investing can become once you employ this methodology. I have been using the methods described in this book and I have been very successful. LAST YEAR (1999) I HAD A RETURN OF 61% WHILE ONLY BEING 70% INVESTED! Talk about low risk and HIGH RETURN! Of course you need to employ some fundamental analysis in conjuction with this technical analysis but I know I couldn't have had such a great year without P &amp; F (point and figure). NO, it wasn't luck. I was invested in as many as 30 stocks and I had exposure in 15 different sectors while having no more than 2 or 3 high flying stocks at one time. Speaking of high flying stocks (like QCOM of which I didn't even have any positions in!), point and figure charting will give you the ability to invest in these wild ones while stomaching the volatility. All in all this book and more importantly this knowledge is the HOLY GRAIL for me!"},{"Title":"Point and Figure Charting: The Essential Application for Forecasting and Tracking Market Prices, 2nd Edition (A Marketplace Book)","review":"Like many other people, in the last 15 years I made a pile of money only to give it all back. Clearly, the odds of winning were stacked against me. I neglected to study business in my college career so I decided to read up as on equity analysis. I've been through 30 plus highly-rated books and thousands of magazines and web sites, and Dorsey is at the top. His books are well written and understandable; his tools and methods are the best.His method is based on supply and demand. If institutions and individual investors favor the stock or sector, the demand will cause the price to rise; if they disfavor the stock or sector, the supply of stock to sell will outweigh the demand and the price will sink. He charts the supply and demand tug of war for stocks, funds, sectors and the market. You can find a stock chart and fundamental data anywhere. He gives you comprehensive and powerful tools no one else has.I took advantage of the 3 week free trial to his website, and reviewed the archives of their &quot;from the analyst&quot; daily market report. They do get you into and out of the market and sectors in a timely fashion. Last year, in May 2001, they explained to their clients that the market was overbought and due for a correction. They would have had you out until September 24th, when they told you the market was extremely oversold to a degree only seen 14 times since 1955. Dorsey's tools and methods give you the courage to buy at bottoms and sell near tops.Dorsey and crew follow a top-down approach: market, sector, fundamentals, and technicals. He tells you to build a watch list of fundamentally sound stocks, then wait until the time is right to buy (and sell). I am truly surprised that more people have not heard of him. I think the deep-seated bias against technical analysis is the reason. Dorsey does not skip the fundamentals, he joins them to the technical picture of supply and demand, and overbought and oversold levels, to help you stack the odds in your favor.My highest recommendation is this: I bought this book for my dear old dad. He cannot afford to take another financial hit, and I think Dorsey's analysis and tools will help him."},{"Title":"Point and Figure Charting: The Essential Application for Forecasting and Tracking Market Prices, 2nd Edition (A Marketplace Book)","review":"This Dorsey book on P&amp;F is actually a 10 star rating to me but I just got five to give.Say 5 stars for bringing me into a new but expuisite technical analysis technique. P&amp;F is dealing with net-moves of prices only - anything inbetween is what Dorsey calls &quot;noise&quot;. So, comparing P&amp;F to standard analysis like based on Stochastik, ROC, RSI, etc., a typical P&amp;F-buy or sell signal is sort of a yell at you to move yourself. As P&amp;F signals are that compelling, it should be a good idea to use P&amp;F in combination with standard techniques like a short term RSI, for instance, to make yourself detect first upcoming divergences and beeing aware of what might be showing up by P&amp;F.Anyways, I changed my complete analysis directives, rebuilding everything over and put it all around Point &amp; Figure after having read Tom Dorsey.The 5 stars virtually remaining to me I give for the master\`s GREAT ATTITUDE of teaching! I've been busy with technical analysis for quite a while by now, having read a lot of books on it. The Dorsey system to me is (may be next to Pring's KST) the best I ever got known about.

Tom's illustrations and straightforward writing style puts this difficult subject within this reader's grasp. His ability to describe chart patterns in tactical detail helps to better understand the right time to buy and ... just as important ... the right time to sell!Heady analysts and gunslingers may take offense to the easy flow of this book. Tom's energetic style and subtle wit makes learning this technique a breeze. This book can help private investors to take the reins of their own financial chariots. It gets down.

The book serves its purpose very well!"},{"Title":"Point and Figure Charting: The Essential Application for Forecasting and Tracking Market Prices, 2nd Edition (A Marketplace Book)","review":"Even though I would rate this book as highly recommended to anyone seriously interested in reducing the risks inherent in investing, this book is not a quick easy read. With a financial services background spanning 20+ years, I had to read this book several times to understand and appreciate it's true value.In my opinion, the greatest value of this book is found in the larger picture, beyond the &quot;how to&quot; technical talk or author's writing style. Here, Dorsey teaches why the price change in stocks actually has very little to do with company fundamentals, and expouses a very particular investment philosophy - an investment philosophy predicated upon the belief that the lowest common denominator in price change of all kind (including stock price movement) is Nature's own Law of Supply and Demand.That concept is supported by others, including the Nobel Prize winning &quot;Modern Portfolio Theory&quot;, which suggests that only about 20% of the cause of price movement in stocks is a direct result of a company's fundamentals, while as much as 80% can be attributed to investor expectations - or said another way, supply and demand.For example, if we were all totally logical and could separate our emotions from our investment decisions, then fundamental analysis - the determination of price based on future earnings - would work magnificently. And since we would all have the same completely logical expectations, prices would only change when quarterly reports or relevant news was released. Investors would be seeking &quot;overlooked&quot; fundamental data in an effort to find undervalued securities.However, if prices are based on investor expectations, then knowing what a security should sell for (i.e., fundamental analysis) becomes less important than knowing what other investors expect it to sell for. That's not to say that knowing what a security should sell for isn't important - it is. But, as we all know firsthand, human emotions are not easily quantifiable or predictable, and this guarantees an element of unpredictability in security prices.In order to be consistently successful, investors must find a way to effectively identify, measure and manage the intangible or \\"emotional\\" (and often times, irrational!) risk component present in all financial markets. So how does this book help investors? The Point and Figure Method of charting stock prices was created by Charles Dow in the late 1800's as a way to accurately identify and measure supply and demand - and therefore risk unrelated to fundamentals - in the financial markets.Although there is little written resource material such as this book on Point &amp; Figure Methodology, there are now several Point &amp; Figure related resource sites available for free in the Internet."},{"Title":"Point and Figure Charting: The Essential Application for Forecasting and Tracking Market Prices, 2nd Edition (A Marketplace Book)","review":"Tom Dorsey's book speaks to the rest of us. Those of us who have been dazzled and confused with the so-called professional's version of the stock market now have a sound plan with which to invest in our futures. Mr. Dorsey speaks in terms that are easily understood by the average investor. Point &amp; Figure Analysis is a comfortable and understandable approach in this day of candles, tea leaves, UFO's and all the other disciplines that the Professionals attempt to confuse and bewilder us with. Let's face it, if supply and demand are the True indicators of market direction, why do we need all the big boys to sell us their &quot;stock of the day&quot; with their fat commissions. Mr. Dorsey's book instills the kind of confidence in the reader that comes when you know what to do and when to do it. He keeps it simple and you feel as if an endearing uncle is sharing his life's worth of learning and discovery with you. The various market indicators are explained thoroughly, giving us an understanding of the probabilities of success or failure with each and every trade or position we hold. Not losing money and/or limiting losses is just as rewarding as making money, perhaps even more so, and knowing when to bail out of a position is very enlightening. I highly recommend this book as it has changed the way I view the market and my goals and understanding of it's movement and trends. Since learning Point &amp; Figure charting from Mr. Dorsey's book, I could not imagine entering a position without this knowledge.

Once the book arrived, I couldn't put it down!! So much information in one place. Used in conjunction with this website: [...], you can't miss!! I purchased the 1999 version, so Mr. Dorsey's references to creating your own charts is certainly dated.As far as the content is concerned, he's \\"spot on\\" with his teaching methods. I don't mind the redundant explanations. It helps drive his points home. Approach the information slowly. You'll find that continually going back to refresh your understanding is quite okay. Another suggestion would be to find a website that will allow you to virtual trade without using \\"real money\\". This helps in testing your understanding of the X's and O's without risking our portfolio.

Mr. Dorsey, frankly, is an embarassment as an author. That said, for the patient reader capable of plugging the many gaps in Mr. Dorsey's thinking there is a fair amount of good information here.

Not as old as some universities (Harvard was founded in 1636), certainly not as big (City University of New York - CUNY with some 450,000 students is about a hundred times bigger). The USMA has produced a series of graduates that have achieved fame far beyond the size or age of the school: Eisenhower, Grant and Lee, and many, many more. Read any history of the United States, and numerous references.As part of the 200 year celebration, the invited a series of essays to be written covering a broad range of topics including the Academy's role in developing officer professionalism, its influence on the careers of distinguished graduates, institutional challenges and changes, the experiences of women and minorities at West Point, and the evolution of the academic curriculum. These have been collected together in this volume that points equally to the past and the future."},{"Title":"West Point: Two Centuries and Beyond","review":"I bought this book because my (real) name is in it! After I received it, I read most of it and it's a wonderful history of West Point. There are so many people associated with the academy that I had never realized.For anybody planning to go to a military school, this is the book to read.Why was I mentioned in the book? Because the writer talked about Hollywood films that had West Point as a subject. And since I wrote practically all of the reviews for the Internet site, The Films of Doris Day, he read my review of \\"The West Point Story\\" and referenced it. Don't be surprised that I bought the book, I buy all books that have my name in them!"},{"Title":"Ibn Saud: King by Conquest","review":"In 1939, a young American paleontologist, Nestor Sander, met and shook hands with one of the most remarkable, and perhaps least acknowledged, national leaders of the twentieth century, Abdul Aziz ibn Abdur Rahman as Saud, the king of Saudi Arabia. For the next fifty years, as Mr. Sander pursued a distinguished career in petroleum paleontology, he remained so impressed by that encounter that he immersed himself in the history of the Desert King. He studied the nine biographies of Ibn Saud in English as well as the two other accounts in French and was struck by certain inconsistencies among them. This result is this fine book, Ibn Saud: King by Conquest.Divided into three parts, the author blends the precision of scientific survey and analysis with the delightful humanism of a wise, well-traveled man of letters. The first section is a stirring account of the King's rise to power concluding with the Yemen War in 1934. The second section, The Saudi State, begins with the Standard Oil of California concession in 1933 and goes on to detail the impact that oil wealth made on the nation in Ibn Saud's lifetime. In the third part, The Man, Nestor Sander writes a qualitative and honest appreciation of King Abdul Aziz that is both disciplined and personal.Lavished with archival portraits of many of the main characters of the period, a generous addendum of biographies that range from Captain Shakespear to Mubarak ibn Subah as Subah, the founder of modern Kuwait, and perhaps the most comprehensive set of maps that any reader could ever desire, including a 15 by 18 inch color map inset into the end paper, this book is essential reading for anyone interested in the King and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia - then or now."},{"Title":"Ibn Saud: King by Conquest","review":"The study of history divides itself in numerous \\"schools,\\" and one of the divisions is between the \\"Big Man\\" (and almost invariably, they were men) school, and the one that examines the social and technological factors which change the lives of the masses of people, and which downplays the significance of the actions of any one individual. Only the true adherents in each school would dismiss aspects of the other. Clearly the author has written a \\"Big Man\\" history, on Ibn Saud, who should be placed with Abraham Lincoln, Winston Churchill, Lenin, Mao Tse-Tung, and others who actions have altered the course of history. The author does not speculate on how the world would be a different place if Ibn Saud had been killed in attempting to regain his patrimony by retaking Riyadh in 1902. But it is hard to imagine \\"social forces\\" throwing up another man who had the grit, determination, diplomatic and political skills to unify the always fractious tribes in the vast majority of the Arabian Peninsula.Nestor Sander is not a professional scholar, and probably the better for it. His profession was geology, and he worked primarily in the oil industry, traveling the world, including Saudi Arabia. He has the \\"real world\\" experience that helps overcome some of the foibles and fads extant in the \\"Ivory Tower.\\" Deep in retirement, when most men are content to putter, as it were, on the golf course, he fulfilled an ambition dating from 1939, when he shook Ibn Saud's hand, and wanted to learn more about who he actually was. He has read virtually all that has been written on the man, in three languages, English, French and German; reading the bibliography is humbling. I regret that a brief biography of Sander's was not included in the book.Sander attempts to reconcile the various accounts of Ibn Saud's life, judiciously balancing the known bias of the authors, and has produced a very workable biography, written in a no-nonsense, staccato style. Of particular interest to me were the early days of the Al Saud family, and his own life prior to 1902, including the time he spent with the Murrah; information and accounts not readily available elsewhere. Sander divides his biography into three parts: one that recounts mainly the military campaigns, and diplomatic maneuvering that led to the creation of the Kingdom; a second which examines his function as a government, and far more so than even Louis XIV, he was indeed the state; and the third examines what was known of him as a man: flaws, foibles, genius and essential humanity.Insights, well there were a delightful few. During my time in Saudi Arabia I had to deal with a few Saudis who would invariably try to do four things at once: conduct a conversation in the office, one on the telephone, read the paper and sign some documents. Invariably it would take three times as long as if they had done each task sequentially. Obviously they were trying to emulate Ibn Saud, who could apparently multi-task efficiently (p. 103). Also, the vignette concerning the meeting between Ibn Saud and Churchill, in which the later confused the former with Husain - the ultimate diplomatic faux pas.I do disagree with the author's brief account of the always contentious issue of the creation of Israel, on page 123.In addition to the main biography, there is a valuable, substantial addenda which includes briefer bios on some of the main characters in Ibn Saud's life, including: Mubarak ibn Suab as Sabah (the Emir of Kuwait), Sir Percy Cox, Husain ibn Ali (his archrival, the Sharif of Mecca), William Shakespear, Harry St. John Philby, Faisal ibn Abdul Aziz (tellingly, perhaps, not Saud) and Abdullah Suleiman (the Finance Minister), as well as sections on the tribes of Arabia, and the very early Saud family history. There are also numerous photographs of the principals, and maps.There are over 60 \\"Middle East Study Centers\\" at American universities. This should be an essential work in their programs, aiding in the understanding of one of the more important countries in the region, the very heartland of both oil and Islam. And for the numerous Saudi students studying in the United States, as well as other countries - this book provides an excellent account of the individual driving force behind the creation of your country. Almost certainly, it is the very best biography of Ibn Saud that we will ever have."},{"Title":"Ibn Saud: King by Conquest","review":"The difference from the hard cover book is the absence of color and a hard cover. But the text and illustrations, including a freestanding map are all here. This book is more than a retelling of Ibn Saud's life. It provides information on the history of his family and describes his contemporaries , both friend and enemy; explains many details of customs in the desert; points out his great ability as a statesman and ends with a discussion of his character, his foibles and his great faith in God. I think it is well-worth $20 and shipping charges."},{"Title":"Ibn Saud: King by Conquest","review":"I was drawn to this book because I know the author and his life story. He has produced a well-written, very detailed account of Saudi history. If you want to understand the current Near East situation read this book. Not only is the chronology carefully observed, the in-depth analysis of the important individuals is revealing. Many books have been written about these subjects by Arab authors as well as others of several countries. I believe this one is the one to read."},{"Title":"Ibn Saud: King by Conquest","review":"To understand today's events and situations, it is important to discover their origins in history. Not ancient history, but the events which transpired just before our present time.Why, for example, is there someone named Osama bin Laden who plots attacks against the West, and who are these Islamic militants who have declared a jihad on the Western Civilization? Why do people from the region of Arabia have such a proclivity for hijacking airplanes and blowing things up? (The vast majority of the September 11, 2001 hijackers were Saudis.) The answers are in this book, which is not as important as a biography of this potentate of an obscure and backward region of sand and oil, as it is as the story of the area's people and their traditions.Here we learn that for many centuries the main occupation of rival tribes was raiding each other's camps and stealing their camels. This blood sport was considered as normal as the Ohio State - Michigan rivalry is today. A major source of income for the region was hijacking and looting caravans which traveled up to Syria and down to the ocean.As Ibn Saud gained power over lesser chieftains, he was prescient enough to realize that his conquest would amount to naught if he presided over a kingdom which was in a state of constant internal war, so, being a pious man himself, he organized the marauding bands of thieves, and converted them to the fundamentalist teachings of Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab an-Najdi (1703-1792). The united brigands, now called the Ikhwan and numbering 150,000, were licensed to murder and pillage, but only on infidels or those who were deemed not sufficiently pious, and this Wahhabi tradition of jihad thus continues to this day.The book's closing chapters comprise a series of character studies of those involved in the formation of Ibn Saud's kingdom. I found the most interesting of these to be that of Harry St.John Philby, father of the notorious Kim Philby who was a Soviet mole in both the CIA and MI6. What motivated him to do such a thing? From this book it's easy to see that the apple does not fall far from the tree.\\"Ibn Saud: King by Conquest\\" is full of such fascinating tidbits, and the quality of writing is uniformly superb throughout the book.Nestor Sander, author of \\"Ibn Saud: King By Conquest,\\" died on February 11, 2012, due to complications following a traffic accident.Although he was a friend, that did not influence the enthusiasm of my review.

I'm glad I chose this Signet Classic version. You know what \\"Paradise Lost\\" is about, or you wouldn't be here, so I won't summarize what has become an essential piece of epic poetry. \\"Samson Agonistes\\" is a beautiful \\"minor epic\\" styled after the ancient Greek tragedies, while \\"Lycidas\\" is...well, it's confusing. But exquisitely worded, and truly enjoyable nonetheless.Le Comte's annotations are helpful, though they sometimes get in the way of the reading (in many spots, half the page is devoted to footnotes). Cifelli's introductions are easy to read (I've come across some introductions to pieces of literature that are harder to read than the literature itself, so these intros were a relief), and even helpful in understanding the texts. The fact of the matter is this: unless you are an academic schooled in interpreting Biblical poetry, you're gonna have a hard time with \\"Paradise Lost\\" (Cifelli echoes these remarks, so I'm not alone here). However, trust me, it is worth it. If you are a student (as am I), or simply an interested reader (as I also am), you will love \\"Paradise Lost\\"--not for its simplicity, but for its complexity, for its beauty.

Edward Le Comte performs an invaluable job of editing, providing copious annotations which give an encyclopedic overview of Milton's Biblical, Classical, theological, and personal allusions throughout &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; as well as &quot;Samson Agonistes&quot; and &quot;Lycidas&quot;, which are the other poems of the title. The back-cover write-up gets it right-- here is the indispensable peer of Vergil, Dante, Homer. These are poetic monuments, cathedrals of sound and sense that are bound to exhilarate anyone who gives them even passing attention: Milton's reverence, rage, and sensuality burn through each line. Never mind even Harold Bloom's protestations to the contrary-- the poetry of the English tradition revolves around a double star, and this is Shakespeare's giant twin in greatness."},{"Title":"Paradise lost and other poems (Classics Club library)","review":"Of Man's first disobedience and the fruitOf that forbidden tree whose mortal tasteBrought death into the world and all our woe,With loss of Eden, till on greater ManRestore us and regain the blissful seatSing, Heavenly Muse...Not a lot people know that 'Paradise Lost' has as a much lesser known companion piece 'Paradise Regained'; of course, it was true during Milton's time as it is today that the more harrowing and juicy the story, the better it will likely be remembered and received.This is not to cast any aspersion on this great poem, however. It has been called, with some justification, the greatest English epic poem. The line above, the first lines of the first book of the poem, is typical of the style throughout the epic, in vocabulary and syntax, in allusiveness. The word order tends toward the Latinate, with the object coming first and the verb coming after.Milton follows many classical examples by personifying characters such as Death, Chaos, Mammon, and Sin. These characters interact with the more traditional Christian characters of Adam, Eve, Satan, various angels, and God. He takes as his basis the basic biblical text of the creation and fall of humanity (thus, 'Paradise Lost'), which has taken such hold in the English-speaking world that many images have attained in the popular mind an almost biblical truth to them (in much the same way that popular images of Hell owe much to Dante's Inferno). The text of Genesis was very much in vogue in the mid-1600s (much as it is today) and Paradise Lost attained an almost instant acclaim.John Milton was an English cleric, a protestant who nonetheless had a great affinity for catholic Italy, and this duality of interests shows in much of his creative writing as well as his religious tracts. Milton was nicknamed 'the divorcer' in his early career for writing a pamphlet that supported various civil liberties, including the right to obtain a civil divorce on the grounds of incompatibility, a very unpopular view for the day. Milton held a diplomatic post under the Commonwealth, and wrote defenses of the governments action, including the right of people to depose and dispose of a bad king.Paradise Lost has a certain oral-epic quality to it, and for good reason. Milton lost his eyesight in 1652, and thus had to dictate the poem to several different assistants. Though influenced heavily by the likes of Virgil, Homer, and Dante, he differentiated himself in style and substance by concentrating on more humanist elements.Say first -- for Heaven hides nothing from thy view,Nor the deep tract of Hell -- say first what causeMoved our grand Parents, in that happy state,Favoured of Heaven so highly, to fall offFrom their Creator and transgress his will,For one restraint, lords of the world besides?Milton drops us from the beginning into the midst of the action, for the story is well known already, and proceeds during the course of the books (Milton's original had 10, but the traditional epic had 12 books, so some editions broke books VII and X into two books each) to both push the action forward and to give developing background -- how Satan came to be in Hell, after the war in heaven a description that includes perhaps the currently-most-famous line:Here we may reign secure, and in my choiceTo reign is worth ambition though in hell:Better to reign in hell, that serve in heav'n.(Impress your friends by knowing that this comes from Book I, lines 261-263 of Paradise Lost, rather than a Star Trek episode!)The imagery of warfare and ambition in the angels, God's wisdom and power and wrath, the very human characterisations of Adam and Eve, and the development beyond Eden make a very compelling story, done with such grace of language that makes this a true classic for the ages. The magnificence of creation, the darkness and empty despair of hell, the manipulativeness of evil and the corruptible innocence of humanity all come through as classic themes. The final books of the epic recount a history of humanity, now sinful, as Paradise has been lost, a history in tune with typical Renaissance renderings, which also, in Milton's religious convictions, will lead to the eventual destruction of this world and a new creation.A great work that takes some effort to comprehend, but yields great rewards for those who stay the course.This collection includes Samson Agonistes, one of the best Greek-style tragedies done in English, based on the biblical character of Samson. It also includes the poem Lycidas, a pastoral poem written specifically for the death of Edward King, a Cambridge student who died by drowning, but which includes a greater sense of universal longing and lost hope.Edward le Comte has provided a worthwhile introduction to the poems and a brief biography of Milton."},{"Title":"Paradise lost and other poems (Classics Club library)","review":"I purchased this book as a gift for my new son-in-law who collects classic literary works that would look great on the book shelf!

(It was probably true before TMMM, but that was before my time.) Architecture, implying an architect, is a requirement for any major piece of software.I can agree with Albin only to a point: architecture is not implementation, analysis, or software engineering. It's different even from &quot;design&quot;, as the word is usually used. An architect really does a different job than other members of a software team (but the architect may design and implement, also).That said, I didn't quite make out how to go about -- training someone as a software architect,- developing a sound and appropriate architecture,- measuring its success in objective and repeatable ways,- making it a part of the project plan and documentation, or- preserving it across generations of maintenance.Most importantly, I did not see any discussion of adapting an existing architecture to new needs, or of extending an archtecture beyond its original bounds. Typical software spends 10% of it's life in design and implementation, and 90% in maintenance. The initial 10% is the fun part. I have real reservations about authors who choose not to discuss the other 90% of the problem.The book has value to the extent that it opens the topic for discussion. Too often, though, it confuses the skill of architecture with the tools of an architect - sort of like looking at a pencil drawing by Rembrandt and saying &quot;Wow, if I get a pencil like his, I'll be able to draw like that too.&quot;I've been looking for books and articles about software architecture. This one has some value, but I'm still looking."},{"Title":"The Art of Software Architecture: Design Methods and Techniques (Wiley Application Development Series)","review":"Much of this introduction is lost in a profusion of nouns. How useful is this: &quot;In commercial enterprise software development, it is not always possible to produce a single-system context model, but rather may require several exemplar contexts&quot;?

The author gives a well-researched overview of:* Software architecture concepts and architectural descriptions* Architectural lifecycles, views, and representations* Architectural quality, quality models and their attributes* Architectural styles, patterns, frameworks, and design principles* Software architecture and design methods, domains, models, and metamodels* Software design fundamentals, philosophy, general heuristics* Software architectural quality, complexity, modularity, and other aspects/concernsAll in all, The Art of Software Architecture looks to be a very informative book that covers the basics of software architecture, design, and quality that I wish all software developers knew. I was surprised by the omission of working with legacy systems, product-line/family architectures and model-driven architecture (MDA).Software evolution and maintenance tends to be about 80% of the lifetime of a software project. Issues of dealing with legacy systems, reworking dysfunctional or decaying architectures, interfacing and integrating with other legacy systems, managing to create and sustain survivable architectures amidst the real world of ever-changing volatile requirements with aggressive deadlines and unreasonable expectations, all seem largely underemphasized for this reviewer's tastes. Important non-technical issues of leadership and communication, coordinating with project and program management, and playing the role of architecture &quot;salesman&quot; to management and stakeholders aren't addressed strongly enough. This is enough to prevent the book from serving as a complete and practical &quot;how to&quot; guide or &quot;survival guide&quot;.The book comprises fourteen chapters, summarized below ...Chapter 1 provides an introduction to software architecture that discusses software development evolution and software engineering fundamentals along with the basic elements of software architecture. It touches on the subjects of reusability, general and special purpose programming languages, and modeling languages and notations. Basic software architectural elements presented include components, connectors, qualities, architectural descriptions, types of architecture, and the difference between architecture and design methodologies.Chapter 2 covers the product lifecycle including a RUP-like management view (inception, elaboration, and construction); a waterfall-like engineering view (requirements analysis, specification, design, implementation, testing, deployment and maintenance); an engineering design view of the specification of information, principles, layout, and production; and an architectural view of predesign, domain analysis, schematic design, development and build.Chapter 3 delves into the architecture design process of understanding the problem, identifying design elements and their relationships, defining system context, identifying modules, describing components and connectors, and evaluating and transforming the architecture.Chapter 4 introduces basics of software architectural design, including the Vitruvian triad of function, form, and fabrication, and their interaction with planning, interaction and architectural design, &quot;cognitive friction&quot; and application architecture. It then discusses overall design activities and tasks, the psychology and philosophy of design, and general methodology of analysis, abstraction, synthesis and general heuristics such as: persistent questions, negation, forward steps, backward steps, factorization, and systematic variation.Chapter 5 is devoted to complexity and modularity. It covers granularity and context, modules and their import/export, coupling, cohesion, design elements and rules, the task structure matrix, and modular operators of: splitting, substituting, augmenting, excluding, inversion, and porting.Chapter 6 is about models and knowledge representation and talks about the use and purpose of models, the roles that models play, problem and solution domain models, functional/behavioral models, information/data models, and nonfunctional models (e.g. performance models). It segues nicely into chapter 7, which is concerned with architectural representations and architecture description languages.Chapter 8 is all about quality models and quality attributes for process and product quality and quality requirements. It mentions issues of measuring quality attributes and system knowledge, barriers to achieving quality, and some common quality attribute misunderstandings. Quality attributes covered include functionality, interoperability, security, performance, resource efficiency, modifiability, availability, reliability, recoverability, usability and portability.Chapter 9 dives into principles of architectural design and applying systems thinking. It discusses design &quot;operators&quot; such as decomposition (including identifying functional components, composition/aggregation, and component communication), replication, compression, abstraction (including virtual machines and adaptability), resource sharing, and functional design strategies of self-monitoring, recovery, and instrumentation.Chapter 10 builds upon the previous chapter by increasing the scale/scope of view of design principles to the application of architectural patterns and architectural styles. It discusses their activation models and quality attributes for such styles and briefly describes the common architectural styles and paradigms associated with dataflow systems, call-and-return systems, independent components, virtual machines, and repositories.Chapter 11 introduces metamodels and reference models. It describes the three-layer model of knowledge representation, the Seeheim and Arch/Slinky reference models, enterprise application reference models, and technology stacks and architectural layers. It goes on to describe a fundamental metamodel for describing software components and then gives an example of content management system reference models.Chapters 12 and 13 discuss architectural descriptions, and common architectural frameworks (sets of architectural views). They touch on how to identify stakeholders, select and specify viewpoints, view interdependence and traceability, recording view inconsistencies and capturing rationale for the viewpoints and the overall architecture. This is followed by advice on applying architectural descriptions to both new and existing systems and performing an architectural assessment. Some of the different architectural frameworks described are: Kruchten's 4+1 views model of architecture (which UML and RUP use), and the reference model for open and distributed processing. The discussion for each framework and its viewpoints includes the stakeholders and concerns addressed, and the construction of t he architectural view representing the viewpoints of the corresponding set of stakeholders.Chapter 14 finishes the book by tackling the subject of software architecture quality: its importance, how to improve it, how to evaluate it, and how to assess modifiability and performance. It discusses the use of a systematic design process, understanding the right problem with a system-level view of the requirements and differentiating between requirements and design. The section on assessing software architectures talks about scenarios reifying nonfunctional requirements and the role of an architectural description, before moving on the subjects of evaluation, modifiability, and performance."},{"Title":"The Art of Software Architecture: Design Methods and Techniques (Wiley Application Development Series)","review":"This book uses real world examples and practical advice coupled with academic rigor.

Don't buy this crapfest!!!!"},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"Well, Ms. MacAlister is at again and she's given us a hot new entry in the life of Aisling Grey. This book is great, maybe a smidge less explosive than You Slay Me, the first book in the series, but still addictive.Aisling is a Gaurdian, a person born to use magic to seal portals to Hell which are spread throughout the world. She's new to this, infact she only found out about the entirety of the \\"Otherworld\\" about a month ago and has decided to study up at a Guardian convention being held in Budapest. She figures she can kill two birds with one stone and agrees to courrier another antiquity for her uncle, just as in the previous book.Many roadblocks will stand in her way though and one of them will be her impossible to live with smolderingly sexy wyvern mate ( or dragon wanna be husband for those of you not in the know). Drake Vireo, leader of the green dragons, is sex in scales( but yummier in his human form) and Aisling can't help her attraction to him even though there are definite unresolved issues between them.Also trying to muck up her field trip are thieves, the three othe dragon wyvern's, a bakers dozen naked & horny Incubi, the Otherworld heirarchy, her pet demon Jim in Newfie dog form nearly dying, several murders, that little business of the challenge with Drake in the previous book, & a partridge in a pear tree. (OK the last was an exageration, but there is a pigeon)[...]. I was thrilled to see that she plans atleast 6 more books to Aislings story. Yeah! HOWEVER, I am left steaming and nearly irate as I found out that there will be A YEAR BETWEEN RELEASE DATES! A YEAR! Come on! You've made us obsessed with your writing, we have money, give it to us now! I can understand MAYBE 6 months, she is a busy auther, but an entire year! And the next full book in her Dark One's Series won't be out till March 2006!!!! Come on, if you think we are going to wait with this much enthuisiasm for that long you're crazier than some of your characters! (And not in the fun way we love!)"},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"Well, Katie Mac is at it again. What do they feed her? I don't know of any writer who is as prolific or as much fun. Humor is hard to write, harder for reader to often catch. What has one person laughing hysterically, will see another stone-faced. Well, a few get stone-faced when they read Katie Macalister. They complains about the story line being unbelievable or a farce. Well, not for one moment do I think Ms. Macalister every expected anyone to take her books serious. She wants you to read for simple pleasure and to laugh till your ribs hurt. As usual, Katie Mac delivers with both - simple pleasures and laughing till your ribs hurt. People can huff and say I won't buy her again because she is silly. Well, guess what, we do buy her for that very reason. She is a FUN read. Period. She is not offering earthshaking discussions on the perils of life. She is taking you an a rollercoaster ride into - well, who knows where she will take us next! I always arrive at the end feeling happy for having enjoyed myself so!I utterly adored Aisling Grey in You Slay Me. I mean who would not adore her boyfriend Drake who is a dragon...hum wyvern? I think that Drake is a dragon...hum...wyvern was a clue the book was not going to be serious! The next in the series of dragon tales...wyvern tales...sees Aisling fulfilling her role as Guardian. It's not easy being a person suddenly in charge of portals straight to Hell. With these new demanding chores for her Guardian role, she thinks it wise to bone up and decides to check up on the necessary skills by checking in to a Guardian convention held in Budapest (and here we thought it was just another Trekkie...hum..Trekker gathering!). Her former job was curious for her uncle, what landed her in the lap of Drake in the first tale. Since she is heading in the right direction she agrees to courier another item of antiquity. Okay, Aisling, didn't you learn about this in You Slay Me?Thankfully, not!!The romance between Drake Vireo and Aisling is still in WIP stage, since this book follows only a month after You Slay Me. Drake for those who missed the first book (Go read the first book!!!) is the leader of the Green Dragons. However sexy Drake is in, whether in Dragon form or human form, Aisling is till adjusting to the idea of having a dragon...hum...wyvern fora steady beau.There are various things causing the road to romance to be bumpy, such as thieves other's of Drakes Ilk on the prowl, murder and mayhem.There are more books in the Aisling series coming, though not as fast as Katie Mac usually puts them out. Hey, ease up people. The woman has been doing a book a month (well, all most) for nearly two years. Let her have a well earned vacation.I will be there waiting for more wyvern tales when they arrive. This made the New York Times Best Sellers list. It only shows the popularity of this fascinating and fun writer."},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"Aisling Grey: \\"Courier\\", \\"Demon Lord\\", \\"Dragon's Mate\\" and \\"Guardian\\", what an interesting combination of career choices but that's who Aisling is and believe me Aisling's experiencing a few difficulties being all four.In this second outing, Aisling is once again delivering an item to a client in Budapest and while there will also be attending a conference for the \\"GODTAM\\", i.e., \\"Guardians, Oracles, Diviners, Theurgist and Mages\\" for the Otherworld or as they say \\"L'au-del&agrave;\\", so that she can horn her skills as a Guardian by hopefully becoming an apprentice to a full-fledged Guardian as she was meant to be.Upon Aisling's arrival to Budapest she runs into the one person she would most rather not see, the man she left behind once before as she could not handle being a Demon's Mate, the \\"dragon\\" who sets her heart, mind and body on fire, Drake Vireo. Little does Aisling know but Drake's presence in Budapest is not a coincidence, he's there to claim his mate, by any means necessary and not necessarily to Aisling's liking.During Aisling's visit at the conference, other \\"Guardians\\" start turning up dead and once again the fingers of justice point to Aisling as the culprit and she must once again prove her innocence or be banded from what she is most determined to become and what she is meant to be, a true \\"Guardian\\" which she had denied herself by hiding what she is after the accidental death of her friend mentioned in \\"You Slay Me\\". With almost no training Aisling makes a few wrong turns but she always finds her way back and with her underlying talents, which she has yet to realize, she is unquestionably going to be one hell of a \\"Guardian\\" (actually her skills are already beyond some) one day.Although Drake understands what being a Guardian means to Aisling, he deems it as \\"foolish\\". Drake feels he and his \\"Sept\\" should be uppermost in her mind and in her life and therein lies the conflict. Compromise can be a difficult dish to serve but the way I see it, if he doesn't compromise just a little, he will lose Aisling and that I cannot foresee happening as the big picture is Drake loves Aisling no matter what she does or where she goes, he's gonna be a part of her life, so he will have to find a way around this. Can't wait to see how he resolves this.Katie MacAlister has once again weaved an intriguing story of magic, lust, love and betrayal and I loved \\"Fire Me Up\\" as much as, if not more than, \\"You Slay Me\\" and I am impatiently waiting for the release of \\"Blow Me Down\\" as I can't wait to see what happens next to my favorite couple, Aisling and Drake and of course, my favorite demon, Jim.Ms. MacAlister keep this novels coming, as in my eyes you can do no wrong!!!!"},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"After receiving this book I ran into the only private place I could find and eagerly tore into this book. BRAVO Katie, I think that this book was better than the last one. The characters were better fleshed out in this one and we got to meet some new characters. Jim, was very funny in this one and Rene was sweet and as helpful as ever. Unfortunatlly Aisling and Drake ended this book on a sour note,but I'm sure that Katie will be getting back together. I highly recommend this series and will be eagerly awaiting for the next one in this fantastic series."},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"I enjoyed You Slay Me, the first part of the Aisling Grey, Guardian Novels, and looked forward to reading Fire Me Up. This book was a real treat and I had a difficult time putting it down. It is not as good as You Slay Me, but that is not saying much because this one is a keeper as well. Aisling has accepted her status as a Guardian, which is why she travels to Budapest to search for the perfect mentor. She is also there to deliver a sacred amulet to a homeless hermit. All she has to do is search for him at every park in Budapest. Talk about finding a needle in a haystack! Aisling also comes face to face with Drake Vireo -- wyvern of the green dragons and the bane of her existence -- who is more determined to make her his mate for life than ever. Things get more complicated for Aisling when the amulet she carries around has some strange effects on mortal men and summons gorgeous incubi. Her search for a mentor isn't going so well either, for each potential mentor has turned up dead. She has to put up with all of that and carry around the smart-mouth dog-slash-demon Jim. There are various fun twists throughout the novel.I like the fact that Aisling is a feisty, independent, I-am-in-charge-of-my-own-life type of heroine. She does get a bit over the top and downright irritating at times, especially when she banters and bickers with Jim and Drake respectively, but I admire the fact that she is a no-nonsense, independent woman. Her brazen personality gets in the way of surrendering to gorgeous, sexy Drake -- who is the proverbial alpha male. Their scenes together are amazing. MacAlister created two characters that have a chemistry that is almost palpable. Drake is incredibly hot; the perfect anti-hero for this sort of series. I hope we will see more of him in future installments. Jim is hilarious as usual. I do love his sharp lines and wonderful quips. MacAlister has succeeded in creating an irritating, albeit lovable sidekick. The humor in this offering exceeds the one in You Slay Me and indeed all of the other Katie MacAlister novels I have read thus far. Her writing style reminds me of MaryJanice Davidson's work in that she blends romance, comedy, action and paranormal elements together quite well. All in all, Fire Me Up is an excellent follow-up to You Slay Me. The intro to this series was awesome and the second book has guaranteed a faithful and avid reader of the Aisling Grey world in me. It is not necessary for me to say that I recommend this book, but I nevertheless do so most highly."},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"It's official! Katie MacAlister is a total tease! I hadn't thought it was possible to improve upon \\"You slay me\\" but this book totally hit me sideways.Oh, the fireworks! The chemistry! The utter pizzazz! This book is an embodiment of the phrase \\"addictive read\\"! I haven't been so dedicated to a book like I was to this one!Wow! Words cannot fully express just how fun, sexy, and exhilarating reading this book was!My word? Get a copy, read it, and never get rid of it! On cold days, I go back to my Aisling Grays and review them, they'll make you laugh out loud even when you try so hard not to.I absolutely, positively couldn't wait till the sequel."},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"I really like this series and can't wait for the next book. Aisling is a predictable but adorable character. This is a fun book that had me laughing out loud on the subway. I really like all her pals and romantic prospects. It is a twist on the whole paranormal world. MacAlister's books are really funny and a bit sexy."},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"This was a great follow-up book that left me ready for more of Aisling Grey. From learning more about guardians and dragonsto solving a new mystery. Aisling is a great character, we get to find out more of who she is and what she as a guardian can do,her relationship with Drake gets more exiting and her demon/dog had me laughing to the end. I can't wait for the next novel."},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"If you liked the first Guardian novel then you should like this one too since they are the same book. Aisling is delivering an object, someone tries to steal it, twice. People start getting dead, she is blamed, and must be the one to solve the crimes, OR ELSE! She's NOT the dragon's mate but does him a few times anyway....wait, which book AM I reading?The mystery here is why I have read two of these dreadful books. Thank God for libraries so I'm just wasting time and not my money. Aisling is still irritating, immature, and an idiot waiting to make a mess happen. I have no idea why Drake wants her, there isn't a single bit of honest dialog between them that would indicate a growing understanding of each other. They just have this inexplicable desire to have firey sex since she was MADE JUST FOR HIM. Otherwise I have no doubt he would give her the boot since she is entirely more trouble than she's worth.And then there is Drake's big \\"betrayal.\\" Just a plot device to leave the lovers in a cliffhanger for the next book."},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"Aisling Grey has returned and brought sexual energy and a host of characters that are hard to resist reading about in this fabulous novel. There is more than simple sparks flying about in this book, heck, there is downright burning inferno's happening in the sexual encounters of this book. Way to go!!Also recommended: Fire In The Ice by Katlyn Stewart and Impossible by Danielle Steel"},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"I absolutely adore Katie MacAlister and her writing. The first Guardian novel, You Slay Me, had me burning. Fire Me Up was great; however, not what I expected. Although I would have loved to give the 2nd novel 5 stars, there was one major downfall--not enough romance! There were too many dilemma's and characters to really concentrate on Aisling and Drake. But what can I say? There has to be more drama left for Katie's next novels, so I guess we can't have a perfect romance right away. I was also somewhat disappointed in Aisling. Aisling needs to have more dignity and not always go running into Drake's arm. In FACT, why shouldn't Drake come running into her's? Drake obviously hasn't changed. I do hope Aisling wisens up and learns from past mistakes.Katie MacAlister, hats off to you. Cannot wait for the next novel. This doesn't mean to rush the writing; we do want another steamin'HOT novel!"},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"MacAlister is an excellent author covering a unique subjet(dragons, etc.) extremely well. This is a good read. Purchase it. This book will hold you over till the next Aisling Grey comes out.(buy her other books) Though, simply put it is not as fantastic as You Slay Me(really her best work to date)."},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"First of all. Let me say first and foremost that I love all of Katie's books. They are smart, sexy sassy and laugh out loud funny.Secondly, what some of the party pooper reviewers seem to be forgetting is that this is a Series. Relationships will progress as more of the Guardian Novels grow. Dont expect a HEA right away.Now, on for the actual review of the book.I loved it.I loved it.I loved it.The characterization was beautiful. Seeing a glimpse of the other dragon septs, and how much Drake actually cares about his sept was fantastic.I am currently trying to bribe Katie to get the next Aisling Grey book out soon. Hopefully it works."},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"I'll start by stating that I usually enjoy this author's books; they are usually quite funny. After reading the first Aisling Grey book, I was desperate to read the second. However, I found this book to be extremely disappointing. I'm sure that you'd love this book if you were into being the bottom in dominance and submission games.Our heroine, who is quickly becoming a power to be reckoned with in the occult world, turns into a weak willed ninny in this book. Obviously, this heroine is desperate to be dominated and enslaved; otherwise, she would have steered clear of this book's erstwhile hero. She throws herself, quite willingly, into the power and control of someone who is consumed with his own power and is only interested in her for hers, but he only wants her power, not her skill. Of course, if she were allowed to obtain skill, how would he be able to control her?The ninny somehow manages to blind herself to his true character, which he never really attempted to conceal, and promptly jumps into the sack with him. Then, in a fit of insanity, she permanently binds herself to this @#@!!. Go figure. Once again, the books ends with the ninny running away in a snit because she was faced with the reality of her own stupidity.The next book will probably continue this pattern. However, our ninny needs to wise up and find a spine. Maybe then she would do the reasonable thing and put out contract on her \\"mate.\\""},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"When I first picked up Katie MacAlister's YOU SLAY ME novel, I was looking for something different - which I found and enjoyed! So I decided to continue and read the second installment, FIRE ME UP, which was another good read ... Now, I am officially addicted to the Aisling Grey series!Though YOU SLAY ME was not as good as FIRE ME UP, it was still a welcomed treat. Aisling has finally accepted her role as Guardian. Her first step to fully claiming this is her travel to Budapest to search for a mentor. She also still works as a courier for her uncle, so in addition to her search, she must deliver an amulet to a homeless hermit. This means searching every park in Budapest ... sounds easy enough. To top it all off, she runs into her green wyvern Drake Vireo, and this time around he is dead set on making Aisling his mate. This turns out to be one heck of a trip.On the whole FIRE ME UP was a really good read and left me extremely excited about moving on to the next installment. I'm very interested to see how MacAlister will develop Aisling, Drake and even Jim's relationships."},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"Laugh, cry and grow with Aisling as she tries to straighten out her messy life.

God knows why.My TakeThis has to have been the stupidest heroine I have ever encountered. I kept reading because I kept hoping she would somehow, miraculously stop being such an incredible idiot! There just had to be something redeeming in this crap.She jumps in with both feet. She never listens to anyone. She gets angry when things don't go her way. Which they almost never do because she never listens to anyone. She never stops to find out what the ramifications of anything might be. She's an absolute, complete, and total moron. I haven't much respect for Drake either, because he keeps wanting to be around her.I know this isn't how I normally do a review, but I'll just become furious if I have to spend any more time with this absolute twit."},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"Drake and Aisling are so perfect together, especially when you add incubi and men throwing themselves at her. Aisling is kind of stupid and Drake is a little manipulative so of course they have a fight to end all fights!"},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"Book 2 of Katie Macalister's series that starts withYou Slay Me (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 1), this a fun, light read. I recommend reading book 1 before reading book 2 as this picks up where the other leaves off- just a month after that story took place.A little magic, a little mayhem and ton of sarcasm and humor, this is just a great series. This isn't exactly a romance- I'd call it urban fantasy that is heavy on the romance. It focuses on the same heroine and cast of characters throughout bringing a bit of magical murder mystery to a close in each book while continuing to develop the character relationships... which includes romance. HOT romance.This story is a lot of the same stuff we got in book one. Our heroine is still being introduced to the magical world around her and still struggling with her smoking hot attraction to her mate, the devilishly handsome dragon. Her demon dog Jim and serendipitous cabby friend Rene remain thick as thieves. Though the plot ends up following a path that closely mirrors the first book, the formula just works- and works well.The only issue I have with this book is that the attraction with Drake begins to develop into an actual relationship. This is a logical progression, but I don't think there is enough actual romance to justify any emotional attachment Aisling might be developing. Near as I can tell, it is all just chemistry... Really. Great. Chemistry. Fun as it is to watch them struggle both to embrace and refuse their passion, I don't actually buy the idea that they might be starting to CARE for one another. And, unfortunately, the lust seems to cloud Aisling's judgment just a little too much for her to maintain her integrity entirely.My small complaints about their romance development aside, this is a fun ride. Start to finish- pacing, humor, characters, settings and plot developments. It's a nicely balanced romp through a magical reality.

I love Jim, the demon dog. He is hilariously snarky but completely devoted to Aisling.I found things a little too convenient at times for this book. Like everyone just happens to be in a place at the same time? I found out reasonings for some of it, but others, not so much. Though I have a feeling that Rene, the cab driver, may be more then what we think.I thought that things came together in an interesting manner, but it seemed a bit too much like the previous book. Similar situations and all that garbedly goo. So that made it not as good as the first one. Jim totally makes the books worth reading, and Drake, the hottest dragon ever makes the story interesting as well.Even though things were too convenient, the story didn't take enough new turns, and Aisling was a bit annoying in her smart stupidity I still really enjoyed this book. I do look forward to continuing the series!"},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"This is the 2nd in the series and continues just a month after the first book ends.

Just your usual Laugh-out-loud MacAlister book!"},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"This book is the second book in the Aisling Gray series. Aisling seems to have some of the worst luck and a flippant tongue, which constantly gets her in trouble. There are some humorous moments and you mustn't take the novel too serious. (The details, grammar, etc. are good so don't mistake me as saying the author doesn't write well. She's just a funny writer.) The attraction between her and the wyvern (dragon lord) Drake is quite obvious. (What's not so obvious is why he puts up with her other than chemistry.) This book lacks the depth I prefer in my reading, but it's one of those quick uncomplicated books you could read just fine in an airport or with a toddler wandering around. I'm undecided as to whether or not I will purchase the next installment. The ending was rather abrupt, just as it was with the first one, with no closure. If you just think of this as a ramble and that this is just a piece of a bigger piece, you're okay. It's a fun read and will give you a pleasant respite."},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"I was waiting with baited breath for this book. When it finallycame out I read it in about 4 hours. After I finished it, I took it to my favorite used bookstore and gave it away. I would not even take a credit for it. Yes, I agree that Aisling whines. Part of it is that everyone one expects her to play by the rules but no one ever explained them to her. It was Drake'sbetrayal I could not stomach. I do not know if I will read the next one"},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"It seems that if you have a sexy alpha male and a ditzy blonde heroine, you can slack on the other areas. Sure the relationship between Aisling and Drake is hot, but it's also implausable. I'd hate to be stuck in an elevator with someone as stupid and annoying as Aisling, much less desire to spend the rest of my life with her. She heaps abuse and scorn on her man and all he stands for, betrays him, mocks his friends, and he just comes back for more.The dialogue is funny, but the characters are farfetched and implausable. Rene, the Parisan cab driver who happens to be in teh same city she's in? Implausable. The guy she has to deliver the amulet to happens to be the key to solving the second plot? Also implausable.And why is it that everyone said she \\"Was a Guardian\\" in book one, but in book two they're all busy telling her she's not one? And why does a woman who studies demons for a living know less than every single person she happens to meet? And why do talking animal sidekicks have to be so ANNOYING?If you want a hot, steamy romance, and you can stomach writers such as Sherrilyn Kenyon, this is a great book. If you want a solid paranormal fantasy, and you want a skilled writer who doesn't make amateurish shortcuts, try Charlaine Harris, Laurel Hamilton, or Kim Harrison."},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"After finishing the first in Katie MacAlister's Aisling Grey, Guardian series, \\"You Slay Me,\\" my biggest complaint was the heroine/bumbling nitwit Aisling herself. I thought \\"You Slay Me\\" was technically sound, with a fast-paced...though chaotic at times...plot that delved into a world that had some really nice glimmers of originality and a whole heck of a lot of laughs. I was counting on those aspects to pull me through my lip-curling distaste of Aisling during the second installment of the series in the hopes that I could stick it out until Aisling started to grow up and WAKE up a bit.Right up until the last chapter or two of \\"Fire Me Up,\\" book two in the series, I was intensely satisfied that they did just that. I was truly enjoying \\"Fire Me Up,\\" and was quite happy bopping along with Aisling and the lovable Jim, the mysterious Rene, the sizzling Drake, and a few other new and not-so-new faces. I thought the plot was a bit less frazzled than in the first book and the laughs were still there. Sure, I wasn't THRILLED with Aisling, she was still way too immature, unrealistic, naive, and frustrating, but she was far more palatable a character than she was in the first book, and actually had shown some growth and brief flashes of maturity.Then...much like Aisling's life every time you turn around...it sorta went to Abaddon in a hand cart. I'm not going to explain exactly what she did or said that turned me off so much, but I will say this - I sincerely hope the character learns the difference between being betrayed by someone and allowing a lack of clarification to be misleading. And if, by some miracle, she DOES grasp that concept, perhaps she could also learn just how contemptible it is to be such a bloody hypocrite and turn around and betray her own VERY CLEARLY sworn oath moments later.I'm sorry - I KNOW there are people who absolutely love Aisling and think she's fantastic. And maybe I'll be one of them eventually. I'm not now. I think she's an utterly self-absorbed and whiny child whose behavior - when viewed against the backdrop of Drake's careful political maneuverings to keep his entire species from war - seems pitifully shallow and grotesque in its gauche lack of maturity. I have absolutely no clue what Drake sees in her, actually, and that's SERIOUSLY damaging any of \\"romance\\" aspects of the plot. In fact - I'm not seeing any romance. I'm seeing some hot scenes with two characters that connect on an elemental level...not an emotional one. Drake's not without HIS flaws, either. He's stubbornly reticent on the subject of his feelings for...well...everything. Including his mate. That makes him seem unsympathetically inflexible and domineering. Not really seeing a love match there. And if I didn't dislike Aisling so much right now, that might bother me a lot more than it does. I can only hope she grows up and becomes worthy of her dragon mate, because honestly, if I were a dragon, I'd have eaten her by now."},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"This doesn't happen all that often. Usually, I enjoy a second book in a series because I got to know the characters in the first book and I'm happy to see them again, but it's usually at best just as good as the first. But as much as I loved You Slay Me, I loved Fire Me Up even more.It didn't hurt that it takes place in Budapest, the site of the most romantic weekend of my life. *sigh*Gotta say, though, I didn't leave any scorch marks on the sheets or burn up any hotel room doors when I was there.Aisling is in Budapest to attend a supernatural conference to find a Guardian to apprentice under so she can learn more about her powers, along with her demon-in-dog-form Jim, who provides help and comic relief. Her cabbie from Paris, Rene, shows up with his usual savoir faire; there's a man who keeps predicting, correctly, all sorts of humiliating things that will happen to her; she's invaded by incubi; and she teams up with professional virgin Tiffany.... and then of course there's Drake Vireo, green wyvern, sexy and exasperating in pretty much equal measures--and he's extremely sexy --who's in town for some delicate negotiations between the various dragon septs.I really don't want to go into any details, because if I start pointing out the good bits, I'll end up giving away the entire story.Fire Me Up is hilarious, hot, and hard to put down. And it wins the award for \\"most creative use of fire in a sex scene.\\" Just truly a joy to read."},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"I have to preface this review by saying I love chick-lit. It is my guilty pleasure. And Katie MacAllister delivers in the first book in her Aisling Grey, Guardian series.The main character, Aisling is acting as a courier, carrying a medieval artifact to a buyer in Paris. In short order, she discovers a body, meets an extremely good looking hunk of man, and has her artifact stolen. Oh, and the body? The purchaser of her artifact, strung up in a ritual to destroy a demon. How does Aisling know that fact? She's an amateur demon-lore scholar.After she is released by the police, Aisling gets her second introduction to the Otherworld, and it changes what she knows, about herself, her life and the universe in general.This book is well written, easy to read and fast paced. The Aisling, Jim and Rene's dialogue is interesting, which some of the other dialogue is a bit more formulaic. Drake can be forgiven for being such a perfect example of man (at least physically) by chalking it up to the fact that this book is found in the romance section of most bookstores. I do appreciate the fact that regardless of how romantic or good in bed the main man is, the main character, Aisling, stands on her own and listens to her head instead of her...uh...loins..."},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"Let me start by warning those of you who have never read anything by Katie that you should not, under any circumstances, read her books in a libary, on an airplane, or during children's nap time. Everyone around you will HATE you, shoot you dirty looks, and throw temper tantrums. But I enjoyed every minute of hyperventilating and guffawing until I was blue in the face. Never EVER has an author made me laugh so much!!!Okay, so about Fire Me Up...Giddy up, Aisling! She's a demon lord, aspiring Guardian, and wyvern's mate, and she is so REAL. And Drake...let's just say I need a drool bib like Jim's whenever he's in the picture. But what's really great about Drake and Aisling is that it's easy to really fall in love with both of them, no matter what mistakes they make in their quest to finally get together once and for all. There are so many moments they share that really pull on the old heart strings, and that's something readers will really love about this series.I am going to be antsy until November when the next book in the series comes out, I read on Katie's website that she's going to do 8 of them. Wowza! I don't know if I (or the general public) can handle it, but I'm more than willing to find out.Happy Reading!"},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"I got this book along with the first Aisling Grey novel (You Slay Me), and I could not put them down until I'd finished them both (took me all of 2 days). Katie Macalister is now officially my favorite author. I found myself laughing out loud and rooting for her clumbsy, blabbering, and less than perfect heroine until the end. Jim, the demon dog is adorable and Drake is perfectly yummy! I can't wait for the sequels!"},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"I love Katie MacAllister's books. They're funny, smart, sexy--but not too overpowering. \\"You Slay Me\\" the prequel to this novel was the first of MacAllister's work that I've read and probably will not be my last. If I could give this one a 4 and a half star rating, I would. It's worth that, but no way am I going to rate it as high as \\"You Slay Me.\\"While I enjoyed \\"FIre Me Up\\" I can't say I was as enthused as I was about its predecessor. MacAllister did successfully run a romance, mystery, and comedy at the same time in \\"You Slay Me.\\"\\"Fire Me Up\\" had many of the same elements working. Of course, Aisling shows up in Hungary to discover that Drake is there. It's almost too easy that they get back together with all the problems they had and too predictable what happened.The mystery didn't really get in full swing til about page 200, which was a long setup. I guessed pretty accurately whodunit, so she wasn't as tricky as \\"You Slay Me.\\"Probably my biggest complaint was that Jim got sidelined for a good chunk of the book. I'll admit right now, I love that demon dog. He makes the series for me."},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"Another great book with Aisling and her cast of crazy friends, demon dogs, etc. Fast, fun read."},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"It seems that MacAlister was so enamoured with the plot she created for \\"You Slay Me\\" that she decided to use the same plot again. Either that, or she just wanted to give the audience exactly what they craved for.Aisling goes to Europe to deliver an artifact, she meets Rene (the taxi driver), she learns weird phrases in the local language, she meets Drake, Aisling and Drake do not have hot sex because she thinks (correctly, it seems) that he wants to rule her life, another sexy dragon wants her for his mate, someone tries to steal the artifact, Aisling and Drake finally have hot sex, people begin to die, Aisling gets arrested by the police...All this interspersed with the same poop&pee; jokes (regarding Jim) that we heard in the first book.I would have liked the book regardless, since it is well written, if she had taken the time to develop the characters a bit more. Sadly, none of the characters seem to have climbed out of their litte stereotype boxes. Aisling is still unsure and clumsy. Drake is still manipulative, demanding and domineering (Type A romance hero). Sam's role is still to irritate Aisling, as well as be a liability to her when the plot needs it. Rene still helps Aisling out with transportation and language. The sex is still boringly perfect - it lives its own life, without any input from the characters' personalities.One extra star for the competent writing. That's all. Too bad, because the author is good - it could have been an excellent book."},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"I have read the entire series. And, I'm pre-ordered on book #4. The books all seem to be so tongue in cheek...all of them are just good clean fun reading. Nothing serious...but, not fluff either. Aisling seems to stumble through her life. She falls from crisis to crisis. But, always seems to come out on top. Some of her solutions are hilarious.I recommend this author. Everything so far has been a blast. I hope she keeps it up. Ya gotta love the dog...I've got two that are almost like him..minus the magic."},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"This one has a real mystery element to it. It is still the silly fun read you expect from Katie. Her books always leave me wanting more. They are easy to read. This one is no exception. Buy the whole series at once to make life easier."},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"The young lady certainly is learning how to multi task. Can hardly wait to see what other adventures she finds herself in."},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"Aisling, Drake, and Jim are all back, and Aisling is searching for a trainer for her Guardian duties. Romance, drama, and intrigue, as well as the hilarious troubles that Aisling creates by challenging Drake."},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"This selection in the Aisling Grey series was worth waiting for. I hope the next in the series isn't far behind. Aisling Grey seems to always get herself in a fix, with Drake and more murders, she is right there in the thick of it. I can't wait to see were Katie is going to take these two in the next book."},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"Wow, double wow. This is the 2nd installment in the Aisling Grey Guardian series. I have to say I enjoyed this one even more the 1st book. The ongoing, tension-filled relationship between Aisling and Drake gets even more intense. How Aisling keeps up with everything that going on is something to admire. All I can say is that Ms. MacAlister has done another brilliant job in creating an intriguing story with lots of magic, lust, romance and betrayal. Plus can't forget Jim the demon (in dog form) is still hilarious as ever.I highly recommend this series."},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"I loved it. Aisling Grey's relationship evolves with Drake but the passion stays red hot."},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"This is absolutely one of the funnies books I have ever read. You simply can't miss with this one. One minute you are reading like a normal person and the next you are bent in half trying not to tinkle on youself!!!"},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"While I enjoyed the book, I have to say that it was nowhere near as entertaining as the first one. I have a problem when characters break up for what I consider stupid reasons. I know that the author needs to keep them apart, but surely there's a better way to keep them butting heads without having them break up for stupid reasons. Asling's whining really got on my nerves, the plot is exactly the same, and you learn absolutely nothing more about the characters. The only thing that they will make me buy the next in the series is if I see that Asling has done some growing up. If not, I won't waste my money. The book itself is enjoyable, but if you read the first one \\"You Slay Me\\" then you will be disappointed."},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"Aisling is back again, along with her pet Newfie Jim, trying to do her best as an antiques courier/Guardian/Keeper of the Gates to Hell but it is not getting any easier.This book is full of laugh out loud moments and leaves you thirsting for the next installment. Drake is back, sexier than ever, and the fireworks between himself and Aisling are only getting hotter. Set in Hungary we get to see another European country through our heroine's eyes as she runs from one adventure to another.For anyone who enjoyed the first book, this one does not disappoint and I highly recommend it. It's perfect for those miserable days when everything has gone wrong and you just need cheering up. If this book does not improve your mood, nothing will."},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"The second installment in the Aisling Grey, Gaurdian series by Katie MacAlister is even better than the first one (You Slay Me). The ongoing, tension-filled relationship between Aisling and Drake gets more interesting this time around -- and more complicated. Aisling's efforts to distance herself from Drake and the other dragons only seem to draw her even more into their midst, creating havoc in her quest to figure out exactly what it is that she's supposed to be doing as a Guardian. This, of course, is so much fun to witness as a reader!Throw in Jim the Demon and other hilarious sidekicks, and you've got vintage Katie MacAlister with a heroine who becomes more fleshed-out in this second book -- leaving the door wide open for Aisling's continued struggles for as well against the dragons and her own destiny."},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"Geez I love these books, If you'd read the first one (You Slay Me) then you know what I mean. Poor Aisling Grey having left the studly dragon Drake who of course is in human form, and also her mate. Travels to Hungary to attend a otherworldly convention. So who else shows up! Thats right Drake. This story moves very quickly with alot of romance, mystery, and murder. Aisling is up to her neck in dragon politics when she finally ok's the mate thing with Drake. I can hardly wait for the next Aisling Grey novel to see what kind of trouble Aisling can get into. Drake as usual is yummy."},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"Customers who brought Fire Me Up, also:. Purchased You Slay Me.

If you read the first book in this series, (if you want to call it a series, this book could be a stand alone) it picks up from where it left off, and is just as fun to read. the only reason I didn't give it a 5 star because it's almost like re-run so far of the first book. But like I mentioned I only read the first 100 pages. Very entertaining, I can't wait to get back to it."},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"Coming off of my \\"You Slay Me\\" high, I was giddy and ready to dive into the next book. It really doesn't move the plot along or develop much between the main characters. However, one must put into consideration that there is at least eight books in the series and things cannot just be tied up like loose ends in book two.My favourite things about this book: the incubus, all the dragon sects getting together, the introduction of the mysterious gabriel, and Aisling getting caught up in yet another murder.Like a previous reviewer has said, Aisling did whine a lot in this book and I truly hopes she sucks it up a bit more in book three because after all, she is not a child. One part I really hated was when she got Drake mixed up with the authorities, or at least tried to. I would have not been surprised if he bit her head off. She was so implusive and annoying for doing that. HELLO. It's the OtherWorld. Gah.Anyway, I look forward to seeing how Renee, the taxi driver who is still unfazed by Otherworldlyness, comes to play in all of this and if perhaps Aisling's ex-husband might make an appearance... I would like to get more about the fellow to whom she must send alimony checks! hilarious!Also, I got to add. I would LOVE to have Tiffany's profession. Wish I could get paid for being one."},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"Well, the whole cast is back once more--even Renee, the fun-loving and sweet taxi driver from France makes an appearance or two in this second addition to the Aisling Grey novels!As I'm sure you have read, Aisling is delivering an amulet to an elusive hermit in Budhapest. The amulet, which she eventually wears for safe-keeping, has the power to draw some veeeeeery interesting characters her way, as it makes her irresistable to the opposite sex. One man even breaks down into sobs after Aisling rejects him, and several incubi (read: sex genies) terrorize her at night with their prescences.Drake is more developed in this book as a character, and he and Aisling undergo a series of steps in their relationship, both forward and backward, while Aisling tries her best to find a teacher. When the women interviewing her for an apprentice position begin to turn up dead and the finger is once more pointed at Aisling, she's got a little over twenty-four hours to find the killers--along the way dealing with the punishment the green dragon sect decides to mete out and the sudden disappearance of her smart-mouth sidekick demon puppy!"},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"Katie MacAlister does the impossible again, by writing a book that is even better than the last. She takes the loose ends of You Slay Me and magically weaves another tale rich in detail, humor and edge of your seat suspense. Jim is back in all of his glory, Drake and Aisling burn up the pages. The other dragons are introduced. Another satisfying read which while answering some questions, raises twice as many others leaving the reader in keen anticipation of Book # 3. Another winner to place on your keeper shelf."},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"I really liked this book, but you must read \\"You Slay Me\\" first so you know the history between Drake and Aisling. These are such cute stories and very witty. They are not boring in the least and very pleasant reads. These were my first introduction to Katie MacAlister and I am very pleased with her writing. So, for those of you who like funny, sexy romps about mystical creatures and humans with special powers, this is a GREAT set of books!"},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"I loved this book! Love the whole series! Katie MacAlister really pulls you into this world and makes you feel what the characters feel. I couldn't put it down, it was the best mix of mystery, fantasy, and romance with a dash of who-done-it all wrapped up in humor! I was laughing out loud during the whole book and would recommend this book to any adult looking for a book to read. There's something for everyone in these."},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"Aisling Grey is back with her tongue-in-cheek wit, her loyal, but sardonic Newfoundland pet demon (yes, the same kind of dog as Nana in Peter Pan) and her Otherworld acquaintances. I loved reading every word of Aisling's latest escapades (in and out of the bed) as she hones her talent for stumbling into trouble and causing mayhem for the entire Other World.This time Aisling finds herself at a guardian convention in Budapest, where she is searching for a mentor and delivering an amulet to a hermit for her uncle. It comes as no surprise (to the reader) that soon Drake shows up with all his wicked dragon charm. Aisling then finds herself forced to solve the murder of two guardians, while trying to resolve the \\"mate\\" issue, find a mentor and shake off the love sick human males who find her irresistible due to the amulet she is trying to deliver.The laughs never stop. I loved the scenes with the incubi. The descriptions were a hoot and their bemoaning of being misunderstood went in a direction I NEVER would have imagined. Of course, the scorching, sexy Drake makes his appearance in Aisling's life and the well, done, erotic moments made me blush, pause and say, \\"Oh my!\\" several times, before I promptly devoured the rest of the sinfully delish scene.If you worry too much about character motives, plot devices, believable circumstances, look elsewhere. This is a fun, whimsical romp, about a girl, her dog and her dragon that requires no thought other than to enjoy it for what it is."},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"If you have read the other reviews, you have some idea of the story in this book and I won't rehash it. I found Katie MacAlister's first Aisling Grey book (You Slay Me) somewhat humorous...humorous enough to order the second to see what she'd be up to next. I have never laughed so hard reading a book. Katie MacAlister has a wicked sense of humor and is able to write these crazy scenarios so well that you can picture the ridiculous situations perfectly.I loved it, ordered the next book and highly recommend Fire Me Up to anyone looking for more than a little chuckle."},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"I just want to say that I am vastly dissapointed. The first book in Katie MacAllister's Aisling Grey series was great. This book started out great too... but went downhill.First of all, a lot of logic is absent in Fire Me Up. Aisling Grey is attending an Otherworld Convention in Hungary so she can meet a Guardian mentor. Drake Vireo, Aisling's gorgeous but manipulative dragon mate, also happens to be in Hungary (his homeland) for some peace negotiations. Logic was actually sound there.*** Spoilers *** Spoilers *** Spoilers ***At the convention, two Guardians die of seemingly-natural causes within days of each other and minutes before their appointments with Aisling. Of course, the police take Aisling into custody after each death and do so for multiple hours. They also confiscate her pasport. This was what bothered me; Aisling had great alibis for both deaths and until the second death, the first seemed absolutely natural so why would they interview a suspect for hours on end? It would be wasting the investigators time to say the least. And I don't care what country you are in, an alibi is an alibi. It was also somewhat obvious who the murderer was (at least half way into the book). Aisling must find the murderer to clear her name or be executed by the Otherworld council.I found the mystery very lacking but the rest of the plot was funny and light. Otherwise I could not have given this book 3 whole stars."},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"I really like this series. I'm not going to waffle on about the plot as its done by various reviewers here.I will say that I do have one problem with this series thus far (the reason why I didn't give it 5 stars) is the amount of drama between Drake and Aisling. I like a fair bit of drama, dont get me wrong, but it seems that every ten minutes of reading Ashling gets seriously mad at Drake and within a paragraph is completely smitten and gaga again. I say either leave some of the drama out or have her stand her ground in anger with him atleast once. Otherwise its just getting a bit repetative and annoying.Other than that I love the series!"},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"Entertaining characters, a light fun plot (minus the murders), and we learn a tiny bit about being a guardian. Most of the story is love, hate, love, hate between Aisling and Drake, which becomes annoying quick. Aisling and Drake aren't my favorite characters in a series due to Aisling's airheadedness, and Drakes blind arrogance. Yet it was a quick read, funny at times, and enough of a plot to keep me interested. I'd like to find out what happens with Drake and Aisling, but I feel like I already know. They will probably get back together, and fight, and break up, and get back together..."},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"This is the second book in the Aisling Grey Guardian series by Katie MacAlister. I did not think that this book was as good as the first book. I thought that the first book was cute, sexy, funny and had some original ideas. This book was cute, sometimes sexy, rarely funny and rehashed a lot of what we already learned in the first book. These are definitely way into the romance category and just slightly into the paranormal.Aisling travels to Budapest, Hungary to go the GODTAM convention where she hopes to meet other people like herself (That is magical type folk) and to find a Guardian to mentor her. Unfortunately she bumps into Drake and finds out that he is still obsessed with her performing her duties as his mate; some of these duties happen to be attending meetings of the Dragons' that just happen to be at the hotel she is at. With Drake hovering and her demon, Jim, making snarky comments Aisling is having one heck of a time getting a mentor lined up.Okay I pretty much know what I am getting into with these books. They are definitely not to be taken seriously, you need to leave all your notions about romantic relationships at the door, remember things won't necessarily make any sense, and remember Aisling is a bit of an airhead. Even going into reading this book with these things in mind I was a bit miffed at this book.First the positive stuff: This was a cute, fun read. It was a quick read and the plot moved along nicely. There were lots of tastefully done steamy sex scenes. I think it is awesome that Aisling is trying to get training for her position as a Guardian. It bugs me to death when a character decides they would rather tough it out, than do the logical thing and get a little help from a mentor. I liked the introduction of the Silver Dragon, Tiffany the professional Virgin, and some of the new Guardians.Okay now for the negative stuff. Aisling whines constantly, about pretty much everything. She can't make up her mind about anything; she hates Drake, she wants him, she hates him, etc. Her and Drake get in arguments over things that are very childish. I mean come on Drake is how old? You don't think he learned any communication skills in all that time? Aisling seems to have major ADD in this book and can't ever decide what to do next. I can understand Jim's frustration with her. Despite the fact that Aisling blunders through most of the book somehow she is uber-powerful and manages to right things (just like in the first book). Maybe this is supposed to be part of the humor?It was an okay book, it was light-hearted and amused me. Just, please don't think about the plot or Aisling's intentions too hard or you will hurt your brain trying to make sense of it. This is a book to read quickly, take at face value, and then it's on to another book. I have the next two books in the series and I will read them because I have them."},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"Be sure to read \\"You Slay Me\\" before reading this installment. I once again bought the audio version of this installment of the series and was not disappointed with it. It's worth the extra expense as Barabara Rosenblat does a fantastic job telling this fun story.Aisling finds herself in Budapest to make another courier delivery and to attend a convention so that she can learn about \\"the other world\\". Of course, things don't go smoothly for Aisling and she finds herself in the middle of a murder investigation. Not only that, she finds that she finds that she is irrisistable to most men and she also has to pay up for the challenge that she wagered in book one.Aisling also finds out what some of the responsibilities are to being the mate of a wivren and her relationship with Drake develops more.Another fun installment of this very immaginative world created by McCalister. While there's sizzle to this story, it doesn't dominate the book."},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"In this second book of the Guardian series, Aisling Grey is back and at it again. Trouble seems to follow poor Aisling wherever she goes, but no worries, she has her trusty demon Jim and Rene, her cab driver friend back to help her out.In this story Aisling is in Budapest to deliver an amulet to a mysterious hermit. Attend the Godtam conference and hopefully find someone to mentor her in how to be a Guardian. In the meantime her story with Drake, the wyvern of the Green Dragons continues to unfold since he is also in Budapest with the other dragon septs for a peace summit.The mystery, romance, wit and humor of this book made it almost impossible not to like Aisling and feel sympathy and humor at her many mistakes.Solid 4 stars!"},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"This is book 2 of the Aisling Grey novels and you definitely want to read the first in the series, \\"You Slay Me,\\" before reading this one. And if you don't want to know too much too soon, don't read the later ones in the series before this one. The books are very linear so you want to read them in order to get the maximum enjoyment. However, if you do as I did and read book 1, then book 4, then book 2, you will still enjoy them but it does take away some of the fun.These books are considered romances, but they don't follow the typical romance novel formula. There is romance and lots of sex but also fantasy and a little mystery added to the blend to keep them interesting."},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"I like how the story is evolving! But I still dont like Drake Vireo. He has a hidden agenda when it comes to Aisling! Katie did admit that he wont be the stereotyped hero guy and wont always be acting out in Aisling's best interest. Even from the first book his character hasnt warmed up to me. Hope there will be a love triangle between Gabriel-Aisling-Drake! Coz this will be a long series before Aisling and Drake can resolve their issues! I do love Jim the Newfie, the demon turned sidekick! Keep up the good work, Katie! Looking forward to reading the next Guardian novel this November!"},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"Halfway through the book, I was worried. Katie MacAlister is constantly in danger of letting her sense of comedy overwhelm her novels - losing the meat of characters, momentum, tension, etc., in her desire to punch out something irreverant, spunky, and lightly entertaining. For a while, I was really worried that she was going to ruin Fire Me Up and Aisling Grey by turning it into a (not necessarily funny) sketch routine.But she didn't!What counterbalances the broad comedy so well in Fire Me Up is the sheer unfairness of Aisling's situation - you'd have to be quite a cynic to dream up all of the awful things that she experiences in this book. She is blamed, suspected, betrayed, misjudged, and patronized at every turn.This novel has a satisfying narrative arc, while also leaving room for the situation to change in later novels as Aisling and the other characters evolve. The action centers around a conference of Otherworlders in Budapest, and a couple of murders committed there. Once again Aisling is a suspect and scrambling to clear her name.She's also looking for a mentor, adapting to her new role as a Guardian and hoping to learn enough to do the job right. And Drake appears as well - for a not-so-coincidentally timed conference of dragon wyverns. A lot of things happen on that front - Aisling finds herself embroiled in dragon politics, intra- and extra-sept, and back in a love/hate sort of relationship with Drake. (I, too, had a love/hate relationship with him in this book).By the end I was totally enthralled and happy with the book and I can't wait to read the next one."},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"I picked this book up from the library and didn't know it was book two in a series until I started reading, but it was fairly easy to figure out what I'd missed in the first book. I found that the humour and the quirkiness of the book grabbed me right away and made me keep reading even though I was missing the first piece of the puzzle. I laughed out loud many times (the Incubi were hilarious, and so was Tiffany the Professional Virgin). The scenes between Drake and Aisling were powerful, but I would have liked more. The mystery over the murders was interesting and kept me reading at the end to find out what was up, although there were some weak points in the story.Definitely an enjoyable read... I'm going to go and track down the first book now for sure."},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"This follow up to \\"You Slay Me\\" is just too fun to read. It was so hillarious, I had to put the book down so many times just to get over laughing! The characters are so out there, they're totally endearing (even the bad guys/gals). Aisling Grey's (pronounced Ashling) story continues after she's said good-bye forever to sexy Drake Vireo (head of the green wyverns) in \\"You Slay Me\\" and continues on with her life as a guardian (Keeper of the gates to Hell), demon lord, courier extraordinaire and not to mention being a dragon's ex-mate (or so she thought).But what Aisling still hasn't figured out is that things are not so simple in the immortal underworld that she now exists in and trying to learn more of. So with her demon Affrijim or Jim in tow, Aisling continues her adventures in Hungary. She surprisingly (or not) meets up with her on again/off again dragon mate Drake (still as hot as ever), faces the green dragons' punishment for losing to Drake in a challenge in Paris, and must keep all four dragon sects from fighting an all out war with each other. But her juggling act also includes getting her special package delivered (or kiss her courier career bye-bye), finding a mentor who won't die on her, not going to jail for murder, and throwing off lovesick mortal men who throw themselves at her as well as seductive (and naked) Incubi trying to seduce her everytime she closes her eyes. Did I mention sexy/hot Drake Vireo? But let's not ruin it all shall we.I hope this book is not the last of it. Because even though the story was so much fun, it leaves alot of opening for more at the end. Thumbs up! Katie MacAlister!"},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"I just finished Fire Me Up, and wow was it great. From start to finish I couldn't put it down. Aisling's relationship with Drake is taken to a new level, that leaves you wondering what will be next. I recommend this book to everyone who loved You Slay Me."},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"I have been waiting for the release of this book ever since I read \\"You Slay Me\\" (which I loved). Totally worth the wait! I am seriously laughing out loud every other page and getting strange looks from my husband wondering what is so funny.

This was 6 hours ago and I already finished the book! I regret that I seem to consume books at an alarming speed and I hated to finish this book. It was over 4 months ago when I read \\"You Slay Me\\" and I've been anticipating the arrival of this book!. I can't believe she's only releasing one per year!Drake and Aishling are mind-blowingly sexy together. The chemistry was there. Aishling and her demon-dog, Jim, cracked me up with their antics! The mystery kept me involve and guessing who did it! The social/political dynamics of the Dragon society are finally explained better. I won't spoil the story with any spoilers or teasers so go buy the book! Simply a MUST READ!"},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"As much as I enjoyed this book, and it was a fun read, I have to agree that Aisling is a bit tiring. I also found the plot very predictable with only one surprise. Although Drake's betrayal was a big one. The writing is still quick and funny and I laughed out loud.I love, repeat love Jim and all his \\"issues\\". I like Nora. I love Drake, even when he is more of a snake than a dragon.I also found myself wondering why Aisling isn't trying to get answers to her questions. Of course the reason is, the story needs to stretch out over more books, but it seems unbelievable that she would just let these things go. For example what is Renee? What about getting pregnant? She mentions these things then does not pursue them, which makes her seem even more stupid.If you don't expect to much, you will be very pleased by this book."},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"This book (the second in the series) was by far the funniest, sexiest, and downright greatest book I have read in quite some time. It is wonderful escape reading. Drake and Aisling are hilarious together. Jim is his usual caustic and lovable self. Rene is back and there for Aisling and the plot moves at a nice pace. You get a look into Dragon politics and a deeper view into the tango that Aisling and Drake do around their feelings for one another.I adore Katie MacAlister's books. I thought the Vamp books were great, but this series will be one that I keep forever.Do yourself a favor and BUY THIS BOOK! You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"Even though most of the characters in Fire Me Up aren't human, Ms. MacAlister wrote a book full of genuine human emotion. Rome wasn't built in a day and neither was the the gripping relationship between Aisling Grey and Drake Vireo. In a time when romance novels have become a little predictable, Katie hits readers with a complex, realistic and sometimes heart wrenching relationship between Hero and Heroine. Combine that with a wisecracking demon in Newfoundland form and a professional virgin and you have a can't miss hit!"},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"I thought this was a wonderful follow up to the first book, You Slay Me. Ending, a little frustrating but set you up for the third book. Katie MacAlister's humor is wonderful & I love the whole \\"dragon\\" theme...getting a little tired of vampires & wolves. You should definitely read it!"},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"A good continutation of the saga - Aisling is an exceptionally strong Guardian of one the gates to other realities---which she discovered in the first book of this series. Problem is, she doesn't know where her gate is, what she's supposed to be doing with it, and she needs a mentor...all while holding down a regular job to keep the bills paid and her Newfoundland dog (demon, actually) fed. To top it all, she's found that she's a Dragon's Mate to a dragon in human form (who also happens to be a total stud-muffin). Gluing the whole story together is her job as a courier for rare/priceless antiquities. Good read, lots of humor, good erotic scenes without crossing the border into porn. Looking forward to the next installment, and hoping Ms Grey doesn't dump the dragon-man! Their chemistry (literally) is such a hoot."},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"I picked up the first novel of the Aisling Gray series (You Slay Me)on a whim at the bookstore because the cover caught my attention. What a wonderful world I found myself immersed in!Aisling is a loveable and slightly quirky heroine. She approaches her continued immersion into the \\"Otherworld\\" with the same wide-eyed, yet slightly sarcastic viewpoint I would probably be feeling in a similar situation.Drake continues to be mysterious yet highly desirable. (Can we say yummy?)As for Jim? He is still cracking me up. I mean, come on - who hasn't secretly longed for a sarcastic Newfoundland demon as pet?I highly recommend this series and have received rave reviews from all friends that I have let borrow my copies. If you want a good laugh, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"Once again Katie MacAlister has written a great novel! I could hardly put it down. She brings back charecters from You Slay Me, her previous Aisling Gray novel. Yet, if the reader has not read You Slay Me there is pleanty of explaination so that the reader understands Aisling's situation. As with her previous novels my emotions ran from laughing out loud to cheering for the heroine to making snarky comments at the bad guy. The charecters are enjoyable and multi-dimensional. This novel reaffirms my belief that Katie MacAlister is one of the best romance novel writers of our time."},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"The first book, \\"You Slay Me\\", has some really interesting takes on the supernatural with its totally messed up main character. However, after I read the first book I wondered if the main character was strong and independent, hated Drake, or just hated men in general. The next book, \\"Fire Me Up\\", especially the ending, answered the question. It is pathetic. It is almost as if the author is going through an \\"I hate men\\" spell.I hope that Katie writes another book in this Guardian series and finally has Al \\"grow up\\". Drake's character deserves better. ;) Yes, I know that she feels that he betrayed her, however, it is in his character to make her think. She should have spelled out to him more of what she wanted prior to accepting to be his eternal mate. ...and then to threaten him with another dragon. Shame on you Al! Al is a selfish, whiney, brat who needs to have the tables turned on her."},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"as you cannot as fully explore a character in depth in a 2 hour movie versus a season long show, so it is easier to explore a character's many nuances in a book series over a single book. we get to see progression in the relationship between aisling and drake, but as in any true and believeable relationship it is not pure bliss 100% of the time. progress, learn from mistakes and grow or stagnate and whither.aisling and drake are suffering from nothing more than growing pains, when that first, shall we say golden glow, has worn off and reality sets in. we see the same \\"old\\" characters again and again because they are important to the sub-plot. whether we know why they are important or not.did aisling get annoying at times? yes. did drake get over bearing at times? gosh and golly, he's a dragon! they do that!is jim just comic relief? well, i don't want to give any plot twists away.would i recommend this book? you betcha. already have, as a matter of fact.i feel like going to the publisher and pounding on the front door like they do in that famous t.v. commercial but yelling, PUBLISH!

Katie is definately a favorite author of mine now!"},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"I can't really say anything about the plot to add to the editorial review and comments made by other reviewers. I will say that I absolutely adored You Slay Me and had hoped for a lot more from this book. It was a quick, fun read with absolutely no twists and surprises and I didn't feel that we learned anything significant about any of the characters or the universe kate MacAlister has created. It was about as substantial as fluff which is kinda disappointing given the potential. I love Drake and the dragons, and Jim is hilarious.. Aisling herself could do with.. something. She makes me laugh but she's too childish and wishy washy for me to actually be able to identify with. I think the author needs to do a little development work on her heroine and punch up the plot next time."},{"Title":"Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)","review":"Not to long ago, Aisling Grey was just a courier making her first delivery in Paris when she meets Drake Vireo, part man part green dragon and totally insisting she is his wyvern's mate. She somehow conjures up her own demon, who turns out to be a loud mouthed Newfoundland canine who speaks English in public. She reluctantly accepts that she is the Guardian/Keeper of the Gates to Hell but has no idea what to do.She travels to Budapest to attend the 238th convention of supernatural beings the GODTAM (Guardians, Oracles, Diviners, Theurgists, and Mages) seeking a teacher. To her chagrin except for the elation of her traitorous feminine parts, Drake is also staying at the Thermal Hotel Danu on Margaret Island. As Drake calls her \\"Mate\\" and a Diviner makes her drop fruits on her breasts, someone steals the amulet her uncle assigned to her to deliver. Since she cannot afford to give up her day job and unable to find a mentor to live long enough to teach her Guardian 101, like any tyro Guardian amongst these professionals, Aisling searches for the purloined amulet.The sequel to the fun fantasy thriller YOU SLAY ME is a delightfully amusing tale. The feisty American star is in Hungary seeking to find her Yoda so that she can learn how to use the force, but sidetracked by her need to recover the amulet and by her Mate who can fire her up with one glance. Fans will enjoy this fine tale as Aisling realizes she is now one of the weird, but struggles with being identified as a Guardian and as the Mate.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Stories from the Sagebrush; Celebrating Northern Nevada at the Millennium (A Halcyon Imprint)","review":"We lived in this part of Nevada for five years, so this was (and still is) a wonderful book outlining interesting facts, and beautiful places in a that doesn't get much press."},{"Title":"Stories from the Sagebrush; Celebrating Northern Nevada at the Millennium (A Halcyon Imprint)","review":"It was simply unbelievable.

After comparing this book with the SAS SQL manual (free online PDF file available at SAS website), I came to one question, why bother to buy this book? The book is not a copy of the SAS manual, but it is written in a strikingly similar pattern yet it provides LESS information than the SAS manual; on the contrary, the SAS manual gives you more materials, more examples, better narratives, clearer explanations than this full-of-typo book."},{"Title":"PROC SQL: Beyond the Basics Using SAS","review":"As I learn more PROC SQL, I do appreciate the examples he offers.

These books are not generalized descriptions of the birds, but \\"compilations of detailed, specific observations of individual birds.\\" We are new to birding and have not found any other book to contain this amount of detailed information; indeed, there might not be any book that exceeds the scope of Bent's. I highly recommend this book, as well as every other volume in the series."},{"Title":"How to Prepare for the Toeic","review":"Barron&#8217;s How to Prepare for the TOEIC Test has both positive and negative points, but the negatives outweigh the positives. First off, the positives. (...) You get six complete TOEIC practice tests and a fair number of practice exercises for each of the seven sections. All of these exercises somewhat approximate an actual ETS TOEIC test. In addition, the author gives explanatory answers to the practice tests and exercises. However, this is where the positives of Barron&#8217;s book end. On the negative side, the author&#8217;s analysis of the construction of the TOEIC is very confusing. For example, his presentation of the material in the listening comprehension sections is less than helpful. It attempts to mix all four sections together which, in my opinion, doesn&#8217;t work well. Peterson&#8217;s TOEIC Success presents this listening material in a much clearer manner. In addition, the author&#8217;s analysis of Parts 5 and 6 (grammar) of the reading section leaves much to be desired. Simply put, the grammar points reviewed in the Barron&#8217;s book are not an exact reflection of the grammar you will find an actual TOEIC test. I do feel that the author&#8217;s analysis of Part 7, the reading comprehension section, is the stronger than his analysis of Parts 1-6. For Part 7, he provides a useful &#8220;question type chart&#8221; and realistic TOEIC-style reading passages. However, even here, there are problems: The reading passages are on the short side and there is an overabundance of chart-type passages. Overall, Barron&#8217;s How to Prepare for the TOEIC Test is not terrible, but mostly confusing and unenlightening. Buy this book if you want a lot of practice tests, but not as a way of giving you a full understanding of the construction of the TOEIC exam."},{"Title":"How to Prepare for the Toeic","review":"Last year, I bought this book because I needed to have a quick help to prepare myself for the TOEIC test.

I most like the large number of sample questions, including several full-length tests and accompanying CD's. One problem, though, is that Loughheed's explanations are difficult for even my advanced-level non-native speakers to understand. However, they are very helpful to me as a teacher in explaining how to solve problems. What I do is review his explanations myself before class, then use them as a tool to help teach things to my students as they work through the sample problems. The test section does not include a table giving a model TOEIC score. I wrote the author about this, and he said a conversion chart would be included in the next edition.

Stories are woven, questions are raised and as time passes answered. The strands begin to straighten out and make sense. Re-reading the book to get it all straight is a treat and a gift.

But the thin line between love and hate running through the book is compelling. And I enjoy how Louise writes in the POV or about particular characters. She did it in Crown of Columbus and she does it here. I find myself \\"becoming\\" her characters as I read each chapter. And the use of the Okijbwa language peaks my curiosity into the culture and lifestyle of these people. I can't rave about the novel because it was so unsettling. But I did enjoy it. She is a talented writer and I can't wait to read her other books."},{"Title":"The Antelope Wife","review":"The tale was too esoteric. It was very difficult to follow. I could only last one chapter then I was off to sleep!"},{"Title":"The Antelope Wife","review":"This is definitely one of her best works yet. It is a spellbinding and powerful book."},{"Title":"The Antelope Wife","review":"The couples, who are likely to become the parents of a little baby, first find a name for that sojourner even before he/she is born. This name usually has to carry positive meanings beneath it, such as the ones from religious, legendary themes which remind people of force ,power, durability etc... The reason is obvious: People all around the world -no matter where they are from or what religion they have etc... - name their children with names associated with strength, stability as they believe -at least want to believe- that those names bring the attribution of the meaning to their children.Naturally, in literature the influence of this belief can be seen. In the novel of Louise Erdrich The Antelope Wife, the protagonists (as there are multiple points of view, I mention here Protagonists) believe that there is a strong relationship between the names they possess and their destiny. The Antelope Wife's impact mostly stems from its different way of narrating. In most of the ordinary novels there is usually one protagonist. In this novel there are many important characters all of whom contribute to the plot. Yet the most vital character can be perceived as the Antelope Wife. Klaus Shawano at first sight, falls in love with her, feels himself compelled to be with her, and begins to follow her secretly. Stubbornly, Klaus keeps on following her, and he manages to catch her; yet she rejects to be with him, and he, not knowing how to make her stay \\"tie[s] her up\\" with sweetheart calico. (30). Here, he metaphorically ties her up to himself with sweetheart calico. At the end, Klaus unties her, that is to say, ends his obsessive love affair with her. Richard Whiteheart Beads' story is a bit tragic as his life was performed just the same way as the beadwork's. Richard's last name depends on a naming story,by which the scattered life of him is revealed. According to this story his family name - Whiteheart Beads -derives from the beadworks. In the course of time, the beadwork was scattered, similarly the life of Richard was scattered: \\"... Whiteheart Bead. That name went until Richard ended up with it\\" (240) . First, her wife Rozin leaves Richard for Frank Shawano. In the stupefaction of the shocking desertion of his wife, he accidentally causes his daughter Deanna to die. The two distress which come in a series profoundly deplores him. That is to say, his life was ruined just like the beadwork had been ruined, scattered... Thus, apparently, the Indian belief comes true: The name completely influenced the entire life of Richard Whiteheart Beads. The Ojibwa society in the novel also name the animals just like they name their children. The Windigo dog who represent intelligence in the book, manages to escape before they cook him in the stew pot to make soup, by using his ability of intelligence. As he manages to escape the stew pot, the owners of him name him as Almost Soup. The witty dog criticizes human beings: \\"In Ojibwa language, that is my name and I refuse to give it up for human mistakes or human triumphs\\" (81). The attempt to emphasize the significance of naming again strikes here, which determines Erdrich's Indian society.The names of some characters have been changed throughout the novel and these alterations of names have a great deal of contribution to the novel. As the novel is mostly based on dialectical adjustments, the alteration of names have a profound impact on the climax of the events. The one whose name have been subject to these alterations most frequently is the Blue Prairie Woman. Although the name changes, the characters' name still take place in further parts at the story, which means that the new name does not replace the former name. The old name remains active. In my opinion, Erdrich tries to conduct the sense of her concept of dialectical adjustments; the old concept remains even if new one comes out. Erdrich, throughout the novel, uses a lot of Indian words. The usage of these words give the sense of beadwork which also takes part in the novel; as one critic claims the bead-sewing twins are \\"create[ing] the patterns of the world\\" (Martin) . The Indian words among the English sentences seem to match thoroughly the beads among the patterns. That is, as the twins create the patterns of the world, the Indian words such as \\"nibi\\", \\"Daashkikaa\\" etc... create the pattern of the novel -or in other words- maintain the completeness of the novel. When examined attentively, Louise Erdrich implies a figurative meaning using the Indian name of Minneapolis: Gakahbekong. She ,consciously using the Indian name, tends to contrast the permanency of the Indian culture and temporality of Minneapolis, the name which belongs to Newly adopted culture. For, in Erdrich's literature, Gakahbekong represents the old, permanent generation whereas Minneapolis represents the new, the changing and the temporary. Although time changes everything in the world it can do nothing to the real, permanent,special ones such as Gakahbekong. No matter how much the appearance of Gakahbekong has transformed, it still contains the spiritual values inside itself. As I stated above, in Louise Erdrich's magical novel The Antelope Wife, the people believe that there is a strong relation between the names they possess and their destiny. Finally, it is clear that they are right about their belief in names as throughout the story, the names have influenced their lives. Almost for all the characters, their names have an important influence on their lives. In the beginning I mentioned that every society pays attention to names, nevertheless in the Ojibwa society it is a little more emphasized. The names have a great contribution to the rendering of the meaning. Specifically, the place, Gakahbekong, plays a significant role since its meaning serves as a symbolical explanation to the general meaning. With a lot of motives beneath the mysterious characters, two complex family relations, a time which consists of lives of three generations and the important characters like Zosie Roy, Antelope Wife, Richard Whiteheart Beads etc... the novel serves as a guide for the social importance of the names in the Indian society. Finally, as the paper dealt with the naming of characters and the influence of both naming and the alteration of the names to the plot, it helped to reveal the underlying motives in the novel of Erdrich, The Antelope Wife."},{"Title":"The Antelope Wife","review":"This was a fairly good book, but the characters were lacking in whatever it is that makes them almost a personal friend . ..Still a good read. If you want to read a book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever."},{"Title":"The Antelope Wife","review":"I was disappointed in Louise Erdrich's previous novel, *Tales of Burning Love*, which I thought was overly sensationalistic--a bit &quot;Hollywood&quot; for my taste. In *The Antelope Wife*, however, she has returned to an approach that is reminiscent of her first and most triumphant novel, *Love Medicine*. She writes in a style that may be difficult for some readers to accept--no,it's not &quot;obscure&quot; in the sense of a James Joyce novel, but she changes voices, time frames, and situations constantly. The result is a tapestry-like narrative that is uniquely effective, in my view. Erdrich has a way with words that is rare in today's literary world, despite the countless novels that are published annually. Moreover, because of her own Native American heritage, she is able to convey with incredible effectiveness the realities of past and present life and consciousness within those Indian cultures with which she is familiar.This is a fine work, one that makes me look forward all the more to Louise Erdrich's next book."},{"Title":"The Antelope Wife","review":"With each book, my admiration grows for this writer. Her attention to detail, characterizations, interweaving of mysticism and reality -- and with all, an original dash of humor laced with sadness. As with Burning Tales of Love, she weaves many disparate threads together, creating a narrative blanket that you never want to unwrap from. I've read everything she's written, and in this day when prizes such as the National Book Award mean so much in sales and recognition, it amazes me that her work isn't at least among the finalists."},{"Title":"The Antelope Wife","review":"I must say that I was somewhat dissapointed with this book. I expected more depth from the characters than what they could give. I miss characters like Lipsha, as complex as the stories of which they were a part. As usual, all the characters are tied to one another in a knot which has no beginning or end. Unfortunately, the depth which they lack makes this, as another person commented &quot;hard to follow&quot;. Erdrich ties them together for the sake of having them tied; many of the connections among them are forced at best. The big, loose, loopish, way in which the story is written makes this the most authentic piece of Native American Fiction Erdrich has ever written. Had the characters been more developed, it would have been one of her best."},{"Title":"The Antelope Wife","review":"This book is beautiful and sad -- intelligent and thoughtful. The author has great empathy for all of her characters -- the good and the bad -- the stable and the disturbed. The twin-ness of the stories and the characters is what achieves this empathy -- it is an exploration, not an apology for the complexities of people. The narrative voices throughout the novel are fraught with a touching and genuine emotion that refrains from becoming sappy. It is difficult to read the woes and ponderings of these characters and to avoid an empathy -- a reading between the lines -- that relate to the author's personal woes. If you wondered, as I did, what effect her personal trials would have on her fiction, this book answers that question better than any interview could. I look forward to her next effort."},{"Title":"The Antelope Wife","review":"I have admired Erdrich's writing in the past---\\"Tracks\\" and \\"The Beet Queen\\"--so I was looking forward to reading another of her novels. I must say I was disappointed here. Though Erdrich, like N. Scott Momaday, has a highly poetical style and her pages are filled with beautiful images (which is certainly a positive characteristic), a novel after all needs to have a strong story line or a point. Beautiful sentences and poetic expressions do not make a story, even if spiced with magical realism, sex, recipes, and colorful beads. As a literary testimony to a section of Native American experience, THE ANTELOPE WIFE has great merit. But as a novel, in the company of all the novels of the world, I felt that in this case, Erdrich tried to stretch out her career and write the next book though her heart was not in it. Perhaps it was a bad time in her life. The novel felt to me as one written by a person \\"trying to be literary\\". She writes of the mixed and intertwined fates of all those people of the Anishinabe world---Indians, whites, men, women, strong and weak---like beads on a string. The Indians come out holding the short stick. Within this framework, individuals play out their fates, violence and love intermingling with mystery and mundane existence. The characters somehow do not rise above their initial characterizations. The women are stronger than the men for the most part: they endure while the men often fall into alcohol and despair. The author writes in graceful style, but not much depth. I felt---at the risk of sounding snotty---that THE ANTELOPE WIFE belongs more in the category of \`chick-lit' than in \`American literature'. I once read part of a novel by Amy Tan, but could not finish for similar reasons. I did read THE ANTELOPE WIFE in its entirety, because Erdrich's writing differs favorably from most other authors', but I grew tired of the soap opera quality of this story."},{"Title":"The Antelope Wife","review":"(First of all, it is a NOVEL, not a collection of short stories as is advertised in Amazon.Com.) The Antelope Wife is Louise Erdrich's best novel since Love Medicine. She uses language like paint, creating pictures and moments. Unfortunately, the plot is still hard to follow, and the characters are so similar that you find yourself having to scan backwards to try to remember who's who. Her symbolism in this book include: Men nursing infants, women nursing dogs, beadwork, twins, baked goods (playing the same role that meat played in Beet Queen), plains Indians, urban Indians, and dogs, some eaten. In her non-fiction book The Blue Jay's Dance, Erdrich writes: &quot;I do not like cats, so I am fascinated by their silken ways.&quot; As a reader, I do not like Erdrich, so I am fascinated by the words she chooses to put on the page."},{"Title":"The Antelope Wife","review":"I am a true fan of Louise Erdrich but I must say this particular book is not my favorite, save it for the last and read ALL of her other books!"},{"Title":"The Antelope Wife","review":"The theme of this Erdrich novel is beaded tapestry and how our lives are smilarly woven into a pattern. She also shows the interweaving of past and present, the animal world with the human world, and myth with reality.Common wisdom says that narrative should almost always be in one voice and that stories should move in a linear progression. Erdrich, as do many of the best Native American writers, shows that this is not necessarily so. Though I did find myself frustrated sometimes trying to follow the connections of past and present, and how different people were related, it became clear in the end that the tale was told in a circle, and eventually it all made sense. Erdrich does not tie up all of the loose ends, however. There remains some mystery, for example, in the characters of the two grandmothers, which is what gives the story a lasting value and keeps you thinking long after you've finished reading.The one flaw, for me, though, was that the weavi!ng still had some loose threads. Like the telling of a family history, everything is included, even the parts that are not necessary to the plot. Perhaps I missed something in my reading or interpretation, but I felt that the story of Sweet Heart Calico (the true antelope wife) and Klaus could have stood alone. While it was fascinating and well handled in and of itself, it really was not necessary to the main story. Also the story of the German soldier was a bit superfluous.Of course, Erdrich was not really writing a family history. She was writing a novel about family histories, and as such, she could have done a little more weeding and honing. In spite of its small flaws, however, this is still a beautiful and well-written work."},{"Title":"The Antelope Wife","review":"Great read. I really enjoy Louise Erdrich's work.

I have thus been meaning to re-read the series in order ever since, and this book was the start of that. I will try and fuill the remaining collection gaps as I go.I used to find Jennings hilariously funny, and I was pleased to discover that I am still very entertained by them as an adult. I am perhaps now a little more aware of the shortcomings of the writing - but they are certainly not badly written.Jennings is a school boy starting out at Linbury Court Prep school, a boarding school in the Sussex Downs. He gets into all kinds of scrapes and situations in this book. Most chapters are self contained, describing one misadventure and thus were perfect for me as a child to read in small chunks, and to enjoy what was going on."},{"Title":"Scary Beautiful","review":"What I really liked about this book was it turned the table on the \\"prettiest girl in school\\" stereotype. In a lot of books and most every teen movie, the prettiest girl in school is always the biggest witch who rules the school with the popular gang and always gets her way. However, Niki Burnham has twisted this by making the pretty girl, Chloe, a really interesting and complex character, very down-to-earth and self conscious of her looks and how they affect other peopl. Chloe's heart is broken when she's dumped by her long-time boyfriend, but she resolves to make the best out of the school. She's fiercely loyal to her friends, works hard at not being the star of the school gossip mill, and when a chance to better herself comes along, she joins the cross-country team and starts hanging out with a \\"geeky\\" boy, Billy. The relationship between Chloe and Billy is sweet and believable and their chemistry is great. Sure, a lot of silly teen angst things happen in Chloe's life, but through her honesty and perseverence, so comes out on top. Niki Burnham's dead-on writing of teens really won me over and I can't wait to read more of her books. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Scary Beautiful","review":"Chloe Rand's life couldn't be any better.

HOWVEVER! i absolutely fell in love with this book. i read it in just a couple days, and it was hard to put down. I really loved it."},{"Title":"Scary Beautiful","review":"This is a book I first read some years back. I remember that this book was incredibly high on my wishlist, I had stumbled upon at the used bookstore and I was really excited to read it. When I picked it up earlier this week, I forgot that I had been slightly disappointed by it the first time. Don't get me wrong, this book is incredibly cute, but it hadn't been what I had wanted back then.From the description you would think that this is going to be a cute little romance novel about Chloe and Billy, however, the \\"romance\\" actually takes a backseat to the drama that is Chloe, her friends, and kind of her ex (I say kind of because he's not really directly the problem here either). Which is where most of my disappointment comes from, I'm expecting this possible awkward romance between a somewhat popular girl trying to get over her ex and a geek. And, we get a girl getting over her ex dealing with her girlfriends who really only know how not to talk their problems out. Oh and then there's that guy... whose supposed to be important, but we only see him every so often.If I wasn't expecting a \\"romantic comedy\\" because it wasn't very romantic or funny, I would have probably been less disappointed. That is my word for this book \\"disappointed\\". Still it was cute, and you have to give Chloe her props for trying to find herself after her long-term boyfriend breaks up with her. This isn't even just a \\"high school girl\\" sort of problem. She handled this well I think, she didn't wallow in self-pity like some people/characters do after their significant others breakup with them. It was also a really quick read, I think I finished it in only a handful of hours.There is one more thing that bothered me. We are reminded every so often (more often than we see Billy), that Chloe is just so PRETTY. Now, I've actually always been confused by this whenever I come upon this in the media, why women are always portrayed this way? That we hate women who are prettier than us? I don't know if it's because I grew up with brothers. But I personally have always gotten along better with other women as opposed to be men, no matter how much prettier they are than me (than again appearance has never really mattered to me). So the fact that Chloe and her friends think that the other girls hate Chloe now because she's so PRETTY and SINGLE now, kind of baffled me."},{"Title":"Scary Beautiful","review":"I really like this book and wall other books by Nokia BurnhamI think this is one of Niki's best books"},{"Title":"Scary Beautiful","review":"How cute is that cover? It is so playful and perfect for a young adult read! I was looking for a quick read when I came across this book on my bookshelf. These Simon Pulse Romantic Comedy line of books remind me of a Harlequin nook geared for teens. They are predictable, a fun romance and characters that are fun.While I have read many books where the teen is the ugly duckling of the school, this is a first for me where we get to read from the beautiful and popular girls perspective. Chloe is that girl that we all love to hate in high school. She is scary beautiful, can have any guy she wants, and she is popular to boot. What makes this different and the character likable, is the fact that she hates being the pretty girl in school. She has just been dumped by her boyfriend of two years, realizing she has spent those two years closed off from her friends, and trying to rediscover who she is.Billy is the geek she would never have noticed before. He is kind, cute, but part of the nerd crowd. He is very smart, yet also fun to be around. Chloe starts to fall for Billy and wants to hang around him more. The only thing is her best friend Rachel has had her eye on him as well. Now Chloe has to decide if friendship is more important than the boy.While I thought the book was predictable, I actually enjoyed this book. It was fun and quick, but told a story as well with a great pace. I liked how down to Earth Chloe was and Billy was such a sweetheart. I love how the author put a new spin on the cliche of outer beauty vs. inner beauty.

These books are not necessarily the best written novels but the stories are always fun and you know you will get a happy ending.

This book disgusted me! Chloe, the main character, spent chapters complaining about her amazing looks. About the zits she never gets, the weight she never gains, the envious stares she recieves, and as a teenage girl who does get the zits, does gain the weight, and is nto often the bearer of those unbearable stares it frustrated me to no end to listen to that.

Ramsey writes with such an intelligent and self-effacing grace, her wide-ranging and subtle perceptions flowing and blending into seamless entertaining narrative. She describes her explorations along the waterways of the Atchafalaya Basin, Bayou Teche, Bayou Lafourche, and the Mississippi River Delta below New Orleans. She made the trips in the late 1940s, going as \\"crew\\" on boats of local trappers, moss gatherers, traders, fishermen, shrimpers, oystermen. The inspired narrative incorporates descriptions of the landscape and environment, sociology including many conversations with locals, history (especially Jean Lafitte and the 1814 Battle of New Orleans), the working realities and the economics of varied professions, and the biology/life cycles of Spanish moss, shrimp, muskrat, oysters, and the marsh.

Taking our personality styles into account, I am better able to provide her with the emotional and physical attention that she wants and needs.

I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"MotherStyles: Using Personality Type to Discover Your Parenting Strengths","review":"Ever since before I conceived my daughter, I have devoured parenting books by the score. Only a few have passed the \\"purchase test.\\" (I borrow everything I read from the library, then decide whether I'll reread it enough times to want to own it.) Motherstyles is different from anything else I've come across. After reading ONE PAGE I purchased it on the spot. A few more pages and I was already laughing and crying, feeling deeply affirmed as a mother and energized by the powerful truths this book contains. Since first reading it cover-to-cover in a couple of days, I have referred to it several times a week for my own parenting and to share its insights with friends.Ms. Penley has used her deep understanding of personality type to show every mother why she shines in certain areas and struggles in others. Motherstyles solves an amazing number of mysteries about why different mothers, kids, and people in general operate differently, as well as shedding light on family dynamics. The book \\"justified\\" for me certain strong needs I have as a mother--such as why I need daily solitude for my very sanity, while for many of my mother friends, a little time alone is simply a luxury that they can postpone if need be. So I'm meeting my needs more consistently--without guilt. I have stopped comparing myself to other mothers, instead embracing my personal style as a gift to my child. And everyone in my family is happier!Mothers in our society are in an strange bind: At our fingertips is an unprecedented amount of theoretical knowledge about all that children need in order to thrive. Yet on the practical level, ONE person, with her very human strengths and limitations, is expected to provide it all . . . while socially isolated, sleep-deprived, and overwhelmed by the rest of life's demands. It would be funny if it weren't so serious. This book goes farther than any other to lighten the load of that impossible burden, empowering mothers to claim their own uniqueness as a vital part of their children's thriving.Motherstyles has changed my world. Since reading it, I've been imagining a world in which every mother had a copy of it. It would be a world in which every mother was doing her very best parenting, her unique kind of parenting--while having fun and feeling plenty of ease and joy! A world in which every mother approached her children, her partner, other mothers, and herself with warm and deep understanding. A world in which every mother felt free to be fully herself. And THAT would give children what they truly need.

Motherstyles is a real gift to anyone from mother-to-be (wish I'd had a copy then!) to the mother of pre-teens and beyond (glad I have a copy now!) My parenting life was immediately made easier through the understanding gained from the author's ideas. The ideas helped me see myself--acknowledge my strengths and accept my struggles--as a mother. They made me feel good about my unique self and my style of parenting. Whereas in the past I would spend too much time feeling down about my mothering short-comings--and we all have some. From the author's information, I learned that I am an ENTP--subtitled the \\"Independence Mom\\". I might not be the best with a whiny, clingy child, and routines (I don't even like pushing kids in swings because it is a repetitive motion. I would look at other parents pushing swings back and forth at the park and wonder enviously--\\"How can they DO THAT for their child?\\"). However,I can now see that my strong desire to encourage independence, take advantage of spontaneous opportunities, and be tolerant and accepting is what frames ME as a mother--those are my gifts to my offspring. I used to think when other moms asked me to arrange for something way ahead \\"I am not good at planning in advance\\" (and I would feel down about myself.) Now, I say, \\"Call me at the last minute, because I am REALLY GOOD doing things spur-of-the-moment\\". The inverse of my parenting struggle is now my parenting strength. The book is set up with lots of interactive features to help the reader determine her unique mothering style and how that affects relationships with offspring, spouse, grandparents, the workplace, other mothers. I think if this book were handed out in maternity wards, we'd have so many happier mothers, right from the start."},{"Title":"MotherStyles: Using Personality Type to Discover Your Parenting Strengths","review":"Whether reading in order to gain a better understanding of oneself, one's own mother, wife, daughter, or indeed any member of the family, there is much for each of us to learn here. Aimed at parents (especially mothers), and teachers concerned about parenting with children of all ages, this book certainly provides the reader with a series of useful, personality-type centered descriptions and advice, and may be especially welcomed by first-time mothers in search of initial tips on this subject. As many a psychologist likes to inform their students - \`the very worst that might happen' (as a result of considering personality variables and their significance for understanding human behaviour), is that \\"you may learn something about yourself!\\". Continuing to expand and apply the framework of Jungian thinking on personality types, via the worked results of individual Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (mother-and-daughter) interpreted profiles, Penley and Eble provide a useful volume here, packed with appropriate example behaviours and \`tips' for practical consideration for mothers finding themselves exploring a variety of different situational experiences.Although we do not fully agree with all of the views expressed here, with some parts of this book certainly sounding confusing to someone knowing little or nothing about personality types, there are many reasons to take its content seriously. Without falling into the more proscriptive (bad) use of the MBTI (for career applicant screening), the current authors use this type of personality assessment in a more prescriptive way (akin to the use of the PIC-MBTI for training recommendation), instead making use of the identified strengths and weaknesses of each profile in affording its recommendations and \`tips' for success. The particular focus of its use in the current volume is to apply MBTI-like analysis in the pursuit of a better understanding of variations in motherhood behaviour and its optimization for action, according to which one of 16 personality profiles any particular person may be said to match. Sufficient information is provided here for the reader to determine for him/herself which of the 16 profiles s/he best reflects (without the need to undergo a professional psychological testing session), although all of the following advice is directed only at providing what might be termed \`tips for motherhood'. On the whole the latter are very useful, and may lead one to understand so much (or at least provoke the reader to think so much) more clearly and deeply about one's own actions/behaviours, and those of other mothers, fathers, and even one's children.Although the reviewers wish to direct caution with regards the authors' use of the occasional lapse in assigning real preference (and thus behaviour) to owners of each of the 16 personality profiles (whereas these are actually reflective of \`expressed preferences' due to the self-report nature of this kind of test instrument), Penley & Eble are more accurate in stating their claim that, when things are going well with their family interactions \\".. [they are].. operating from the strengths of your unique mothering style\\", and that \\"each of the 16 types of mothers does something better for her children than any of the other 15 types of mothers are likely to do\\" (p.18). If we were to offer criticism re the details of interpretation and recommendations, it would be leveled at the omission of any discussion with regards the significance of variations in personality type with regards the significant variations one might expect to consider due to a particular mother's age and personal experience (especially following multiple births and increasing sibling number). However, this book is not just for (or about) mothers and mothering styles. There is much here for (and about) dad, and the children, and the ways in which the whole family may better understand each other - and indeed, the way(s) in with they might choose to interact with other families, and without recourse to any of the soul-mate searching and zodiac-sign matching that so many other books have tended towards. The self-balancing and whole family issues (which are in particular the focus of the later chapters), are dealt with in the same light as the mothering-style sections, and are well filled with appropriate and useful \`tips' and recommended strategies for a better understanding of each individual's actions, communications, desires, and preferences for ideas implementation - this is a great strength of this book, and a reason (if the only one) to read it.Dr. Tony Dickinson and Julia HuiAcademic Research Laboratory, Hong Kong, 2008."},{"Title":"MotherStyles: Using Personality Type to Discover Your Parenting Strengths","review":"I loved this book - I read it like a good, page turning, bestseller - cover to cover in just a matter of days!

But I want to tell you why, ever since I met Janet Penley, I pestered her to write this book.I first met Janet Penley in 1993 when she spoke at a mothering seminar. I bought her self-published M.O.M.S. Handbook and I'll tell you, this material drastically affected my mothering. (Fortunately, I discovered Janet's work early in my mothering career.) Understanding personality type-especially my own, my husband's, and my children's--has enabled me to appreciate and build on the strengths of each of our types. I also know now here we need outside help or perspective to shore up our weaknesses. I grasp our family dynamics better?-particularly the greatest source of my ongoing frustration. Because my husband and I are the same types, I am often stretched in opposite directions, just to provide the balance that every family system needs.Helping Janet expand this information into a full-size book has only deepened my understanding of personality type and mothering, and convinced me of its great value. I draw from the material in this book--about energy management, family dynamics, self-care and more--literally every day.I highly recommend this to EVERY mom who wants to not only become a better mother, but to enjoy the experience more. Grandmothers would also benefit from passing this on to their daughters/daughters-in-law. (But make sure you read it yourself, too, so that you can understand your different approaches and, I hope, appreciate each other's styles more.) Even dads would benefit--there's a whole chapter on dads, and besides, it will help him understand his wife better. It would be a great gift for a man to give his parenting partner.Janet Penley invested 19 years in developing this material, and we spent another 2 years writing the book. When you buy this book here you get 21 years of wisdom and experience for less than $15. I can't think of a better deal."},{"Title":"MotherStyles: Using Personality Type to Discover Your Parenting Strengths","review":"This was my first time ordering. I am very pleased with the merchandise and the timely manner in which it was recieved. the only observation I have is that it did not come with a receipt and this is needed for our bookkeeper."},{"Title":"MotherStyles: Using Personality Type to Discover Your Parenting Strengths","review":"I was so excited to get this book. What a dissappointment. Being an INTJ, I feel rather isolated as a mom and I was hoping to find tips for how to interact w/ my own strong minded INTP child. I sought insight but instead I found faux psychology. The author notes a background in marketing but not psychology... she is not an authority on anything besides workshops and writing and selling books. She took MBTI and watered it down to some anemic and misguided version of itself. I thought I could possibly show up INFJ w her tests bc my T/F are rather closely scored (although I always shown a slight edge for T, having tested INTJ each time I've taken the test). But not w/ Penley's test. Because I don't enjoy play and do like order she types me as ISTJ. Sorry, but I'm a mom who doesn't really like to do imaginative play w/ kids. I was a loner my whole life, so this is no surprise as an adult. I do have a vivid imagination in my own head, but this is something I enjoy solo. ISTJ \\"Guardians\\" are traditionalists. I despise the idea of doing something a certian way just because that's the way its always been done. An INTJ always asks \\"does it work?\\" where a traditionalist ISTJ follows the rules. I have rejected religion and many social norms. I accept others who find their own path and give them credit for developing themselves into something unique. I don't think you'll find many ISTJs who do that. They become uncomfortable with those who don't follow the rules. I do like order and am good at scheduling my time, but that just means I'm a well-developed INTJ (raised by Guardians, the skills w/ structure were bound to rub off), not an ISTJ. My thoughts and approach to life are more of an indicator of my personality type than a few selected behaviours out of many behaviors Penley could have chosen. I encourage my daughter to think independently, to ask \\"why\\" and never just follow, to make logical arguements in support of her ideas if they conflict with mine... I do not fit ISTJ. This book has some good points about differing perspectives between types but Penley's testing could leave a mom thinking she is something she is not. Stick with MBTI and draw your own conclusions. The more you learn about it the more human interactions become a matter of common sense. If I could I would return this book, but since it was a gift I will be tossing it in the paper recycling."},{"Title":"MotherStyles: Using Personality Type to Discover Your Parenting Strengths","review":"I can't say this to people enough; that MBTI method typing is flawed, because of the following reasons. First, the test you take on typelogic dot com determines you internal self. Myself for example-internally I am ESTJ but in reality I am INFJ (ESTJ is my dual-the person who is the best match for my personality type). Second, as you can see from my example of testing ESTJ my internal dual-seeking self is menefesting outwardly flawing the resaults of the test thereby putting you in a pool of people you wouldn't get along with. For correct resaults-type yourself using How to Find Yourself and Your Best Match Socionics by Rod Novichkov then take the MBTI test and you'll know exactly what I'm taling about."},{"Title":"MotherStyles: Using Personality Type to Discover Your Parenting Strengths","review":"I have been an accredited MBTI trainer for 6 years - but I have this daughter who's now 5 and she's, lets say, 'spirited'. I've read lots of parenting books but none have really hit the mark - because she's not bad and most of these assume 'difficult' children - even The Spirited Child! So I bought this book - blind - don't know anyone who has it or has read it.For me the first part of the book was superfluous - it's about working out your style and whilst I understand the book has to do that for non-MBTI people - it's a little unfair for those of us that get it.Then it gets into the analysis. My first surprise is that the author has a preference for 'T' - so do I.I found the book interesting - first read. You can also put by the bed and read a bit each night - you don't need to devour at one sitting. The examples are great. There's one particular example that could have been written about me and my daughter - about sticky tape and sissors! and it was like wow - OMG - now I get it.Has it made me change my parenting style - no, will it, probably not overall, has it helped me understand my daughter more - you bet!"},{"Title":"MotherStyles: Using Personality Type to Discover Your Parenting Strengths","review":"While, no personality test can explain everything about you, the information that you can learn about YOURSELF from this book is simply incredible. I have found it invaluable in my own life. Not only did it help me recognize my parenting strengths and weaknesses, but also it helped me to stop comparing myself to other mothers around me. They've got their strengths and weaknesses - and I've got mine.Understanding your strengths helps you develop confidence as a mother. But more importantly, as a Life Coach I have learned that you MUST clearly identify your needs and weaknesses BEFORE you can hope to work on them! That's why this book is so useful.I highly recommend this book to help you understand yourself better & become the best mom you can be!"},{"Title":"MotherStyles: Using Personality Type to Discover Your Parenting Strengths","review":"I became familiar with Janet Penley's work about 10 years ago and bought her first book then. I found it to be a really useful way of thinking about how I parent (vs. the way I see others approaching parenting). It showed me that nobody can do it all, that I have certain things I'm going to good at and other areas where I will have to work harder. But it also showed me that the \\"creative\\" or super-organized moms across the street will also have areas that they will struggle with - things that I might be very good at.As my children have grown older and their personalities have emerged more fully, I have found the ideas Ms. Penley brings even more useful. She shows you how your child can have a fundamentally different way of looking at a situation that flows from his/her personality that can be just as valid as your way. Understanding these differences as a starting point leads to much more effective communication."},{"Title":"MotherStyles: Using Personality Type to Discover Your Parenting Strengths","review":"I am REALLY enjoying your book.

Great gift for a new mother."},{"Title":"MotherStyles: Using Personality Type to Discover Your Parenting Strengths","review":"This book was amazing. I always wondered why I seem to get along better with my son than my daughter. After reading this book, I realized why. My personality is INTJ (Introverted, Intuitive, Thinker, Judger), my son is an ISTJ (Introverted, Sensor, Thinker, Judger), and my daughter is an ENFP (Extroverted, Intuitive, Feeler, Perceiver).I spoke to my ex who I think is an ISTJ, and he said that he also clashes with her all the time. The book teaches way to get along with your children who have different personalities than you. This morning I tried one of the tips she gives. I was trying to dress my daughter, and I said, \\"Put your clothes on.\\" My son did it right away, and my daughter started crying. I said, \\"Let me dress as you as a fairy princess.\\" She stopped crying and put her clothes on with no issues.Definitely get this book.

As a nervous mom, this book provided the comfort I need - I just had my first child, and have been fretting about how I can \\"do right\\" by him, what I may be messing up, and how to cope with raising a son when I had been expecting a daughter!

This is a great novel. It was hard to put down. I appreciated the realism of Sasha and her girls. There is always one that will stab you in the back. Tracey M. Lewis is right on target about relationships. Men and women have been in too many bad and/or one sided relationships that when meeting/finding/running across that good man or woman it is unbelievable. Trust is gone; there has to be a catch. I am glad Ms. Lewis has brought up the unequally yoked issue. Becoming a practicing Christian is a personal thing between you and God. Love cannot make your loved one a Christian. Langston prayed for Sasha to give herself to God and all the while Sasha ignored her upbringing and that small voice. You watched Sasha struggle with today's issues: downsized out-of-a-job, family, past relationships, girlfriends and going back to school. Christian fiction was taken to another level. I am recommending this books to church friends and other. I cannot wait for the next gospel/sequel.

In The Gospel, Tracey Michae'l Lewis reveals the story of an intelligent, attractive, career woman intent on chasing her dreams like fabulous fashionistas hunting down bargains at a Prada shoe sale. Visions of running a day spa and fielding applications for a man with enough love to warm an office building take a backseat to emotional derailment from failed relationships. Through her quest for milk and honey, Sasha Renee soon learns that success, in her business and personal life, comes from digging deep and refusing to allow pride or fear to corrode accountability. In the end, The Gospel According to Sasha Renee helps us to realize that death is less of a conclusion and more a commencement."},{"Title":"The Gospel According to Sasha Renee","review":"This is the first of four books or \\"gospels' chronicling four generations of African American women. It is also Tracey Michae'l Lewis debut novel. It is well written and entertaining as well as thought provoking.

But to move forward she must face some demons and acknowledge the Spirit within her. Her job, her man and her deepest feelings of self worth are all bad. She has a dream and is stashing away the funds to make it a reality. But set backs in life make the dream seem even farther away. Once she feels she is headed in the right path of reaching her dream Mr. Right falls across her path. But will her fears and insecurities keep her for recognizing him?Langston Germaine is a professor at DePaul University and a Christian man. Placing serious relationships on hold to pursue his goal of becoming a professional might have cost him his one true love. Then he has a student who he knows is destined to be his soul mate. But will he allow the Lord to work it out for him?What happens when Christians go against their beliefs and become unevenly yoked? What pain and heartache do people inflict on themselves when they refuse to let the Holy Spirit control their lives?Not your typical Christian romance The Gospel According to Sasha Renee will entertain you as Sasha and her girls try to learn life's lessons. It will also cause for introspection and self-evaluation. The Gospel According to Sasha Renee will make you laugh, shake you head, think and shed a few tears. It has some mystery and suspense with a few surprising twists intertwined. Definitely worth picking up and spending a couple of quiet hours to read and reflect.

My expectations were not met. The book was riddled with grammatical errors and changes in tense. The writer's POV was awkward. Sasha's story started out slow, so much so that I did not want to finish the book. I struggled to do so, but did because I had paid for the download.

There are many instances where the Spirit gently coerces Sasha, but she often chooses to ignore it, which results in some drastic changes in her life.

Will Langston be able to convince Sasha to open her heart and her mind to the One who can save her?THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO SASHA RENEE was a good debut novel. The message behind the story was clear, but at times the plot and character development was not as strong as it could have been.

It taught me to research the literature of geographic economics well but not clearly. I had read it with a few socialist books on Poland and other command economies. It brought my trust in capitalism to life as well as opening my reading to socialism and social theory. Covering systems at various scales and in a geographic example type format with small maps and breakdowns of labour and supply, it illustrates, the differences of the world's nations. Some of the connections between these nations and the theory of finances is of course, confusing.Until we realise that global as a word does not belong to Wall Street but to the people of the earth, we will not get straight talk.

I've already recommended this book to friends and have passed on my copy a couple of times."},{"Title":"Labyrinth of Chaos","review":"This book has more heart, warmth, and originality than any book I have read in quite a while. I read Labyrinth of Chaos in late 2001, while on a trip, and I could not put it down. This is fiction in the tradition of Walt Whitman, a novel of the open road, and the the product of a generous and open spirit.Labyrinth of Chaos is the story of a trip taken by a young American named Alan Agrippa, through Great Britain. Agrippa is the classic young traveler, enjoying everything, meeting people, drinking in new experiences, trying to get the most of his time overseas. Agrippa is an open-minded, positive person, and I don't think he has a cross word for anyone throughout the book. I remember thinking, as I closed this book, &quot;There was not a single example of anger or negativity in this book,&quot; which is quite remarkable for a three-hundred page novel.There's not much plot to Labyrinth of Chaos, other than Alan's relationship with a French girl named Ronia. It's a &quot;picaresque,&quot; a novel in which the main plot is simply the accumulation of interesting experiences. We are treated to a detailed account of Agrippa's adventures -- his trips through city streets, museums, coffee shops, and conversations with wise scientists and philosophers and fellow hipsters.The core of the novel is found in Alan's reflections on the intersection of mysticism, psychology, physics, and the structure of the universe. He discusses his ideas with Ronia and other characters, giving the novel an interesting flavor as a &quot;novel of ideas.&quot;Some might say that some dialogue and descriptions in this book are a little stilted -- but to dwell on that issue is to miss the point. This is a book that says &quot;come join me on this adventure of life and ideas and self-creation,&quot; and to truly follow him you would have to follow your own passions and create your own work of art. Wallace doesn't indulge in the vice of so many fiction writers these days, who try to awe or intimidate their readers with long, pseudo-technical passages and footnotes that show off their questionable erudition or knowledge of trivia. The attitude of those writers is a deadening one, rigid, self-obsessed and closed-off -- &quot;You can't do this&quot; -- the very opposite of the Whitmanesque spirit in literature. Whitman, and Brian Wallace, tell you you can. And you should.If you enjoyed Labyrinth of Chaos, I would suggest another book that it reminded me of: Andre Vandenbroeck's &quot;Breaking Through: The Narrative of the Great Work&quot; (the story of an Italian filmmaker who is pursuing connections between science and spirit by investigating Paleolithic culture in Spain)."},{"Title":"Labyrinth of Chaos","review":"Finally, an American author who has a command of the Queens English.

He may approach a drug dealer, a priest or a scholar with the curiosity and innocence that perhaps only a child could muster. Clearly, his rather habitual dabbling into illegal substances plays a major role here. It is what fuels Alan's journey of self-discovery. However, although his experiementation may serve him right, he's often too busy letting us inside his mind to share in the details around him. There's a certain richness of setting missing here. For example, London seems like a rather colorless city through Alan's eyes, lacking in the sights, smells and sounds that make it such a vibrant place. He never interacts with it enough. In that sense, setting is scenery here. Labyrinth could have taken place anywhere.Alan's love interest is intriguing enough but only shines through during their rather heated sex scenes. There are some other characters lurking in the background but ultimately, they lack consequence. Alan is the star and his mystic musings the center of the story.Nevertheless, the book is intelligently written with beautifully crafted and clever language. Mr. Wallace has promise. This is a worthy trip into the mind of a most peculiar character. I'm curious to see where Alan goes next."},{"Title":"Labyrinth of Chaos","review":"In LABYRINTH OF CHAOS, Brian Wallace dramatically fulfills his self-proclaimed goal to &quot;demonstrate through a time, place, and specific characters that life is something that is filled with intrigue, mystery, and importance regardless of who you are and what you do.&quot; Indeed, Wallace's text becomes metafiction as he strikes a balance between autobiography, history, neurology, metaphysics, and the art of writing about writing. Successfully titillating and enriching the reader's senses, the narrator's naivet&eacute;, genuine goodwill and flair for encountering the unexpected brings the reader a sense of adventure and immediacy as the protagonist explores both his interior and exterior worlds.Alan Agrippa has inherited sufficient funds to support his exploration of Europe. Shortly after arriving in England he meets Ronia Vintras, an exchange student taking classes in London. Together and separately, they explore the geographical, philosophical, and sexual landscapes of our time. Alan seeks out and discovers metaphysical truths in the European landscapes, expanding to include such things as Junian individuation, quantum physics, druids, and tree fairies. Each new encounter and exploration accompanies joy in the experience and complex philosophical musings designed to make the reader the think. While not a difficult read, LABYRINTH OF CHAOS does make the reader work, reevaluating long held beliefs regarding morals, philosophy and religion.LABYRINTH OF CHAOS becomes increasingly intriguing as the pursuit of the duality of ancient and modern thinking plays out in a text that is uniquely approachable. This fictionalized novel summarizes some of our strongest philosophical minds from Plato to Fritjof Capra, yet making their theories immediate and approachable. Further, Wallace's flexible, open mind reflects the very tenets of New Physics. In addition, Wallace brings a heavy dose of Romanticism to his text; that is, a deep connection to nature shared by such great poets as Wordworth and Coolridge. With a striking balance between the scientific and the philosophical, the mundane and the metaphysical, this remarkable author charts a course to the mystic's understanding of the interconnectivity of all things. Overriding the deep philosophical reflections is a strong sense of adventure, and an overwhelming need to experience and delight in the happenstance of life. Very highly recommended.Bright Blessings, Weaver"},{"Title":"Labyrinth of Chaos","review":"This is truly a unique novel, if ever there was one. Trying to describe it is a bit of a perplexing task. Probably the best association I can make with it would be Jean Paul Sartre's \\"Nausea.\\" Sartre's novel comes to mind in that it is like a snapshot of a persona's life, as is \\"Labyrinth of Chaos.\\"In LOC it is a snapshot of a young man named Alan Agrippa. Having obtained a substantial inheritance from his late beloved uncle, Agrippa decides to spend the $$ travelling over Europe on a soul-searching expedition. Over the course of the story we follow him as he travels throughout Great Britain, Scotland, Wales and Ireland.Along the way, he meets and strikes up conversations with all sorts of people from all walks of life. Some of these people include a priest, an adolescent with an active libido, a theoretical physicist, a couple voodoo practitioners, several musicians and a beautiful & mysterious French girl who captures his heart. With these diverse personages he engages in conversations that include the topics of anthropology, philosophy, quantum mechanics, religion, history, the occult, pornography, literature, pyschedelics / drug use and much more. The book is filled with references to aspects from all sectors of life.Technically, the book is far from perfect. Wallace does a great job of describing various locales and landscapes, but much of the dialogue is wooden and somewhat \\"stilted.\\" On the upside, there is some delicious names-dropping and erudite explanations of the historical backdrops of different locations presented in the book. There is also a nice \\"quest\\" motif in the narrative in which Wallace forms a nexus between his story and Thomas Mann's \\"The Magic Mountain.\\" In fact, I would encourage people to read Mann prior to reading this work; Wallace may make a little bit more sense that way. {Of course, I would also recommend people to read Mann whether they read the present book or not, but that's a different story...}This is a very good book for anyone who wants something \\"modern\\" and perhaps a little bit off-the-wall. Be advised that some of it is [adults only] rated, tho. Not that that's a bad thing; just that it may not appeal to everyone."},{"Title":"Labyrinth of Chaos","review":"In Labyrinth of Chaos, Brian Wallace has recreated a classic literary form in a postmodern narrative of a young man's search for meaning. Wallace's insights are woven into a seamless tapestry of profound historical reflections, philosophical questions and cultural edification.The beauty and effectiveness of this novel is it's uncompromising representation of positive postmodern values, as if all the resistances to the accommodation of those values did not exist. This in no way fails to address those resistances. Rather, it portrays vigorous health of body and mind as a standing, totally positive refutation of them.Wallace's 'epic hero,' Alan Agrippa, moves progressively forward into ever greater mystical awareness through purposeful investigation of the geo-history of our mystical European heritage, made possible by the simple, fortuitous expedient of temporary liberation from the constraints of financial responsibility.In his journey, Alan pursues and finds experiences, including the experience of romantic love, that coalesce into scintillating, multi-cultural panoramas of entheogenically stimulated mystical effulgence, articulated within a context that is strikingly realistic, yet at the same time teeming with aesthetic delight by virtue of his inner creative genius. Alan represents for all an opportunity that many may experience vicariously through his journey into the deepest mysteries of life and love.Labyrinth of Chaos left me highly stimulated and totally free to contemplate the deep structural layers of meaning laid bare by Wallace's insights combined with scholarly commentary that tackles, with consummate skill incorporating the most advanced notions of purposeful genetic evolution and quantum mechanics, the difficult problem of describing mystical experience.Bravo, Brian Wallace."},{"Title":"Labyrinth of Chaos","review":"Having come to this book through reading some of the author's own reviews here on Amazon.com, I had high hopes for an intelligent read that would cut deep beyond the shallow flash that many of today's contemporary authors offer.What did I get? No shallow flash, but shallow wankery instead. This is the sort of novel many lonely boys begin to scrawl in their private notebooks sometime in high school, imagining the journey before they've actually set out upon it. Convinced that every word is magical, inspired - usually these notebooks end up boxed away, an embarassing reminder of the author's overly idealistic, underly talented youth. I should know. I had plenty of those notebooks myself. The difference is, I knew better than to try to pass my garbage off as the \\"mysticism\\" I once thought it was. Sadly, this author didn't use such good judgement.Labyrinth of Chaos (the title should have tipped me off) is a plotless, meandering book. This works sometimes. For Celine. For Henry Miller. For William Burroughs. Not for Brian Wallace. The reader follows egomaniac Alan Agrippa through flatly-told tales of his life's adventures. Likely a thinly veiled soapbox for the author's own borrowed philosophies, the prose rapidly becomes as tedious as the guy in your college dorm who droned on and on about these same notions. You remember him - he wore a lot of black, listened to Dead Can Dance and never really gave up Dungeons and Dragons.I have a bad habit.

I have an extensive vocabulary, and Brian had me reaching for the dictionary with every chapter. Purpose and flow are intriguing, and it is a satisfying read.

When presented with the opportunity to do such proofs, many people suffer from a brain cramp similar to that experienced by writers. One of the most common phrases heard when I was teaching is similar to the following, \\"I can follow the proof once it is done, but how do you think of trying those steps?\\" In this book, the author performs a marriage of complex numbers and geometry that can sometimes serve to point the aspiring geometer in the proper direction.Contrary to their name, complex numbers are easy to understand and manipulate. Only basic knowledge of algebra is essential. In this case, the author uses all of Chapter One to introduce the fundamental ideas of their use. After that, things get exciting. Applying this knowledge to geometry, we see new ways to do old, sometimes very old things. In many cases, the approach is general, in that it is easy to see how such ideas can be used to attack other problems. Large numbers of exercises are included at the end of each chapter.Worthy of inclusion in any library, this author shows that it is always possible to develop new ways to solve old problems.Published in Journal of Recreational Mathematics, reprinted with permission."},{"Title":"Los dientes de Franco: Patobiografia del general Francisco Franco a traves de las revelaciones de sus dentistas (Testigos) (Spanish Edition)","review":"historia de la dentadura del Caudillo de Espa&ntilde;a, centinela de occidente, el unico que vencio a los rojos en el campo de batalla."},{"Title":"Miracle at Midway","review":"This book was terrific to read. I was inspired to buy this book by the National Geographic special on the USS Yorktown. Miracle at Midway leaves nothing out...personal accounts from both sides. It is, however, an extremely objective account. Instead of flag-waving feelings, you're left breathing a sigh of relief. I found the account of retooling the Yorktown at Pearl to be the most inspirational aspect of this book."},{"Title":"Miracle at Midway","review":"This book is one of the best works I have read about the Pacific War and it is one of my favorite accounts of the Battle of Midway. Even though it is not a Pearl Harbor-only volume like other books by Prange, Dillon, and Goldstein, I agree with Penguin's characterization of Miracle at Midway as a sequel to At Dawn We Slept, Prange's definitive account of the events before, during, and after the Day of Infamy.Miracle at Midway picks up the narrative of events soon after the Pearl Harbor Striking Force under the command of Vice Admiral Chuichi Nagumo returns to Japan, hailed as heroes by everyone in the Empire. It then, economically and without bogging down in detail, describes the events that led to the battle of Midway, a small atoll at the far end of the Hawaiian island chains.Attention to detail is given to the planning and execution of both American and Japanese operations in the Midway battle. Prange and his co-authors point out that Midway was Pearl Harbor in reverse; the Japanese, who had been careful and canny in December 1941, were overconfident and somewhat sloppy in planning and executing Operation MI. The Americans, who had been caught unprepared six months earlier, were able to break Japan's JN-25 Naval Communications Code and set a carefully laid ambush in the path of Japan's mighty First Air Fleet.This book is highly readable (though I prefer Walter Lord's Incredible Victory), and I give it a strong recommendation, even though it has very few pictures and even fewer maps."},{"Title":"Miracle at Midway","review":"This has been the only book I have read so far on the Battle of Midway. I have read previous books on Pearl Harbour by the same author and I was looking forward to a good account of this battle. Overall I found the book covered all the details with numerous first hand accounts from participants from both sides but it wasn't a book that held me spellbound and glued to the narrative. It was a good working text that gave you a thorough account of the battle and was unbiased in its approach. I am sorry to say however that I was looking for a little bit more to draw me into the story."},{"Title":"Miracle at Midway","review":"Thousands of airline passengers pass through the original Chicago Municipal Airport each day. The facility has been in existence for so long that the original dedication plaque bears the name of the city's last Republican mayor. Although the airport has been surpassed by the larger O'Hare, it is exceptionally convenient and affordable, once you reach it. The recent renovations and upgrades look great.During the Forties, the airport was renamed in honor of a significant naval victory in the Pacific. More recently, a modest sculpture has been added to recognize the sacrifice and heroism of those pilots and sailors who achieved the naval Miracle in the battle for the sea lanes and the fueling facilities near Midway Island. The outnumbered American fleet triumphed due to daring leadership, long hours spent deciphering and analyzing enemy codes, inclement weather and a large measure of good luck.Historian Gordon Prange did not live to complete this book; two of his students completed the task. Nevertheless, it is a fitting companion to Prange's acclaimed account of the Japanese attack upon Pearl Harbor, \\"At Dawn We Slept.\\" Both books are balanced and provide candid assessments of the leadership and personnel of both navies.Thousands of busy commuters pass through Chicago Midway Airport without stopping to reflect upon those singular events or pausing to look at the sculpture, but, after reading this stirring book, I am no longer one of them."},{"Title":"Miracle at Midway","review":"Gordon Prange, author of the acclaimed \\"At Dawn We Slept\\", has written a masterful book about how America struck back against the Japanese at a tiny island 1000 miles west of Pearl Harbor: Midway.By June of 1942, the Japanese had rolled up an incredible list of victories. But beginning with the Doolittle raid in April of 1942 abd followed by the Battle of the Coral Sea in May, the Americans had finally begun to check the Japanese advance. The Japanese, infected with \\"victory disease\\", nevertheless felt that if they could draw the U.S. Pacific fleet away from Pearl Harbor, they would be able to destroy the remains and continue on toward Hawaii and perhaps the West Coast.However, the Americans had one huge advantage over the Japanese. The Americans were able to read the Japanese JN-25 naval code, and this provided a wealth of information as to where the Japanese planned to strike next. Under the command of Joe Rochefort, the code-breakers at Pearl Harbor soon had enough information to predict that the Japanese were going to strike at Midway. The Americans would be waiting for them.On one fateful day in June, 1942, the tide of the war in the Pacific turned against the Japanese. In the span of only a few minutes, three Japanese aircraft carriers, all veterans of the Pearl Harbor attack, were sunk by American dive bombers. The fourth Japanese carrier was sunk later in the day. The Americans lost the carrier USS Yorktown, but it was a relatively small price to pay for such a smashing victory. American industrial capacity had increased by this time, and new carriers would soon be coming into service, so the loss of the Yorktown was diminished. The Japanese, however, had nowhere near the capacity of the United States. The Japanese never recovered from this terrible blow.I've read Prange's excellent analysis of Pearl Harbor, and this book does just as good of a job describing the battle of Midway. From the initial sighting of the Japanese fleet to the final withdrawl, Prange describes the battle in a manner that will keep the reader enthralled throughout. Prange earned the title of \\"The Dean of Pearl Harbor\\" with his masterful trilogy, now he has added the battle of Midway to that impressive list. I highly recommend this great book. Read it and discover how a small American fleet destroyed a vastly superior enemy force and turned the tide forever against the Japanese."},{"Title":"Miracle at Midway","review":"This book was a replacement for one that I had lost. One of the best reads about the battle that I have read. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Miracle at Midway","review":"A great volume on the battle of midway. Well researched & written. A study of the battle very in depth. Covers both sides. I like this book along with Midway, the battle that doomed Japan & Shattered Sword as the best books written on the subject. Get it."},{"Title":"Miracle at Midway","review":"The Battle of Midway stands as the single most important American battle fought in WWII, and quite possibly was the most important engagment ever fought by the US Navy. In many ways, it was truly a 'miracle' for the American forces, as Prange's title claims. And he conveys the sense of urgency accompanying the battle on both sides well. Furthermore, his account is factually exhaustive (and adequately footmarked, most of the time). But Prange's writing style is too self-indulgent and verbose to handle the multitude of names, locations, and times thrown at the reader. Ironically (and frustratingly) he praises certain commanders for the sparse, just-the-facts style of their reports, orders, and so on. And yet Prange himself lacks any economy of words. This poor writing and the sparcity of maps &amp; photographs (to serve as refrences) slowed the text down to a monotonous grind.Nevertheless, Prange's attentiveness to facts, though obscured at times due to his writing style, is a breath of historical fresh air. This is very much an historian's account of the battle, and worth reading--just do a lot of skimming."},{"Title":"Miracle at Midway","review":"Prange's Miracle ad Midway has been supplanted as best in the field byShattered Sword: The Untold Story of the Battle of Midwayby Parshall & Tully. Parshall & Tully carefully lay out the argument that, if anything, the odds were actually against the Japanese winning the battle of Midway. The Japanese were counting on surprise, which they didn't have. Allied codebreaking took away the element of surprise. The Japanese thought at most they would be fighting two American carriers, and that would be after they suppressed ground-based aviation on Midway. Thanks to superbly expedited damage repair on the Yorktown, the Americans has three carriers ready and waiting for the Japanese. In addition, the Americans reinforced Midway island's land-based air to the extent resources and space allowed. When you add the increased complement of fighters on American carriers (thanks to the introduction of the folding-wing F4F-4), the Americans had the edge in total airpower. American airpower could be more effectively used because the Americans had effective ground and ship-based radar fighter direction. Japanese lack of effective radar made it much easier to mount a surprise attack on Japanese carriers."},{"Title":"Miracle at Midway","review":"After the devestation of the American Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, conventional wisdom held that it would take months, maybe years, for the Americans to recover and be of sufficient strength to mount a defense and ultimate counter-attack. But several key issues proved this wrong: America had already been making war material for Lend/Lease and the aircraft carriers the Japanese were hoping would be at Pearl Harbor were not at Pearl Harbor. Midway would be the turning point in the war and this book gives a chronology to the events leading up to the battle and the battle itself. This battle, more than any before it, would affirm the place of aviation in battle. The battleships in this battle never saw each other, much less fight each other. In the battle, America sustained damaged to its carrier fleet, while Japan took a huge hit upon its carrier forces. This would set the tone for the rest of the Pacific Theater, as the author succintly points out. The Japanese had to have islands to fly and refuel aircraft; the Americans still had their mobile, floating aircraft islands. A must read for anyone who wants to know the turning point in the Pacific Theatre in WWII."},{"Title":"Miracle at Midway","review":"Miracle at Midway is the account of the Battle of Midway according to research accumulated over many years by Gordon Prange, best known for his work on the Pearl Harbor attack, entitled At Dawn We Slept. Miracle at Midway is considered the sequel to At Dawn We Slept, and like the earlier book was published after Prange's death by his assistants Goldstein and Dillon. The text is heavily footnoted and cites all the main primary and secondary sources that were available in the first few decades following the war. The narrative closely follows that of Walter Lord's Incredible Victory, and although not nearly as dramatic, unlike Lord's book, it can be used as a starting point for research due to the extensive footnoting.There will always be debate concerning the various events of this most famous battle, and whether this or that decision of commanders at various levels on either side could have caused the outcome to be different. The most enduring lesson I took from Miracle at Midway has to do with that age-old principle of military science: that of separating enemy's intentions from his capabilities. In the case of Midway, both sides abandoned the safer side of the argument and concentrated on intentions rather than capabilities. The critical difference was that the Japanese were basing their estimation of American intentions on what amounted to wishful thinking, whereas the Americans were basing it on intelligence gathered by intercepting and deciphering of Japanese communications. As a result of this intelligence, Lt. Commander Layton was able to predict the time and place of first contact with Nagumo's force within five minutes, five degrees and five miles of that which actually occurred (page 102 in the 1982 edition). Prange rightly credits Nimitz for having the conviction of believing Layton and his faith in Station Hypo, the intelligence-gathering organization. Without the complete trust in the intelligence operation, Nimitz would have had to prepare for all possibilities, instead of actual intentions, and then it would have been impossible to catch Nagumo so completely by surprise."},{"Title":"Miracle at Midway","review":"It's incredible to believe that the turning point in the Pacific came down to the ninety seconds it took Max Leslie's and Wade McCluskey's SBD dive bombers to destroy three Japanese flattops. But without the sacrifice of John Waldron's Torpedo 8 Squadron it never could have happened. This book tells about it all: the over confidence of the Japanese High Command, the ingenuity and brilliance of American Intelligence, the tenacity and guile of the U S commanders and the bravery and skill of the Navy Pilots. This book is riveting, entertaining, and above all, inspiring! A must read."},{"Title":"Miracle at Midway","review":"Even when dealing with historical events that are, by their very nature, action-packed, it can be hard to balance storytelling with in-depth research and historical precision. While Prange's 'Miracle at Midway' may not be the taut thriller 'Incredible Victory,' say, is, it more than makes up for this alleged deficiency with the quality of its research and presentation.Gordon W. Prange and his literary assistants/successors Goldstein and Dillon are best known for their multi-volume exploration of the before-during-and-after of the attack on Pearl Harbor, arguably the most-written (and argued) about event in American history. Impressive and valuable as their work on Pearl Harbor is, few would argue it's the final word on what happened and why.Fortunately, Midway isn't enshrouded in political agendas and conspiracy theories like Pearl Harbor has become. It's still a fairly straightforward clash of military and naval forces. Consequently, it's much easier to argue that Prange has painted a fairly definitive portrait of what Fuchida Mitsuo later called 'the battle that doomed Japan.' One of the beautiful (and trying) things about history is that 'final judgment' is never rendered on any event -- new evidence and interpretations can always change the way we view things. Serious historians and casual readers alike will find Prange's work a valuable set of lenses through which to view this critical moment in world history."},{"Title":"Miracle at Midway","review":"This book gives a great amount aof incite into what the battle was really like. It shows you the strategy of both ides and how they were either successful or disasterous. I would reccomend that anyone, with more then just a minor interest in this battle, get this book"},{"Title":"Miracle at Midway","review":"The Battle of Midway was truly an inspired victory for the United States. Facing a larger, more powerful Japanese fleet, the United States overcame tremendous odds to turn the tide of the Pacific War. In some ways, the battle was a lesson in management. While Yamamoto micromanaged the battle from preparation until defeat, Nimitz properly delegated responsibilities to those involved in planning and fighting. He relied on Naval Intelligence's deciphering of Japanese codes when others were dismissive of their accuracy. He also provided Admirals Fletcher and Spruance room to maneuver and strategize during the battle. Prange does a wonderful job of explaining these and other components to the battle. He describes in vivid detail both the Japanese and American approach to Midway.In some ways, the 1942 Battle of Midway resembled the 1940 Battle of Britain - both the United Kingdom and the United States overcame tremendous odds in these two clashes to emerge victorious. While much war was left to fight, the Battle of Britain and the Battle of Midway were pivotal in their importance and represent the conviction that, in the end, freedom always wins. Thus, Midway was one of those moments in history when things went right for the right reason."},{"Title":"Miracle at Midway","review":"I am fascinated by the Battle of Midway. In June 1942 the Japanese were trying to launch a surprise attack at Midway, but the Americans were able to turn the tables and sink four Japanese aircraft carriers. It was a major setback for the Japanese. Many on both sides agree that this was the deciding point for the Japanese. They went from being on the offensive to fighting a defensive war.My interest in Midway was first peaked with Victor Davis Hanson's \\"Carnage and Culture.\\" The book covers several \\"Landmark Battles in the Rise of Western Power.\\" Professor Hanson spends fifty five pages on Midway. One of the main points is that the American culture allowed greater flexibility at the individual level which paid great dividends. For example several times American pilots were directed to certain locations to attack the Japanese fleet. When the pilots arrived, they didn't see any ships. Rather than wait for instructions, they went looking for the ships. Invariably they made the right decisions and the final result was the complete destruction of all four carriers.\\"Miracle at Midway\\" covers the Battle of Midway in great detail. Four hundred pages summarize years of research. To prepare for this book the author waded through dozens of diaries and hundreds of pages of government records. This research was on both the American side and the Japanese side. The author interviewed many of the survivors.The result is an engaging book. It was hard for me to put down. The author do a great job of taking the reader through the events. It is easy to follow what was happening, even with the story taking place simultaneously at several locations.The book also does a great job of showing the \\"fog of war.\\" Often times leaders on both sides were forced to make major decisions with faulty or incomplete information. Because of the exhaustive research the author have the details from both sides. I was surprised by how many times a pilot would claim to hit a ship of a certain time, but the records from the other side would show the ship was a smaller class. Sometimes the author was not able to find a record of any ship being attacked.If you want to know more about Midway this is a great book to read."},{"Title":"Miracle at Midway","review":"With Walter Lord's book, it is the venerable work on the battle in the English language.

The story of Admirals Spruance and Nimitz taking the great risk of trying to \\"ambush\\" the vastly superior Japanese fleet is told in scholary detail, while still being written for intelligent, general audiences. Prange was an official historian of the U.S. Army, and interviewed scores of men and officers on both sides of the battle. The result is an emintently readable story of good luck and great bravery on both sides of the conflict. If you like this book, you should also read Prange's \\"At Dawn We Slept,\\" another brilliantly researched and written book about the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor; both of these books are excellent reads. I like them so much that I routinely re-read them every other year or so. Yes, they are THAT good."},{"Title":"Miracle at Midway","review":"The Battle of Midway was clearly the most important battle of the Pacific War. Up until that point, the Japanese had been having their way with an unbroken string of victories. The Doolittle Raid was the pinprick that brought the Imperial Fleet to Midway and even that battle, in its earliest stages, was unfolding much in favor of the Japanese.However, in just a few minutes, dive-bombers from the Yorktown and Enterprise devastated three of the four Japanese carriers and in that instant turned the entire balance of power in the Pacific around. The fourth carrier, now outnumbered by the three American carriers, was sent to the bottom later in the day.Miracle at Midway is a focused and factual account of that battle. It is missing much of the pathos and human touch of Walter Lord's Incredible Victory but it is a good compliment to that work.There is nothing not to like here. It reads well, has first hand accounts from both sides and only speculates when the facts are inconsistent. Prange is a meticulous historian who does not disappoint with this book.John E. NevolaAuthor of The Last Jump - A Novel of World War II"},{"Title":"Miracle at Midway","review":"Prange painstakingly recreates the events leading up to Midway, and the battle itself--no small feat, considering the size of the forces involved and the confusion and contradicting accounts inherent in any naval action.As this is a historical account, rather than a novel, it may be a tad dry and technical at times, but Prange never loses sight of the human beings involved in the action. If you liked &quot;Battle of the River Plate,&quot; you will probably like this"},{"Title":"Miracle at Midway","review":"Very readable and enjoyable, and packed with interesting details. Because of extensive interviews and exhaustive research, the authors have provided us with an authoritative account of the events and people behind a naval battle with no equal. It gives both sides of the picture and pulls no punches. A great and inspiring read."},{"Title":"Miracle at Midway","review":"Reading the new WWII novel, The Triumph and the Glory, rekindled my interest in the Pacific war, and spurred me to read the Gordon Prange books, which I'd meant to do long ago. Miracle at Midway presents both sides of this crucial battle in fine style, and creates great suspense even though we all know the outcome. A great book!"},{"Title":"Miracle at Midway","review":"This is one book that you definately want to buy if you are interested in this battle. It tells the tale of this amazing battle from its roots to the very ending and analyzes the tactics and mistakes. Narrative is amazing and the appendices are very comperhensive."},{"Title":"Miracle at Midway","review":"I bought this book being fascinated with Pacific War and Battle at Midway for last 10 years. I have read &quot;At Dawn We Slept&quot; from the same authors, and I find &quot;Miracle At Midway&quot; far more vivid and interesting. The story is very detailed, but on the other side rather easy to follow and keeps you on, so you feel you are reading some interesting novel, rather than documentary."},{"Title":"Miracle at Midway","review":"This is a pretty thorough study of the famous battle. I think Walter Lord's classic volume is better written -- Lord was a better storyteller. Prange's writing is, as other reviewers pointed out, sometime unnecessarily flowery, resorting to some forced, obscure metaphors and analogies. On the other hand, Prange's book has a lot more raw data -- quotes from documents, diaries and interviews.If you have to read only one book about Midway, I would still recommend Lord's book, but if you are a Midway junkie of sort, then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Miracle at Midway","review":"This is the first book I've read on Midway and I must give the author his due, however, I found it to be a bit dry and short on the narrative (which was much ballyhooed on the cover). If you want 'just the facts' you'll like this book, otherwise look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Miracle at Midway","review":"Despite his interviews with Japanese naval officers, apparently the co-authors who wrote this book after Mr. Prange's death did not carefully check the veracity of some of the material relied upon, namely Fuchida's book.That book was inaccurate in a number of respects and Prange, et. al. relied on it for much information. The best example was the US dive bombers hit that Japanese carriers which had flight decks full of strike aircraft ready to attack Midway at a moment's notice. Further research has revealed that Japanese aircraft were in the carriers' hangers at the time they were hit.Overall, this is an excellent book but the definitive work on Midway has yet to be written."},{"Title":"Miracle at Midway","review":"In Chapter 31, the authors make a big deal about the use of the singular &quot;enemy carrier&quot; instead of the plural &quot;enemy carriers&quot; by the Japanese admirals as proof of the confusion the Japanese were in. But the Japanese language does not distinguish between singluar and plural forms so this is just an artifact of the English translation. This makes you wonder just how many conclusions the authors jumped to based on some poor English translation of the Japanese material."},{"Title":"Miracle at Midway","review":"Just how fortunate the United States was in winning the closely contested navy engagement at Midway in the central Pacific in mid 1942 is evident to any reader of this very well documented and quite balanced account of one of the largest and most famous exchanges between the US navy and their Japanese counterparts during the course of World War Two. By using extensive inputs from both Japanese and American participants and observers of the sea battle, the authors thread together a memorable and engaging narrative of the events leading up to and involving both sides during the summer months of that fateful year. It was one for the record books, and one that demonstrated conclusively that the rules of war at sea had changed forever from one dominated by capital ships like battleships and cruisers to one dominated by aircraft carriers and attack airplanes.In the devastating aftermath of Pearl Harbor, the American Navy was looking for an opportunity to engage the Japanese in a \\"mano-a-mano\\" confrontation, hoping to even the odds and shorten the war by using what we felt would be surprise and tactics to overcome the numerical advantage the Japanese enjoyed in numbers of both ships (especially in terms of aircraft carriers) and launchable aircraft. Even though the Japanese had blundered badly at the battle of the Coral Sea, they left the scene believing the fracas had been won, and that they had further damaged the American fleet by sinking three carriers. And though the U.S. Navy did in fact limp away having lost some of its few carriers either through sinking or damage, in actuality they had inflicted more damage than they had incurred. Furthermore, soon one of the badly damaged U. S. Navy carriers (the Yorktown) would be repaired and ready to sail in support of the Midway engagement.Also, by cracking certain aspects of the Japanese Navy's wireless communication codes, the Americans were able to determine not only what the Japanese were ostensibly planning in terms of a strategy to take Midway, but also what the specific positioning and disposition of the various aspects of the Japanese naval force would be. Obviously, this information added to the element of surprise gave the Americans a huge tactical advantage, and made victory much more possible. Yet it did not guarantee anything. It was the tactical brilliance and contemporaneous innovation of the on-site commanders in the American force that won the day. In a series of engagements that did not change the course of the battle until the last few remaining waves of American aircraft suddenly sank or damaged the majority of the Japanese carriers, the Americans succeeded both through their own daring and a few fatal tactical errors on the part of the Japanese commanders.The results were devastating for the Japanese, who never again could muster the kind of raw carrier power, or just as importantly, ever replace the huge number of experienced carrier-based aircraft pilots needed to successfully engage and threaten the expanding American task forces that within another 12 to 18 months would virtually transform the character of the war in the Pacific, leading the Japanese into waging an almost suicidal war of attrition which they had no chance to win. This is a well-written, well-documented, and entertaining book that helps the reader to understand just how critical to both the Americans and the Japanese the fateful naval engagement at Midway was, and how the results determined the course of the rest of the war in the Pacific. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Miracle at Midway","review":"In the same tradition as At Dawn We Slept, Miracle At Midway engulfs and captivates the reader. This book describes in great detail both American and Japanese plans for battle. The apprehensions of the Japanese staff to approve the Midway mission are described, as well as Washington's uncertainty of the Japanese intentions. Many believed that Japan would try to attack Hawaii or the West Coast. Thanks to the codebreakers, Midway was found to be the true objective. Prange describes in great detail how the brave torpedo bomber pilots flew undaunted against the Japanese carriers, clearing the way for the deadly attacks by the Dauntless dive bomber pilots. Also, the Japanese blunders in rearming their aircraft after the Midway strike are described. This book is a must read for any fan of naval warfare."},{"Title":"Miracle at Midway","review":"Gordon Prange, the late author of At Dawn We Slept, Miracle at Midway, Pearl Harbor, the Verdict of History and The Pearl Harbor Papers does an unmatched job of researching the beginnings of the Pacific War from the Japanese perspective, interviewing many of the participants of the Nihon Kaigun (Imperial Japanese Navy) especially the Kido Butai (First Striking Force). Midway was an extremely close call and victory for the Japanese might have meant conquest of Hawaii and therefore a war lasting some two years longer for America (my opinion). Prange excellently presents the intelligence dilemma and the precise interpretation which presented Admiral Nimitz with his opportunity to ambush Nagumo Chuichi and his four carriers. The author gives credit to the American commanders, Spruance and Fletcher for their flexibility and all the Americans for their courage and stamina. Midway was won by American naval airmen and Prange makes that clear."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:S,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},B=["disabled"],E={key:0},H={key:1};function O(n,o,s,u,r,i){const c=m("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",x,[(e(!0),t(g,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(e(),w(c,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",H,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",E,"See more"))],8,B)):p("",!0)])}const q=d(M,[["render",O],["__scopeId","data-v-1944969a"]]),R=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/51.md","filePath":"quotes/51.md"}'),j={name:"quotes/51.md"},G=Object.assign(j,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(q)]))}});export{R as __pageData,G as default};
