By having at their disposal a comprehensive textbook that offers ample material for a full-year composition course, instructors teaching aone-termcourse can make various selections from Chapters 1-17, from whatever types of specialized writing suits the needs of their students, and from the appropriate essays in the reader. As well, because the authors believe strongly that an effective composition textbook should address students directly, they've aimed for a conversational yet clear style that invites students into the book, lessens their apprehensions about writing, and provides a model for their own prose. This style complements the authors' strong student-based approach to writing, and together they help create a text that genuinely meets student needs.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=c5MXAQAAMAAJ&dq=Strategies+for+Successful+Writing:+A+Rhetoric,+Research+Guide+and+Reader&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thoughts and advice from an old cattleman","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=TAwhAgAACAAJ&dq=Thoughts+and+advice+from+an+old+cattleman&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Odd Vegetable Cookbook","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=4QuEtgAACAAJ&dq=Odd+Vegetable+Cookbook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Corporal Works","description":"Practical suggestions, tips, and ideas for parents to practice the corporal works of mercy in the home, plus reflection questions and a prayer for God's guidance in our pursuit of the \\"little way\\" of the family.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=X17vjwEACAAJ&dq=Corporal+Works&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mystical concepts in Chassidism: An introduction to kabbalistic concepts and doctrines","description":"An excellent guide to the intricate concepts of Jewish mysticism found in Chabad Chasidic philosphy.

Willard nineteenth-century America's most renowned and influential Woman had been hidden away in a cupboard at the National WCTU headquarters, and its importance eluded Willard's biographers. Writing Out My Heart publishes for the first time substantial portions of the forty-nine volumes rediscovered in 1982. They open a window on the remarkable inner life of this great public figure and cast her in a new light. No other female political leader of the period left a private record like this. Best known for her powerful leadership of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU), at that time the nation's largest organized body of women, Willard was a world-class reform leader and feminist. How she achieved this stature has been documented. This compelling journal reveals why. Written during her teens, twenties, and fifties, the journal documents the creation of Frances Willard's self. At the same time, it often reads like a good novel. It stands as one of the most explicit and painful records in the nineteenth century of one woman's coming to terms with her love for women in a heterosexual world. Other sections reveal what impelled Willard to reform the nature and depth of the religious dimension of her life a dimension not yet adequately explored by any biographer. Here we see her growing commitment to the \\"cause of woman.\\" The volumes written in her late middle age give insight into the years when, world famous, she was part of the transatlantic network of reform, battling ill health, dealing with controversy in the WCTU, and grieving for her mother, a lifelong figure of emotional support. This finale concludes one of the most fascinating of the journal's themes: the nineteenth-century confrontation with sickness and death. Drawn from one of the richest sources in documentary history, knowledgeably introduced and annotated, Writing Out My Heart is a biographical goldmine, rich in the themes and institutions central to women's lives in nineteenth-century America.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=yFnMGqzeauUC&dq=Writing+Heart:+Bg+Bd&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"El Shaddai the Musical (Satb)","description":"An all-in-one resource that helps both the music director and pastor plan the worship services for each Sunday and holy day of the year, the United Methodist Music and Worship Planner 2014-2015; is lectionary based and places at one's fingertips a calendar format that helps plan the entire choir year from September through August, reproducible worship planning forms, suggestions for prayers, solos, anthems, visuals, and much more.

This great wolf is just one of the animals whose true stories come to life in this engrossing collection of tales by the celebrated naturalist Ernest Thompson Seton (1860-1946). Combining scientific observations of animals in their natural habitats with a romantic vision of nature and the narrative skills of a born storyteller, Seton created an extraordinary collection of tales that gave the animal story new force and believability as a literary genre. Critically and popularly acclaimed upon its initial appearance in 1898, Wild Animals I Have Known remains, more than a century later, the best-known and best-loved of his works. Each tale focuses on an individual creature: the clever crow, Silverspot; Raggylug, a young cottontail rabbit; the author's errant hound, Bingo; Redruff, a Don Valley partridge; a wild horse known as The Mustang; Vixen, The Springfield Fox; and Wully, faithful sheep dog by day and treacherous killer by night. Seton offers affectionate but realistic portraits of each animal, stressing the commonality between his subjects and their human neighbours. In addition to his popular wildlife stories, the author is well known for his work as an illustrator and painter. This edition faithfully reproduces the layout of the original volume, as well as all 200 of the author's distinctive illustrations.

The region included today in the states of California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas formed the far northern frontier of New Spain in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. After 1821 it became a part of the newly independent Mexico, which soon lost the land north of the Rio Bravo (or the Rio Grande) to the expanding United States. Explored here are the varying experiences over nearly 350 years of Mexicans living in lands north of the Rio Bravo. Professor Gomez-Quinones examines Mexicans' interactions first with Indians and then Anglos and delineates what changes occurred in Mexican and Mexican-American identity and political consciousness. This new interpretation of Mexicans in borderlands history emerges from a wide-ranging analysis including politics and governance, repression and violence, gender and ethnicity, hegemony and ideology, and cultural and social change.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=wEwUAAAAYAAJ&dq=Roots+of+Chicano+Politics,+1600-1940&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Better Homes and Gardens Great Cooking for Two","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=saj-twEACAAJ&dq=Better+Homes+and+Gardens+Great+Cooking+for+Two&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Claude Monet Argenteuil Pocket Address Book","description":"Practice your strokes in the garden with this lovely notebook inspired by Claude Monet s artwork and words.

Bush on God and Country: The President Speaks Out About Faith, Principle, and Patriotism","description":"Although he left office nearly 20 years ago, Ronald Reagan remains a potent symbol for the conservative movement. The Bush administration frequently invokes his legacy as it formulates and promotes its fiscal, domestic, and foreign policies. His name is watchword for campus conservatives who regard him in a way that borders on hero worship. Conservative media pundits often equate the term \\"Reagan-esque\\" with personal honor, fiscal rectitude, and unqualified success in dealing with foreign threats. But how much of the Reagan legacy is based on fact, how much on idealized myth? And what are the reasons - political and otherwise - behind the mythmaking? \\"Deconstructing Reagan\\" is a fascinating study of the interplay of politics and memory concerning our fortieth president.

They comprise a masterpiece not only of personal testimony but of intelligent witness to that which is most lasting and fundamental, though often most elusive and difficult to achieve, in human life and culture. Religion presumable constitutes the most important set of relationships that can be cultivated in a person. Yet religion is often the most readily misunderstood and maligned. Schleiermacher's aim in these addresses is to penetrate the excrescences and the corruptions of so-called religion to reach its vital heart so as to clarify what religion essentially is, to suggest how it is to be found, to consider how it may be cultivated, and perhaps also to stimulate a responding chord of sensitively and devotion among his hearers. He is not trying to put something over on anyone. In tolerant, open-hearted response to familiar attitudes he is simply replying, again and again: \\"Is the situation really what you say? Consider this!\\" Or: \\"Yes, you are entirely correct, but that is not religion. You are looking in the wrong place.\\" Or: \\"You are moving in the right direction but in the wrong way.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=r8knAAAAYAAJ&dq=On+religion:+Addresses+in+response+to+its+cultured+critics+(Research+in+theology)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Uncommon Wisdom: Conversations With Remarkable People","description":"Written for anyone who wants to know the philosophies of key figures in New Age thought, here is an introduction to serious New Age thinking.

Bij Pixar is een unieke omgeving gecre?erd met processen die creativiteit beschermen en die ingaan tegen conventies: - Geef een goed idee aan een middelmatig team en ze verkloten het. Geef een middelmatig idee aan een fantastisch team en ze repareren het of verzinnen iets beters. - Als je er niet naar streeft om het onzichtbare zichtbaar te maken en het te begrijpen, dan ben je slecht voorbereid om leiding te geven. - Managers zijn er niet om risico s te vermijden. Ze moeten een omgeving cre?ren waar het veilig is voor anderen om risico s te nemen. - De kosten om fouten te voorkomen zijn vaak hoger dan de kosten om fouten te herstellen. - De communicatiestructuur van het bedrijf is niet gelijk aan de organisatiestructuur. Iedereen moet elkaar kunnen praten. - Ga er niet vanuit dat algemene overeenstemming leidt tot verandering  zelfs als iedereen aan boord is, kost het veel energie om een groep in beweging te krijgen.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Yu5hBAAAQBAJ&dq=New+Ideas+about+New+Ideas&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Diamond Life","description":"Have you ever wondered why you are here? \\"Diamond Life\\" approaches the way you look at God, yourself and others.

While the significance of Gandhi s thought and life to our times is undeniable it is widely assumed that he did not serve any discipline and cannot be considered a systematic thinker. Despite an overwhelming body of scholarship and literature on his life and thought the presuppositions of Gandhi s experiments, the systematic nature of his intervention in modern political theory and his method have not previously received sustained attention. Addressing this lacuna, the book contends that Gandhi s critique of modern civilization, the presuppositions of post-Enlightenment political theory and their epistemological and metaphysical foundations is both comprehensive and systematic. Gandhi s experiments with truth in the political arena during the Indian Independence movement are studied from the point of view of his conscious engagement with method and theory rather than merely as a personal creed, spiritual position or moral commitment. The author shows how Gandhi s experiments are illustrative of his theoretical position, and how they form the basis of his opposition to the foundations of modern western political theory and the presuppositions of the modern nation state besides envisioning the foundations of an alternative modernity for India, and by its example, for the world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=EDrjBAAAQBAJ&dq=Theory&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Total Aikido: The Master Course (Bushido--The Way of the Warrior)","description":"Explains the principles, and basic postures and movements of aikido with special emphasis on key points to perfect one's technique, develop greater strength, and increase one's speed","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=1jofOYKrMM8C&dq=Total+Aikido:+The+Master+Course+(Bushido--The+Way+of+the+Warrior)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Evil's Niece","description":"1890s New Orleans keeps its secrets like a sultry courtesan, but when the prim and proper Miss Eve spied Chapin, her husband, with a little blonde secret of his own, her anger turns to longing.

From a strictly presentist perspective, the investigation of this subject contributes to the historiography of colonialism and of Latin America's relations with the major world powers. In addition, it rounds out the story of foreign interests in the emancipation of Spanish and Portuguese America, while at the same time shedding new light on the history of Russian overseas expansion. The study probes the major determinants of Russian responses to the struggle for independence of colonial Latin America and evaluates, from a European perspective, the actual impact of tsarist policy on the course of those historic events. Drawing on a wide range of printed materials and on hitherto unused manuscript sources from the archives and libraries of Spain, Portugal, Brazil, and the USSR, it isolates Russian New World objectives during the first decades of the nineteenth century and relates those objectives to the formulation of tsarist policy toward the insurgent Iberian colonies.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kGnUBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lives of the Poets: A Selection (Oxford English Texts)","description":"'If a man is to write A Panegyrick, he may keep vices out of sight; but if he professes to write A Life, he must represent it really as it was.' In the last of his major writings, Samuel Johnson looked back over the previous two centuries of English Literature in order to describe the personalities as well as the achievements of the leading English poets. The major Lives - of Milton, Dryden, Swift, and Pope - are memorable cameos of the life of writing in which Johnson is as attentive to human frailty as to literary prowess. The shorter Lives preserve some of Johnson's most piercing, critical judgements. Unsentimental, opinionated, and quotable, The Lives of the Poets continues to influence the reputations of the writers concerned. It is one of the greatest works of English criticism, but also one of the most humanly diverting. This selection of the Lives of ten of the most important poets draws its text from Roger Lonsdale's authoritative complete edition. ABOUT THE SERIES: For over 100 years Oxford World's Classics has made available the widest range of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, helpful notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=D58tJKAYtaMC&dq=Lives+of+the+Poets:+A+Selection+(Oxford+English+Texts)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sweet Zen: Dharma Talks from Cheri Huber","description":"Sweet Zen is an impressive compendium of clear and inspiring teachings showcasing Zen Buddhist approaches to spiritual practice.

Fifteen years later, Japan was on its way to becoming the only non-Western nation in the nineteenth century with a modern centralized bureaucratic state and industrial economy. This book is a study of the Meiji Restoration that changed the face of Japan. Prominent historian Albert M. Craig tells its story through that of the domain of Choshu--whose role in the formation of modern Japan was not unlike that of Prussia in Germany--during the fifteen crucial years between 1853 and 1868. Whereas previous studies have stressed the role of discontented lower samurai and frustrated rich merchants and peasants in this transition, claiming that they provided the motive power behind the political movements of the Restoration period, this work sharply challenges these earlier interpretations. Craig instead emphasizes the vitality of traditional values in Japan's early reaction to the West and foregrounds the critical contribution of the old society to the formation of the new Meiji state. Choshu in the Meiji Restoration is a seminal work for scholars and students of Japanese history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=HhEEd9QkPxIC&dq=Choshu+in+the+Meiji+Restoration+(Studies+of+Modern+Japan)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Low bridge and punk pungs","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=j23mSgAACAAJ&dq=Low+bridge+and+punk+pungs&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"From behind the plate","description":"The most anticipated J.

This is a book on how to build one of these beautiful boats from start to finish. Over the years, many hundreds of these craft have been built so hat the methods of construction details have been worked out and refined to an unusual degree. For their size, these lobseterboats withstand some of the harshest possible use, as most of them fish all winter off the stormy coast of Maine. Such a boat has to be good to survive. There are differences in the boats from one part of the coast to another, and from one boat to another within an area. But the boats from Beals Island and Jonesport have always been highly regarded, especially for their graceful good looks and high speed. The late Will Frost s boats were always advanced for their day, and it was not at all strange that during Prohibition his shops on Beals Island and Jonesport were engaged to build some fast, high-powered rumrunners. His influence has much to so with the modern Maine lobsterboat as we know it today. Not a little of Will Frost s thinking about lobsterboats was passed on to his grandson Royal Lowell, the author of this book.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=rVxwa5bXwocC&dq=Boatbuilding+Down+East:+How+Lobsterboats+Are+Built&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Cloud Sketcher","description":"In a tiny village in Finland, Esko Vaananen is at the brink of despair -- he loves a woman he can never have.

Blakelock, an American Painter","description":" The best book yet written about this neglected and fascinating American painter  who anticipated abstract expressionism by more than fifty years (Gail Levin, The New York Times Book Review). At the dawn of the 20th century, Ralph Blakelock s brooding, hallucinogenic paintings were a striking departure from the prevailing American tradition and as sought after as the works of Winslow Homer and John Singer Sargent. In 1916, the record-breaking sale of Blakelock s Brook by Moonlight made him famous. Yet at the time of his triumph, the troubled painter had spent fifteen years in a psychiatric hospital while his family lived in poverty. Released from the asylum, Blakelock fell into the dubious care of an eccentric adventuress, Beatrice Van Rensselaer Adams, who kept him a virtual prisoner while siphoning off the profits of his success, until his mysterious death. In this acclaimed biography, Glyn Vincent offers the first complete chronicle of Blakelock s life. Vividly portraying New York in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the narrative begins with his childhood in Greenwich Village and the years he spent peddling his canvases door-to-door and playing piano in vaudeville theaters. Vincent also delves into Blakelock s journeys among the Sioux and Uinta Native Americans; his mental illness; and the way his exploration of mysticism informed his radical shift away from the Hudson River School of art.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=dQOsPMRwD_cC&dq=The+Unknown+Night:+The+Genius+and+Madness+of+R.A.+Blakelock,+an+American+Painter&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Complete Chondro: A Comprehensive Guide to the Care and Breeding of the Green Tree Python","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Basket of Flowers","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=efUcAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Basket+of+Flowers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eucharist and Church Fellowship in the First Four Centuries","description":"Explores the vocabulary of fellowship in the Christian community and the evidence for agreement in the confession of the faith and church practice in the Lords Supper.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=AYCLPQAACAAJ&dq=Eucharist+and+Church+Fellowship+in+the+First+Four+Centuries&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Currents of Space","description":"The second book in the Galactic Empire series, the spectacular precursor to the classic Foundation series, by one of history's most influential writers of science fiction, Isaac Asimov Trantor had extended its rule over half the Galaxy, but the other half defied its authority, defending their corrupt fiefdoms with violence and repression.

The collection contains nine performance scripts by established and emerging black and Latina/o queer playwrights and performance artists, each accompanied by an interview and critical essay conducted or written by leading scholars of black, Latina/o, and queer expressive practices. As the volume's framing device, \\"blacktino\\" grounds the specificities of black and brown social and political relations while allowing the contributors to maintain the goals of queer-of-color critique. Whether interrogating constructions of Latino masculinity, theorizing the black queer male experience, or examining black lesbian relationships, the contributors present blacktino queer performance as an artistic, critical, political, and collaborative practice. These scripts, interviews, and essays not only accentuate the value of blacktino as a reading device; they radiate the possibilities for thinking through the concepts of blacktino, queer, and performance across several disciplines. Blacktino Queer Performance reveals the inevitable flirtations, frictions, and seductions that mark the contours of any ethnoracial love affair. Contributors. Jossiana Arroyo, Marlon M.

The writings in this collection are drawn from a wide variety of disciplines to provide a broad and informative array of insights on these fascinating and diverse populations.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nNRwoVlhAAwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mathematical Methods and Theory in Games, Programming, and Economics: Vol 1 : Matrix Games, Programming, and Mathematical Economics/Vol 2 : The Theo","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=-NgSAAAAIAAJ&dq=Mathematical+Methods+and+Theory+in+Games,+Programming,+and+Economics:+Vol+1+:+Matrix+Games,+Programming,+and+Mathematical+Economics/Vol+2+:+The+Theo&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Privilege of Parenting: How to raise great kids in the st century","description":"Shows parents how to be in tune with a child's basic nature and discusses how to create a harmonious partnership working together to help children develop a coherent world view.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=q5IKAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Privilege+of+Parenting:+How+to+raise+great+kids+in+the+st+century&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Awareness Itself the Teachings of Ajaan Fuang Jotiko","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=-LcBHAAACAAJ&dq=Awareness+Itself+the+Teachings+of+Ajaan+Fuang+Jotiko&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"No Dogs Allowed!","description":"When Iris, her family, and the neighbors take a trip to Enchanted Lake, everyone brings what they think is needed, but the family dog turns out to present a problem.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=P-a4V-hDj5cC&dq=No+Dogs+Allowed!&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"To Care for the Earth: A Call to a New Theology","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=6p7_swEACAAJ&dq=To+Care+for+the+Earth:+A+Call+to+a+New+Theology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jewels of Stringology","description":"The term ?stringology? is a popular nickname for text algorithms, or algorithms on strings. This book deals with the most basic algorithms in the area. Most of them can be viewed as ?algorithmic jewels? and deserve reader-friendly presentation. One of the main aims of the book is to present several of the most celebrated algorithms in a simple way by omitting obscuring details and separating algorithmic structure from combinatorial theoretical background. The book reflects the relationships between applications of text-algorithmic techniques and the classification of algorithms according to the measures of complexity considered. The text can be viewed as a parade of algorithms in which the main purpose is to discuss the foundations of the algorithms and their interconnections. One can partition the algorithmic problems discussed into practical and theoretical problems. Certainly, string matching and data compression are in the former class, while most problems related to symmetries and repetitions in texts are in the latter. However, all the problems are interesting from an algorithmic point of view and enable the reader to appreciate the importance of combinatorics on words as a tool in the design of efficient text algorithms.In most textbooks on algorithms and data structures, the presentation of efficient algorithms on words is quite short as compared to issues in graph theory, sorting, searching, and some other areas. At the same time, there are many presentations of interesting algorithms on words accessible only in journals and in a form directed mainly at specialists. This book fills the gap in the book literature on algorithms on words, and brings together the many results presently dispersed in the masses of journal articles. The presentation is reader-friendly; many examples and about two hundred figures illustrate nicely the behaviour of otherwise very complex algorithms.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=9NdohJXtIyYC&dq=Jewels+of+Stringology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Liberty for All?: 1820-1860 A History of US Book 5","description":"Chronicles the history of the United States from the time of the Missouri Compromise, when Maine and Missouri became states, until Abraham Lincoln's election to the presidency.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=m3PXhuHFGrsC&dq=Liberty+for+All%3F:+1820-1860+A+History+of+US+Book+5&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Himmler's Cavalry: The Equestrian SS, 1930 - 1945","description":"Dressed in black uniforms emblazoned with the SS flash, Heinrich Himmlers horsemen carried the SS banner across the German countryside and to equestrian competitions throughout Germany and Europe.

Achieving Maximum Value from Information Systems argues that to realise business benefits successfully, technology must be carefully integrated with the business strategy of the enterprise and its corporate culture.

It will come into its own as the esoteric or soul factors begin to supersede the exoteric focus of the vast majority of professional and amateur astrologers today. This is the science which deals with those conditioning and governing energies and forces which play through and upon the whole field of space and all that is found within that field. The Ancient Wisdom teaches that Space is an entity. It is with the life of this entity and with the forces and energies, the impulses and the rhythms, the cycles and the times and seasons, that esoteric astrology deals. Esoteric astrology can be applied by the trained worker in a variety of ways; in medicine, psychology, science, education; to an evaluation of human problems, of the destiny of nations, of a correct interpretation of world affairs, and so on. It is necessary, however, that at this stage the application of esoteric astrology to human life should be recognised as experimental and tentative, so that each individual worker can adjust his thinking and his methods according to his own wrought-out experience. to work depend entirely on a consciousness evolving out of control by the personality into the life of the soul, out of separateness and self-centredness into a realisation of unity, and absorption into a centre of group consciousness. Astrology is described in this book as the science of relationships - the relationship existing between all living organisms within the universe. Not only the qualities of the ray energies affect these centres of consciousness, but also the quality and energy of the ruling planets and the zodiacal signs. Seen from the exoteric outside, astrology is a vast and most involved and complex subject. From the esoteric inside, while it is still vast, all-inclusive and complex, it is also possible to perceive the thread which unites and the pattern which prevails throughout the whole system. A basic simplicity in the grand design emerges, therefore, which can serve to interpret the whole. study: (1) The Zodiac and the Rays (2) The Nature of Esoteric Astrology (3) The Science of Triangles (4) The Sacred and Non-Sacred Planets (5) Three Major Constellations (6) The Three Crosses (7) The Rays, Constellations and Planets. In addition there is an appendix which summarises and tabulates many of the factors of fundamental importance to the study of esoteric astrology. This is a book for the true occult student. It may appear to be too highly specialised for some; but every esoteric worker finds eventually that his work requires an understanding of the basic astrological factors which affect all relationships and all forms of life within the ethers of space, so that he may learn how to cooperate intelligently in the evolution of the whole by the right adjustment of the part within that whole; until eventually the many are absorbed into the One. The books of Alice A. Bailey, written in cooperation with a Tibetan teacher between 1919?1949, constitute a continuation of the Ageless WisdomCa body of esoteric teaching handed down from ancient times in a form which is always suitable to each period. writings offer an unparalleled spiritual approach to such subjects as the teaching on Shamballa and the Path of spiritual evolution; the spiritual Hierarchy; the new discipleship and training in meditation as a form of service; the teaching on the seven rays and the new psychology of the soul; the teaching on esoteric astrology; and the new world religion, which emphasizes the common thread of truth linking all the major world faiths.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=yr3kPgAACAAJ&dq=Esoteric+astrology+(A+treatise+on+the+seven+rays)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Year in the South: 1865: The True Story of Four Ordinary People Who Lived Through the Most Tumultuous Twelve Months in American History","description":"A slave determined to gain freedom, a widow battling poverty and despair, a man of God grappling with spiritual and worldly troubles, and a former Confederate soldier seeking a new life.

It was on that day that a carpenter named James Marshall discovered a tiny nugget of gold while building a sawmill at Sutter s Fort, just east of Sacramento, California. Marshall s find ignited a fever the nation had never known before, drawing people from all over the country to the West Coast with high hopes of getting rich quick. Over the next six years, three hundred thousand prospectors raced to the California gold fields to make their fortunes, leaving their lands and families behind in order to chase a dream of easy wealth, but all too often encountering a reality of lawlessness, disease, cruelty, and death. A former columnist for the New York Times, author Fred Rosen takes readers back to the seminal moment when the American dream exploded. Chock full of fascinating details, unforgettable characters, and shocking real-life events, the captivating true story of the California gold rush brings an era of unparalleled change to breathtaking life. Rosen s enthralling history of the gold rush of 1848 demonstrates how this golden ideal was supplanted by a culture of selfishness and greed that endures in America to this very day.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SZifCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Greek Passion","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=hMNIjM6-W20C&dq=The+Greek+Passion&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Evaluating Change in English Language Teaching","description":"This book is an exploration of the processes of change in English language teaching.

Focusing on two widows, the book encourages their individual stories to emerge and gives a voice to an otherwise forgotten group of women whose stories have been lost under the literary tomes of middle-class writers such as Vera Brittain and May Wedderburn Cannon. The discussion is further informed by a wider reading of 300 other such files, which allows wider observations to be made about the nature of the discourses examined, and offers the most complete possible picture for such data. Offering a streamlined adaptation of the Discourse-Historical Approach to critical discourse analysis, Discourses Surrounding British Widows of the First World War demonstrates how this model of analysis can be used to investigate a large body of data from a wide variety of sources, covering a long period of time.

Besides traveling, cruising, and casino hopping, he and his wife also enjoy many other good things their retired life has to offer. However, everywhere they went, they saw seniors struggling with their poor health and disabilities. It made them realize how fortunate they are that at their age, they still have excellent health. Obviously, the decision they made earlier in life that put health as an equally important goal as wealth for their retirement was a wise one, and it made all the difference. In addition, they also have no illness or handicaps of any kind, and are not dependent on any mandatory medications. This is why, even in their seventies, they are still able to do all the fun things they used to do in their younger years. Furthermore, Dian had a very successful career. Like others, he dealt with cutthroat competition under unrelenting stresses in his profession, yet still managed to stay on top without sacrificing his good health. He did this by choosing to live a healthy lifestyle that included regular vigorous exercise, a healthy diet, sufficient rest and recovery, and an active sex life, four parts of his  prescription for long-lasting youth.  That is the secret of how he has managed to stay totally fit at over seventy, and still looks and feels like an extremely fit young man twenty years younger. This is what he shares with the readers, plus the fun-filled lifestyle that he and his wife now enjoy living in retirement. Dian associates real-life scenarios, some of them with multicultural background, to address many interesting but relevant issues concerning retirement, sex life, health, and fitness, and the positive impact living a healthy lifestyle can have on our aging process. As part of the conclusion, Dian said,  What I described as my  prescription for long-lasting youth  is at best a strong personal belief, but one that seems to have promising merits, and supported by my personal experience to this date.

Determined to serve, she became a veritable soldier, a nurse, and a one-woman relief agency operating in the heart of the conflict. Now, award-winning author Stephen B. Oates, drawing on archival materials not used by her previous biographers, has written the first complete account of Clara Barton's active engagement in the Civil War. By the summer of 1862, with no institutional affiliation or official government appointment, but impelled by a sense of duty and a need to heal, she made her way to the front lines and the heat of battle. Oates tells the dramatic story of this woman who gave the world a new definition of courage, supplying medical relief to the wounded at some of the most famous battles of the war -- including Second Bull Run, Antietam, Fredericksburg, Battery Wagner, the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, and Petersburg. Under fire with only her will as a shield, she worked while ankle deep in gore, in hellish makeshift battlefield hospitals -- a bullet-riddled farmhouse, a crumbling mansion, a windblown tent. Committed to healing soldiers' spirits as well as their bodies, she served not only as nurse and relief worker, but as surrogate mother, sister, wife, or sweetheart to thousands of sick, wounded, and dying men. Her contribution to the Union was incalculable and unique. It also became the defining event in Barton's life, giving her the opportunity as a woman to reach out for a new role and to define a new profession. Nursing, regarded as a menial service before the war, became a trained, paid occupation after the conflict. Although Barton went on to become the founder and first president of the Red Cross, the accomplishment for which she is best known, A Woman of Valor convinces us that her experience on the killing fields of the Civil War was her most extraordinary achievement.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_KQ0Jqs90IMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Reunions Can Be Murder: The Seventh Charlie Parker Mystery (Charlie Parker Mysteries)","description":"Praise for USA Today bestseller Connie Shelton's previous mystery books: \\"Charlie is slick, appealing, and nobody's fool--just what readers want in an amateur sleuth.\\" --Booklist \\"Connie Shelton gets better with every book she writes.\\" --The Midwest Book Review \\"...Shelton's engaging story, likable heroine, and comfortable prose make this a good choice.\\" --Library Journal Charlie gets her newest case (the seventh in this bestselling mystery series) when an ill-tempered female attorney hires her to find the family's missing patriarch in time for an upcoming family reunion.

The investigatory lens is focused on the primary context in which children develop--the family. Reviewing current research in such areas as attachment and parenting styles, marital functioning, and parental depression, the volume examines how these variables may influence developmental processes across a range of domains and, in turn, predict the emergence of clinical problems. Illuminated are the interplay of risk and protective factors, biological and contextual influences, and continuous and discontinuous patterns of development in childhood and adolescence. Also considered in depth are the ways in which the developmental psychopathology perspective points to new directions in diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of child emotional and behavioral disorders. Featuring a wealth of figures, tables, and illustrative vignettes, this is a valuable source book for practititioners, scholars, and other professionals in mental health and related disciplines. It will also serve as a text in graduate-level courses on developmental psychopathology and clinical child psychology.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_df9DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Under Ice: Waldo Lyon and the Development of the Arctic Submarine (Williams-Ford Texas A&M; University Military History Series)","description":"'De Trident Deceptie is een thriller die aankomt als een vuistslag.

If a witness is questioned by a police officer, will the manner of questioning alter the representation of the memory? Can memories be supplemented with additional, false information?\\" The \\"passion\\" Loftus describes in the lines above led her to a teaching career at the University of Washington and, perhaps more importantly, into hundreds of courtrooms as an expert witness on the fallibility of eyewitness accounts. As she has explained in numerous trials, and as she convincingly argues in this absorbing book, eyewitness accounts can be and often are so distorted that they no longer resemble the truth.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hjM6CQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dancing on Air (Harper Monogram)","description":"Important American periodical dating back to 1850.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=P3cCAAAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Plasma Etching : Fundamentals and Applications (Series on Semiconductor Science and Technology, 7)","description":"The focus of this book is the remarkable advances in understanding of low pressure RF (radio frequency) glow discharges.

While a project office model leads to better products from projects, it is also a vehicle for generating overall organizational change -- by transforming the organization from function-based to project-based. This model incorporates projects into the very fabric of the organizational strategy and revitalizes organizations, creates competitive advantage, and increases shareholder value.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=tn9_RaIOhHgC&dq=Creating+the+Project+Office:+A+Manager%27s+Guide+to+Leading+Organizational+Change&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Competing Devotions: Career and Family among Women Executives","description":"The wrenching decision facing successful women choosing between demanding careers and intensive family lives has been the subject of many articles and books, most of which propose strategies for resolving the dilemma. Competing Devotions focuses on broader social and cultural forces that create women's identities and shape their understanding of what makes life worth living. Mary Blair-Loy examines the career paths of women financial executives who have tried various approaches to balancing career and family. The professional level these women have attained requires a huge commitment of time, energy, and emotion that seems natural to employers and clients, who assume that a career deserves single-minded allegiance. Meanwhile, these women must confront the cultural model of family that defines marriage and motherhood as a woman's primary vocation. This ideal promises women creativity, intimacy, and financial stability in caring for a family. It defines children as fragile and assumes that men lack the selflessness and patience that children's primary caregivers need. This ideal is taken for granted in much of contemporary society. The power of these assumptions is enormous but not absolute. Competing Devotions identifies women executives who try to reshape these ideas. These mavericks, who face great resistance but are aided by new ideological and material resources that come with historical change, may eventually redefine both the nuclear family and the capitalist firm in ways that reduce work-family conflict.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=JkXlQBWTNygC&dq=Competing+Devotions:+Career+and+Family+among+Women+Executives&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Walden & On the Duty of Civil Disobedience","description":"\\"In 1845, Henry David Thoreau moved into a cabin by Walden Pond.

Themes of the story are the family's earnest efforts to achieve a goal they have set for themselves and how these efforts are reinforced by planning and perseverance. Everyone in the story is realistically challenged by the deprivations and rigors of the hike. With occasional humor to overcome discouragement, they all grow a little from the experience.

Bungling spies were captured and half-hearted efforts at sabotage came to nothing. Yet anyone who lived through WWII remembers the chilling posters warning Americans that \\"Enemy Agents Have Big Ears\\" and \\"Loose Lips Sink Ships.\\" Even Superman joined the struggle against these insidious foes. In 1940, polls showed that 71% of Americans believed a Nazi Fifth Column had penetrated the country. Almost half were convinced that spies, saboteurs, dupes, and rumor-mongers lurked in their own neighborhoods and work-places. These fears extended to the White House and Congress. In this book, Francis MacDonnell explains the origins and consequences of America's Fifth Column panic, arguing that conviction and expedience encouraged President Roosevelt, the FBI, Congressmen, Churchill's government, and Hollywood to legitimate and exacerbate American's fears. Gravely weakening the isolationists, fostering Congress's role in rooting out Un-American activities, and instigating the creation of the modern intelligence establishment, the Fifth Column scare did far more than sell movie tickets, comic books, and pulp fiction. Insidious Foes traces the panic from its origins in the minds of reasonable Americans who saw the vulnerability of their open society in an age of encroaching totalitarianism.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WiBrTnpoeTYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Teeter-Totter: Lee Ann's Diary","description":"This story covers five yeas in the life of an abused child from her puberty to a young adult.

'A man is not an orange. You can't eat the fruit and throw the peel away' Willy Loman is on his last legs. Failing at his job, dismayed at his the failure of his sons, Biff and Happy, to live up to his expectations, and tortured by his jealousy at the success and happiness of his neighbour Charley and his son Bernard, Willy spirals into a well of regret, reminiscence, and A scathing indictment of the ultimate failure of the American dream, and the empty pursuit of wealth and success, is a harrowing journey. In creating Willy Loman, his destructively insecure anti-hero, Miller defined his aim as being 'to set forth what happens when a man does not have a grip on the forces of life'. Arthur Miller (1915-2005), American dramatist, was born in New York City. In 1938 Miller won awards for his comedy The Grass Still Grows. His major achievement was Death of a Salesman, which won the 1949 Pulitzer Prize for drama and the 1949 New York Drama Critics' Circle Award. The Crucible was aimed at the widespread congressional investigation of subversive activities in the US; the drama won the 1953 Tony Award. Miller's autobiography, Timebends: A Life was published in 1987. If you enjoyed Death of a Salesman, you might like Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire, also available in Penguin Modern Classics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Du1gQgAACAAJ&dq=Death+of+a+Salesman:+Certain+Private+Conversations+in+Two+Acts+and+a+Requiem&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Love Busters ~ Overcoming Habits That Destroy Passion [ 4 Audio Cassette Tapes and Hardcover Book ]","description":"Denken is niet zo simpel als we denken en toch doen we het de hele dag door, we kunnen niet anders.

Is a practical guide for anyone trying to mobilize voters or organize at the grass roots. Unlike authors of other campaign advice books, Donald Green and Alan Gerber root their work firmly in rigorous science. Their recommendations emerge from thorough experiments conducted in real electoral settings, examining the impact and effectiveness of door-to-door canvassing, telephone calls, direct mail, and other campaign tactics. Since 1998 the authors have conducted research in over a dozen states, studying a wide range of federal, state, and municipal elections. Their book connects theory with practice, informing campaign professionals and local organizers as well as students of electoral politics. They discover that many GOTV tactics used by campaign managers and political consultants are less effective than is often believed. The authors, relying on rigorous and systematic research, challenge much of the conventional wisdom about what works and what doesn't in the political campaigns. The authors' applied form of political science has won acclaim from scholars and earned the attention of campaign professionals and journalists. This book presents their result for a non-academic audience interested in putting campaign research into practice, and the findings will be surprising to many. Get Out the Vote! will help both consultants and the candidates who use their services better understand the efficacy of campaign methods.

The potential of these systems is enormous. Gathering data on behaviours and preferences allows businesses to enhance customer relationships, distribute knowledge and expertise around the world, and negotiate more effectively with suppliers, distributors, and partners. But there s a dark side. At what point does this data mining cross the line into invasion of privacy, unethical, or even illegal, practices? What happens if proprietary information is accidentally released or gets into the wrong hands? Or when human judgment takes a back seat to computergenerated reports? In Making It Personal, business and technology expert Bruce Kasanoff explores the impact of these \\"personalization\\" technologies, and how to apply them without invading privacy. Illustrated with examples drawn from all types of organizations, Kasanoff considers the commercial, cultural, and legal implications, as individuals and businesses become increasingly interconnected. The result is not only a compelling and thoughtprovoking narrative, but also a practical framework from which to assess the opportunities and threats posed by personalization  and how you and your organization will respond. Making It Personal is a missioncritical briefing for anyone prepared to ask tough questions about how best to balance personalization and privacy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=0L9RPgAACAAJ&dq=Making+It+Personal:+How+To+Profit+From+Personalization+Without+Invading+Privacy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Good Life (Hackett Publishing Co.)","description":"A collection of 25 philosophical writings from antiquity to modernity that concern the self-directed question of what is the good life.

Waar gaat het om in onze relatie met God? David Hudson is een gevierd predikant. Zijn pakkende preken trekken grote menigten mensen naar de kerk. Stephen Decker is architect en lid van Davids gemeente. Beide mannen hebben dezelfde droom: een kerk te bouwen tot eer van God. Wanneer hun kerk bij legaat een stuk land krijgt, lijkt deze droom verwezenlijkt te kunnen worden. De kerkenraad besluit het land te verkopen, aangezien het in een minder aantrekkelijke buurt ligt. Met de opbrengt wordt een ander perceel in een rijker buitenwijk gekocht, waar een nieuwe kerk moet verrijzen. Een spreker als David verdient immers een groot gebouw. Ondertussen bezoeken steeds meer mensen de diensten, aangetrokken door de krachtige preken van David en de professionele muziek. Het geld stroomt binnen; de bouwplannen worden voortdurend uitgebreid.

Its sleeper success bred a series of film sequels and a syndicated television program while its villain, Freddy Krueger, became a Hollywood horror icon for the ages. In the four decades since its release, Craven's creation and subsequent franchise has become firmly established as a pop culture institution and a celebrated symbol of American cinema. This book takes readers on an engrossing journey through the history, production and themes of the Nightmare on Elm Street film series and its spin-off TV show, Freddy's Nightmares. It reveals new stories about the franchise's history and dives into some of the themes and ideas that tend to be overlooked.

Mishra describes his restless journeys into India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan, among Islamists and the emerging Hindu middle class, looking for this most enigmatic of religious figures, exploring the myths and places of the Buddha's life, and discussing Western explorers' \\"discovery\\" of Buddhism in the nineteenth century. He also considers the impact of Buddhist ideas on such modern politicians as Gandhi and Nelson Mandela. As he reflects on his travels and on his own past, Mishra shows how the Buddha wrestled with problems of personal identity, alienation, and suffering in his own, no less bewildering, times. In the process Mishra discovers the living meaning of the Buddha's teaching, in the world and for himself. The result is the most three-dimensional, convincing book on the Buddha that we have.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CaTmyFTkFx0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Applied Probability and Random Processes","description":"The long-awaited revision of Fundamentals of Applied Probability and Random Processes expands on the central components that made the first edition a classic.

Combining the qualities of a poetry collection and an autobiography, the work is structured around some 350 poems that focus on various incidents or remembrances. The work is of interest not only for its literary merit and its particularly evocative blend of prose and poetry, but also for its historical glimpses of the stirring events of the Genpei War, the subject of the great romantic war epic The Tale of the Heike. The memoirs tell of Lady Daibu's carefree young days at court, the death of her great love, Sukemori, in the war, and her enduring grief as she longs for her lover and times past. A special fascination of the work is its intimate views of famous persons who are known mostly through military tales or historical records. The introduction tells what we know of Lady Daibu's life and analyzes the intricate structure of the work, and appendixes describe its textual history.\\" -- Publisher's description","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=6wTZwAEACAAJ&dq=The+Poetic+Memoirs+of+Lady+Daibu&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"To Make A Marriage (Bachelor Sisters) (Harlequin Presents)","description":"From the first, Danie clashed swords with Jonas Noble, realizing that he was determined not to disclose the reasons for his dealings with her family.

It was a vicious, calculated murder. The killer selected his victim at London's Euston station, followed her home on the tube, strangled her to death in front of her child. At the same time, killed in the same way, a second body is discovered at the back of King s Cross station. It is a grisly coincidence that eerily echoes the murder of two other women, stabbed to death months before on the same day. It is DI Tom Thorne who sees the link and comes to a horrifying conclusion. This is not a serial killer that the police are up against. This is two of them. Finding the body used to be the worst part of the job, but not any more. Now each time a body is found, Thorne must live with the knowledge that somewhere out there is a second victim, waiting to be discovered. But whilst the methods might be the same, the manner of the killings is strikingly different. Thorne comes to realise that he is hunting two very different killers. One is ruthless and in control, while his partner in crime is submissive, compliant, terrified. Thorne must catch a man whose need to manipulate is as great as his need to kill, a man who will threaten those closest to Thorne himself, a man, who will show him that the ability to inspire terror, is the deadliest weapon of all...","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Fb8TAAAAQBAJ&dq=Scaredy+Cat:+A+Novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The mystery of true Israel","description":"This study of the use of the names 'Jew', 'Hebrew' and 'Israel' in ancient Jewish and early Christian literature - especially the Bible, Philo, Josephus, Dead Sea Scrolls, New Testament and Mishnah - defines the nature of Israel and Judaism in Antiquity.

Most of the chapters were originally presented as papers at a research conference held in 2001 at the Kellogg School of Management of Northwestern University. The contributions span traditional social psychological areas, as well as organizational theory; examining leadership as a psychological process and as afforded by organizational constraints and opportunities. The editors' goal was not to focus the chapters on a single approach to the study and conceptualization of leadership but rather to display the diversity of issues that surround the topic. Leadership scholars have identified a host of approaches to the study of leadership. What are the personal characteristics of leaders? What is the nature of the relation between leaders and followers? Why do we perceive some people to be better leaders than others? What are the circumstances that evoke leadership qualities in people? Can leadership be taught? And so on. The contributions to this book examine these important questions and fall into three categories: conceptions of leadership, factors that influence the effectiveness of leadership, and the consequences and effects of leadership on the leader. All in all, the chapters of this volume display part of a broad spectrum of novel and important approaches to the study of the psychology of leadership. We hope that they are equally useful to those who are or would be leaders and to those who study the topic. As recent events have served to remind us, it is too important a topic to be ignored by psychologists.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6Sh5AgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Depeche Mode: Some Great Reward","description":"In 1980, four English youths formed a completely electronic pop band.

Despite the efforts of more than four hundred police officers and homicide investigators, the heinous crime was never solved. Now, after endless speculation and false claims, bestselling author Donald H.

With the aid of archival photos, news clippings, and investigative reports, Wolfe documents the riveting untold story that names the brutal murderer the notorious Mafia leader, Benjamin \\"Bugsy\\" Siegel and the motive an unwanted pregnancy resulting from Short's involvement with the most powerful figure in Los Angeles, Norman Chandler. But Wolfe goes even further to unravel the large-scale cover-up behind the case.

Whereas once the subject addressed mainly the financing of corporations--equity, debt, and valuation--today it also embraces crucial issues of governance, liquidity, risk management, relationships between banks and corporations, and the macroeconomic impact of corporations. However, this progress has left in its wake a jumbled array of concepts and models that students are often hard put to make sense of. Here, one of the world's leading economists offers a lucid, unified, and comprehensive introduction to modern corporate finance theory. Jean Tirole builds his landmark book around a single model, using an incentive or contract theory approach. Filling a major gap in the field, The Theory of Corporate Finance is an indispensable resource for graduate and advanced undergraduate students as well as researchers of corporate finance, industrial organization, political economy, development, and macroeconomics. Tirole conveys the organizing principles that structure the analysis of today's key management and public policy issues, such as the reform of corporate governance and auditing; the role of private equity, financial markets, and takeovers; the efficient determination of leverage, dividends, liquidity, and risk management; and the design of managerial incentive packages. He weaves empirical studies into the book's theoretical analysis. And he places the corporation in its broader environment, both microeconomic and macroeconomic, and examines the two-way interaction between the corporate environment and institutions. Setting a new milestone in the field, The Theory of Corporate Finance will be the authoritative text for years to come.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=p683L1gaVm4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kinship & Marriage in Early Arabia","description":"DIVA collection of essays that redefine and transform the field of kinship./div","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=FhWo46l220gC&dq=Kinship&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Rape of America's Youth: The US College System","description":"\\"Taking the US College System apart issue by issue Eddie Papetti examines why each issue is present in the College System and how it can be corrected.

Knee Deep in Grace presents the life story of Dipa Ma Barua, along with the essential spiritual teachings that make her a towering figure in contemporary Buddhism. While she experienced fame in her lifetime and had a following of many Burmese, Indian, and American students, she was like the women saints of the Vedas, \\"remarkable women...from the dawn of history...who achieved realization while cleaning their homes and raising their children\\" (Daughters of the Goddess: Women Saints of India). Dipa Ma was a primary teacher of Sharon Salzberg Jack Kornfield, and Joseph Goldstein, who have been among the most influential \\"importers\\" of Buddhism to America.

What Yogi Berra observed about a baseball game it ain't over till it's over is true about life, and [Late Bloomers] is the ultimate proof of this. . . . It s a keeper.  Forbes We live in a society where kids and parents are obsessed with early achievement, from getting perfect scores on SATs to getting into Ivy League colleges to landing an amazing job at Google or Facebook or even better, creating a start-up with the potential to be the next Google, Facebook or Uber. We see coders and entrepreneurs become millionaires or billionaires before age thirty, and feel we are failing if we are not one of them. Late bloomers, on the other hand, are under-valued in popular culture, by educators and employers, and even unwittingly by parents. Yet the fact is, a lot of us most of us do not explode out of the gates in life. We have to discover our passions and talents and gifts. That was true for author Rich Karlgaard, who had a mediocre academic career at Stanford (which he got into by a fluke) and, after graduating, worked as a dishwasher and night watchman before finding the inner motivation and drive that ultimately led him to start up a high-tech magazine in Silicon Valley, and eventually to become the publisher of Forbes magazine. There is a scientific explanation for why so many of us bloom later in life. The executive function of our brains doesn t mature until age twenty-five, and later for some. In fact, our brain s capabilities peak at different ages. We actually experience multiple periods of blooming in our lives. Moreover, late bloomers enjoy hidden strengths because they take their time to discover their way in life strengths coveted by many employers and partners including curiosity, insight, compassion, resilience, and wisdom. Based on years of research, personal experience, interviews with neuroscientists, psychologists, and countless people at different stages of their careers, Late Bloomers reveals how and when we achieve our full potential. Praise for Late Bloomers  The underlying message that we should  consider a kinder clock for human development  is a compelling one.  Financial Times  Late Bloomers spoke to me deeply as a parent of two millennials and as a coach to many new college grads (the children of my friends and associates). It s a bracing tonic for the anxiety they are swimming through, with a facts-based approach to help us all calm down.

Like the glorious ghosts of the paintings in the Hermitage that lie at the heart of the story, Dean s exquisite prose shimmers with a haunting glow, illuminating us to the notion that art itself is perhaps our most necessary nourishment. A superbly graceful novel.    Chang-Rae Lee, New York Times Bestselling author of Aloft and Native Speaker Bit by bit, the ravages of age are eroding Marina's grip on the everyday. An elderly Russian woman now living in America, she cannot hold on to fresh memories the details of her grown children's lives, the approaching wedding of her grandchild yet her distant past is miraculously preserved in her mind's eye. Vivid images of her youth in war-torn Leningrad arise unbidden, carrying her back to the terrible fall of 1941, when she was a tour guide at the Hermitage Museum and the German army's approach signaled the beginning of what would be a long, torturous siege on the city. As the people braved starvation, bitter cold, and a relentless German onslaught, Marina joined other staff members in removing the museum's priceless masterpieces for safekeeping, leaving the frames hanging empty on the walls to symbolize the artworks' eventual return. As the Luftwaffe's bombs pounded the proud, stricken city, Marina built a personal Hermitage in her mind a refuge that would stay buried deep within her, until she needed it once more. . . .","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jB86NO3aIawC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Scholastic Encyclopedia of the Civil War","description":"Traces the course of the Civil War, year by year, using profiles of important people, eyewitness accounts, and period art.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=O2k9ngEACAAJ&dq=Scholastic+Encyclopedia+of+the+Civil+War&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Northern Accents","description":"English as spoken in the north of England has a rich social and cultural history; however it has often been neglected by historical linguists, whose research has focused largely on the development of 'Standard English'.

Emphasising its richness and variety, the book places northern speech and culture in the context of identity, iconography, mental maps, boundaries and marginalisation. It reassesses the role of Northern English in the development of Modern Standard English, draws some pioneering conclusions about the future of Northern English, and considers the origins of the many images and stereotypes surrounding northerners and their speech. Numerous maps, and a useful index of northern English words and pronunciations, are included.

She was a key figure in the Charismatic Movement in the United States during the 1960s through to about 1980, mainly through her writing.

Her adventures are the stuff of novels: she rode with bandits; braved desert shamals; was captured by Bedouins; and sojourned in a harem. Called the most powerful woman in the British Empire, she counseled kings and prime ministers. Bell s colleagues included Lloyd George and Winston Churchill, who in 1921 invited Bell the only woman whose advice was sought to the Cairo Conference to  determine the future of Mesopotamia.  Bell numbered among her closest friends T.E. Lawrence, St. John Philby, and Arabian sheiks. In this volume of three of her notebooks, Rosemary O Brien preserves Bell s elegant, vibrant prose, and presents Bell as a brilliant tactician fearlessly confronting her own vulnerability. The fundamental themes of her life reckless behavior; a divided self which combined brilliance of intellect with a passionate nature; a sense of history; and the fatal gift of falling in love with a married man are all here in remarkable detail. Her journey to northern Arabia in 1914 earned Bell professional recognition from the Royal Geographical Society, and solidified her reputation as a canny political analyst of Middle Eastern affairs. In addition to Bell s own photographs, O Brien has provided us an unprecedented first access to excerpts of the Bell/Richard Doughty-Wyllie love letters, the married British army officer with whom she was in love and for whom her diaries were written.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=yfQYdOJpaDMC&dq=Gertrude+Bell:+The+Arabian+Diaries,+1913-1914&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Never Enough Words: How Americans Invented Expressions as Ingenious, Ornery, and Colorful as Themsel ves","description":"A study of the ways in which the unique attributes of the American character have shaped the American language","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_LFZAAAAMAAJ&dq=Never+Enough+Words:+How+Americans+Invented+Expressions+as+Ingenious,+Ornery,+and+Colorful+as+Themsel+ves&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Getting Radio Airplay: The Guide to Getting Your Music Played on College, Public and Commercial Radio","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=39kNAAAACAAJ&dq=Getting+Radio+Airplay:+The+Guide+to+Getting+Your+Music+Played+on+College,+Public+and+Commercial+Radio&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Teach Yourself World Faiths, New Edition","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=SUXFtwEACAAJ&dq=Teach+Yourself+World+Faiths,+New+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"European History (Cliffs AP)","description":"Your complete guide to a higher score on the *AP European History exam About the book: Introduction Reviews of the AP exam format and scoring Proven strategies for answering multiple-choice questions Hints for tackling the essay questions FAQs Part I: Subject Area Reviews Covers all subject areas you'll be tested on Intellectual and cultural history Political and diplomatic history Social and economic history Includes sample questions and answers for each subject Part II: AP European History Practice Exams 3 full-length practice exams with answers and complete explanations","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=6G5GMsdQryAC&dq=European+History+(Cliffs+AP)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sparkman & Stephens: Classic Modern Yachts","description":"Sparkman & Stephens were undoubtedly one of the most successful and influential yacht designers in the history of modern yachting.

The author makes it perfectly clear that there is only one way of escape from present slough and despair. It is in turning in heartfelt repentance to God who has already provided atonement in the sacrifice of His Son. And true repentance includes a return to the doing of God's will as revealed in God's Word, the Bible.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=twmjDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eddie Kantar Teaches Advanced Bridge Defense","description":"Covers defensive strategies, interferences, ways of counting the hand, extra trump tricks, falsecarding, and lead-directing doubles","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=rf_wV7GJxRsC&dq=Eddie+Kantar+Teaches+Advanced+Bridge+Defense&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Critical Race Feminism: A Reader (Critical America Series)","description":"Anita Hill, Angela Harris, Lani Guinier, and others address a range of subjects on the legal status of women of color In Critical Race Feminism, Anita Hill, Lani Guinier, Regina Austin, Patricia Williams, Emma Coleman Jordan (Anita Hill's lawyer) and over three dozen other women seek to ensure that their perspectives on race, power, law, and politics in America will never again be distorted or ignored. Revealing how the historical experiences and contemporary realities of women of color are profoundly influenced by a legacy of racism and sexism that is neither linear nor logical, the book offers a panoramic perspective on American women's lives, illustrating how women of color derive strength from oppression. Both a forceful statement and a platform, the volume addresses an ambitious range of subjects from life in the workplace, motherhood, and parenting to sexual harassment, the O.J. Simpson trial, and criminal justice. Extending beyond national borders, it also takes on such global issues as female genital mutilation with sensitivity and eloquence. In a foreword that discusses relations between black women and men in the wake of the Million Man March, Derrick Bell argues that there is a singular focus, and thus a unique power, in Critical Race Feminism that makes this anthology relevant for women and men of all colors.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=6PqyAAAAIAAJ&dq=Critical+Race+Feminism:+A+Reader+(Critical+America+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Conquest (Unicorn and Dragon, Vol II)","description":"The fate of eleventh-century England depends on two sisters--the compulsive Alison and the crafty Wildecent--as the dark forces of the outside world invade Malfwynder Manor","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=1bg0haEuNI4C&dq=Conquest+(Unicorn+and+Dragon,+Vol+II)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Riddle in the Mountain","description":"Celtic mythology and the American West combine to create an unusual, well-researched, and fast-paced adventure.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=SZzzIAAACAAJ&dq=Riddle+in+the+Mountain&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Guide for Using Stone Fox in the Classroom","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=TL75VQAF5PcC&dq=A+Guide+for+Using+Stone+Fox+in+the+Classroom&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hip Replacement or Hip Resurfacing: A Story of Choices","description":"This book consists of twelve short stories reflecting life in the rural culture of Southern Illinois during the last half of the twentieth century. The narrations occur in local bars, where local characters gathered to entertain one another by swapping yarns. Part one contains stories in which the author had personal involvement, while part two consists of stories related to the author by drinking companions. Mr. Roberts, the author, who is a well-known author in the field of Blindness Rehabilitation, turns his attention to the spinning of entertaining yarns based on local history, culture, and personal experience.

Their contributions reflect not only widely divergent political orientations and value systems, but also three distinct domains of inquiry into human motivation and behavior -- social scientific, psychodynamic (or psychoanalytical), and clinical practice. Each of these three domains is privy to important evidence and insights that need to transcend epistemological and methodological boundaries if understanding of the subject is to improve dramatically. In keeping with this notion, the editors asked the authors to go beyond a summary of findings, and lend additional distinction to the book by applying the \\"binoculars\\" of their particular perspective and offering suggestions as to the implications of their findings. One of the goals of the conference that resulted in this book was consensus building in the area of media and family. From examining the findings and insights of a diverse group of scholars, it seems that consensus building in several areas is a distinct possibility. Addressing the concerns of educators about the influence of the mass media of communication -- entertainment programs in particular -- on children and the welfare of the nuclear family, this volume projects directions for superior programming, especially for educational television. The influence of sex and violence on children and adults is given much attention, and the development of moral judgment and sexual expectations, among other things, is explored. The critical analysis of media effects includes examination of positive contributions of the media, such as the search for missing children and exemplary educational programs.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=odL5AQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins","description":"An alphabetically arranged reference contains the definitions and origins of more than 15,000 words and expressions, including slang words, proverbs, nicknames, and phrases from literature.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=S1YkAQAAMAAJ&dq=Encyclopedia+of+Word+and+Phrase+Origins&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Montana Man","description":"MAN of the Month The BENNING Legacy MR.

Between the mid-eighteenth and early-nineteenth centuries, the food source that we still call the Irish potato had allowed the fastest population growth in the whole of Western Europe. As vividly described in   Gr da's new work, the advent of the blight phytophthora infestans transformed the potato from an emblem of utility to a symbol of death by starvation. The Irish famine peaked in Black '47, but it brought misery and increased mortality to Ireland for several years. Central to Irish and British history, European demography, the world history of famines, and the story of American immigration, the Great Irish Famine is presented here from a variety of new perspectives. Moving away from the traditional narrative historical approach to the catastrophe,   Gr da concentrates instead on fresh insights available through interdisciplinary and comparative methods. He highlights several economic and sociological features of the famine previously neglected in the literature, such as the part played by traders and markets, by medical science, and by migration. Other topics include how the Irish climate, usually hospitable to the potato, exacerbated the failure of the crops in 1845-1847, and the controversial issue of Britain's failure to provide adequate relief to the dying Irish.   Gr da also examines the impact on urban Dublin of what was mainly a rural disaster and offers a critical analysis of the famine as represented in folk memory and tradition. The broad scope of this book is matched by its remarkable range of sources, published and archival. The book will be the starting point for all future research into the Irish famine.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=J83xDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Road & Track Mazda MX-5 Miata 1989-2002 Portfolio (Road & Track Series)","description":"Do you long for revival and power in your life?

Using primary sources from four Nordic countries, (Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden), this volume explores how small states have adjusted their military strategies in response to external shocks of the 21st century. The 9/11 terrorist attacks, the Russian interventions in Georgia and Ukraine, and the rise of the Islamic State have all forced the Nordic states to adopt new strategies. While the responses have not been uniform, their differing relations to the EU and NATO have not prevented these countries from behaving similarly in military affairs. Limitations in military capacity has led all four countries to pursue strategies that include cooperation with more resourceful partners. It is necessary for them to cooperate with others to protect and promote their national interests. Moreover, the Nordic cosmopolitan outlook expresses milieu-shaping ambitions that we generally would not expect small states to pursue against a potential great power aggressor.

In this book, the members of the Group for the Study of Interpersonal Development at the Harvard Graduate School of Education and the Judge Baker Children's Center in Boston describe in detail an innovative intervention and prevention method, pair therapy, that is designed to address these issues by helping children develop healthy interpersonal relationships. Pair therapy is a relationship-oriented treatment modality that addresses the social context of the difficulties encountered in growing up in today's world. This approach has been developed not only as a therapeutic intervention in day and residential treatment centers but also as a prevention method that can be used in public schools, day care centers, and other contexts. This practical volume meets the demand for an accessible, hands-on guide to the pair method. The theoretical foundations of the approach are also presented in an accessible fashion here. The techniques described in this book model a relationship-building process between an adult professional and two children. This process replicates the social relations that happen naturally in healthy and happy interactions and long-term relationships among well-cared-for children in safe and secure communities. This book will be useful for a number of disciplines that deal with younger children and adolescents: social work, education, school and group therapy, and human development. It offers educators, therapists, and other practitioners in a wide variety of settings the opportunity to learn how to develop a pair therapy program. It will also be an indispensable tool in the libraries of mental health practitioners who counsel youth beyond ordinary clinical treatment.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Eqw0DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gassire's Lute;: A West African epic","description":"A rousing tale of wars and heroes, Gassires Lute recounts the fall of the city-state Wagadu and tells how Gassire, warrior son of the ruling family, renounced his noble birth to become his peoples first bard.

During this period, the arsenal evolved from a small post where skilled workers hand-produced small arms ammunition to a full-scale industrial complex employing a large civilian workforce. James Farley uses the history of the arsenal to examine larger issues including the changing technology of early nineteenth-century warfare, the impact of new technology on the United States Army, and the reactions of workers and their families and communities to the coming of industrialization. Shortly after the War of 1812, the U. S. Army founded several new arsenals, including Frankford, to build up supplies of arms and ammunition then in short supply. At that time, the Army was held in low regard because of its perceived poor performance in the war, so the arrival of arsenals was not welcomed. By 1870, however, the arsenal at Frankford had integrated itself into the community and become a valued and respected member of it. Farley argues that the Ordnance Department of the U. S. Army created an industrial system of manufacture at Frankford well in advance of private industry. He also contends that the evolution of the Army into an employer of a large-scale civilian workforce helped to end the isolation and anti-militarism that plagued it after the War of 1812. Farley's study joins recent work in the history of technology, such as Judith McGaw's That Wonderful Machine, that seeks to understand technological change in its social and cultural context.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=tbfZdZxr3cQC&dq=Making+Arms+in+the+Machine+Age:+Philadelphia%27s+Frankford+Arsenal,+1816-1870&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Engineering Ethics: An Industrial perspective","description":"Engineering Ethics is the application of philosophical and moral systems to the proper judgment and behavior by engineers in conducting their work, including the products and systems they design and the consulting services they provide.

His account of everyday events is so perceptive and so true to the mark that all we country types yearn to re-experience its joys, and its miseries. The Ranch on the Cariboo is a good book and while it may not make a pretty sight to the tractor jockeys, by damn it is authentic; I should know because I was raised on a similar ranch just 18 miles north.

Even those who accept that humans can reach beyond the conventional five senses typically think of psychics as \\"special\\" or \\"gifted\\" with unusual abilities.

David Morehouse was trained by the U.S. government in remote viewing an exact scientific protocol for tapping the human power to gather information across space and time. In this comprehensive manual, he has taken his military training as an \\"operational\\" remote viewer and turned it into a step-by-step training system one that teaches any serious reader how to unlock their natural abilities and become more than the physical world allows. Remote Viewing includes more than just a method for gathering information.

The psychological thriller by the renowned US women s rights writer and campaigner is an autobiographical-inspired novella based upon her own experience of severe postnatal depression, leading to post-natal psychosis. At the time, women with PND (known in America as postpartum depression) were seen as hysterical and were often dismissed by doctors who overlooked treatment options through lack of understanding of the condition. In Perkins  short story, written tellingly from the first-person perspective, the nameless female protagonist is forced to sleep in an attic with yellow wallpaper and is driven mad by her enforced imprisonment following the birth of her first child. The book describes in detail how she sees imagined beings and ghostly sightings in the house. Disturbing in its nature yet utterly realistic to the heroine, the protagonist offers a diary-style narrative detailing her experience as a new mother suffering with severe mental illness: \\"I don t know why I should write this. I don t want to. I don t feel able. And I know John would think it absurd. But I must say what I feel and think in some way it is such a relief! But the effort is getting to be greater than the relief.\\" Evoking gothic themes of Charlotte Bronte s 'Jane Eyre', in both Jane Eyre s own tortuous and notorious Red Room and Bertha Mason's confinement in her loft prison, the book was made into a film in 2011  directed by Logan Thomas and starring Aric Cushing and Juliet Landau. Charlotte Perkins Gilman, also known as Charlotte Perkins Stetson, was born on 3rd July 1860 in Connecticut, USA. Her early family life was troubled, with her father abandoning his wife and family; a move which strongly influenced her feminist political leanings and advocator of women s rights. After jobs as a tutor and painter, Perkins  a self- declared humanist and  tom boy   began to work as a writer of short stories, novels, non-fiction pieces and poetry. Her best known work is her semi-autobiographical short story, inspired by her post-natal depression, entitled  The Yellow Wallpaper  which was published in 1892 and made into a film in 2011. A member of the American National Women's Hall of Fame, Charlotte Perkins Gilman was a strong believer that \\"the domestic environment oppressed women through the patriarchal beliefs upheld by society\\". A believer in euthanasia, she was diagnosed with incurable breast cancer in January 1932 and chose to take her own life in August 1935, writing in her suicide note that she \\"chose chloroform over cancer\\".","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uBlyEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rand McNally Boston Eastern Massachusetts Streetfinder: New Digital 2000-2001 Edition","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=wpsYAQAAMAAJ&dq=Rand+McNally+Boston+Eastern+Massachusetts+Streetfinder:+New+Digital+2000-2001+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Romantic Music","description":"This volume brings together twenty-two of the most diverse and stimulating journal articles on classical and romantic performing practice, representing a rich vein of enquiry into epochs of music still very much at the forefront of current concert repertoire.

For more than half the nation's history, vast mental hospitals were a prominent feature of the American landscape. From the mid-nineteenth century to the early twentieth, over 250 institutions for the insane were built throughout the United States; by 1948, they housed more than a half million patients. The blueprint for these hospitals was set by Pennsylvania hospital superintendant Thomas Story Kirkbride: a central administration building flanked symmetrically by pavilions and surrounded by lavish grounds with pastoral vistas. Kirkbride and others believed that well-designed buildings and grounds, a peaceful environment, a regimen of fresh air, and places for work, exercise, and cultural activities would heal mental illness. But in the second half of the twentieth century, after the introduction of psychotropic drugs and policy shifts toward community-based care, patient populations declined dramatically, leaving many of these beautiful, massive buildings and the patients who lived in them neglected and abandoned. Architect and photographer Christopher Payne spent six years documenting the decay of state mental hospitals like these, visiting seventy institutions in thirty states. Through his lens we see splendid, palatial exteriors (some designed by such prominent architects as H. H. Richardson and Samuel Sloan) and crumbling interiors chairs stacked against walls with peeling paint in a grand hallway; brightly colored toothbrushes still hanging on a rack; stacks of suitcases, never packed for the trip home. Accompanying Payne's striking and powerful photographs is an essay by Oliver Sacks (who described his own experience working at a state mental hospital in his book Awakenings). Sacks pays tribute to Payne's photographs and to the lives once lived in these places,  where one could be both mad and safe.

Leader of cultural renaissance in Hindi literature in modern times, he is credited with reinventing the ancient form of epic writing in modern prose. His contribution to Hindi literature is often compared to the legendary writer Premchand, though critics believe his impact to be more significant and long-lasting than the latter. Like his predecessor Premchand, Kohli is rated by publishers as the highest selling Hindi author of high literary standards. He is credited with synthesizing the essential elements of Indian philosophy and culture in his epic writings, which include his best known classic, Mahasamar. His epic writings effortlessly engross the reader in the story, and by the virtue of his art, this master story-teller elucidates the complicated concepts of Indian Philosophy like Law of Karma with such an ease and grace. The reader can imbibe the complete theory via situational examples, without even an inkling that he is being taught. His legendary works include all time greats like (Abhyudaya), Mahasamar and Todo, Kara Todo (epics); Vasudeva, Abhigyaan, Aatmdaan (novels); \\"Paanch Absurd Upanyaas\\", \\"Aashriton ka Vidroh\\" (satire), \\"Jahan hai dharm, Vahin hai jai,  \\"Hindi Upanyaas : Srijan evam Siddhant\\" (Literary Criticism), Smaraami (Essays and Memoirs); Kshamaa Karnaa Jiji, Saath sahaa gayaa dukh, Preeti Kathaa (Autobiographical novels). Kohli is the unprecedented master of exploring human relationships. His portrayal of highly complex characters cover a wide range - from a common householder (in Saath sahaa gayaa dukh) to mental wrecks (like Duryodhan in Mahasamar) to pinnacles of human evolution (like Rama, Krishna, Ramkrishn Paramhansa and Vivekananda). This satire can push and pinch, his emotional writings (like saath sahaa gayaa dukh) can easily make a reader cry; while his epical writings simply leave the reader awestruck and amazed. He portrays both the aspects of life : the existing and the idealistic, the prevalent and the preferable. His works also assert the timeless nature of Human mind and behaviour. It is only a matter of time when his writings, translated in many languages, can spread the timeless message of India throughout the world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HAIZBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Not I, But Christ","description":"Laying a good foundation is essential for the full growth of a Christian as well as for the building up of the body of Christ.

Paulo Coelho, auteur van De alchemist De monnik die zijn Ferrari verkocht is het verhaal van Julian Mantle, een geslaagd advocaat, die door zijn enerverende maar onevenwichtige leven een bijna noodlottige hartaanval krijgt. Geconfronteerd met zijn fysieke broosheid maakt Julian een spirituele crisis door die hem noopt op zoek te gaan naar de antwoorden op de grote vragen van het leven. Hij besluit radicaal te breken met zijn luxe maar oppervlakkige bestaan en waagt zich op een buitengewone odyssee naar een eeuwenoude cultuur in de Himalaya. Daar vindt hij een krachtig systeem dat de mens in staat stelt om de potentie van geest, lichaam en ziel ten volle te ontplooien en intenser, gelukkiger en harmonieuzer te leven. De monnik die zijn Ferrari verkocht is een inspirerende vertelling, waarin de tijdloze spirituele wijsheid van het Oosten wordt vermengd met messcherpe zakelijkheid van het Westen.

In this book, the members of the Group for the Study of Interpersonal Development at the Harvard Graduate School of Education and the Judge Baker Children's Center in Boston describe in detail an innovative intervention and prevention method, pair therapy, that is designed to address these issues by helping children develop healthy interpersonal relationships. Pair therapy is a relationship-oriented treatment modality that addresses the social context of the difficulties encountered in growing up in today's world. This approach has been developed not only as a therapeutic intervention in day and residential treatment centers but also as a prevention method that can be used in public schools, day care centers, and other contexts. This practical volume meets the demand for an accessible, hands-on guide to the pair method. The theoretical foundations of the approach are also presented in an accessible fashion here. The techniques described in this book model a relationship-building process between an adult professional and two children. This process replicates the social relations that happen naturally in healthy and happy interactions and long-term relationships among well-cared-for children in safe and secure communities. This book will be useful for a number of disciplines that deal with younger children and adolescents: social work, education, school and group therapy, and human development. It offers educators, therapists, and other practitioners in a wide variety of settings the opportunity to learn how to develop a pair therapy program. It will also be an indispensable tool in the libraries of mental health practitioners who counsel youth beyond ordinary clinical treatment.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Eqw0DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Especially dogs: Especially at Stillmeadow","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Z_V7swEACAAJ&dq=Especially+dogs:+Especially+at+Stillmeadow&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Einsiedeln: The Monastery and Church of Our Lady of the Hermits : from the Carolingian period to the present (The Great art guides)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=tBxQAQAAIAAJ&dq=Einsiedeln:+The+Monastery+and+Church+of+Our+Lady+of+the+Hermits+:+from+the+Carolingian+period+to+the+present+(The+Great+art+guides)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Share of Honor","description":"In the Philippines during World War II, Americans and Filipinos become enmeshed in the resistance against the Japanese occupation and romantically entangled with one another","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=gxgQHQAACAAJ&dq=Share+of+Honor&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"No kava for Johnny","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=R_lLAAAAIAAJ&dq=No+kava+for+Johnny&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Operating Systems (3rd Edition)","description":"The widely anticipated revision of this worldwide best-seller incorporates the latest developments in operating systems technologies.

With the advent of the revolving pistols, however; came patents that created monopolies in revolver production and the through-bored cylinder necessary for self-contained metallic cartridges. The caplock revolvers took on a separate evolution and remained state of the art long after the widespread appearance of cartridge firing rifles and shotguns. They rode in the holsters of explorers and adventures across the world and granted safe conduct in the back alleys of industrial slums right up until the last quarter of the 19th Century. Handguns possess a mystique distinctly different from that of other firearms. They are tools of personal empowerment-chosen by their owners to provide independence and freedom of movement. In the ambitious, optimistic early years of western industrial civilization they were the emblem of liberty and equality and the bane of repressive governments and social movements. Largely because of the traditions that emerged in the time of the caplock pistols and revolvers, they remain so in the early years of the 21st Century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=LQausfRgWvYC&dq=Pistols+and+Revolvers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rebels In Hell","description":"All of Hell is in revolt as Gilgamesh, Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, and the other damned, turn rebel, in this collection of stories by such science fiction masters as Robert Silverberg, Janet Morris, C.J.

Ye Wenjie moet toezien hoe de Rode Garde haar vader doodslaat tijdens de Chinese Culturele Revolutie. Deze moord zal niet alleen haar leven tekenen, maar ook de toekomst van de hele mensheid. Veertig jaar later wordt de nanotechnoloog Wang Miao gevraagd om een geheimzinnige reeks van zelfmoorden onder wetenschappers te onderzoeken. Wangs onderzoek leidt hem naar een mysterieuze onlinegame en een virtuele wereld die wordt beheerst door de onvoorspelbare interactie tussen haar drie zonnen. Maar is die wereld alleen maar virtueel of bestaat zij misschien echt? Dit is het drielichamenprobleem, en het is de sleutel tot alles: tot de dood van de wetenschappers, tot een samenzwering die lichtjaren omvat en tot de uitroeiing die de mensheid onder ogen moet zien. Het drielichamenprobleem is het eerste, adembenemende deel van een trilogie over ruimte en tijd, en over het voortbestaan van de aarde, waarvan wereldwijd al meer dan tien miljoen exemplaren werden verkocht. Cixin Liu is de bekendste en succesvolste sciencefictionschrijver van China.

The guide includes well-researched history and cultural sections, with a particularly strong section on music, and brings an honest approach to reporting the fragile balance between tourist development and protecting the environment. This new edition reflects the many changes since the previous one, including the introduction of charter flights from the UK to Sal and the first casino-hotel on Sal, as well as providing full information on how to make the most of the less developed islands away from the main tourist hotspots. Stable and peaceful, quietly isolated by its mid-Atlantic location, Cape Verde continues to grow economically and to develop its tourist infrastructure at a leisurely pace. With few natural resources, the islands are heavily dependent on imports, foreign remittances and still to some extent on foreign aid. The reduction in the latter has heightened the focus on the importance of tourism as an economic driver and visitor numbers continue to rise. Year-round sunshine makes Cape Verde a particularly appealing destination. The archipelago is diverse, particularly in terms of its tourist infrastructure. Sal and Boavista, the oldest of these volcanic islands are flat with white-sand beaches that rival anything in the world. Consequently, they attract 95% of Cape Verde's visitors, leaving the other seven inhabited islands undeveloped. Hikers and those curious to discover something authentic are drawn to them, spending their time walking amongst the jaw-dropping mountainous landscapes of Fogo or Santo Ant?o, taking some true time-out in tiny Brava or mellow Maio or enjoying the cultural fusion of African, Portuguese and Brazilian influences in the cities of Praia and Mindelo. The adventurous will find adrenalin rushing as they profit from windsurfing and kitesurfing opportunities, fuelled by strong breezes and Atlantic waves, while for culture, Mindelo is the attraction with a constant backdrop of seductive music, the thread which ties together the islands scattered across the mid-Atlantic.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=TyKoDgAAQBAJ&dq=Cape+Verde+Islands:+The+Bradt+Travel+Guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"One Big Happy: Nice Costs Extra!","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=cuCkPQAACAAJ&dq=One+Big+Happy:+Nice+Costs+Extra!&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gertie the birdie","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=C_VEGwAACAAJ&dq=Gertie+the+birdie&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Acting in the Cinema","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=1-F5rgEACAAJ&dq=Acting+in+the+Cinema&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Life in the Far West","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=VYgWzgEACAAJ&dq=Life+in+the+Far+West&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"On Overgrown Paths","description":"The great confessional memoir of the Nobel-prize winning Norwegian novelist, Knut Hamsun.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=c-rqAAAAMAAJ&dq=On+Overgrown+Paths&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Best-Loved Short Stories: Flaubert, Chekhov, Kipling, Joyce, Fitzgerald, Poe and Others (Dover Large Print Classics)","description":"This international array of 11 tales by popular authors includes Fitzgerald's \\"Bernice Bobs Her Hair,\\" de Maupassant's \\"The Necklace,\\" and stories by Flaubert, Poe, Tolstoy, Kipling, Joyce, Lawrence, Cather and others.

Since the terrorist attacks of 9/11, George W. Bush s decision to move away from multilateral decisionmaking toward a more aggressive, preemptive style of foreign policy attracted widespread debate, and criticism, throughout the world. Reversing direction, the Barack Obama presidency is placing greater emphasis on constructive or peaceful engagement within multilateral frameworks, relying on special envoys to deal with some of the thorniest problems. In this book, Paul Viotti explores American foreign policy from the founding of the republic in the late 18th Century to the present day. Part 1 examines the broad policy options available to the US government: namely, peaceful engagement, containment through deterrence or coercive diplomacy, and armed intervention. Part 2 looks at the American experience in foreign policy. By exploring early precedents and elite practices, the moralism of American exceptionalism as well as the roots of an expansionist American foreign policy, the discussion draws out the continuities running from the 18th century to the present. Part 3 concludes with an analysis of the politics of interest on the Potomac with analysis of the interplay of contending policy elites, factions and parties influencing foreign policy making today. Assessing alternatives, the author concludes that even though containment and armed intervention will remain part of the way the United States conducts its foreign policy, diplomatic engagement options are the most promising course of action for the coming decades.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=f5kW-NoaD9MC&dq=American+foreign+policy+since+World+War+II+(Books+that+matter)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Death of A Thousand Cuts: Corporate Campaigns and the Attack on the Corporation","description":"A corporate campaign is an organized assault on the reputation of a company that has offended some interest group. Although corporate campaigns often involve political, economic, and legal tactics, they are centered around the media, where protagonists attempt to redefine the image--and undermine the reputation--of the target company. It is a strategy most frequently employed by unions but is also employed by special interests, such as environmental or human rights groups. Sometimes it is even employed by one corporation against another. It is a rapidly growing phenomenon that is still unknown to the general public, to most academics and journalists, and is rarely understood by the corporations that find themselves on the firing line. The Death of a Thousand Cuts argues and demonstrates that corporate campaigns are a distinctive phenomenon whose manifestations are today ubiquitous in both the marketplace and the media. This volume examines, in considerable detail, the history, strategy, tactics, effects, consequences, and likely future directions of the corporate campaign and of its nonlabor-based cousin, the anticorporate campaign. The book is based on ample sources and methods, among them an extensive review and analysis of media coverage, news releases, previous scholarship, union publications, campaign materials, interviews and conversations with individuals who have experienced corporate campaigns, public presentations by labor leaders and others, correspondence, Internet postings, case law summaries, documents, videotapes, and other materials. Through original data and interpretation, this book adds context and integration to these materials thus giving them new meaning. Key features of this outstanding new book include: * A thorough and clear explanation of what a corporate campaign is and how it differs from other more mundane \\"public relations\\" campaigns. * A detailed examination of strategies and tactics that includes their historical development. Some of the more high profile target companies in recent years include Coca-Cola, Microsoft, Caterpillar, Campbell's Soup, Federal Express, General Dynamics, Home Depot, International Paper, K-Mart, Nike, Texaco, Walmart, Starbucks, and UPS. * Hundreds of examples that help explain such contemporary events as the anti-sweatshop movement on college campuses, the living wage movement, and the protests against the World Trade Organization, International Monetary Fund, and World Bank. * A lengthy appendix contains abbreviated descriptions of nearly 200 corporate campaigns waged by labor unions and various advocacy groups since the idea of the corporate campaign was first developed in the 1960's.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=iSuRAgAAQBAJ&dq=The+Death+of+A+Thousand+Cuts:+Corporate+Campaigns+and+the+Attack+on+the+Corporation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Translating Neruda: The Way to Macchu Picchu","description":"What goes into the translating of a poem? Usually that process gets forgotten once the new poem stands intact in translation. Yet a verse translation derives from historical, biographical, and philosophical research, interpretive analysis of the original poem, and continuous linguistic and prosodic choices that parallel those the poet made. Taking as a text Pablo Neruda's brilliant prophetic sequence Alturas de Macchu Picchu (1945), the author here re-creates the entire process of translation, from his first encounter with the poem to the last shaping of a phrase that may never come right in English. This many-faceted book forms an essay on the theory and practice of literary translation, a study of Neruda's career through 1945, and an interpretation of his major poem, all of which lead to a striking new poem in English, Heights of Macchu Picchu, printed along with the original Spanish. This genesis of a verse translation also includes little-known biographical data, hitherto untranslated poems and prose from the years 1920 to 1945, and new translations of key poems from Neruda's Residence on Earth and Spain in My Heart.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=8YohLXmGnU0C&dq=Translating+Neruda:+The+Way+to+Macchu+Picchu&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cambridge (MD) (Images of America)","description":"Dorchester County's special blend of past and present, treasured by locals, appeals also to visitors from all walks of life.

Dorchester County is surrounded almost entirely by scenic waters: the Choptank and Nanticoke Rivers, Hunting Creek, and the Chesapeake Bay. A cruise along these waterways offers long stretches of pristine marsh and uplands that transport visitors to earlier days, when Native Americans traveled these same waters in log canoes. Occasional glimpses of historic homes evoke colonial times. Within these watery boundaries, this largest of Maryland's counties encompasses landscapes and activities to gladden any heart. Railroad and history buffs, hunters, birdwatchers, epicures, and visitors from more hectic locales all find their heart's content in this land of pleasant living.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=8NuUFA4BMusC&dq=Cambridge+(MD)+(Images+of+America)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chronicle of the 20th Century: The Ultimate Record of Our Times","description":"This book examines the cultural concepts that guided the development of the  age of mankind   the changes that took place in historical, philosophical, scientific, religious, literary, and artistic thought in the 20th century.

Because such metaphors structure our most basic understandings of our experience, they are \\"metaphors we live by\\" metaphors that can shape our perceptions and actions without our ever noticing them. In this updated edition of Lakoff and Johnson's influential book, the authors supply an afterword surveying how their theory of metaphor has developed within the cognitive sciences to become central to the contemporary understanding of how we think and how we express our thoughts in language.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=r6nOYYtxzUoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Responding to the Challenges of Developmental Education: New Directions for Community Colleges, Number 129","description":"Developmental education is a core mission of the community college, and approximately 40 percent of entering community college students enroll in one ore more developmental math, English, or reading courses. The existing literature recommends several instructional and organization practices for developmental educators to follow in addressing the needs of those students. Despite the availability of these models, however, community colleges--each facing its own unique combination of students needs and available resources--continue to struggle in their efforts to effectively educate underprepared students and help them move onto and succeed in college-level courses. This volume of New Directions for Community Colleges offers a realistic assessment of the difficulties community colleges face in attempting to assist students who share the common characteristic of being underprepared for college-level work, but whose backgrounds, academic preparation, motivational levels, and goals are extraordinarily varied. The authors discuss the dangers of isolating developmental students, faculty, and curriculum from the broader academic structure of the college. They provide examples of successful programs, and offer a range of recommendations that college administrators can adapt to their campuses and student populations. They also call for additional research on developmental education, especially systematic assessments of existing programs and qualitative research that captures the perceptions of the students for whom these programs are designed.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=EIglAQAAIAAJ&dq=Responding+to+the+Challenges+of+Developmental+Education:+New+Directions+for+Community+Colleges,+Number+129&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club (2 volumes)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=97_azgEACAAJ&dq=The+Posthumous+Papers+of+the+Pickwick+Club+(2+volumes)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pocket-size Workout Cards, Second Edition","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Z488DAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Back Roads of the Cape","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Ubym5FAsEgEC&dq=Back+Roads+of+the+Cape&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Strategies for enhancing your executive, personal, and career development.

The connection has a history, one rooted in a conception of feminine identities invented through a science interwoven with the pursuit of empire, the accumulation of goods, and the furtherance of power. It is this history that Robin Truth Goodman exposes in her analysis of literary and political representations of female infertility from the mid-nineteenth century to our day.\\" \\"Goodman takes Darwin's studies on sterility between species as her starting point, exploring evolutionary science as the intersection of a colonial worldview based on class struggle and the pathologizing of female identities that fall outside of reproductive normalcy. She then examines how Joseph Conrad constructs a vision of feminism as a product of miscegenation, how Alejo Carpentier and Mario Vargas Llosa deploy female figures of miscegenation to recast Latin American literature as \\"difference,\\" and how ecological devastation in the Brazilian Amazon is envisioned through failures in Indian marriage. Locating points of conjunction between queer, feminist, and postcolonial theories, Infertilities points to the role of lesbian representation and reproductive politics in ongoing critiques of globalism.\\"--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

During that first visit, this man filled her ears with prophetic visions of a glorious future--the inheritance of those fortunate few who might choose to accompany him. His confidence and charisma entranced her, and she soon recruited two of her college roommates. When the psychologist fired his assistant two years later, Elizabeth and her mother followed. Over the next decade, this man, a malevolent genius and master of manipulating metaphysical concepts to benefit a self-serving agenda, organized a small, dedicated band of followers. \\"The Group\\" evolved into an incestuous family--a cult.

Subsequent to a momentous event in August 1994, with the guru as high priest, \\"The Black Dog Religion\\" was born. Elizabeth sank into a pit of despair, darker than she ever could have imagined was possible.

As such, Ostrogorski's two-volume study of the party system in Britain and the United States exerted profound influence on the subsequent writings of Max Weber and Robert Michels. A descriptive analyst of the party system in these two countries, Ostrogorski developed concepts and methods that an-ticipated by nearly half a century those later used by American and British political scientists. The core of Ostrogorski's analysis is a detailed history of the rise of and changes within the party system in Britain and the United States, the first nations to introduce mass suffrage. While the emphasis of Democracy and the Organization of Political Parties is on the similar trends in the political parties of both countries, Ostrogorski also showed concern with the sources of differences between them. Seeking to explain these variations, he suggested a number of fundamental hypotheses about these two societies that con-tinue to be of relevance today. Lipset's substantial introduction places Os-trogorski's work within its historical context and assesses Ostrogorski's im-pact and influence on both his contemporaries and on later political scien-tists.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dPdKDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Halftime: Changing Your Game Plan From Success to Significance","description":"Buford tells men how they can make their middle years a time of transformation toward a more satisfying life.

Fighter aircraft were developed by during World War I at an unprecedented rate, as nascent air forces sought to achieve and maintain air supremacy. German manufacturers innovated at top speed, while constantly scrutinising the development of new enemy aircraft. The Germans also utilised the concept of systematic production or modular engineering during the war - Fokker capitalised on this aspect with all his aircraft built in a similar fashion - wooden wings with welded steel fuselages. This meant that they could be disassembled or reassembled quickly in the field - unlike many Allied aircraft. Pfalz and Albatros were the first to realise the importance of a streamlined fuselage - the precursor to all that would follow. Both of these companies built semi-monocoque fuselages using plywood to develop semi-stressed skin - the Allies had nothing like this. The Germans also perfect powerful inline engines, as exemplified by the Albatros fighters. These engines did not have the gyroscopic effect of the rotary engines and as such were easier and more stable to fly. Fokker was slow to give up his rotary engines but once he did, the result was the iconic Fokker D VII - years ahead of its time and the only aircraft specifically mentioned in the Treaty of Versailles that Germany could not build after the war. German Fighter Aircraft in World War I explores how German fighter aircraft were developed during the war, the innovations and trials that made the Fokker D VII possible, and the different makes and types of aircraft. Using unpublished images including photographs of surviving aircraft, archive images, and models and replicas, it shows details of aircraft that were kept top secret during the war. Extensively illustrated with 140 photos and ten colour profiles, this is will be essential reading for all WWI aviation enthusiasts and modellers.

Its author was a man of sophistication and erudition even though he was not given to virtuoso displays of either quality. He created this novel out of his personal and artistic needs, and out of his sense of the need of Japan and the world community to know the story he tells in it. Japan has been richly served by the original. But Toson had a worldwide as well as a Japanese audience in mind when he wrote Before the Dawn. This translation has been done in the hope of contributing to that undertaking. Before the Dawn looks back on the adventure, turmoil, and tragedy of the mid-nineteenth century with a clear and unsentimental vision, but it speaks of those times in tones of tact, humility, and deference. It is a celebration of the humanity of its characters and the richness, complexity, and diversity of the lives they lived during the final years of the Tokugawa shogunate and the first two decades of the Meiji era. For all the weight of its historical concerns, it maintains its lyrical tone even when the subject is external threat, internal political turmoil, the grinding hardship of maintaining the old post system, or the bitter disappointments that the new age brought so many of those who had worked hardest and sacrificed most to bring it into being. It has been followed not only by scholarly studies but also by an immense outpouring of historical fiction, family and local histories, and other publications drawing on the rich store of old diaries and official records preserved throughout the country. These later works often illuminate the period from points of view that were not accessible to any of Tosona??s characters, but Before the Dawn remains the standard against which all others are measured.\\" a??from the Introduction","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=1aABEAAAQBAJ&dq=Before+the+Dawn&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Southern Baptist Politics","description":"Unlike other recent studies of the Southern Baptists, Southern Baptist Politics was written after the culmination of the &\\"Baptist battles&\\" of the 1980s, when Fundamentalists had effectively taken control of the denomination. It also considers the SBC not simply as a denomination but as an organization with characteristics similar to other voluntary associations in American society& an approach that promises to be useful for the study of other religious groups in America. Arthur Farnsley concludes that the SBC, as an American denomination, had within itself the seeds of pragmatism and individualism that characterize most American voluntary organizations. Of primary interest to Farnsley are the crucial issues of authority and power. Taking his cue from Paul Harrison's classic study, Authority and Power in the Free Church Tradition, Farnsley considers how authority has traditionally been exercised within the SBC, and how Fundamentalists maneuvered within this existing authority structure to seize power. According to Farnsley, disgruntled Fundamentalists soon discovered that they could exploit the democratic elements within the SBC polity to their advantage. So successful were they in their efforts that by 1990 all significant leadership positions within the denomination were filled by Fundamentalists, thus enabling them to take, and hold, institutional power. The lessons of Southern Baptist Politics extend beyond this one denomination. By using the Southern Baptists as a case study, Farnsley asks what the SBC controversy can tell us about religious organizations in America, about dealing with cultural pluralism, and about institutional means for creating change.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=mSqt40uivdIC&dq=Southern+Baptist+Politics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Language of Comics: Word and Image","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=j_S6QHAov1kC&dq=The+Language+of+Comics:+Word+and+Image&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Lena Baker Story","description":"\\"This is the story of the first and only woman to be legally executed in the state of Georgia's electric chair.

Kiersten White has taken the best parts of the Arthurian legend and made them all her own.\\"--Ren e Ahdieh, #1 New York Times bestselling author of The Wrath and the Dawn series. A new fantasy series set in the world of Camelot that bestselling author Christina Lauren calls \\"brilliant,\\" reimagining the Arthurian legend . . . where nothing is as magical and terrifying as a girl. Princess Guinevere has come to Camelot to wed a stranger: the charismatic King Arthur. With magic clawing at the kingdom's borders, the great wizard Merlin conjured a solution--send in Guinevere to be Arthur's wife . . . and his protector from those who want to see the young king's idyllic city fail. The catch? Guinevere's real name--and her true identity--is a secret. She is a changeling, a girl who has given up everything to protect Camelot. To keep Arthur safe, Guinevere must navigate a court in which the old--including Arthur's own family--demand things continue as they have been, and the new--those drawn by the dream of Camelot--fight for a better way to live. And always, in the green hearts of forests and the black depths of lakes, magic lies in wait to reclaim the land. Deadly jousts, duplicitous knights, and forbidden romances are nothing compared to the greatest threat of all: the girl with the long black hair, riding on horseback through the dark woods toward Arthur.

He explores topics such as spiritual gifts, the fruit of the Spirit, the Spirit's power for evangelism, and hearing God's voice. His desire is for Christians to \\"work for consensus, or at least for unity in God's work despite our differences on secondary matters.\\" Employing a helpful narrative approach and an ample number of stories, Keener enters into constructive dialogue with Pentecostals, moderates, and cessationists, all the while attempting to learn from each viewpoint. He seeks to bridge the gap between cessationists and Pentecostals/charismatics by urging all Christians to seek the Holy Spirit's empowerment. His irenic approach to this controversial issue has been endorsed by charismatics and non-charismatics alike. Sure to provoke helpful dialogue on a topic that has caused unfortunate divisions within the church, Gift and Giver will be a valuable addition to college and seminary courses on pneumatology. It will also be helpful to lay readers interested in a balanced discussion of spiritual gifts.

This collection of fifty holonomic maps and comprehensive text is based on a resonant field paradigm which transcends the Newtonian materialistic model. Each individual map is a work of art unto itself, encapsulating a world of insight and consciousness, and bridging the gap to an integrated, galactic worldview. In 1978, Buckminster Fuller said that it would be curtains for humanity if a design revolution were not completed within ten years. It is now ten years later, and as a convincing response to this challenge, Earth Ascending postulates a planetary design which envisions the evolving field of Earth in relation to the galactic whole. Earth Ascending demands a stretch of consciousness. Our fall from spiritual realization and our degradation of the environment are the result of a blind acceptance of one-dimensionality, and a paralyzed, complacent acceptance of impending doom. Only a rebirth into the numinous world of multidimensional interface will give us the vision to create a new future.

He offers personal recollections of schools, teachers, and traditions of particular importance in his own life. And, returning to his roots as a professor of economics, he discusses the competitiveness of American industry and the relations between the market economy and American democracy. Throughout these writings Levin illuminates and inspires. Always his affection for the university shines through.

But twenty years on, in the light of recent events in the Middle East and post-September 11, its powerful message of hope, directed towards a people 'poised between Holocaust and empowerment', remains as powerful, apposite, and pressingly relevant as it was before. Ellis begins with two poles: the holocaust and the pain and vision that issue from it. This leads him into ethics, and he highlights the contrast between the depth of Jewish ethical commitment and the paucity of renewal movements within Judaism. The author then addresses all suffering peoples, and the Christian liberation movements active among them, so that the holocaust may be set in a wider context. Against this background, Ellis sees it as essential that the journeys and visions of dissenting Jews - such as Etty Hillesum and Martin Buber - should be re-appraised. An alternative perspective of what it means to be Jewish begins to emerge, and in the final chapter a Jewish theology of liberation is essayed, which is a theology prepared 'to enter the danger zones of contemporary Jewish life', often at some cost.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=l2SmDwAAQBAJ&dq=On+the+third+era+in+Jewish+history:+Power+and+politics+(Perspectives)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Green Lantern: Fear Itself","description":"The Green Lanterns of three generations, Alan Scott, Hal Jordan, and Kyle Raynereach face a foe that brings their greatest fears to life.

Geison uses Pasteur's laboratory notebooks, made available only recently, and his published papers to present a rich and full account of some of the most famous episodes in the history of science and their darker sides--for example, Pasteur's rush to develop the rabies vaccine and the human risks his haste entailed. The discrepancies between the public record and the \\"private science\\" of Louis Pasteur tell us as much about the man as they do about the highly competitive and political world he learned to master. Although experimental ingenuity served Pasteur well, he also owed much of his success to the polemical virtuosity and political savvy that won him unprecedented financial support from the French state during the late nineteenth century. But a close look at his greatest achievements raises ethical issues. In the case of Pasteur's widely publicized anthrax vaccine, Geison reveals its initial defects and how Pasteur, in order to avoid embarrassment, secretly incorporated a rival colleague's findings to make his version of the vaccine work. Pasteur's premature decision to apply his rabies treatment to his first animal-bite victims raises even deeper questions and must be understood not only in terms of the ethics of human experimentation and scientific method, but also in light of Pasteur's shift from a biological theory of immunity to a chemical theory--similar to ones he had often disparaged when advanced by his competitors. Through his vivid reconstruction of the professional rivalries as well as the national adulation that surrounded Pasteur, Geison places him in his wider cultural context. In giving Pasteur the close scrutiny his fame and achievements deserve, Geison's book offers compelling reading for anyone interested in the social and ethical dimensions of science.

Coming together as refugees from three seminal '60s bands-the Byrds, Buffalo Springfield and the Hollies-the combined talents of David Crosby, Stephen Stills, Graham Nash and Neil Young have influenced several generations of musicians while proving to have enduring appeal to fans of all ages. As rock and roll's first \\"supergroup,\\" CSNY generated an enormous amount of media scrutiny-from their galvanizing appearance at Woodstock to multi-platinum, chart-topping albums such as Deja Vu, from David Crosby's miraculous recovery from life-threatening addictions to the band's resurgence for enormously successful concert tours. Now, noted CSNY historian Dave Zimmer distills the best of the journalism on these four remarkable artists, ranging from group portraits to individual profiles to in-depth interviews to incisive commentary by such writers as Cameron Crowe, Ben Fong-Torres and David Crosby himself. 4 Way Street: The Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young Reader is an open window into one of the most popular groups of all time, offering a fascinating look at their highly charged musical relationships and how they have changed over the decades, along the way revealing a colorful chronicle of the music of an era that continues to echo into the new millennium.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=dLaQipNSklMC&dq=4+Way+Street:+The+Crosby,+Stills,+Nash&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Reinventing Human Services: Community- and Family- Centered Practice (Modern Applications of Social Work)","description":"Dissatisfaction with a human services system that is unresponsive, stigmatizing, and ineffective has led to a ferment of experimentation in recent years.

It draws on successful examples in Britain, Canada, and the United States to develop a new paradigm for social work practice, one that integrates individual, family, and community levels of practice and reconceptualizes professional-community relations.

Brauer's idiosyncratic style, from his Quaker roots and Buddhist principles, lends a piquancy to his curious stance with phrases like \\"Seeking to understand wu-wei, the art of participating without interfering, might go a long way to re-orienting the bizarre farrago that democracy has become.\\" Whether getting ruffled with the Media having 'all the percipience and principle of a lobotomised Caliban', or lumping bankers in with politicians in the 'conspiracy of charlatans', Brauer weighs his arguments to form a trustworthy voice intent on showing, rather than telling. With edicts for everyone from Confuscious to archy the cockroach, Brauer communicates with palatable, pub-table anecdotes and examples, home-grown diagrams and illustrations, and fair, honest questions in this timely study of human beings in the face of power and money.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NreLVUMgN3wC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Father Marquette and the great rivers (Vision books)","description":"This Vision book for youth 9 - 15 years old tells the thrilling story of one of America's greatest missionaries who came down from Canada with explorer Louis Joliet to explore the mighty Mississippi River, the \\"great river\\" bordered by Indian tribes who killed white men on sight.

Ricketts: The shaping of a novelist","description":"Edward F. Ricketts, a marine biologist who lived on the Monterey waterfront in California, was a close friend of John Steinbeck, the novelist. As Professor Astro makes clear, no analysis of Steinbeck?s writing can proceed without a careful study of the life, work, and ideas of Ricketts, who was Steinbeck?s closest personal and intellectual companion for nearly two decades.Ricketts went to California from Chicago in 1923, and from that time until his death in 1948 he operated a biological supply house at Pacific Grove. Steinbeck and Ricketts met in 1930 and struck an immediate friendship. Together they planned a handbook on the marine invertebrates of the San Francisco Bay region. Although this project was never carried out, it paved the way for another venture, a collecting expedition to the Gulf of California which resulted in their collaboration on Sea of Cortez: A Leisurely Journal of Travel and Research, the published record of that trip. As Professor Astro points out, Ricketts served, in varying degrees, as the source of characters in six of Steinbeck?s novels and novelettes and one short story. Perhaps more importantly, the author shows that many of Steinbeck?s central thematic tenets were provided by Ricketts? passion for holistic and ecological thinking, his associational beliefs about the behavior of men and animals in groups, and his disdain for the acquisition of material wealth. But, he warns, ?to say that all of Steinbeck?s concern with science in general and with marine biology in particular came directly from Ricketts is to distort the facts.?By analyzing the range and depth of Ricketts? impact on Steinbeck?s fiction, this book places a major writer in fresh perspective.Richard Astro is an associate professor of English at Oregon State University.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=SVSfPQAACAAJ&dq=John+Steinbeck+and+Edward+F.+Ricketts:+The+shaping+of+a+novelist&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Victor Sjostrom: His Life and His Work","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=mI1ZAAAAMAAJ&dq=Victor+Sjostrom:+His+Life+and+His+Work&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Opportunities in Fire Protection Services","description":"Provides an overview of fire protection, examines the education and qualifications needed for the job, and advises on job hunting","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=l2KlbPoAtOcC&dq=Opportunities+in+Fire+Protection+Services&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Egyptian necklace","description":"The son of the Pharaoh's architect discovers the overseer's attempt to rob a former queen's tomb in Egypt, 1400 B.C.

The outgrowth of a project begun by Grace L. Tracey and completed by John P. Dern, it presents a detailed account of landholdings in that part of western Maryland that eventually became Frederick County. At the same time it provides a history of the inhabitants of the area, from the early traders and explorers to the farsighted investors and speculators, from the original Quaker settlers to the Germans of central Frederick County.In essence, the book has a dual focus. First it attempts to locate and describe the land of the early settlers. This is done by means of a superb series of plat maps, drawn to scale from original surveys and based both on certificates of survey and patents. These show, in precise configurations, the exact locations of the various grants and lots, the names of owners and occupiers, the dates of surveys and patents, and the names of contiguous land owners. Second, it identifies the early settlers and inhabitants of the area, carefully following them through deeds, wills, and inventories, judgment records, and rent rolls.Finally, in meticulously compiled appendices it provides a chronological list of surveys between 1721 and 1743; an alphabetical list of surveys, giving dates, page reference--text and maps--and patent references; a list of taxables for 1733-34; and a list of the early German settlers of Frederick County, showing their religion, their location, dates of arrival, and their earliest records in the county.Winner of the 1988 Donald Lines Jacobus Award!","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Ei2NW7IXYsIC&dq=Pioneers+of+Old+Monocacy+The+Early+Settlement+of+Frederick+County+Maryland+1721-1743&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Professional Techniques for Pet and Animal Photography","description":"A comprehensive guide to safeguard your livelihood, income, and standard of living through the ups and downs of any economy.

Rock paintings and engravings can be found in nearly every state and province, and each region has its own distinctive story of discovery and evolving investigation of the rock art record. Rock art in the twenty-first century enjoys a large and growing popularity fueled by scholarly research and public interest alike. This book explores the history of rock art research in North America and is the only volume in the past twenty-five years to provide coverage of the subject on a continental scale. Written by contributors active in rock art research, it examines sites that provide a cross-section of regions and topics and complements existing books on rock art by offering new information, insights, and approaches to research. The first part of the volume explores different regional approaches to the study of rock art, including a set of varied responses to a single site as well as an overview of broader regional research investigations. It tells how Writing-on-Stone in southern Alberta, Canada, reflects changing thought about rock art from the 1870s to today; it describes the role of avocational archaeologists in the Mississippi Valley, where rock art styles differ on each side of the river; it explores discoveries in southwestern mountains and southeastern caves; and it integrates the investigation of cupules along Georgia?s Yellow River into a full study of a site and its context. The book also compares the differences between rock art research in the United States and France: from the outset, rock art was of only marginal interest to most U.S. archaeologists, while French prehistorians considered cave art an integral part of archaeological research. The book?s second part is concerned with working with the images today and includes coverage of gender interests, government sponsorship, the role of amateurs in research, and chronometric studies. Much has changed in our understanding of rock art since Cotton Mather first wrote in 1714 of a strange inscription on a Massachusetts boulder, and the cutting-edge contributions in this volume tell us much about both the ancient place of these enduring images and their modern meanings. Discovering North American Rock Art distills today?s most authoritative knowledge of the field and is an essential volume for both specialists and hobbyists.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=H86_Awa0lEoC&dq=Discovering+North+American+Rock+Art&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The First Hundred Years of Nino Cochise","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=SErJtwEACAAJ&dq=The+First+Hundred+Years+of+Nino+Cochise&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Can you feel the thunder?","description":"Thirteen-year-old Mic Parsons struggles with mixed feelings about his deaf and blind sister while at the same time he makes his way through the turmoils of junior high.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=QcUEAAAACAAJ&dq=Can+you+feel+the+thunder%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Martinis and Whipped Cream: the New Carbo-Cal Way to Lose Weight and Stay Slim","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=UxtvnQEACAAJ&dq=Martinis+and+Whipped+Cream:+the+New+Carbo-Cal+Way+to+Lose+Weight+and+Stay+Slim&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tsar: The Lost World of Nicholas and Alexandra","description":"First published in the US in 1995, this lavishly illustrated history tells of the life and times of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia.

They met only once, at Waterloo. On December 7, 1815, Marshal of France, Michel Ney, stood before a firing squad in Paris. Muskets crashed and he fell. Thirty-one years later he died in North Carolina. This is the dramatic story of Ney's probable escape from execution, of his dangerous early years in America, and his transformation into a highly respected educator. Execution Denied is also a tale of governmental deceit and attempted murder; of enormous courage and rock-solid loyalties across time and space. It imaginatively connects the many dots of historic evidence to create a carefully considered, but necessarily speculative story. In the absence of conclusive data, like DNA, we may never know the full truth. Still, I believe that this re-construction is close to what happened.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=msEsAAAACAAJ&dq=Execution+Denied:+The+Story+Of+Marshal+Ney:+Napoleon%27s+%22Bravest+of+the+Brave%22&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"No Graves As Yet: A Novel Of World War I","description":"Through Anne Perry s magnificent Victorian novels, millions of readers have enjoyed the pleasures and intrigue of a bygone age.

Theirs was a peace that led to war. On a sunny afternoon in late June, Cambridge professor Joseph Reavley is summoned from a student cricket match to learn that his parents have died in an automobile crash. Joseph s brother, Matthew, as officer in the Intelligence Service, reveals that their father had been en route to London to turn over to him a mysterious secret document allegedly with the power to disgrace England forever and destroy the civilized world. A paper so damning that Joseph and Matthew dared mention it only to their restless younger sister. Now it has vanished. What has happened to this explosive document, if indeed it ever existed? How had it fallen into the hands of their father, a quiet countryman? Not even Matthew, with his Intelligence connections, can answer these questions. And Joseph is soon burdened with a second tragedy: the shocking murder of his most gifted student, beautiful Sebastian Allard, loved and admired by everyone. Or so it appeared. Meanwhile, England s seamless peace is cracking as the distance between the murder of an Austrian archduke by a Serbian anarchist and the death of a brilliant university student by a bullet to the head of grows shorter by the day. Anne Perry is a sublime master of suspense. In No Graves As Yet, her latest haunting masterpiece, she reminds us that love and hate, cowardice and courage, good and evil are always a part of life, in our own time as well as on the eve of the greatest war the world has ever known.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ObHntcCkaaMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The magic pretzel (Werewolf Club)","description":"Fourth-grader Norman Gnormal, who behaves a lot like a dog, finds his first real friends when the principal signs him up for the Werewolf Club at school.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=qK9Xg_w9YHYC&dq=The+magic+pretzel+(Werewolf+Club)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Edward Gorey: Verse Advice: A Book for Recording Birthdays and Other Special Occasions (Perpetual Calendar)","description":"Als Sara McMillan een stapel prikkelende dagboeken in handen krijgt, afkomstig uit een opslagunit waarvan de inhoud geveild wordt, is ze geschokt en gefascineerd tegelijk door de ontboezemingen van de schrijfster.

Reasserting patriarchal gender relations presumably authorized by religion has been central to these movements. At the Fourth United Nations Congress on Women in Beijing in 1995, Muslim and Catholic delegations from diverse countries united to oppose provisions on sexuality, reproductive rights, women's health, and women's rights as human rights. In this book, scholars from eight different Muslim and Catholic communities analyze the political strategies that women are employing in these contexts ranging from acceptance of traditional doctrines to various forms of resistance, religious reinterpretation, innovation, and political action toward change and equal rights.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lEoBDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Red Grooms: A Retrospective 1956-1984","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=W-1PAAAAMAAJ&dq=Red+Grooms:+A+Retrospective+1956-1984&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Survival Bartering","description":"Learn to trade and barter just about anything, anywhere, anytime.

Cognitive ethologists study the comparative, evolutionary, and ecological aspects of the mental phenomena of animals. Philosophy can provide cognitive ethology with an analytical basis for attributing cognition to nonhuman animals and for studying it, and cognitive ethology can help philosophy to explain mentality in naturalistic terms by providing data on the evolution of cognition. The heart of Allen and Bekoff's book is this reciprocal relationship between philosophical theories of mind and empirical studies of animal cognition. The interdisciplinary approach reveals flaws in common objections to the view that animals have minds.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=H97oavF8NO4C&dq=Species+of+Mind:+The+Philosophy+and+Biology+of+Cognitive+Ethology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Brother's Keeper (Gift Editions)","description":"This edition of Ellen Gould White's Spiritual Gifts, thoughts, views, discourses, essays and testimonies contains all four books and is divided into the following sections: Volume 1 - Spiritual Gifts Volume 2 - Sketches Of Christian Experience Volume 3 - Facts of Faith Volume 4 - Testimony for the Church","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ssQkBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rights of man","description":"Thomas Paine was the first international revolutionary. His Common Sense (1776) was the most widely read pamphlet of the American Revolution; his Rights of Man (1791-2) was the most famous defence of the French Revolution and sent out a clarion call for revolution throughout the world. He paid the price for his principles: he was outlawed in Britain, narrowly escaped execution in France, and was villified as an atheist and a Jacobin on his return to America. Paine loathed the unnatural inequalities fostered by the hereditary and monarchical systems. He believed that government must be by and for the people and must limit itself to the protection of their natural rights. But he was not a libertarian: from a commitment to natural rights he generated one of the first blueprints for a welfare state, combining a liberal order of civil rights with egalitarian constraints. This collection brings together Paine's most powerful political writings from the American and French revolutions in the first fully annotated edition of these works.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=lEMUAQAAIAAJ&dq=Rights+of+man&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The tumult and the shouting;: My life in sport","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=3YNJnwEACAAJ&dq=The+tumult+and+the+shouting%3B:+My+life+in+sport&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"John H.

These turns to represent reality in  living color  echo our evolutionary reliance on and indeed privileging of color as a complex and vital form of consumption, classification, and creation.

Finding color in stars and light, examining the system of classification that determines survival through natural selection, studying the arrival of color in our universe and as a fulcrum for philosophy, DeSalle s brilliant A Natural History of Color establishes that an understanding of color on many different levels is at the heart of learning about nature, neurobiology, individualism, even a philosophy of existence.

This book reveals the ways in which the work of bio artists offers new meanings for our lives in the wake of scientific discovery, as well as new frameworks for describing them. Four thematic chapters cover the key areas in which biotechnology has had an impact on today's world, including ecology, biomedicine, designer genomes and evolutionary theory, profiling the work of 60 artists, collectives and organizations from countries including France, Germany, the US, the Netherlands, Mexico and Japan. Interviews with eight bio artists and technologists, including Arne Hendriks, Mark Dion, Boo Chapple, Heather Dewey-Hagborg and Raphael Kim, provide a deeper insight into the ideas and methods of this new breed of creative practitioner.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=LzMMrgEACAAJ&dq=Altered+Realities&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"1947: When All Hell Broke Loose in Baseball (Baseball Hall of Fame Library)","description":"Library Journal Starred Review: \\"The author slams a home run in dealing with racism in baseball and the larger picture of American life McGregor's account makes for a compelling read.

A long-overdue achievement!\\"--Joseph Thomas Moore, author of Larry Doby: The Struggle of the American League's First Black Player In 1947, as the integration of Major League Baseball began, the once-daring American League had grown reactionary, unwilling to confront postwar challenges--population shifts, labor issues and, above all, racial integration. The league had matured in the Jim Crow era, when northern cities responded to the Great Migration by restricting black access to housing, transportation, accommodations and entertainment, while blacks created their own institutions, including baseball's Negro Leagues. As the political climate changed and some major league teams realized the necessity of integration, the American League proved painfully reluctant. With the exception of the Cleveland Indians, integration was slow and often ineffective. This book examines the integration of baseball--widely viewed as a triumph--through the experiences of the American League and finds only a limited shift in racial values. The teams accepted few black players and made no effort to alter management structures, and organized baseball remained an institution governed by tradition-bound owners.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=fVXIBwAAQBAJ&dq=1947:+When+All+Hell+Broke+Loose+in+Baseball+(Baseball+Hall+of+Fame+Library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Slovene Complete Course (Book Only) (TY: Complete Courses)","description":"Learn Slovene fast and easy Whether you re a traveler, student, or businessperson, you ll find it easy to pick up Slovene, a language spoken by millions of people every day.

Childish and wise, joyous and angry, at once complex and simple, he was sustained for 20 years by his wife and memoirist Nadezhda Mandelstam, who became, with Anna Akhmatova, the saviour of his poetry.In May 1934, after years of persecution, Mandelstam was arrested for writing an unflattering poem about Stalin, and subjected to gruelling interrogations and torture. He attempted suicide twice, slashing his wrists in prison, and jumping from a hospital window in Cherdyn. Exiled to Voronezh, he seemed crushed. A friend described him then as 'in a state of numbness. His eyes were glassy. His eyelids were inflamed, and this condition never went away. His eyelashes had fallen out. His arm was in a sling.'But it was to be four more years before Mandelstam was completely beaten. In Voronezh he broke a silence of 18 months after a concert by the young violinist Galina Baranova. Her music released him into the most fertile phase of his writing, his last two years in exile, when he wrote the ninety poems of the three Voronezh Notebooks. Nadezhda's memoir Hope Against Hope includes a moving account of their time in Voronezh, and Anna Akhmatova's poem 'Voronezh' describes her visit there in 1936, when 'in the room of the exiled poet / fear and the Muse stand duty in turn / and the night is endless / and knows no dawn.'This edition is now out of print but the whole book is reprinted as part of The Moscow and Voronezh Notebooks.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=6iR8AAAAIAAJ&dq=The+Voronezh+Notebooks:+Poems+1935-1937&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stochastic Algorithms for Visual Tracking","description":"A central problem in computer vision is to track objects as they move and deform in a video sequence. Stochastic algorithms -- in particular, particle filters and the Condensation algorithm -- have dramatically enhanced the state of the art for such visual tracking problems in recent years. This book presents a unified framework for visual tracking using particle filters, including the new technique of partitioned sampling which can alleviate the \\"curse of dimensionality\\" suffered by standard particle filters. The book also introduces the notion of contour likelihood: a collection of models for assessing object shape, colour and motion, which are derived from the statistical properties of image features. Because of their statistical nature, contour likelihoods are ideal for use in stochastic algorithms. A unifying theme of the book is the use of statistics and probability, which enable the final output of the algorithms presented to be interpreted as the computer's \\"belief\\" about the state of the world. The book will be of use and interest to students, researchers and practitioners in computer vision, and assumes only an elementary knowledge of probability theory.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lFHlBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eye in the Sky","description":"A wry look at how different people see the world, told in the caustically fun style of award-winning science fiction novelist Philip K.

With the conquest of Australia a very real possibility, the stakes were high. Their target: the Japanese-held Soloman Islands, in particular the southern island of Guadalcanal. Hamstrung by arcane pre-war thinking and a bureaucratic mind-set, the US Navy had to adapt on the fly in order to compete with the mighty Imperial Japanese Navy, whose ingenuity and creativity thus far had fostered the creation of its Pacific empire. Starting with the amphibious assault on Savo Island, the campaign turned into an attritional struggle where the evenly matched foes sought to grind out a victory. Following on from his hugely successful book Rising Sun, Falling Skies, Jeffrey R. Cox tells the gripping story of the first Allied offensive of the Pacific War, as they sought to prevent Japan from cutting off Australia and regaining dominance in the Pacific.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=y71KDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Punk Rock Aerobics: 75 Killer Moves, 50 Punk Classics, And 25 Reasons To Get Off Your Ass And Exercise","description":"* Would you flee in terror if confronted with a room full of sweaty people in spandex thongs?* Are you not immune to the occasional Van Halen-style air guitar jump?* Have you been known to push aside your coffee table and dance like crazy in your living room?If you answered \\"yes\\" to any of these questions, here at last is your workout book. As simple as throwing on that old Ramones (or even White Stripes) record, punk meets a high- and low-impact workout in an exercise craze that is spreading like wildfire amongst teens and aging rockers alike: Punk Rock Aerobics. Unlikely bedfellows though they seem, punk has always been about image-from Iggy's abs to the Sex Pistols' carefully cultivated outfits. Back in the good old days cigarettes would suffice to keep rockers slim, but to have real punk energy, say these rockers-turned-certified- aerobics-instructors, you need to drop those chips and get off the couch.Chock-full of easy-to-follow moves in an accessible, home-exercise-friendly format, Punk Rock Aerobics contains photos and instructions for DIY, heart-pumping (and thigh-slimming) retro moves like the \\"Air Guitar,\\" the \\"Skank,\\" and the \\"Fire Hydrant,\\" while suggesting songs by the Sex Pistols, Blondie, and the Stooges for a perfect workout soundtrack.

Working from cassette tapes left behind in the dead man's property, our narrator must piece together the history of his blighted existence and discover the agents of its cruel end. What he doesn't expect is that digging for the truth will demand plenty of lying, and that the most terrible of villains will also prove to be the most attractive. In the first of six police procedurals that comprise the Factory series, Derek Raymond spins a riveting, and vividly human crime drama. Relentlessly pursuing justice for the dispossessed, his detective narrator treads where few others dare: in the darkest corners of London, a city of sin plagued by unemployment, racism and vice, and peopled by a cast of low-lifes, all utterly convincing and brought to life by Raymond's pitch-perfect dialogue.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mvS1EuFtAXkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Ghosts of Berlin - Images of a Divided City","description":"Berlin was at the centre of two world wars and was until 1989 the potential flashpoint for a third.

The dream of creating artificial devices that reach or outperform human inteUigence is an old one. It is also one of the dreams of my youth, which have never left me. What makes this challenge so interesting? A solution would have enormous implications on our society, and there are reasons to believe that the AI problem can be solved in my expected lifetime. So, it's worth sticking to it for a lifetime, even if it takes 30 years or so to reap the benefits. The AI problem. The science of artificial intelligence (AI) may be defined as the construction of intelligent systems and their analysis. A natural definition of a system is anything that has an input and an output stream. Intelligence is more complicated. It can have many faces like creativity, solving prob lems, pattern recognition, classification, learning, induction, deduction, build ing analogies, optimization, surviving in an environment, language processing, and knowledge. A formal definition incorporating every aspect of intelligence, however, seems difficult. Most, if not all known facets of intelligence can be formulated as goal driven or, more precisely, as maximizing some utility func tion. It is, therefore, sufficient to study goal-driven AI; e. g. the (biological) goal of animals and humans is to survive and spread. The goal of AI systems should be to be useful to humans.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fhoonlqqGP8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Sorrows of Young Werther/Die Leiden des jungen Werther: A Dual-Language Book (English and German Edition)","description":"Loosely based on Goethe's personal experiences, the novel is written mostly in the form of letters in which Werther recounts his unrequited love for a married woman.

Trimble examines the pioneering work of Glenn Curtiss and his role in the origins of aviation in the U.S. Navy in the years up to and through World War I. A self-taught mechanic and inventor, Curtiss was a key figure in the development of the airplane during the early part of the century and his contributions to aviation are well known. This book s careful examination of his partnership with the Navy breaks new ground in revealing significant new details of his contributions. Curtiss s links to the Navy came as result of aviation advocates within the Navy, chief among them Captain Washington I. Chambers, who recognized that the Navy had special requirements for airplanes and their operations, and for aviators and their training. Curtiss helped meet the special requirements of the service for aircraft, particularly those with the potential for operating with naval vessels at sea or in conducting long-distance flights over water. He also was instrumental in training the first naval aviators. Curtiss and the Navy continued their collaboration through World War I, reaching a climax in 1919 with the first transatlantic flight of the famed Navy-Curtiss NC flying boat. This book addresses the broader implications of the Curtiss-Navy collaboration in the context of the longstanding trend of government-private cooperation in the introduction and development of new technologies. It also explores the interactive dynamics of weapons procurement and technological change within a large and entrenched bureaucracy and helps lay to rest the persistent myth that the Navy resisted the introduction of aviation","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HUX9hjHe6pkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lint","description":"Agressie is een veelvoorkomend probleem met verschillende verschijningsvormen, zoals fysiek geweld, geweld gericht op materi?le zaken en verbaal geweld.

According to Shallenberger, the loss of functions that result from aging are themselves the result of energy loss: more energy, less aging; less energy, more aging. When Dr. Shallenberger discusses anti-aging methods, he is actually talking about improving energy production. His work with patients over the years has proven that an energy deficit is the root cause of every disease and symptom, from cancer, to fatigue, to obesity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=oWqlpha5bogC&dq=Bursting+With+Energy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Swim Bike Run","description":"It's race day and you have your running shoes, sleek suits, bikes, goggles, and watches, but if you haven't been training with the proper nutrition, you'll be left in the dust in the third mile.

Although existing books begin with advanced concepts, such as emptiness or egolessness, The Positive Psychology of Buddhism and Yoga begins with very basic concepts and avoids the exotic and so called \\"mystical\\" notions. Levine emphasizes the goals of Buddhism and Yoga and the methods they employ to achieve those goals. This book is divided into four sections. The first deals with Buddhism, the second with Yoga, and the third describes aims and practices in Western clinical psychology. The fourth section is a workshop on handling anger. The central lesson of the first three sections is that one can improve one's life by changing one's self. This fourth section applies this lesson and the methods of the three preceding sections to handling one's own anger. Overall the book is rich with Eastern tales and illustrative anecdotes. These concrete examples vividly illuminate the general conceptual presentation. Levine shows not only the basic concerns of Buddhism and Yoga and how intensely practical their methods are but how these concerns and methods relate to those of modern Western psychology. Application to daily living is emphasized throughout.

Steve Ovett and Sebastian Coe presided over the golden era of British athletics. Between them they won three Olympic gold medals, two silvers, one bronze and broke a total of twelve middle-distance records. They were part of the landscape of the late seventies and early eighties -- both household names, their exploits were watched by millions. As far apart as possible in terms of class and upbringing -- Ovett is the art student, the long-haired son of a market-trader from Brighton, a natural athlete; Coe's formative years were spent under the rigorous training routine of Peter Coe, a self-taught trainer who referred to his son as 'my athlete' -- their rivalry burned as intense on the track as away from it. The pendulum swung between the pair of them -- each breaking the other's records, and, memorably, triumphing in each other's events in Moscow in 1980 -- for the best part of a decade, until the final showdown at the Los Angeles Olympics in 1984 . . . The Perfect Distance is both a detailed re-creation and a fitting celebration of the greatest era of British athletics.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vwGV1ucSKJ8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Facing East: A Pilgrim's Journey into the Mysteries of Orthodoxy","description":"The Classic Story of a Family's Pilgrimage into the Orthodox Church Veiled in the smoke of incense, the Eastern Orthodox Church has long been an enigma to the Western world.

But for the Mozarabs, a Catholic community that traces its roots to the Visigoths and Hispano-Romans of seventh-century Spain, veneration of the Cross--particularly the Lignum Crucis, a relic of the \\"\\"True Cross\\"\\"--has served to join devotion to Christ with a powerful symbol of religio-ethnic identity and survival in the face of persecution. The Mozarabs (the term may mean \\"\\"Arabized\\"\\") of Toledo maintained their Catholic identity through the period of Islamic rule. After the Christian reconquest of Spain and the imposition of uniform Roman liturgical rites, they clung tightly to their own Mozarabic Rite, which is still recognized and celebrated today.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=I4JmAwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Jews+and+Europe:+2000+years+of+History+(A+Henry+Holt+reference+book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"On the Divine Images: Three Apologies Against Those Who Attack the Divine Images","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=PJOJQgAACAAJ&dq=On+the+Divine+Images:+Three+Apologies+Against+Those+Who+Attack+the+Divine+Images&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cards of Destiny 2001","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=D2L6DwAAQBAJ&dq=Cards+of+Destiny+2001&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Still Lives: Narratives of Spinal Cord Injury (Bradford Books)","description":"An examination, through personal narratives and reflective commentary, of life without sensation or movement in the body. In writing Still Lives, Jonathan Cole wanted to find out about living in a wheelchair, without having what he calls \\"the doctor/patient thing\\" intervene. He has done this by asking people with spinal cord injuries the simple question of what it is like to live without sensation and movement in the body. If the body has absented itself, where does the person reside? He describes his method in the first chapter: \\"I have gone to people, not with a white coat or a stethoscope...[but] to listen to their lives as they express them,\\" and it is the candid and powerful narratives of twelve people with spinal cord injuries that form the heart of the book.Asking his simple question, Cole discovers that there is no single or simple answer. The twelve people with tetraplegia (known as quadriplegia in the US) or paraplegia whose stories he tells testify to similar impairments but widely differing experiences. Cole employs their individual responses to shape the book into six main sections: \\"Enduring,\\" \\"Exploring,\\" \\"Experimenting,\\" \\"Observing,\\" \\"Empowering,\\" and, finally, \\"Continuing.\\" Each concludes with a commentary on the broader issues raised. Still Lives moves from a view of impairment as tragedy to reveal the possibilities and richness of experience available to those living with spinal injuries. More universally, it offers new perspectives on our relation to our bodies. In exploring the creative and imaginative adjustments required to construct a \\"still life,\\" it makes a plea for the able-bodied to adjust their view of this most profound of impairments.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=2FnS91JZiOQC&dq=Still+Lives:+Narratives+of+Spinal+Cord+Injury+(Bradford+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lakatos: An Introduction","description":"Lakatos: An Introduction provides a thorough overview of both Lakatos's thought and his place in twentieth century philosophy.

But how did this label become attached to a curable disease that poses little threat to human health? And why, in the epidemic of 2001, did the government's control strategy still rely upon Victorian trade restrictions and mass slaughter? This groundbreaking and well-researched book shows that, for over a century, FMD has brought fear, tragedy and sorrow- damaging businesses and affecting international relations. Yet these effects were neither inevitable nor caused by FMD itself but were, rather, the product of the legislation used to control it, and in this sense FMD is a 'manufactured' plague rather than a natural one. A Manufactured Plague turns the spotlight on this process of manufacture, revealing a rich history beset by controversy, in which party politics, class relations, veterinary ambitions, agricultural practices, the priorities of farming and the meat trade, fears for national security and scientific progress all made FMD what it is today.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=4WiEevIIStcC&dq=A+Manufactured+Plague%3F:+The+History+of+Foot-and-mouth+Disease+In+Britain&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"This simian world","description":"\\"This Simian World\\" by Clarence Day.

This healing seeks to protect the  exposed being  from harm through augmenting the self. Unlike Western medicine, it does not seek to cure physical ailments but aims to prevent suffering by allowing patients to transform their personal narratives of Self. Like Western medicine, it is empirical and is presented as a  local knowledge  that amounts to a practical anthropology of human conflict and the environment.

Highly recommended.   Ian Hamilton, author of the bestselling Ava Lee novels Lane and Darling's Arizona honeymoon is interrupted by gunshots in the newest instalment in a series Kirkus Reviews calls \\"relentlessly exciting.\\" It s November, and Lane and Darling have escaped the chilly autumn in the Kootenays for a honeymoon at the posh and romantic Santa Cruz Inn in sunny Tucson, Arizona. But despite her very best intentions to relax, soon after their arrival Lane s plans to spend the holiday poolside with a good mystery are interrupted by gunfire. One of the hotel s wealthy guests has been shot point blank and Lane is second on the scene. Though Lane and Darling attempt to distance themselves from the investigation, the longer they stay at the Santa Cruz Inn, the deeper they are drawn into a web of suspects and bystanders, and a collection of seemingly perfect marriages fraught with jealousy and violence. The situation threatens first their honeymoon and then their lives when Lane puts herself directly in the sights of local criminals who will stop at nothing to get what they want. Back in Nelson, Sergeant Ames has been left in charge of the department during Darling s absence. As he investigates a case of vandalism at the Van Eyck garage, it seems to lead directly to the death of the suspected vandal himself. Working with Constable Terrell, the new recruit, to piece together what happened in this strange and unsettling murder, Ames finds his romantic interest in mechanic Tina Van Eyck creates complications that are more than awkward; they could be deadly.

Before 1925, systematic traffic accident investigation was practically unknown, but with the advent of the automobile and the resultant prominence of traffic deaths in everyday life, concerned persons and organizations took measures to minimize traffic danger. Accident investigation has become progressively more sophisticated. By reconstructing accidents, determining fault, and obtaining convictions, drivers are urged to be more responsible. This book covers 13 major topics, with specific instructions for various tasks, explaining how each task can better serve the whole of the investigation. These tasks include, for example, taking photos, examining vehicle damage, making sense of involved persons' differing accounts of what happened, questioning witnesses, gauging the mental and emotional state of involved persons and witnesses, measuring the scene, interpreting skidmarks and other bits of evidence, and drawing situation maps. It also elaborates on laws, police and administrative functions, standards, and more. Numerous exhibits, including diagrams, and photographs with captions.

Author Jim DeKorne offers authoritative information about the cultivation, processing, and correct dosages for various psychotropic plant substances including the belladonna alkaloids, d-lysergic acid amide, botanical analogues of LSD, mescaline, ayahuasca, DMT, and psilocybin. Opening with vivid descriptions of the author s personal experiences with psychedelic drugs, the book describes the parallels that exist among shamanic states of consciousness, the use of psychedelic catalysts, and the hidden structure of the human psyche. DeKorne suggests that psychedelic drugs allow us to examine the shamanic dimensions of reality. This worldview, he says, is ubiquitous across space, time, and culture, with individuals separated by race, distance, and culture routinely describing the same core reality that provides powerful evidence of the dimensional nature of consciousness itself. The book guides the reader through the imaginal realm underlying our awareness, a world in which spiritual entities exist to reconnect us with ourselves, humanity, and our planet. Accurate drawings of plants, including peyote, Salvia divinorum, and San Pedro, enhance the book s usefulness.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=2RrfAAAAQBAJ&dq=Psychedelic+Shamanism:+The+Cultivation,+Preparation,+and+Shamanic+Use+of+Psychotropic+Plants&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Door with Seven Locks","description":"The Door with Seven Locks is a 1940 black-and-white British film, created and released shortly after the British Board of Film Censors lifted its mid-1930s ban on supernatural-themed and horror genre films.

Because of their wide range of important applications, these materials have been intensely studied over the past twenty-five years, mainly from the perspectives of physics and engineering. But a body of rigorous mathematical theory has also gradually developed, and this is the first book to present that theory. Designed for researchers and advanced graduate students in applied mathematics, electrical engineering, and physics, this book introduces the electromagnetics of complex media through a systematic, state-of-the-art account of their mathematical theory. The book combines the study of well posedness, homogenization, and controllability of Maxwell equations complemented with constitutive relations describing complex media. The book treats deterministic and stochastic problems both in the frequency and time domains. It also covers computational aspects and scattering problems, among other important topics. Detailed appendices make the book self-contained in terms of mathematical prerequisites, and accessible to engineers and physicists as well as mathematicians.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=uo7kdroy9qIC&dq=Integral+Representations+For+Spatial+Models+of+Mathematical+Physics+(Research+Notes+in+Mathematics+Series,+Volume+351)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Uncle Wiggily's Automobile","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ZRdhzgEACAAJ&dq=Uncle+Wiggily%27s+Automobile&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Glaciers","description":"This comprehensively referenced text examines the nature, origin and behaviour of glacier systems, and the geological and geomorphological evidence for their former existence.

Now, this brilliantly talented writer returns with I Know This Much Is True, a heartbreaking and poignant multigenerational saga of the reproductive bonds of destruction and the powerful force of forgiveness. A masterpiece that breathtakingly tells a story of alienation and connection, power and abuse, devastation and renewal--this novel is a contemporary retelling of an ancient Hindu myth. A proud king must confront his demons to achieve salvation. Change yourself, the myth instructs, and you will inhabit a renovated world. When you're the same brother of a schizophrenic identical twin, the tricky thing about saving yourself is the blood it leaves on your bands--the little inconvenience of the look-alike corpse at your feet. And if you're into both survival of the fittest and being your brother's keeper--if you've promised your dying mother--then say so long to sleep and hello to the middle of the night. Grab a book or a beer. Get used to Letterman's gap-toothed smile of the absurd, or the view of the bedroom ceiling, or the influence of random selection. Take it from a godless insomniac. Take it from the uncrazy twin--the guy who beat the biochemical rap. Dominick Birdsey's entire life has been compromised and constricted by anger and fear, by the paranoid schizophrenic twin brother he both deeply loves and resents, and by the past they shared with their adoptive father, Ray, a spit-and-polish ex-Navy man (the five-foot-six-inch sleeping giant who snoozed upstairs weekdays in the spare room and built submarines at night), and their long-suffering mother, Concettina, a timid woman with a harelip that made her shy and self-conscious: She holds a loose fist to her face to cover her defective mouth--her perpetual apology to the world for a birth defect over which she'd had no control. Born in the waning moments of 1949 and the opening minutes of 1950, the twins are physical mirror images who grow into separate yet connected entities: the seemingly strong and protective yet fearful Dominick, his mother's watchful \\"monkey\\"; and the seemingly weak and sweet yet noble Thomas, his mother's gentle \\"bunny.\\" From childhood, Dominick fights for both separation and wholeness--and ultimately self-protection--in a house of fear dominated by Ray, a bully who abuses his power over these stepsons whose biological father is a mystery. I was still afraid of his anger but saw how he punished weakness--pounced on it. Out of self-preservation I hid my fear, Dominick confesses. As for Thomas, he just never knew how to play defense. He just didn't get it. But Dominick's talent for survival comes at an enormous cost, including the breakup of his marriage to the warm, beautiful Dessa, whom he still loves. And it will be put to the ultimate test when Thomas, a Bible-spouting zealot, commits an unthinkable act that threatens the tenuous balance of both his and Dominick's lives. To save himself, Dominick must confront not only the pain of his past but the dark secrets he has locked deep within himself, and the sins of his ancestors--a quest that will lead him beyond the confines of his blue-collar New England town to the volcanic foothills of Sicily 's Mount Etna, where his ambitious and vengefully proud grandfather and a namesake Domenico Tempesta, the sostegno del famiglia, was born. Each of the stories Ma told us about Papa reinforced the message that he was the boss, that he ruled the roost, that what he said went. Searching for answers, Dominick turns to the whispers of the dead, to the pages of his grandfather's handwritten memoir, The History of Domenico Onofrio Tempesta, a Great Man from Humble Beginnings. Rendered with touches of magic realism, Domenico's fablelike tale--in which monkeys enchant and religious statues weep--becomes the old man's confession--an unwitting legacy of contrition that reveals the truth's of Domenico's life, Dominick learns that power, wrongly used, defeats the oppressor as well as the oppressed, and now, picking through the humble shards of his deconstructed life, he will search for the courage and love to forgive, to expiate his and his ancestors' transgressions, and finally to rebuild himself beyond the haunted shadow of his twin. Set against the vivid panoply of twentieth-century America and filled with richly drawn, memorable characters, this deeply moving and thoroughly satisfying novel brings to light humanity's deepest needs and fears, our aloneness, our desire for love and acceptance, our struggle to survive at all costs. Joyous, mystical, and exquisitely written, I Know This Much Is True is an extraordinary reading experience that will leave no reader untouched.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=v9uqxTiOxq8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Don't Push the River (It Flows By Itself)","description":"Verslag van de ervaringen van de auteur tijdens een behandeling van drie maanden met Gestalt-therapie en andere persoonlijkheid-ontwikkelende methoden.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_kdrAAAAMAAJ&dq=Don%27t+Push+the+River+(It+Flows+By+Itself)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mastering PowerPoint 97","description":"Written to cover three learning phases, with this book the reader can understand and execute the simplest designs and outlines using PowerPoint wizards, create a more elaborate design using templates and clever design elements (like clip art), or even use animation, video clips, and audio.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=h4pRAAAAMAAJ&dq=Mastering+PowerPoint+97&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dracula, My Love","description":"Na de vondst van enkele manuscripten gaat een meisje op zoek naar de achtergrond van haar ouders, waarin Dracula een belangrijke rol heeft gespeeld.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=-U-uQAAACAAJ&dq=Dracula,+My+Love&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Don't Hurry, Be Happy!: 650 Smart Ways to Slow Down and Enjoy Life (Beeson Pastoral Series)","description":"Geschiedenis van het Catharinaklooster in de Sina?, en van de vondst in 1859 van een uitermate belangwekkend bijbelhandschrift door de bijbelgeleerde Tischendorf..","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=CclLAAAACAAJ&dq=Don%27t+Hurry,+Be+Happy!:+650+Smart+Ways+to+Slow+Down+and+Enjoy+Life+(Beeson+Pastoral+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Data Analysis for Managers with Microsoft Excel (with CD-ROM and InfoTrac )","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=WdHuXFxmAoQC&dq=Data+Analysis+for+Managers+with+Microsoft+Excel+(with+CD-ROM+and+InfoTrac+)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Touch For Health: The Complete Edition","description":"Quantum-touch is een belangrijke doorbraak in de kunst van genezen met de handen.

Schall, arguably one of the best, perhaps even the only, authentically Thomistic political scientist writing today. In contrast to main currents in contemporary Thomism, Schall remains conversant with the great tradition of political philosophy and therefore appreciates the complex and relatively imprecise nature of political reflection. In this book, the distinguished theorist addresses a wide range of subjects, including the question of overpopulation, the thought of Charles McCoy and Leo Strauss, the role of Christianity in political philosophy, and the challenges that the democratic project pose to human beings' perception of the truth. As a meditation on practical and theoretical political questions, self-consciously proceeding from the perspectives of both nature and grace, the book provides a unique picture of what a genuine Thomistic political science might look like.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=8LZfuAELtCkC&dq=Reason,+Revelation,+and+Human+Affairs&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bible Knowledge Background Commentary: Acts-Philemon (Bible Knowledge Series)","description":"This powerful reference tool provides an in-depth look at the historical, geographical, cultural, and economic background of Acts-Philemon.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=oP3k4TNiDWMC&dq=Bible+Knowledge+Background+Commentary:+Acts-Philemon+(Bible+Knowledge+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Palm-Wine Drinkard and My Life in the Bush of Ghosts","description":"The ghosts live in the center of the jungle and this tells of what happens to the mortals who venture into the world of the ghosts.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=FbVYM6Pbo5oC&dq=The+Palm-Wine+Drinkard+and+My+Life+in+the+Bush+of+Ghosts&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Macy Gray -- On How Life Is: Piano/Vocal/Chords","description":"This volume for piano and voice contains the songs from Macy Gray's album, How Life Is, with guitar chord boxes and full lyrics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=b9ijngEACAAJ&dq=Macy+Gray+--+On+How+Life+Is:+Piano/Vocal/Chords&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Greens of Clear Springs, New Bern, and Craven County: The genealogical history of a North Carolina family","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=1CQmGwAACAAJ&dq=The+Greens+of+Clear+Springs,+New+Bern,+and+Craven+County:+The+genealogical+history+of+a+North+Carolina+family&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Corvette GTP","description":"Professional automobile racing has always been dominated by sanctioning bodies whose main goal was to ensure competition. That has meant seeing that cars are well matched--in body shape or chassis/engine combinations or engine size. But what about an all-out competition, in which one team's idea of the fastest race car could be pitted against another s, regardless of mechanical  parity ? This was what the International Motor Sports Association s (IMSA) Grand Touring Prototypes (GTP) race series was about. The Series ran from 1981 to 1993, and it was one of the most exhilarating racing experiences of all time. This book is the first to profile the amazing machines that resulted from the GTP s flat-out competition among different--and passionate--ideas about what might be the fastest way around a track: the V-12 with its better ground-effect tunnels but higher center of gravity (CG); the flat six with its low CG but severely-restricted ground-effect tunnels; and others that employed elaborate wings and air dams. Here are the people behind this engineering free-for-all, the culmination of almost a century of automobile racing experience. And here are eighteen of the most competitive vehicles they designed. Using photography, diagrams, drawings and first-person accounts from the men who built them, Inside IMSA's Legendary GTP Race Cars offers a detailed look at the technology that drove some of the world s most exciting race cars, the likes of which may never be seen again.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=tPnXCAmIKwEC&dq=Corvette+GTP&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stitches in Time (Unabridged Audiobook on 10 Audiocassette Tapes)","description":"Amir en Hassan zijn gevoed door dezelfde min en groeien samen op in de hoofdstad van Afghanistan. Als blijk van hun verbondenheid kerft Amir hun namen in een granaatappelboom: Amir en Hassan, de sultans van Kabul. Maar sultans zijn ze alleen in hun fantasie, want Amir hoort tot de bevoorrechte bevolkingsgroep en Hassan en zijn vader zijn arme Hazaren, in dienst van Amirs vader. Bij de jaarlijkse vliegerwedstrijd in Kabul is Amir de vliegeraar, degene die het touw van de vlieger in handen heeft. Hassan is zijn hulpje, de vliegervanger. Voor jou doe ik alles! roept Hassan hem toe voordat hij wegrent om de vallende vlieger uit de lucht op te vangen. Die grenzeloze loyaliteit is niet wederzijds. Wanneer er iets vreselijks gebeurt met Hassan verraadt hij zijn trouwe metgezel. Na de Russische inval vluchten Amir en zijn vader naar de Verenigde Staten. Amir bouwt er een nieuw bestaan op, maar hij slaagt er niet in Hassan te vergeten. De ontdekking van een schokkend familiegeheim voert hem uiteindelijk terug naar Afghanistan, dat inmiddels door de Taliban is bezet. Daar wordt Amir geconfronteerd met spoken uit zijn verleden. Zijn voornemen om zijn oude schuld jegens Hassan in te lossen sleept hem tegen wil en dank mee in een huiveringwekkend avontuur.

Catullus' own social background, the circumstances of the literary life of his time, the true extent of his works and the variety of audiences he addressed - these and other questions are explored by Professor Wiseman with new and startling results. Contemporary high society and politics are illustrated through Clodia and Caelius Rufus, considered not as mere adjuncts to Catullus' story but as significant historical personalities in their own right. A final chapter on nineteenth- and twentieth-century interpretations of Catullus' world shows how anachronistic preconceptions have prevented a proper understanding of it, and made this radical reappraisal necessary. Anyone with a serious interest in Latin literature or Roman history will want to read this book. Students in the upper levels of school or at university will find it essential background reading to their work on Catullus and Cicero's Pro Caelio.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=-d3hFC_nAEAC&dq=Catullus+and+His+World:+A+Reappraisal&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Man enough: fathers, sons and the search for masculinity (Perigee)","description":"How does a boy learn to be a man? A man learns masculinity primarily from his father. But generations of boys who grow up without caring fathers or male mentors to emulate are left to guess what \\"men\\" are really like. They rely on cultural icons--larger-than-life images--as models of masculinity. As a result, they grow up mirroring overblown myths of manhood. Obsessed with being \\"man enough,\\" they become philanderers, controllers, and competitors--constantly overcompensating for their loss of a true role model, yet sorely unprepared for family life. In Man Enough, psychiatrist and family therapist Frank Pittman explores what it is like to grow up male today. With great poignancy, humor, and candor, he weaves together case studies from his practice, examples from literature and films, plus personal vignettes from his own experiences as a father to examine these hyper-masculine men and to illustrate how they developed and how they can change. Dr. Pittman asserts that men can move past proving their masculinity and start practicing it by striving with the other guys rather than against them, achieving equality and intimacy with their mates--and by fathering. A man raises himself as he raises children and learns to understand and forgive his parents as he becomes one. An important book for men and women, Man Enough offers a new approach to issues of commitment, caring and control and creates a positive model for the fathers of tomorrow's men.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=hrLqCjvhn50C&dq=Man+enough:+fathers,+sons+and+the+search+for+masculinity+(Perigee)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lone Wolf (Lone Star Country Club)","description":"Just one look from her evocative neighbor, Hawk Wainwright, was all it took to set Mission Creek newcomer Jenny Taylor on her toes.

They have, in the process, often forgotten that during the nineteenth century their church was racked by a divisive struggle that threatened to tear apart the very fabric of the Episcopal Church. On one side of this struggle was a powerful and aggressive Evangelical party who hoped to make the Episcopal Church into the democratic head of \\"the sisterhood of Evangelical Churches\\" in America; on the other side was the Oxford Movement, equally powerful and aggressive but committed to a range of Romantic principles which celebrated disillusion and disgust with evangelicalism and democracy alike.. The resulting conflict--over theology, liturgy, and, above all, culture--led to the schism of 1873, in which many Evangelicals left the church to form the Reformed Episcopal Church. For the Union of Evangelical Christendom tells this largely forgotten story using the case of the Reformed Episcopalians to open up the ironic anatomy of American religion at the turn of the century. Today, as the Episcopal Church once again finds itself enmeshed in cultural and religious crisis, the remembrance of a similar crisis a century ago brings an eerily prophetic ring to this remarkable work of cultural and religious history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=3IrvLWp71vUC&dq=For+the+Union+of+Evangelical+Christendom:+The+Irony+of+the+Reformed+Episcopalians&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stalked: A True Story (True Crime Library)","description":"This the first book to focus specifically on serial killers motivated by monetary gain. ?

Uphill Walkers is the story of how the Blais family pulled together to survive and ultimately thrive in an era when a single-parent family was almost unheard-of. As they came of age in an Irish-American household that often struggled to make ends meet, the Blais children would rise again and again above all obstacles   at every step of the way inspired by a mother who expected much but gave even more, as she saved and sacrificed to provide each child with the same education they would have received had their father lived. Beautiful, heartbreaking, and full of wonderful insights about sisterhood, brotherhood, and the ties that bind us together, Uphill Walkers is a moving portrait of the love it takes to succeed against the odds   and what it means to be a family. \\"In plain-spoken prose ...

How do scientists convince funders, fellow scientists, the general public, and even themselves that animal experiments are a good way of producing knowledge about the genetics of human behavior? In Model Behavior, Nicole C. Nelson takes us inside an animal behavior genetics laboratory to examine how scientists create and manage the foundational knowledge of their field. Behavior genetics is a particularly challenging field for making a clear-cut case that mouse experiments work, because researchers believe that both the phenomena they are studying and the animal models they are using are complex. These assumptions of complexity change the nature of what laboratory work produces. Whereas historical and ethnographic studies traditionally portray the laboratory as a place where scientists control, simplify, and stabilize nature in the service of producing durable facts, the laboratory that emerges from Nelson s extensive interviews and fieldwork is a place where stable findings are always just out of reach. The ongoing work of managing precarious experimental systems means that researchers learn as much if not more about the impact of the environment on behavior as they do about genetics. Model Behavior offers a compelling portrait of life in a twenty-first-century laboratory, where partial, provisional answers to complex scientific questions are increasingly the norm.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xOdRDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dreamweaver 2 for Windows & Macintosh, Second Edition (Visual QuickStart Guide)","description":"Este livro   sobre o dreamweaver, um software que permite criar anima??o e p ginas Dynamic HTML.

This major new book focuses on the spatial dimensions of urban environmental burdens, showing how important it is to take these into account when pursuing environmental justice and good governance - whether in the context of the sanitary risks of slum living, the pollution of uncontrolled industrialization and motorization, or the enormous ecological footprints of affluent urban lifestyles.Written by leading experts in the fields of urban development and environmental planning, the book reviews the urban environmental shifts that have shaped today?s challenges, and examines conditions and problems in the urban centres of low-, middle- and high-income countries. Case studies address such economically diverse cities as Accra, New Delhi, Mexico City and Manchester, while thematic chapters explore issues including water, sanitation and transportation. The book concludes by exploring and analysing different scales of governance. The editors argue that we should not rely solely on local governance to address local burdens like poor sanitation, nor depend only on global governance for global challenges such as greenhouse gas emissions, but that scale is crucial in both understanding the problems and devising successful responses.Published with UNU-IAS and IIED.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=mnE2qC3A12cC&dq=Scaling+Urban+Environmental+Challenges:+From+Local+to+Global+and+Back&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Debits and Credits","description":"For most students in an Introductory Accounting course, the first week is a terrible experience -- learning the unusual concepts of debits and credits is a major headache.

Mary W. Helms's research greatly expands knowledge of the distribution, extent, and structural nature of these pre-Columbian chiefdoms. In addition, Helms delves more deeply into select aspects of ancient Panamanian political systems, including the relationship between elite competition and chiefly status, the use of sumptuary goods in the expression of elite power, and the role of elites in regional and long-distance exchange networks. In a significant departure from traditional thinking, she proposes that the search for esoteric knowledge was more important than economic trade in developing long-distance contact among chiefdoms. The primary data for the study are derived from sixteenth-century Spanish records by Oviedo y Vald s, Andagoya, Balboa, and others. The author also turns to ethnographic data from contemporary native people of Panama, Colombia, tropical America, and Polynesia for analogy and comparison. The result is a highly innovative study which illuminates not only pre-Columbian Panamanian elites but also the nature of chiefdoms as a distinctive cultural type.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_1kfAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Afterlife and Other Stories","description":"This is a collection of stories which look back on the past.

Do you please others so they'll like you? Perhaps you prefer to seek approval instead of making your own decisions or feel wounded by hurtful treatment but don't know how to prevent it. If you do these or anything similar, this book was written for you and for women who want to reduce their self-doubt, anxiety, stress, depression, or unhappiness. Caring, thoughtful women are often sought out by people who are manipulative, harmful, or domineering: those who use deliberate strategies to get what they want regardless of the harm they cause.You can discover how to overcome the doubts, fears, and restrictive beliefs that stifle your power. First, you'll learn how to identify the five forms of anger and which ones you and the people in your life use. The one constructive and protective form of anger is Assertive anger. Assertive anger can range from a firm No to survival force action. There are two angers that restrict genuine power: Defensive anger and Suppressed anger. And there are two angers that are used to manipulate, bully, or dominate: Narcissistic and Defensive anger. By identifying which angers people use, you can tailor your responses to them.When you discover what suppresses your personal power, you can strengthen nine personal skills and capabilities. You'll learn to reconnect yourself to your self-belief, determination, and intuition, so you can fortify your responses with Assertive anger with the required strength for each situation.Like the people whose stories are told within these pages, if you want to increase your personal power so you can assert yourself and protect your rights, you'll find that you are capable of profound, enduring change. By identifying the relationship between power and the five forms of anger, you can replace disempowering thoughts, emotions, and behaviours with empowering ones. These will generate the clarity and conviction to activate your Assertive anger so you can shape your life as you choose. Ignite Your Power aims to awaken that which is already within you.This book is written in everyday language with many examples.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=A3f_yQEACAAJ&dq=Faces+of+Anger&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"LightWave 3D 7.0 Character Animation (With CD-ROM)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=CSIQAQAAMAAJ&dq=LightWave+3D+7.0+Character+Animation+(With+CD-ROM)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ryrie Study Bible/New American Standard/Black Bonded Red Letter","description":"By focusing on Scripture, The Ryrie NASB Study Bible is designed to enhance a deeply personal study of God's Word.

It was on her fifteenth birthday that Scarlett Harwood finally saw the movie from which her name had come. From the moment Vivien Leigh's character materialized on the screen until the credits rolled, the girl was mesmerized, dumbstruck by the twinship she saw between herself and that young belle. It felt to her like someone had crawled inside her head, excised her brain, and planted it in the head of Scarlett O'Hara. She left the theatre that day still dabbing her tears, convinced that she was the reincarnation of the heroine - with one exception. She was smarter. She would never repeat O'Hara's mistakes. Never.

To keep whatever spark of Jewish spirit was alive in the hearts of the refugees, to make it glow and burst into flame, the men and women of the Vaad Hatzala Rescue Committee worked long and hard. This is the story of a special breed of people, led by Rabbi Nathan Baruch. They dedicated themselves to a thankless task at the request of the greatest rabbinical leaders of the 20th century, and prevailed in their mission despite the lack of funds, the lack of people, the hostility of local populations and other Jewish organizations, and the chaos in Europe at the end of the war.

M. Il'in, L. A. Kalyakin, and S. I. Maslennikov Singularly Perturbed Problems with Boundary and Interior Layers: Theory and Application by V. F. Butuzov and A. B. Vasilieva Numerical Methods for Singularly Perturbed Boundary Value Problems Modeling Diffusion Processes by V. L. Kolmogorov and G. I. Shishkin An important addition to the Advances in Chemical Physics series, this volume makes available for the first time in English the work of leading Russian researchers in singular perturbation theory and its application. Since boundary layers were first introduced by Prandtl early in this century, rapid advances have been made in the analytic and numerical investigation of these phenomena, and nowhere have these advances been more notable than in the Russian school of singular perturbation theory. The three chapters in this volume treat various aspects of singular perturbations and their numerical solution, and represent some of the best work done in this area: * The first chapter, \\"The Matching Method for Asymptotic Solutions in Chemical Physics Problems,\\" is concerned with the analysis of some singular perturbation problems that arise in chemical kinetics. In this chapter the matching method is applied to find asymptotic solutions to some dynamical systems of ordinary differential equations whose solutions have multiscale time dependence. * The second chapter, \\"Singularly Perturbed Problems with Boundary and Interior Layers: Theory and Application,\\" offers a comprehensive overview of the theory and application of asymptotic approximations for many different kinds of problems in chemical physics governed by either ordinary or partial differential equations with boundary and interior layers. * The third chapter, \\"Numerical Methods for Singularly Perturbed Boundary Value Problems Modeling Diffusion Processes,\\" discusses the numerical difficulties that arise in solving the problems described in the first two chapters, and proposes rigorous criteria for determining whether or not a numerical method is satisfactory for such problems. Methods satisfying these criteria are then constructed and applied to obtain numerical solutions to a range of sample problems. Timely, authoritative, and invaluable to researchers in all areas of chemical physics, Singular Perturbation Problems in Chemical Physics is an essential resource.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=M-LOvLpxbtEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Spencers of Althorp","description":"The Spencer family, part of the nobility of England, between 1330 and the present. \\"The first known ancestors of the Princess of Wales were sheep farmers and Althorp came into the family when successive John Spencers first tenanted and then bought the property at the end of the fifteenth century.\\" (Flyleaf of paper cover).","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=MV9nAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Spencers+of+Althorp&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Netscape Developer's Guide to Javascript 1.2","description":"You'll find detailed coverage of using LiveConnect to interface with plug-ins and Java applets, integrating JavaScript with Dynamic HTML, working with LiveWire databases, and building components using JavaScript Bean files.

The book too has uni?ed vision: its short ?ctions and prose poems aren't separate forms but merge into each other like the continuous spectrum of colours in a rainbow. Redgrove begins with short ?ctions, but gradually withdraws the narrative scaffolding, asking the reader to respond instead to an alternative and possibly more dramatic pattern of imagery, where a narrative exists but is unspoken: 'It is like waking from a deep sleep and seeing the world new, but stripped of its procedures.' At the end of the rainbow, Redgrove's all-seeing eye penetrates the Esplumeor, Merlin's prison, variously interpreted as a bewitched bed, a house of glass, an observatory with 84 windows, a place where falcons moult or where the magician with sexual laughter puts off his accustomed forms, or a place where a person uses his plume or pen. His prose-poems here are about Cornwall, where he lives, 'and where it is not easy to tell whether one is in a dungeon or a paradise, as it depends on the way the wind is blowing'.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=oChbAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Cyclopean+Mistress:+Selected+Short+Fiction+1960-1990&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Read It!

Over a long and distinguished career Benjamin Libet has conducted experiments that have helped us see, in clear and concrete ways, how the brain produces conscious awareness. For the first time, Libet gives his own account of these experiments and their importance for our understanding of consciousness. Most notably, Libet's experiments reveal a substantial delay--the mind time of the title--before any awareness affects how we view our mental activities. If all conscious awarenesses are preceded by unconscious processes, as Libet observes, we are forced to conclude that unconscious processes initiate our conscious experiences. Freely voluntary acts are found to be initiated unconsciously before an awareness of wanting to act--a discovery with profound ramifications for our understanding of free will. How do the physical activities of billions of cerebral nerve cells give rise to an integrated conscious subjective awareness? How can the subjective mind affect or control voluntary actions? Libet considers these questions, as well as the implications of his discoveries for the nature of the soul, the identity of the person, and the relation of the non-physical subjective mind to the physical brain that produces it. Rendered in clear, accessible language, Libet's experiments and theories will allow interested amateurs and experts alike to share the experience of the extraordinary discoveries made in the practical study of consciousness.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=c18ls_NjqZEC&dq=Mind+Time:+The+Temporal+Factor+in+Consciousness+(Perspectives+in+Cognitive+Neuroscience)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Flow Blue: A Closer Look","description":"With 684 beautiful color photographs, this book provides an in-depth pictorial survey of Flow Blue ceramic wares.

Three decades ago, the USAF faced a North Vietnamese electronic air defense threat about which little was known. Through some extraordinary efforts, the USAF ably countered that threat employing an obsolete aircraft, the EB-66, only refitted and upgraded for mid 1960s missions. Since the aircraft was at the end of its projected lifecycle, and a new jammer was on the drawing board, the air staff would not fund additional EB-66 modifications and maintenance requirements. Parallels are easy to draw with today's jammers, as essentially the same situation exists with the EA-6B. The number of EB-66 aircraft during the Vietnam War was inadequate to meet both operational and training requirements. Thus, crews were trained on the job, often during combat operations, and the \\"boneyard\\" at Davis-Monthan was often the site of scavenger hunts for repair parts needed to keep the aircraft aloft. The advent of the Pueblo crisis created an additional demand for the EB-66 forcing a partial redeployment of the fleet from Thailand to Korea. Training assets were also flown from Shaw to Germany during the same period to monitor the escalating air defense threat in the Warsaw Pact nations. Missions and employment doctrine had to change to match electronic counters by adversaries from all directions.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8Duo-KA3jtgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tragedies","description":"Hamlet One of the most famous plays of all time, the compelling tragedy of the young prince of Denmark who must reconcile his longing for oblivion with his duty to avenge his father s murder is one of Shakespeare s greatest works.

Waar Tolkien een eigen universum schiep, baseerde zijn tijdgenoot White zich op de legende van koning Arthur en zijn ridders van de Ronde Tafel. White maakte een vrije bewerking van het verhaal, waarbij hij de schijnwerper ook richt op Arthurs vrouw Guinevere en zijn vriend, de onverslaanbare Lancelot. Whites eigen ongelukkige jeugd, problematische liefdes en dito vriendschappen kwamen hem bij het schetsen van hun driehoeksverhouding goed van pas. De schrijver permitteerde zich een cruciale ingreep in de oude legende: hij ruimde maar liefst tweehonderd pagina s in voor het opgroeien van de vondeling Arthur. Als een Harry Potter avant la lettre beleeft de jongen onder leiding van tovenaar Merlijn vele leerzame avonturen in het dierenrijk. Het doel van deze opmerkelijke educatie: de wereld verlossen van het Recht van de Sterkste, de wortel van alle kwaad. Arthur bedenkt een Ronde Tafel, waar alle ridders die aanzitten gelijk zullen zijn. Met goede werken hoopt hij de ongepolijste vechtjassen in het gareel te houden. Maar dan begaat hij zelf een onvergeeflijke fout... In deze nieuwe vertaling komt de queeste van Arthur op liefdevolle, humoristische, hartstochtelijke, pijnlijke en ten slotte hartverscheurende wijze opnieuw tot leven.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=p-ePDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Faith, Hope, and Chicken Feathers by Andrea Wyman","description":"Sophie, YL, and Harper, new students in Mrs. TenBroeck's sixth grade class, give each other support as they struggle to survive both in and out of school.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=X9loGjJdx60C&dq=Faith,+Hope,+and+Chicken+Feathers+by+Andrea+Wyman&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Principles of Behavior Therapy","description":"Professor Bandura presents basic psychological principles governing human behavior within the conceptual framework of social learning, reviewing the recent theoretical and experimental advances in the field and discuting extensive applications of this knowledge to the vital areas of personality development, education, psychopathology and psychotherapy.

Few people realize how profoundly their lives are affected by self-reflection or how frequently inner chatter interferes with their success, pollutes their relationships with others, and undermines their happiness. By allowing people to ruminate about the past or imagine what might happen in the future, self-reflection conjures up a great deal of personal suffering in the form of depression, anxiety, anger, jealousy, and other negative emotions. A great deal of unhappiness, in the form of addictions, overeating, and domestic violence, is due to people's inability to exert control over their thoughts and behavior. Is it possible to direct our self-reflection in a way that will minimize the disadvantages and maximize the advantages? Is there a way to affect the egotistical self through self-reflection? In this volume, Mark Leary explores the personal and social problems that are created by the capacity for self-reflection, and by drawing upon psychology and other behavioral sciences, offers insights into how these problems can be minimized.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=QCVnDAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Curse+of+the+Self:+Self-Awareness,+Egotism,+and+the+Quality+of+Human+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Turing Test: The Elusive Standard of Artificial Intelligence (Studies in Cognitive Systems)","description":"This book gives the most comprehensive, in depth and contemporary assessment of this classic topic in artificial intelligence.

The authors of this controversial book argue that the deliberate and often well-camouflaged addition of salt to processed foods has momentous health consequences, comparable to the well-documented risks of smoking tobacco. To equate salt consumption with smoking is a strong statement, but MacGregor and de Wardener provide a compelling and forceful account of complex issues relating to the perceptions of salt in society. The authors separate fact from fantasy and cast light on some of the hidden forces working to manipulate and exploit the consumer. The book presents what amounts to a scientific detective story that unravels with startling clarity the jumble of misinformation that has been concocted by the powerful vested interests of the multi- billion-dollar food industry. Along the way, the authors illuminate the rich history and mythology associated with salt, its symbolism, and its manifold socio-economic influences. The book is filled with an amusing and eclectic selection of historical and contemporary illustrations that lend context to this complex topic. Not only does this book have profound implications for the study of public health, but it also serves as an entertaining and instructive account of a part of our diet that is too easily taken for granted and ignored at our peril. Whether you agree or disagree with the authors, this will be fascinating and enlightening reading for all who are concerned with the mounting prevalence of salt in our diets.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=eDcQv9KCECUC&dq=Salt,+Diet+and+Health&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Seven Stairs","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=gXcLAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Seven+Stairs&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nirvana: The Chosen Rejects","description":"Examines the career of Nirvana, from their beginning to the death of Kurt Cobain, and includes excerpts from articles and interviews of the band.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=LuLUMJalA1oC&dq=Nirvana:+The+Chosen+Rejects&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bessie Smith and the Night Riders","description":"Black blues singer Bessie Smith single-handedly scares off Ku Klux Klan members who are trying to disrupt her show one hot July night in Concord, North Carolina.

It was identified with a sunwheel floor inlay said to have been venerated in occult ceremonies during the Second World War at Wewelsburg Castle, the secretive personal retreat of Nazi security chief Reichsf hrer-SS Heinrich Himmler. Over the last twenty years the Black Sun has been transformed into a metaphorical comet  blazing in the Northern sky,  particularly among neo-Nazis with esoteric and occult leanings. An Internet search of the terms Black Sun, Schwarze Sonne (German), Sol Negro (Spanish), Soleil Noir (French) and Sol Niger (Latin) reveals the extent of its penetration into everyday aspects of far-right cultural life. The symbol appears on T-shirts, CD covers, flags, decorative household knickknacks, wristwatches, uniform insignia, tattoos, etc. In response to the phenomenal growth of interest in the Black Sun, several previous authors have weighed in on the topic of neo-Nazi occultism. While they have succeeded in producing much-needed general reviews, each author singularly failed when it came to addressing the mystery of the Black Sun itself. What is the origin of the Black Sun mythology? When was the Black Sun first identified with the Wewelsburg Castle sunwheel? What do current-day neo-Nazis believe about the Black Sun? Why have esoteric beliefs found traction among neo-Nazis? What does the Black Sun mythology hold for the future of National Socialism?

Established as protection against slave insurrections feared by the white minority of Charleston, South Carolina, a generation later The Citadel was a school of privilege for young white men. Through two world wars it grew in size and reputation, proudly providing the United States with (male) military leaders, paying little heed to what was happening in the country around it. In 1993, when the school rescinded Shannon Faulkner's admission because of her gender, a landmark legal battle ensued. Faulkner won, and although she faced vicious harassment and left after a week, The Citadel was forced to reform: nearly 30 women have graduated since her brief time at The Citadel.

This essential volume, a much-needed introduction and guide to the field, shows how change and continuity in the Chinese American experience are reflected in the writings of immigrants from China and their descendants in the United States. Using a fresh approach that combines literary and historical scholarship, Xiao-huang Yin covers representative works from the 1850s to the present. These include journalistic and autobiographical texts from nineteenth-century Chinese authors; writings on the walls of Angel Island, the main Asian immigrant arrival point on the West Coast; writings of late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century \\"cultivated Chinese\\", students and scholars who came to America to advance their educations; and the work of more recent authors who have entered the canon, including Sui Sin Far, Jade Snow Wong, Frank Chin, Maxine Hong Kingston, and Amy Tan. As the only volume that covers the literature written by immigrant authors in the Chinese language, Xiao-huang Yin's book significantly enlarges the scope of Chinese and Asian American studies. This body of literature, including works by immigrant writers such as Chen Ruoxi, Yu Lihua, and Zhang Xiguo, reflects the high percentage of Chinese Americans for whom the Chinese language remains an integral part of everyday life. A core text for students and scholars of Asian American studies, Chinese American Literature since the 1850s is an important resource forliterary critics, historians, sociologists, and anthropologists interested in diaspora studies, transnationalism, cultural studies, race and ethnicity, and the immigrant experiences in which Chinese American literature is embedded.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=SoFrcpVBFJkC&dq=No+Chinese+Stranger+(1st+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Memoir and Remains of the Rev Robert Murray M'Cheyne","description":"One of the best-loved and most widely influential Christian classics of all time.

Chittadhar H?daya, a master poet from Nepal, wrote this tour de force while imprisoned for subversion in the 1940s and smuggled it out over time on scraps of paper. His consummate skill and poetic artistry are evident throughout as he tells the Buddha s story in dramatic terms, drawing on images from the natural world to heighten the description of emotionally charged events. It is peopled with very human characters who experience a wide range of emotions, from erotic love to anger, jealousy, heroism, compassion, and goodwill. By showing how the central events of the Buddha s life are experienced by Siddhartha, as well as by his family members and various disciples, the poem communicates a fuller sense of the humanity of everyone involved and the depth and power of the Buddha s loving-kindness. For this new edition of the English translation, the translators improved the beauty and flow of most every line. The translation is also supplemented with a series of short essays by Todd Lewis, one of the translators, that articulates how H?daya incorporated his own Newar cultural traditions in order to connect his readership with the immediacy and relevancy of the Buddha s life and at the same time express his views on political issues, ethical principles, literary life, gender discrimination, economic policy, and social reform.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=GV-UDwAAQBAJ&dq=Buddha,+His+Life+and+Teachings&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wait and See","description":"Wait and See! is part of the Jolly Phonics Readers Level 3 Inky Mouse and Friends series.

Students start by identifying a community to which they belong and focusing on problems in it, and then analyze possible solutions, construct arguments for them, decide which are likely to succeed, and consider how to initiate action. This is a primary text for first-year composition courses, covering the basics of the writing process. The assignments are recursive. Short writing assignments in each chapter build up to longer papers. Each of the assignment questions is accompanied by a guide to thinking about and writing the assigned paper, followed by a short Focus On reading that provides a brief account of community activism, a media case study, or a notable success story. The longer papers are accompanied by in-class peer reading groups. Each successive peer reading attempts a higher level of conceptual critique.

The Saga of Billy the Kid focuses on a period of time where two dangerous gangs tore a bloody path across Lincoln, New Mexico. After being shot to death in 1881 by the intrepid Lincoln County sheriff Pat Garret, Billy the Kid became a romanticized symbol of the wildness that laced the American west. Interest in the outlaw s wild life grew after Burn s initial publication, setting Billy the Kid up as one of the finest examples of the loss of the Wild West. As the US grew more industrialized, the stories of saloons, train robberies, and lone cowboys became even more important, and still remain important today. In a rousing tale that is partly truth, partly fiction, read the story that started its own wild frontier in the most influential version out there.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mzNgBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Women's Room","description":"A landmark in feminist literature, THE WOMEN'S ROOM is a biting social commentary of a world gone silently haywire.

He want to build a giant space station capable of rotating to provide its 1,000 or more inhabitants with near Earth-like gravity, room to grow, and incredible surroundings. Two problems are in his way: money and getting all the materials up there. When even his own government appears to condemn his efforts and threaten to cut off his supply chain, Tom must turn to an alternate source for his building materials mining what he needs from asteroids. But he needs a way to transport raw materials to Earth and finished goods into orbit. The solution has never been tried except in science fiction. He decides to build a space elevator.

Bilko and the hilarious Car 54, Where Are You? King of the Half Hour, the first biography of Hiken, draws extensively on exclusive first-hand interviews with some of the well-known TV personalities who worked with him, such as Carol Burnett, Fred Gwynne, Alan King, Al Lewis, and Herbert Ross. The book focuses on Hiken s immense talent and remarkable career, from his early days in radio as Fred Allen s head writer to his multiple Emmy-winning years as writer-producer-director on television. In addition to re-establishing Hiken's place in broadcast history, biographer, David Everitt places him in the larger story of early New York broadcasting. Hiken s career paralleled the rise and fall of television s Golden Age. He embodied the era s best qualities craftsmanship, a commitment to excellence and a distinctive, uproariously funny and quirky sense of humor. At the same time, his uncompromising independence prevented him from surviving the changes in the industry that brought the Golden Age to an end in the 1960s.

Though the Communists failed to achieve their tactical and operational objectives, James Willbanks claims Hanoi won a strategic victory. The offensive proved that America's progress was grossly overstated and caused many Americans and key presidential advisors to question the wisdom of prolonging combat. Willbanks also maintains that the Communists laid siege to a Marine combat base two weeks prior to the Tet Offensive-known as the Battle of Khe Sanh to distract the United States. It is his belief that these two events are intimately linked, and in his concise and compelling history, he presents an engaging portrait of the conflicts and singles out key problems of interpretation. Willbanks divides his study into six sections, beginning with a historical overview of the events leading up to the offensive, the attack itself, and the consequent battles of Saigon, Hue, and Khe Sahn. He continues with a critical assessment of the main themes and issues surrounding the offensive, and concludes with excerpts from American and Vietnamese documents, maps and chronologies, an annotated list of resources, and a short encyclopedia of key people, places, and events. An experienced military historian and scholar of the Vietnam War, Willbanks has written a unique critical reference and guide that enlarges the debate surrounding this important turning point in America's longest war.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=jy3aJyxIKUsC&dq=Voices+of+Courage:+the+Battle+for+Khe+Sanh,+Vietnam+With+CD+(Audio)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The wisdom of the Talmud : a thousand years of Jewish thought.","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LgwYarm1X94C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stories For My Grandchildren","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=tJWywwEACAAJ&dq=Stories+For+My+Grandchildren&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Behavior-Based Robotics (Intelligent Robotics and Autonomous Agents)","description":"Foreword by Michael Arbib This introduction to the principles, design, and practice of intelligent behavior-based autonomous robotic systems is the first true survey of this robotics field.

Was it the increased profits other companies, such as Amoco Canada, were experiencing due to their employees' new financial involvement in the company? Or was it he improved production that Bagel Works, Inc., and Dixie Ironworks, Inc., realized through employee joint accountability? Perhaps it was the enhanced employee morale that still other companies were achieving now that their employees were partners who designed their own bonus packages. Likely, it was all these reasons and dozens more that convinced hundreds of companies to adopt open-book management to help reduce costs, improve quality, and boost sales, all while creating an environment that reinvented and revitalized the role of the employee.In this practical and highly accessible book, John Case, the leading authority and foremost chronicler of open-book management, shows how to put the open-book philosophy to work. The Open-Book Experience explains how to identify critical numbers, how to bring the corporate financials down to earth, and how to set up a system that gets everyone in the business working to improve performance. It describes how companies both large and small have actually implemented open-book management how they got started, how they overcame obstacles, and how they taught employees to understand the business. Using a step-by-step methodology gleaned from the experiences of more than 100 successful companies, and revealing tools and techniques such as electronic scoreboards and collaborative  games,  Case shows how open-book management can work for any company wanting to bridge the age-old gap between concern for people and the need for rigorous performance measurement and improvement.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=VrLEswEACAAJ&dq=The+Open-book+Experience:+Lessons+From+Over+100+Companies+Who+Successfully+Transformed+Themselves&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Two Steps Forward","description":"Camino van Graeme Simsion (Het Rosie Project) en Anne Buist is een humoristische feelgoodroman over vriendschap, familie, liefde en de grote uitdagingen van het leven.

By exploring the political, scientific, psychological and devotional world of early modern Europe, and applying those insights to our own time, the author shows how Bosch used his sophisticated artistic skills to convey a similarly sophisticated understanding of humanity. In Christ Mocked -- a painting \\"500 years old but passionately modern\\" -- Christ's Passion is so portrayed as to make us reassess the cosmic significance of Christ's death, and its profound implications for what we think it means to be human.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=de3eBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Do Baby Bears Sit in Chairs?","description":"A little boy asks silly questions in rhyme.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=8rvlOAAACAAJ&dq=Do+Baby+Bears+Sit+in+Chairs%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Clinical Hypnosis and Self-Regulation: Cognitive-Behavioral Perspectives (Dissociation, Trauma, Memory, and Hypnosis)","description":"...provides up-to-date methods for using hypnosis to enhance the outcome of empirically validated treatments... contains chapters by the most prominent cognitive-behavioral scolars in the field, and a chapter by Arnold Lazarus.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=uRqKQgAACAAJ&dq=Clinical+Hypnosis+and+Self-Regulation:+Cognitive-Behavioral+Perspectives+(Dissociation,+Trauma,+Memory,+and+Hypnosis)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Powers Vol. 1: Who Killed Retro Girl?","description":"A detective investigating the murder of the popular superhero Retro Girl may have to reveal his own dark secret in order to solve the crime.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=zGX7vgEACAAJ&dq=Powers+Vol.+1:+Who+Killed+Retro+Girl%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Prayers from the Imitation of Christ (Classic prayer series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Q9O1yIYby3kC&dq=Prayers+from+the+Imitation+of+Christ+(Classic+prayer+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Genealogy Software Guide","description":"This is a much-needed guide to genealogy software. Along with a variety of other useful features it comprises reviews of the major software programs, including commercial & shareware software as well as utilities. We are all painfully aware of the fact that genealogy software changes rapidly, & indeed over the last few years countless genealogy programs have been orphaned with outdated interfaces, inadequate features, & little or no author support, so for this reason the book concentrates solely on software that is current & is still supported by the author or publisher. In addition, new versions of existing software & frequently released updates result in a quagmire of options & choices, so a guide such as this is not only essential for the computer genealogist, it is absolutely indispensable. Bearing in mind some concerns that might be paramount to the reader, the author tackles a number of frequently asked questions before launching into her software reviews, answering such key questions as the following: Why use genealogy software? What equipment do I need? How do I choose & evaluate a program? What are the different types of software available to me? And where can I buy this software? With such questions authoritatively addressed, the author goes on to list each program's major features; but rather than a mere litany of details, functions, & common characteristics, she tries to provide a sense of what the program actually feels like, providing over eighty sample reports & screen shots of the major genealogy programs & software utilities. In this context it is important to note that only IBM compatible software is reviewed here; Macintosh & other platforms, however, are listed & briefly described.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=S9GVz_wRgbYC&dq=Genealogy+Software+Guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Charming the Prince","description":"When an unfortunate truce with French forces Sir Bannor, the mighty English knight, to return to a castle overrun with his impish children, he sends his steward to find a mother who will civilize them, but he is unprepared for the beautiful lady who is selected.

Applied Corporate Finance provides a user's perspective to corporate finance, by posing the three major questions that every business has to answer, and then providing the tools and the analytical techniques needed to answer them. The three questions are- * Where do we invest our resources? (The Investment Decision) The first part of the book looks at how to assess risk and develop a risk profile for a firm, convert this risk profile into a hurdle rate, and develops the basic rules that need to be followed in estimating the returns on any investment. * How should we fund these investments? (The Financing Decision) Firms generally can use debt, equity or some combination of the two to fund projects. This part of the book examines the relationship between this choice and the hurdle rate to be used in analyzing projects, and presents ways in which the financing decision can be used to maximize firm value. It also sets up a framework for picking the right kind of security for any firm. * How much cash can and should we return to the owners? (The Dividend Decision) The third part of the book establishes a process that can be used to decide how much cash should be taken out of the business, and in what form - dividends or stock buybacks. The final chapter in the book ties in the value of the firm to these three decisions, and provides insight into how firms can enhance value. In summary, this is a book about coming up with real solutions to real problems, using real-time data on real companies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=p3e3AAAAIAAJ&dq=Applied+Corporate+Finance:+A+User%27s+Manual+(Wiley+Frontiers+in+Finance)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Della's House of Style","description":"Specializing In Cuts, Weaves, Manicures, Pedicures. . . and Passion.

Goods, money, microbes, pollution, people and ideas are crossing boundaries ever more frequently. The implications for our future and for the health of the planet are profound. Vanishing Borders outlines the ecological challenges posed and then goes on to define the necessary strategies for tackling them. Presently, national governments are singularly ill-equipped for tackling transitional environmental problems-from ozone depletion to soaring trade in commodities such as timbre- problems which are climbing ever higher on the international political agenda. Industrial and developing countries are on a collision course over climate change, and water shortages are creating tensions in several parts of the world. The author argues that only a worldwide commitment to strengthening treaties and institutions needed to integrate ecological considerations into the rules of global commerce holds out hope. Over 200 international environmental treaties exist but most need more stringent conditions and enforcement, and continuing support from NGO and business communities. Significantly, the digital revolution, integral in itself to processes to globalization, offers channels through which powerful coalitions can effect change. The book provides a compelling and accessible analysis and a clear plan of action in pursuit of environmental stability.

For which He wonders if forgiveness is possible. Because now he is a only a ghost of the God he once was - now retired. After this one incarnation as a human being on Earth, he quit. As God, he had become indifferent. But as a tall black Jew with blue eyes and red hair in the Roman Empire, he proved to be too smart for his own good. Or maybe just too human. He tried to quit. The Autobiography of Jesus X is either the new Bible or the most offensive book ever written, or both. Maybe neither. This is part sci-fi/fantasy, part expose memoir, and part stand-up comedy.

In this volume, The Library of America collects the finest of these stories: twenty-four in all, along with some revealing essays and an earlier version of his novel The Thin Man. Mixing melodramatic panache and poker-faced comedy, a sensitivity to place and a perceptive grasp of social conflict, Hammett s stories are hard-edged entertainments for an era of headlong change and extravagant violence. For the heroic sagas of earlier eras Hammett substituted the up-tempo, devious, sometimes nearly nihilistic exploits of con men and blackmailers, fake spiritualists and thieving politicians, slumming socialites and deadpan assassins. As a guide through this underworld he created the Continental Op, the nameless, laconic detective, world-weary and unblinking, who serves as protagonist of most of these stories. The deliberately unheroic Op is separated only by his code of professionalism from the brutality and corruption that run rampant in stories such as  Zigzags of Treachery,   Dead Yellow Women,   Fly Paper,  and  $106,000 Blood Money.  Hammett s years of experience as a Pinkerton detective give even his most outlandishly plotted mysteries a gritty credibility, and his intimate knowledge of San Francisco made him the perfect chronicler of that city s waterfronts, back alleys, police stations, and luxury hotels. By connecting crime fiction to the realities of American streets and American speech, his Black Mask stories opened up new vistas for generations of writers and readers.

From its beginnings, it has been shaped by bohemians and renegades, slaves and oppressed minorities, prostitutes, immigrants and other excluded groups. But what do we really know about the origins of these intimate expressions of the heart? And how have our changing perceptions about topics such as sexuality and gender roles changed our attitudes towards these songs? In Love Songs: The Hidden History, Ted Gioia uncovers the unexplored story of the love song for the first time. Drawing on two decades of research, Gioia presents the full range of love songs, from the fertility rites of ancient cultures to the sexualized YouTube videos of the present day. The book traces the battles over each new insurgency in the music of love--whether spurred by wandering scholars of medieval days or by four lads from Liverpool in more recent times. In these pages, Gioia reveals that the tenderest music has, in different eras, driven many of the most heated cultural conflicts, and how the humble love song has played a key role in expanding the sphere of individualism and personal autonomy in societies around the world. Gioia forefronts the conflicts, controversies, and the battles over censorship and suppression spurred by such music, revealing the outsiders and marginalized groups that have played a decisive role in shaping our songs of romance and courtship, and the ways their innovations have led to reprisals and strife. And he describes the surprising paths by which the love song has triumphed over these obstacles, and emerged as the dominant form of musical expression in modern society.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lGGzBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Colt Tailing","description":"You make a skittish colt follow, or tail, a calm one, to get him to cross a strange river.

As the confidence and sense of self she had built up over many years are shaken, she is drawn back into the intense feelings of vulnerability first experienced during her fatherless youth in war-torn Germany.

Instead of embodying the truth of Jesus' teaching, Christianity seemed to harbor the fearful thoughts and actions of people who were more committed to self-interest than to unconditional love. So when Ferrini felt Jesus' voice inside him saying, \\"I want you to acknowledge me,\\" he resisted. In time, however, he came to realize that it was not Jesus he was rejecting but the untruths that had become attached to Christian teaching. Responding to the inner voice did not mean merely acknowledging Jesus as some great teacher who lived in the past, but also meant that he was opening himself up to a living presence within his own awareness. Once Ferrini reached this reconciliation, powerful words of spiritual truth began to flow through him. Reflections of the Christ Mind presents the most important teachings the author has received through his spiritual awakening. Here at last is a gospel devoted solely to Jesus' teachings of love, healing, and forgiveness. The teacher readers meet in these pages is both compassionate and open-minded-he is the Jesus Christians know in their hearts. Repudiating religious hypocrisy, intolerance, and spiritual pride, Ferrini rejects the dogmatic position of the Church, offering instead words of hope and healing that form the new gospel for today.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uczyQFTfx9cC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Oopsy Daisy: 30 Postcards","description":"Join Splat the Cat in New York Times bestselling author-artist Rob Scotton's hilarious springtime adventure!

He hits upon this ultimate truth by developing his notion of human history and events as  a procession of delusions,  striking out at the so-called  Fallacies of Hope.

However, they can actually be incredibly goofy and friendly, acting more like clowns than protectors. There is no doubt that they can make great guard dogs, but proper training and socialization also can make them a perfect family dog who will get along with everyone they meet. The Rottweiler history goes back thousands of years, evolving from Mastiffs who worked with the Romans. They have been working alongside people for their known history, working as fighters, herders, and protectors. Today, the breed is utilized in work with military personnel, police, and security experts. At first glance, a well trained Rottie can be an intimidating sight, due to their size, muscle mass, and serious expression. This guide will walk you through the in's and out's of owning this phenomenal breed. Whether you're someone playing with the idea of getting a Rottie, or have already embarked on your journey with your pup, this guide will offer an insight into how to create a happy and fulfilling life for you and your Rottweiler. This book will answer all your questions such as: Is a Rottweiler the right dog for me? I brought my Rottie home. What now? How can I successfully train my Rottweiler? What are some common mistakes should I avoid? Topics covered in the book include: Rottweiler Breed History and Characteristics Loyal, Loving Guardians Determining If the Rottweiler Is the Right Breed for You Finding Your Rottweiler Preparing for Your Rottweiler Puppy Bringing Home Your Rottweiler The First Month Housetraining Socialization and Experience Living with other dogs Training You Rottweiler Puppy Basic Commands Nutrition Exercising  Great Exercise Partners Grooming  Productive Bonding Health Issues Rottweiler Health Concerns Your Aging Rottweiler What their reputation often overlooks is just how much personality Rottweilers have. They can be great guardians, but the vast majority of the time, they are goofy pups that consider themselves lap dogs. It s not unusual for a full sized Rottie to try to flop down on top of your lap while you sit on the couch, or to dance at your feet begging for you to run around outside with them. They love to play and are very trainable, simply because that training means spending more time with you. This wonderful, loving, and affectionate breed can be the perfect addition to the right home.

Maurice Halbwachs (1877-1945) addressed this question for the first time in his work on collective memory, which established him as a major figure in the history of sociology. This volume, the first comprehensive English-language translation of Halbwach's writings on the social construction of memory, fills a major gap in the literature on the sociology of knowledge. Halbwachs' primary thesis is that human memory can only function within a collective context. Collective memory, Halbwachs asserts, is always selective; various groups of people have different collective memories, which in turn give rise to different modes of behavior. Halbwachs shows, for example, how pilgrims to the Holy Land over the centuries evoked very different images of the events of Jesus' life; how wealthy old families in France have a memory of the past that diverges sharply from that of the nouveaux riches; and how working class construction of reality differ from those of their middle-class counterparts. With a detailed introduction by Lewis A. Coser, this translation will be an indispensable source for new research in historical sociology and cultural memory. Lewis A. Coser is Distinguished Professor of Sociology Emeritus at the State University of New York and Adjunct Professor of Sociology at Boston College.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ejfnDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blooming English: Observations on the Roots, Cultivation and Hybrids of the English Language","description":"Publisher Description","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=TPGpyOJTdvIC&dq=Blooming+English:+Observations+on+the+Roots,+Cultivation+and+Hybrids+of+the+English+Language&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Arcadia","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KJg6AAAAcAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Basics of Biblical Hebrew Vocabulary Audio","description":"This pack contains everything you need to learn the original language of the Old Testament, no matter if you are already enrolled in a class or learning on your own.

Enlightenment, this discourse claims, is neither a goal to be achieved nor a potential to be realized but the true status of all things. Every animate and inanimate object manifests the primordially enlightened Buddha just as it is. Seen in its true aspect, every activity of daily life eating, sleeping, even one?s deluded thinking is the Buddha?s conduct. Emerging from within the powerful Tendai School, ideas of original enlightenment were appropriated by a number of Buddhist traditions and influenced nascent theories about the kami (local deities) as well as medieval aesthetics and the literary and performing arts. Scholars and commentators have long recognized the historical importance of original enlightenment thought but differ heatedly over how it is to be understood. Some tout it as the pinnacle of the Buddhist philosophy of absolute non-dualism. Others claim to find in it the paradigmatic expression of a timeless Japanese spirituality. According other readings, it represents a dangerous anti-nomianism that undermined observance of moral precepts, precipitated a decline in Buddhist scholarship, and denied the need for religious discipline. Still others denounce it as an authoritarian ideology that, by sacralizing the given order, has in effect legitimized hierarchy and discriminative social practices. Often the acceptance or rejection of original enlightenment thought is seen as the fault line along which traditional Buddhist institutions are to be differentiated from the new Buddhist movements (Zen, Pure Land, and Nichiren) that arose during Japan?s medieval period. Jacqueline Stone?s groundbreaking study moves beyond the treatment of the original enlightenment doctrine as abstract philosophy to explore its historical dimension. Drawing on a wealth of medieval primary sources and modern Japanese scholarship, it places this discourse in its ritual, institutional, and social contexts, illuminating its importance to the maintenance of traditions of lineage and the secret transmission of knowledge that characterized several medieval Japanese elite culture. It sheds new light on interpretive strategies employed in pre-modern Japanese Buddhist texts, an area that hitherto has received a little attention. Through these and other lines of investigation, Stone problematizes entrenched notions of ?corruption? in the medieval Buddhist establishment. Using the examples of Tendai and Nichiren Buddhism and their interactions throughout the medieval period, she calls into question both overly facile distinctions between ?old? and ?new? Buddhism and the long-standing scholarly assumptions that have perpetuated them. This study marks a significant contribution to ongoing debates over definitions of Buddhism in the Kamakura era (11851333), long regarded as a formative period in Japanese religion and culture. Stone argues that ?original enlightenment thought? represents a substantial rethinking of Buddhist enlightenment that cuts across the distinction between ?old? and ?new? institutions and was particularly characteristic of the medieval period.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=jbO_KctXdecC&dq=Original+Enlightenment+and+the+Transformation+of+Medieval+Japanese+Buddhism+(Studies+in+East+Asian+Buddhism)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"MADELINE'S CHRISTMAS.","description":"With everyone else sick in bed with a cold on Christmas Eve, it is up to Madeline to run the school, and she finds a remarkable helper in a rug-selling magician.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=b1EcfEPYukoC&dq=MADELINE%27S+CHRISTMAS.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Bright Feathers","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=H84-wQEACAAJ&dq=The+Bright+Feathers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The child's life of Christ, or, The wonderful life","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=5lMhygLPKIMC&dq=The+child%27s+life+of+Christ,+or,+The+wonderful+life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jake Howards Wife","description":"Jake Howards Wife by Anne Mather released on Feb 22, 1979 is available now for purchase.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=oxXvtwEACAAJ&dq=Jake+Howards+Wife&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Endogenous Growth Theory","description":"\\"Problems and solutions by Cecilia Garcaia-Pe?nalosa in collaboration with Jan Boone, Chol-Won Li, and Lucy White.\\" Includes bibliographical references (p.

In this groundbreaking study, Taffy Martin delves beneath the layers of myth and recaptures the excitement that Moore's contemporaries, particularly William Carlos Williams, felt when they encountered her poetry. She reveals that, far from being a stanch upholder of Modernist order and stasis, Moore continually undermines the stability of her own medium, language. Unlike the writings of other Modernist poets, such as T. S. Eliot, who tried to create islands of order in the seas of twentieth-century fragmentation, Moore's work shows surprising awareness of that fragmentation. In this way, she anticipates the thematic preoccupation of Postmodernist writers and critics. In Marianne Moore, Subversive Modernist, Taffy Martin combines traditional scholarship and contemporary critical theory to create a feminist reading of one of the twentieth century's most difficult poets. In so doing, she places Moore in the tradition of Modernism, defines Moore's quarrels with it, and thus produces a broader understanding of both the poet and the movement. Drawing on Moore's unpublished correspondence, her reading notebooks, and her workbooks, as well as feminist criticism's attention to writers who elude traditional critical approaches, this excellent study provides much-needed insights into the Modernism, life, and art of Marianne Moore.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lNeBBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Learning and Individual Differences: Process, Trait, and Content Determinants","description":"This book is based on a conference held at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, in October 1997.

In superb novels like Home from the Hill, The Ordways, and Proud Flesh as well as in the brilliant story collections The Last Husband and A Time and a Place, William Humphrey (1924--1997) created an imaginary East Texas Red River County, conjuring the speech and life rhythms of his native territory with artistic genius. Crowder's lyrical blending of biographical fact and incisive analysis corrects a mistaken view that Humphrey was among those writers mired in the pious cult of southern delusionary remembrance. From early short fiction set in a New York commuter village through late works of the Northeast, such as Hostages to Fortune and September Song, Humphrey allowed himself a psychic distance from the South that fueled an unsparing critique of its myths -- exemplified by the fierce deconstruction of Texas heroes found in his last novel, No Resting Place. In a poignant discussion of Humphrey's memoir, Farther Off from Heaven, Crowder demonstrates that the tragic death of his father led to Humphrey's overriding fictional themes of pain and inconsolable loss. Indeed, Crowder asserts that Humphrey failed to achieve literary renown in part because he evokes emotional experiences beyond what most people can endure. Humphrey's fiction derives its power from refusing to indulge in the false consolations of vanished people and history, from showing that living in the southern past is not living at all. Wakeful Anguish is among the first books about William Humphrey and will be greeted as one of the finest. Marshalling unpublished archival letters, interviews with persons who knew Humphrey at different stages in his life, and private correspondence and conversations between Humphrey and himself, Crowder achieves something rare in literary biography: a portrait that reveals both the sustained suffering in an author's life and work and his exultation in the triumph of his art.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=7ud-Q5Yq5sMC&dq=Wakeful+Anguish:+A+Literary+Biography+of+William+Humphrey+(Southern+Literary+Studies)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Apex to Zulu","description":"The Zulu Warriors are more than football hooligans.

Three and a half centuries later, Amsterdam is once again the mecca for people who care passionately about one particular plant though this time the obsessions revolves around the intoxicating effects of marijuana rather than the visual beauty of the tulip. How could flowers, of all things, become such objects of desire that they can drive men to financial ruin? In The Botany of Desire, Michael Pollan argues that the answer lies at the heart of the intimately reciprocal relationship between people and plants. In telling the stories of four familiar plant species that are deeply woven into the fabric of our lives, Pollan illustrates how they evolved to satisfy humankinds s most basic yearnings and by doing so made themselves indispensable. For, just as we ve benefited from these plants, the plants, in the grand co-evolutionary scheme that Pollan evokes so brilliantly, have done well by us. The sweetness of apples, for example, induced the early Americans to spread the species, giving the tree a whole new continent in which to blossom. So who is really domesticating whom? Weaving fascinating anecdotes and accessible science into gorgeous prose, Pollan takes us on an absorbing journey that will change the way we think about our place in nature.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=W_L_2yTfOEEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Killing Suki Flood","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=21xIAAAACAAJ&dq=Killing+Suki+Flood&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ration Book Cookery","description":"One of a series of books which look at the art of cookery in Britain at different periods in history.

In 'Typhoon' Conrad reveals, in the steadfast courage of an undemonstrative captain and the imaginative readiness of his young first mate, the differences between instinct and intelligence in a partnership vital to human survival. 'Falk', the companion sea-story, contrasts, as Conrad once put it, 'common sentimentalism with the frank standpoint of a more or less primitive man', a man with a conscience, however, about the girl he desires. In one of the 'land-stories' Conrad explores the utter isolation of an East European emigrant in England; in the other, the plight of a woman ironically trapped by the unwitting alliance of two retired widowers - each blind in his own way.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nwl0xFNTpggC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The John Varley Reader","description":"A landmark collection from the master of science fiction whose short stories  are quite literally unforgettable  (William Gibson).
