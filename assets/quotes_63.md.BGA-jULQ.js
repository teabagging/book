F. is an intricate cultural novel which focuses on the different concepts that underlie politics across the world in a central African location. This book is intricate in all the concepts it deals with, i.e. politics, resource economy and the eclectic types of tribal mercenaries present. All in all, the book is a horrendous yet scrupulous analysis of the complex avarice that is ubiquitous in all socio-cultural hodgepodge novels. The complex metaphorical analysis and connections present in the book allow the reader to better discern the sundry of indelible characters that try to attain the resource-gluttonous needs of every complex society around the world. The platinum rich mountain is more than a unifying symbol of greed unto which all humanity rests its existential and rather materialistic bases on. It is more of a dithering social analysis that percolates through the general needs of our modern world, which depend on such symbols as platinum rich mountains. The incipient technological innovations that come through what we need in our modernistic valued world comes to see the mountain as a complex intertwined mix of different cultural as well as political needs. It therefore becomes the sole possessor of all mind psychology and philosophy, which base their attitudes on the materialism that pervades most of our societies and governments today.!

I just was not that interested in the outcome but it was a good effort."},{"Title":"The Dogs of War","review":"There are numberless tiresome paperback \\"action novels\\" about mercenaries. Most of these are fairly predictable and very comicbook-like in their quality. This is not one of them!Mr. Forsyth, who actually researched what he writes about, has created a very realistic scenario of a modern-day mercenary action, and the powers that be that brought it about.A geologist finds evidence of massive ore-deposits in a typically unstable African republic (its description is very much like Liberia) whose major industry is mining. A British corporation has mining interests already in country, and wants to capitalize off of this find. However, the current president, is a corrupt and eccentric despot of questionable sanity...and he is favoring political and economic ties with the Soviet Union. The solution: the British corporation hires a team of professional free-lance soldiers to stage a coup, and put a new president in place, one who will favor the corporate interest!The major part of the story is the complex procedures in which the mercenary team makes its preparations in a year prior to the action, emphasizing secrecy. The actual action on objective is short, sharp and decisive...but with an outcome that the corporate sponsor didn't quite expect!"},{"Title":"The Dogs of War","review":"The Dogs of War is one of Forsyth's best. Although written in the early 70's, it completely holds up over time (just as Day of the Jackal). The story is set in several exotic locations throughout Europe and Africa. In true Forsyth style, the first 85% of the book is setting up the action in the final 15%. Making the arrangements for a coup de tat is fascinating and the action doesn't disappoint. Fantastic book - highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Dogs of War","review":"This book is much better then the movie, although the movie was completely different from the book.

Frederick Forsyth would be a great writer even if he were writing stereo instructions. The problem is, with all the attention paid here to logistics, \\"Dogs Of War\\" doesn't feel that far removed in dryness from a Sony manual.Frederick Forsyth had his mojo working in the early 1970s, when he launched his fiction career with the magnificent \\"Day Of The Jackal\\" and followed up with a totally different, equally absorbing work in the same vein, \\"The Odessa File.\\" He had contracted for a third book, and evidently drawing on his experiences as a journalist covering the Biafran civil war in Nigeria, decided to write about a group of mercs hired to topple the leader of a small African nation.As a premise, \\"Dogs Of War\\" is very promising, and Forsyth's familiarity with the sights and smells of Africa feeds a backdrop that at times is presented quite well. A cynically world-weary tone predominates, and that works well in the context of the story. The problem is there isn't much of a plot, and a core group of main characters that, while presented as hard-bitten desperados, don't exactly give Pike, Dutch, and the rest of the Wild Bunch a run for the money in terms of characterization. One guy is called Tiny because he's large. Another strops his knife whenever there's a lull. When these characters finally face danger, we don't know them well enough to care about their fates.You know there's a big problem when there's only a few pages left in the book and the mercenaries haven't even hit the beach of the country they are about to take over. Forsyth takes his time getting to the central action of the story, and though he writes with his usual flair, the final showdown is perfunctory and unconvincing.You can see some positive developments in Forsyth's writing here, such as the emergence of humor, especially with a subplot about some scummy capitalists who set up a shell corporation for their illicit scheme with the unknowing help of a balmy Scottish widow. He works in a lot of fascinating commentary on the nature of the world though the eyes of the main protagonist, Cat Shannon.\\"The truth is, the Establishment is on the side of the big battalions, because it created and armed them in the first place,\\" he tells a lady friend. \\"It never seems to occur to the millions...that maybe God, if there is one, has something to do with truth, justice, and compassion rather than sheer brute force, and that truth and justice might possibly be on the side of the little platoons.\\"But not all the side routes Forsyth takes justify the time and attention, and there are too many ideas that either are left half-baked (a Russian interest in the African nation, a rival mercenary homicidally jealous of Shannon) or that cry plot convenience, like how Shannon gets the inside track on his employer's intentions.In the end, \\"Dogs Of War\\" is not so much a bad book, but a frustratingly incomplete one. It's got that classic Forsyth style for those (like me) who admire it, but it lacks a sense of purpose. It's not a surprise Forsyth took a few years off before penning his next, far better novel, \\"The Devil's Alternative.\\""},{"Title":"The Dogs of War","review":"I picked up the book attracted by the bestseller and interesting plot, it does has a pretty good start but I was a bit disappointed on how predictable the story has evolved. Thus I think it's average read."},{"Title":"The Dogs of War","review":"This book is a brilliant story with insightful views on the lives of mostly unknown professionals who will fight for any cause --if the price is right. It tells of a band of mercenaries who find themselves knee-deep in the plot of an English CEO to literially take over an minor African nation and install a president who will give them a deal on mining rights to a certain mountain. It's a wonderful tale set in the '70s, full of close calls and twisted dealings that ends with a surprise!

I read it after after reading &quot;The Day Of The Jackal&quot; and for the second time was not dissapointed. The novel in itself is full of suspense and the ending is a shocker. It is a great piece of work"},{"Title":"The Dogs of War","review":"Great opening, great setup, great action, FANTASTIC ending."},{"Title":"The Dogs of War","review":"Frederick Forsyth has written some legendary thrillers, in particular The Day of the Jackal. In this novel, the jackal is replaced by dogs, and the lone assassin replaced by a team of mercenaries with the mission of taking over a floundering African republic. The mission is instigated by Sir James Manson, whose driving force is marked by \\"an unscrupulousness ... a preparedness to ignore so-called moral principles in pursuit of the goal succcess.\\" (p.117) Manson heads the huge mining company Manson Consolidated, and after discovering a mountain with ten billion dollars worth of platinum, in his pursuit for mammon Manson decides to maximize his millions by arranging a coup to take over the African country which holds this buried wealth. Through his personal aide, he employs mercenary leader Cat Shannon to undertake this mission.Most of the novel revolves around Shannon's preparations for the military coup. Just as The Day of the Jackal was the anatomy of a hit, the Dogs of War is the anatomy of a coup; it deals with a military coup in the same manner that the former book deals with an assassination attempt. The concept is certainly interesting - \\"knocking off a bank or an armored truck is merely crude - knocking off an entire republic has, I feel, a certain style.\\" (p.120) But unlike The Day of the Jackal, the anatomy of the coup suffers from tediousness at times, and is overly burdened with details of letters and arrangements as Shannon acquires arms, equipment and men. The apparent depth of Forsyth's research is fantastic and certainly adds to the credibility and authenticity and a slow and convincing build-up. But unless you are personally planning to take over an African republic, you will find many of the details rather unnecessary, The story is also marked by instances of remarkable coincidence, such as Shannon's ease in bedding Manson's daughter. Although there are implicit references to unchastity, we are spared any vivid details, and the instances of profanity can be counted on one hand.In the end, while it's an interesting novel, it doesn't have nearly the same bite as the Day of the Jackal. The ending moves quickly and has a nice twist (although the glorification of suicide is disappointing), but it is too little too late. It's clean and convincing, but the majority of this book is rather too slow moving. The bark of these Dogs of War is worse than their bite, and anyone looking for more bite is better off re-reading the Day of the Jackal. Even Frederick Forsyth can't make dogs bite as well as jackals."},{"Title":"The Dogs of War","review":"People with no reason to worry about continued living can make very bad opponents, as those who go up against Cat, the protagonist in this mercenary tale, discover.Cat is tasked with putting together a mercenary operation in the pursuit of what?

It is very detailed on the 'how to' of building a mercenary operation amongst other things (banking and setting up front companies), which I really enjoyed.It seemed to be almost a manual for the mercenary soldier. In fact, if you are thinking of becoming one you should probably read this book.Don't get me wrong here either.

The characters are memorable, the detail impressive, and the storyline is taunt. I think the most impressive part of the book is both the detail of how the shell company was set up and the detail of how the assault on Zangaro was executed. Just a terribly impressive book that details a microcosm of the late 50's to late 60's geopolitical struggles in Africa. I can never put it down once I start it. Now if they would just put it on a kindle I would be happy"},{"Title":"The Dogs of War","review":"I often see a movie first and *then* read the book.I've seen the movie version twice and then took my time acquiring the novel.I just finished it up this morning.The one and two star reviewers had it right: Forsyth goes into endless administrative detailabout the preparations for the mission, which go on for a couple of hundred pages, wrapping upwith an unexciting and mostly predictable paramilitary action.Characters were a bit more intruiging than most of the naysayers give the author credit for.I would pay money to be able to overhear some of their barstool recounting of their prior exploits.Potentially interesting complications, like a rival merc's vengeful intentions and a competing Russianmining survey team, and of course the ever present spectre of an overly curious customs official inquiringtoo deeply about strange cargoes are given short shrift.I'm somewhat of a firearm and military history enthusiast. Forsyth's equipping of the mercs withWWII era 9mm submachineguns was a basically believable choice. However, it feels as if \\"9mm bullet\\"and \\"Schmeisser submachine guns\\" were terms previously unknown to the author, because he keeps mentioningthem endlessly, as if he became strangely gleeful at having uncovered some basic gun knowledge.Since the mercs never seemed to entertain the idea of outfitting themselves and their African allieswith any other infantry weapon, simply saying \\"ammunition\\" and \\"weapon(s)\\" when the smuggling logisticscame up in the narrative would have sufficed.Nonetheless, I pounded through the book in fairly short order, so that probably says a fair amount aboutthe entertainment factor, even as I damn it with faint praise."},{"Title":"The Dogs of War","review":"frederick forsyth creates magic with this extremely readable book. the plot keeps one guessing till the end. a must-read for all adventure lovers !!"},{"Title":"The Dogs of War","review":"The Frederick Forsyth book The Dogs of War was a very good book. It keeps the reader interested throughout the whole book. At the beginning of the book, Forsyth use good details to show us the planes that are landing in the night. The author tells the reader a lot about the main characters background before some of them became mercenaries. This book is right for people who like action books. The overthrowing of a government provides us with a good action book.The Manson Consolidated Mining Company has sent one of its mining scientist to the Crystal Mountains to check if the mountains contain tin. He actually finds that the mountains contain platinum which is very valuable. The only way the mining company can mine the mountains is to have the country's government overthrown. This is the conflict that makes this a good book. It was really enjoyable to read because there are some great combat scenarios in this book. If you are a person who likes combat stories then I would suggest getting this book."},{"Title":"The Dogs of War","review":"If you like your books uneventful, characterless, dry and packed with minutae, look no further than the Dogs of War.When a vein of platinum is found in the mountain region next to a third world dictatorship, plans are put in motion to hire a group of mercenaries to take out the ruler, so fat cat businessmen can put in their own guy and get the mining rights super cheap. That's the first 50 pages.The next 350 pages are the mercenaries buying boats, guns, clothes, oil, and ammo, with plenty of \\"something could go wrong, but no, it doesn't\\" moments thrown in to make you think the book might hold some dramatic tension sometime in its barely endurable length.The last 30 pages is an attack that can only be called antilimactic.I didn't care about these people, their cause, or whether they made it out alive or not. It would have been nice to see what they could do with a little more plot."},{"Title":"The Dogs of War","review":"I actually liked this book more than Day of the Jackal, which is also 5 stars, because, having lived in Africa, the book rings true. Equally true the characters are 1-dimensional and cardboard caricatures at times, but, that does not mean it is not authentic. All these architypes you will see in post-Colonial Africa in one form or another. Also wickedly ironic and racist, but in a benign way."},{"Title":"The Dogs of War","review":"Dogs of War is one of the finest work of Frederick Forsythe. The author has done considerable amount of research to present a true picture of the world of merceneries with explicit details. The plotting is amazing.

The book is surprisingly dated, and up to last 40 pages, not much is happening. There are 2 clever twists, and a gripping end. But the rest of the book is not really worth reading. You are better off going for the &quot;Jackal&quot; or the &quot;Odessa files&quot;, or, as mentioned above, the &quot;Constant Gardener&quot;."},{"Title":"The Dogs of War","review":"This is my favorite forsyth, i found this book extremly enjoyable.

Cat shanon the mercenary in charge decides to foil the scheme. Forsyth did his homework well on this one."},{"Title":"The Dogs of War","review":"This third novel written by master action / suspense writer Frederick Forsyth was not, unfortunately, one of his best. More than one third of the book is a long description of logistics that will make the reader bored and want to jump pages. It's an endless description of buying suplies, of stock market actions, etc, with the purpose of giving credibility to the action itself. But it backfired."},{"Title":"The Dogs of War","review":"The whole idea of a group of mercenaries going on a covert mission to invade another country to overthrow the government, insert a puppet dictator and then exploit the natural resources sounded fascinating and realistic to me. I expected a lot of drama and intrigue but that's not what I got. I would describe most of the book as bland or lukewarm. There were simply too many monotonous details written about the organizing of the covert operation than the operation itself. I don't mind reading about details of events before an operation or attack, it's just that the organizing of this operation went a little too smoothly. It seemed like the hero of the story (a mercenary) didn't have too many worries. There was just one big problem he had but it was delt with very quickly like magic. How a certain event unfolded was not explained very well as it could have been. While reading, I was wondering &quot;Where was he and how did he know?&quot; and &quot;Exactly how did that happen?&quot;. Some may not pay that much attention to it but I think the sub-plot could have been drawn out more, it was resolved too easily.The little twist at the end was effective and made sense. I actually thought that it was kind of funny.Forsyth fans will find this book enjoyable, but not nearly as gripping as his other books like &quot;The Fist of God&quot; and &quot;The Day of the Jackel&quot;."},{"Title":"The Dogs of War","review":"I agree with the other reviewers who have given this book a low rating. This is definitely not one of Forsyth's better books. There is a very good short story lurking here, but the book is padded out with excessive amounts of non-essential logistics and accounting (and the fairly trivial sums involved make it seem extraordinarily dated). Promising plot twists - the murderous rival mercenary Roux, the competing Russian interest in African minerals, the factions competing for power in his fictional country - are given short shrift. The author was clearly deeply affected by his experiences in Biafra, but the story emphasizes only the incompetence and corruption of sub-Saharan Africa, and only in the very brief denouement do we get any hint of the idealism that also exists in the continent. Perhaps if the author had developed these and other sub-themes to their full potential the book would have justified its length. As it is, it looks very much like something written to satisfy contractual obligations."},{"Title":"The Dogs of War","review":"The time: the early 60's. Successive British governments are shedding their empire. The place: Africa where regimes are emerging through barbarism and chaos. Mercenaries are fighting on all sides. Some work for the highest bidders and some work for leaders they believe will bring stability, justice, and freedom. Mercenary Cat Shannon, former royal marine, is on one of the last planes out. His side has been overrun.In the African hills of Zangaro, a British miner takes soil samples in the belief that it holds copper, but the samples reveal a rich deposit of the rarest ore in the world--platinum.Once his employer discovers the real value, he hatches a scheme to get the mining rights. He will hire mercenaries to overthrow the regime and install a puppet who will give him the mineral rights to the mountain. Reenter, Cat Shannon who is hired to do the job.Shannon recruits the best. He knows how to gather what he needs in secret, getting large sums of money out of the country, and acquiring the weapons and equipment he will need without arousing suspicion, fending off jealous competitors, but he has to speed up the operation.His employer discovers the Soviets have also found out about the platinum and are sending a ship of surveyors and mining experts of their own, and the current Zangaro regime is far more inclined to do business with them. It has become a race against time.Shannon and his men land off the coast and begin their operation, but there is a twist that even his employer did not count on. It is worthwhile reading this book to find out.Forsythe manages to introduce an amazing amount of detail about mining, finance, smuggling and Africa to the point that you believe he is expert in each. He weaves these details into a story that builds with suspense and intrigue. The climax, as usual, will surprise you.Cry Havoc! Let slip the Dogs of War. But, don't let the book slip away from your shelf."},{"Title":"The Dogs of War","review":"A routine analysis of an African Republic's mountain's ore content uncovers a motherlode of one of the most rare metals on the planet, platinum. However the African Republic's government is a ruthless dictatorship, rabidly anti-western and pro-communist. Facts that do not intimidate Sir James Manson, chairman/managing director of Manson Consolidated Mining Company Limited, in the least. Not surprising when, even at dirt cheap prices, the mountain is worth ten billion dollars. Eager to snag the mining rights, Manson quickly sets forth a rather unique plan. Hire mercenaries to help overthrow the government, replace it with a pro-west puppet dictator, have a shell company buy up the mining rights to the mountain, have ManCon buy the shell company, and rake in the cash by the basket full. Easier planned than done, as others quickly get their eyes on the same prize.Frederick Forsyth narrates with a reporter's deadpan voice and backs up the seemingly outlandish story with a huge amount of detail that makes it all seem credible. While the book does crackle with energy and keeps the pages turning, it lacked that something special to lift it up above the average page turner. But fans of Cold War era Men of Adventure tales will be sure to love this, recommended."},{"Title":"The Dogs of War","review":"Amazing research needed for this, great how it all knits together. Good surprises and plot twists, very good ending. Not his best but definitley better than the opposition. No wonder it takes Forsyth on average 5 years to produce a novel, keeps everybody on tenderhooks waiting for the next brilliant book."},{"Title":"The Dogs of War","review":"Ironically, I read most of this book while in a West Africa country a couple months ago -- not far from where this supposedly took place in real life -- it kept me interested during flights and at the hotel. Truth is stranger than fiction but this fiction is pretty darn good.The twist at the end was surprising and thought provoking. If you like history and intrigue, you'll probably like this book. In fact, I think I'm going to buy another copy for someone's Christmas gifts."},{"Title":"The Dogs of War","review":"I re-read this book every couple of years. Sometimes I buzz through the parts about Swiss bank account transfers and customs-house forms. Other times I drink in all those technical details like a foaming schooner of Flemish ale. Depends on your mood, I guess. Regardless, I always savor the action sequences, which are relayed in splendid detail, and Forsyth's unique brand of gallows humor.This is about how one man sets up and carries out a coup d'etat, dollar by dollar, bullet by bullet. It it not just a shoot-em-up, and those who wish to read such a book should go elsewhere. But for those who savor the details, and camaraderie shared among wild geese in an Ostend bar at the end of a good day's scheming and plotting, this book is one in a million."},{"Title":"The Dogs of War","review":"I think this is an interesting read even if it a novel. I read this after a reference to this book in a news story about the coup de etat in the island nation of Comorros. At that time, some South African mercenaries overthrew the crazed rule of the African ruler of Comorros. That is where the reference to the Dogs of War was made.One of the previous reviewers thought it was bad for Forsyth to spend so much space on how the coup was organized. The procurement of all the arms with the export license was very fascinating. What Forsyth revealed was that coups could be done privately witout the knowledge of governments. One only had to know how to procure and organize for the overthrow of a government. I think Forsyth did this well.This is an interesting read. This may not be on the level of his previous books, but it is still a good read."},{"Title":"The Dogs of War","review":"This is the mercenary counterpart to what is an anatomy to an assassionation in the Day of the Jackal.A closely-guarded secret discovery of rich platinum deposits in the Crystal Mountains in a tiny African state led a British entrepreneur Manson to finance a coup in the state to obtain control of the deposit. Keeping himself anonymous and working only with 2 greed-motivated underlings, Manson sought out a notable mercenary leader Cat Shannon who just returned from an unsuccessful mission from Africa.Unwilling to be pawn to an unseen mastermind, Shannon initiated his own counter-espionage to learn more about his paymaster and the interest in the apparently insignificant African state. To add spice to the game, the Russians, who had the major influence in the state, also learned that a British survey completed several months before in the Crystal Mountains which reported no significant tin deposits (the original object of the survey) may not have been completely truthful ...The start of the tale focus on the cat-and-mouse game Manson and his underlings played to keep their discovery a secret while trying to launch a military takeover, finding the suitable men to fight and another to be the puppet head. The middle of the tale looks at the mercenary acquiring, financing and transporting the necessary hardware from various sources in Europe. The narration is well-detailed, showing for the right price, anything can be bought from the street hoodlums or from the your own government.Manson and his underlings were well-constructed, appearing to be more mercenary than the soldiers of fortune. Shannon, on the other hand, a man who after his earlier African experiences could not adapt to a cog-in-the-wheel life in civilised Britain, showed such sharp mettle and acumen that one could not help but wonder what a splash he would have made if he had found the determination to make his mark in the business world. The other mercenary characters were also colourfully potrayed, though sometimes their identities became mixed.Another aspect well-written was Shannon's inner self who found himself always fighting a war whose ultimate beneficiaries were the people he despised bitterly. An entertaining moment was found in Manson's daughter, beautiful model well-versed in the ways of the world, a barracuda to break men of wealth, becoming almost innocent and childlike when confronted with Shannon's world.Unfortunately, unlike the promise of the book's introduction at the backcover, the Russians never did was played to their full potential.This book offered an alternative perspective to the 60s &amp; 70s, contrasting the concerns and motivations of Europe then to the really dark times in Africa. Certainly an interesting book, enough to occupy for a long journey, best read uninterrupted if one does not want to lose track of the details."},{"Title":"The Dogs of War","review":"I loved this book because the characters are real, the plot seems authentic, and the hero achieves what men always desire...to use ones' honor for an honorable cause."},{"Title":"The Dogs of War","review":"The Dogs of War is a how-to manual for setting up a mercenary coup of a third-world African country. The detail was impressive and shows that Frederick Forsyth really researched the ins and outs of arms smuggling and mercenary deals while a BBC journalist in Africa.The main character, Cat Shannon, disseminates just as much information as is minimally necessary for each and every component of his operation so that he's exposed no more than necessary. He's an experienced mercenary who lives the life of danger, whether brandishing weapons in the jungle or obtaining end user certificates for arms shipments in Yugoslavia. His life is exciting, yet he's in control all the time and the reader learns that this is why he's lived as long as he has.The country in question, Zangaro, is home to a platinum reserve that could rival known deposits in quantity and British mining magnate, James Manson, wants it all to himself without the fuss of dealing with the existing dictator. Where Cat Shannon is meticulous in setting up arms purchases, transportation issues, and hiring experienced killers, Manson is a master craftsman at avoiding legality in the business world through setting up shell companies, forging scientific surveys and filing false reports to government agencies.The detail is both the strength and the weakness of this book. It's not an action/adventure. It's a how-to, as I pointed out earlier. That works to a point, but somewhere in the fourth or fifth iteration of end-user certifications, I got bored and just wanted them to get to Africa and kick some ***. For that reason, I can't give it a high rating even though Forsyth writes so beautifully I'd read his \\"What I Did on my Summer Vacation\\" essay from fourth grade. This just isn't his strongest work.But, if you're going to overthrow a nation-state, please read this book."},{"Title":"The Dogs of War","review":"This book holds together quite well, although is noticably dated at this stage. It is entertaining and is a worthwhile addition to the collection of any Africa enthusiast, if for no other reason than memories of 1970's Africa which it is bound to arouse."},{"Title":"The Dogs of War","review":"Frederick Forsyth weaves a brilliant tale about European mercenaries ousting a brutal African dictator for the benefit of a massive British mining company. Forsyth looses the readers in the minutia of planning the ouster. Too much detail about user certificates, tunics, smuggling, etc could have easily been replaced or deleted all together.All in all, this is an excellent book."},{"Title":"The Dogs of War","review":"The language is not that great, the story is somewhat dated, some of the developments are half-baked, but nevertheless the book captivates you and makes an entertaining reading.Interesting take on how the coups are accomplished in small African countries, and I suspect Forsyth is not that far away from reality."},{"Title":"The Dogs of War","review":"a great book for those familiar with equatorial guinea and all the turmoil the country has been through. But a great read as far as aesthetic entertainment goes as well. How to stage a coup in a small country..."},{"Title":"The Dogs of War","review":"No spoilersWhile I can say that this is not my favorite Forsyth book so far, that does not at all mean that I didn't enjoy it and that you shouldn't read it. Even though \\"Jackal\\" is still the best by far, The Dogs of War is quite entertaining and held my attention throughout. When it comes to espionage/underworld activities/mystery/thriller novels, Forsyth is the king. My only detraction from this book has to do with the ending. While I was reading it, I kept wondering how he was going to wrap the story up, and once he did I wasn't all that satisfied. However, that's obviously my opinion and hopefully you'll have a different one. Either way, I recommend this book and all the previous Forsyth novels as well."},{"Title":"The Dogs of War","review":"I am not a fan of action novels and this was quite unusual for me, but I decided to give \\"Dogs of War\\" a try. I was surprised, because I actually liked it.The novel begins with an end of one of the African independence wars in the 1950's, when the mercenaries are leaving for Paris. The troop led by devilishly intelligent Cat Shannon is dispersed with the promise of getting back together when the new job comes up.Meanwhile, in London, financial shark, Sir James Manson, discovers, that the samples from the Crystal Mountain in the fictional central African republic of Zangaro, contain not only trace amounts of tin, but a significant amount of platinum. He immediately hatches up a cunning plan to circumvent the permits and licenses, a plan calculated to make him very rich very soon. The plan involves the military coup in Zangaro... And for this he needs Cat Shannon.The whole book is taken by the preparation for the coup and it is true, that it reads like an instruction. Logistics is the key, and it was a bit mundane to read about the calculations, expenses and prices of weapons. The coup itself is at the end, but it is brilliantly executed and not free from surprises.The novel is quite conventional, but it caught my interest, I liked the character of Shannon, I disliked Sir James, all as it was supposed to be. I am not sure if I will see the movie (although it definitely is the perfect plot for the movie) because I think Christopher Walken is spooky and I do not want to change the image of Cat Shannon I have in my head after reading this novel. Definitely, I am ready for the more famous books by Forsyth now."},{"Title":"The Dogs of War","review":"At least this is a different story, and in this book you will see that the people who has money and power think that they could do anything, but they have to take care of the people who work for them, specially in the job of Cat Shannon.The book will keep you interested almost in all pages, the last to chapters are to long for the things Forsyth describes in them, but so far you have to finish the book, in one chapter says that Cat swam several miles to do his exercises, but at the end of the book this is a contradiction, you will see when you read the epilogue.As the books of Forsyth that I like, you will never know if this story is true or false."},{"Title":"The Dogs of War","review":"The Frederick Forsyth book The Dogs of War was a very good book. It keeps the reader interested throughout the whole book. At the beginning of the book, Forsyth use good details to show us the planes that are landing in the night. The author tells the reader a lot about the main characters background before some of them became mercenaries. This book is right for people who like action books. The overthrowing of a government provides us with a good action book.The Manson Consolidated Mining Company has sent one of its mining scientist to the Crystal Mountains to check if the mountains contain tin. He actually finds that the mountains contain platinum which is very valuable. The only way the mining company can mine the mountains is to have the country's government overthrown. This is the conflict that makes this a good book. It was really enjoyable to read because there are some great combat scenarios in this book. If you are a person who likes combat stories then I would suggest getting this book."},{"Title":"The Dogs of War","review":"The Dogs of war is a classic novel, well blended with spine chilling experiences and happy moments. Sadness also finds a palce in parts of hte book. The best book by Fredrick Forsyth, following The Day of The Jackal. The novel maintains a steady pace throughout, mystifying the reader's mind. It is a woderful piece of art. The writer has succeded in putting bringing together thrill and sorrow at the same time, something that I found missing in The Day of The Jackal and The Odessa File. both were equally gripping but this book has to surpass the quality of the two other books only because of the different emotions, felt not only by the writer, but also the the reader..."},{"Title":"The Dogs of War","review":"It can not be denied that Forsyth put a lot of research intothis, and should be duly commended for that. He has an ability ofwriting a good story, and unlike many, he knows how to conclude his works, usually above satisfactory levels. This was said to contain a shocker for an ending, but I tend to disagree. Not exactly a shocker, but a pretty neat twist to the story, that, for sure."},{"Title":"The Dogs of War","review":"The ingredients for a vintage Forsyth novel are there. However, the mix is not optimal. At times, the reading becomes tedious. Notwithstanding that, it's still a good read, even if it's just for the sake of increasing your general knowledge."},{"Title":"Walt Whitman: The Song of Himself","review":"In this latest biography of quite possibly the most important American poet, Jerome Loving takes on a Herculean labor: to present the facts about a man who endeavored to create himself as an icon, and who has been taken up by a dozen causes and ideologies as one of their own (some have regarded Whitman as a religious figure on par with Christ, a homosexual liberator, or a proto-communist). The result of a great deal of combining and comparing, winnowing opinion, propaganda, and rumor, is a cautious, complex, and detailed view of the facts of Whitman's life.On the issues currently 'hot' in debate about the poet (his homosexuality or lack thereof, his attitudes towards immigrants, women, and African-Americans), Loving doesn't succumb to the temptation to either sanctify his subject or make him simply a partisan of the current opinions, but rather weighs and presents the evidence in as close to an impartial manner as I've seen. The lack of a simplistic, overarching narrative to Loving's life of Whitman (the kind of narrative found in many other bios) is true to the facts of life and scholarship--sometimes we can't know. I've found this book scrupulously up-to-date; it corrects many factual errors found in earlier Whitman bios. It is required reading for any Whitman scholar, and a good read as well for those interested in knowing more about the Good Grey Poet than his poems tell us by themselves."},{"Title":"Walt Whitman: The Song of Himself","review":"As a probably a-typical reader (I've not read Whitman's poems very thoroughly or very recently), I was nonetheless very interested to read about his life in incredible detail. Loving chronicles Whitman's movements to and fro - professionally, geographically, and artistically. His ability to deliver the flavor of the era via exposition of the political and social issues is quite good, however, at the &quot;juiciest&quot; of moments you sometimes feel disappointed. For example, there is quite a bit written about Whitman's Free Soil politics vs. abolistionist and how that ultimately destroys his friendship with his stalwart supporter O'Connor. The information is conveyed -- but I feel that I am missing some of the passion -- of their relationship to begin with -- and then of the heated argument they reportedly had. Perhaps this information was unavailable.I could conclude that Loving did not wish to guess -- but on several occasions in the book he speculates freely and without tons of support. I guess I would have prefered more freedom to speculate by the scholar.Still - if the reader is seeking a landscape upon which to speculate this should indeed be ample."},{"Title":"Walt Whitman: The Song of Himself","review":"After reading Loving's book on Whitman it only enhanced my spirit to read and analyze more of this Poet's life and poetry. I decieded to write about Whitman in my class at college and used Loving's book as a research means together with other books form the university library. I feel as if I know more about good &quot;Old Walt&quot; then I do my own family. This was truly a good read. Enjoy!!!"},{"Title":"Walt Whitman: The Song of Himself","review":"I took a Whitman seminar from Dr. Loving, and this was our textbook. It is very dy, and very full of detail. I love Whitman's work, and reading this biography really helped me understand more about it."},{"Title":"Walt Whitman: The Song of Himself","review":"The poet died in 1892. In life he became notorious and a positive influence on the reformers of the day. The author states he supplied the model for the count in Bram Stoker's DRACULA. The first edition of LEAVES OF GRASS was 1855, the last 1881. Whitman was not as solitary as previously assumed. For the poet the Civil War became a marriage ceremony of sorts. At forty three Whitman was too old for the rigors of combat. In 1862 Whitman went to the front in search of his brother George. Subsequently traveling to Washington D.C. he began his career as a wound dresser. Whitman immersed himself in the pathos of the terrible struggle.Whitman's capacity to love was the dynamo of LEAVES OF GRASS. He was a former printer, second son in the family. Whitman's ancestry was essentially Dutch and English. He concluded his formal schooling at age eleven. Between 1836 and 1841 Whitman taught at eight district schools on Long Island. By 1855 Whitman had read Emerson. In 1840 he made the prophetic announcement that he was thinking of writing a book. The tone of Whitman's early writings is moralistic. Whitman wrote a temperance novel entitled FRANKLIN EVANS.Whitman was a privte poet who made public his boundless affection for the one in the many. Whitman was no New England reformer. His utopia was not an agrarian retreat. In the 1840's Whitman dressed in a conventional way. Whitman loved Indian names and thought the nation was losing something through its policy of Indian removal. At the same time he had Darwainian confidence that the Indians faced extinction. Whitman was appalled by capital punishment. He saw the matter within the context of the haves and the nave-nots.The Bible was an influence later on his poetry. Whitman was editor of the BROOKLYN EAGLE 1846-1848. Whitman saw slavery as a social evil. He never became an abolitionist in a political or formal sense. Whitman lost his job and traveled south to New Orleans. He worked at the CRESCENT but later separated from that publication possibly by mutual agreement. His favorite poet was William Cullen Bryant. It may have occurred to him at this time that he was wearing out his opportunities in journalism. Travel beyond Long Island and New York City had fed his imagination at least.Whitmam, a product of &quot;charity schooling&quot;, was socially and economically different from Emerson and others. Whitman was involved in Free-Soil politics. He became the editor of the FREEMAN. As the paper adopted a softer tone, Whitman was pushed out of the editorial office. LEAVES OF GRASS began to take shape in his mind in the 1850's. Parallels abound between Emerson's first two collections of essays and Whitman's first three editions of LEAVES OF GRASS. Whitman was interested in problems of democracy and the development of genius. He probably heard or knew of Emerson's address &quot;Natural Aristocracy.&quot; Whitman was awash in romantic ideas about art and the artist.Whitman's favorite composers of opera were Rossini, Donizetti, Bellini, and Verdi. Italian opera emphasized the human voice over the orchestration. It is because of Italian opera that LEAVES OF GRASS may be read aloud. BEL CANTO sent Whitman into moments of rapture. LEAVES OF GRASS is a solitary act. The terms leaves and grass are printer's lingo. The use of leaves in a book title was common. Whitman felt that the genius in the United States was always in the common people. Emerson wrote that famous letter on July 21, 1855 greeting Whitman &quot;at the beginning of a great career.&quot;Whitman blurred the difference between poetry and prose. Whitman took the single line as the rhythmical unit. James Russell Lowell supported Whitman's poetry with reservations. Richard Moncton Milnes was a notable English supporter. Alcott left a full account of a visit with Whitman in 1856. Emerson thought the poet should use self-censorship on his Children of Adam poems for the 1860 edition. The only contemporary response to homosexuality and the Calamus poems was a letter of the English critic John Aldington Symonds in 1890. William Dean Howells and Henry James did not like the poetry in DRUM TAPS or any of the other offerings of Whitman. William Rossetti arranged for an English edition of LEAVES OF GRASS.Whitman was a commencement speaker at Dartmouth in 1872. In the 1870's he moved to Camden and suffered the first stroke. Ill health did not prevent him from being productive in later life. His last essay treated Elias Hicks, a Quaker artist, who had been an influence on his work. This critical biography is excellent."},{"Title":"Walt Whitman: The Song of Himself","review":"Simply, this is the worst biography I have read in a long time. It is boring, it drags and, even though it is a work of non-fiction, it could have been more creatively written. Also, the book does not address Whitman's sexuality which is one of the greatest debates about Whitman. I suggest you pass and try another biography of Walt Whitman."},{"Title":"Cartoons from The New Yorker: 2006 Day-to-Day Calendar","review":"I am going to purchase the 2006 calendar (I can't believe I didn't get one for Christmas!).

With more than one hundred poems, it's also packed full of passion. I think that after many years of searching, Ferlinghetti finally found his true voice. These poems are sometimes funny, sometimes painful, but always beautifully created and full of life."},{"Title":"A Far Rockaway Of The Heart","review":"I just finished this little book of 101 poems by Lawrence Ferlinghetti. I know I liked it but I can't say too easily why. If I compare this with Billy Collins' work I think the language is more beautiful and the imagery is more abstract. I took my time with it more than most poetry I have read, often reading the poems twice or three times. This was not because I had hard time understanding it; I just didn't want to let them go! I am glad that I read this book and now look forward to reading A Coney Island of the Mind.There was one unexpected thing about A Far Rockaway of the Heart that I discovered by accident.When I finish any book that I have really enjoyed, I often turn back to the beginning once I have finished the last page. This is part of my \\"contemplation/digestion/meditation\\" process I go through when I have really liked a book. It is my way of coming down from that particular high I was on.When I did this after having read the last page and contemplating a while, I found that if you start reading the first poem again immediately after reading the last poem, these two poems seem to be connected in much the same way that the rest of the poems are connected. So the whole collection of poems form a ring, rather than a chain. I don't know if this is intentional or not, but I like to think it is.I *highly* recommend this book."},{"Title":"A Far Rockaway Of The Heart","review":"This is a great book for exploring the Bohemian poetry movement in the U.S. (namely, San Francisco).

After all, writing a calculus text is no small feat. The authors of these books have to try to include every possible concept for fear that a math department or instructor will reject the book because it omits something or other. This means that you will get a little bit of everything, with a paltry few examples for each section. If you have a sadistic professor (aren't they all?), you may feel lost in trying to grasp calculus concepts from this book alone.Math texts are full of assumptions, often skipping steps along the way in the examples.

I would actually recommend buying that book instead of this one if you are planning on taking up to Calc. 3 because they are similar in price but the full version includes Calc 1, 2, and 3 material.Anyway, I used this text for both Calculus 1 and 2 in college. The first six chapters cover the course material for Calculus 1: Introductory Analytical Geometry, Limits, Derivatives, Applications of Derivatives, Integrals, and Applications of Intergrals. Chapters 7-12 covers course material normal for Calculus 2: Inverse functions/Derivatives and integrals of exponential and logarithmic functions, Techniques of Integrations, Applications of Integration to Physics/Engineering, Differiential Equations (which we didn't cover), Parametric Equations/Polar Coordinates, and Series. For some reason chapter seven includes different verisons of certain sections but they are basically the same anyway.Unlike other reviewers, I think that this book was very helpful. It is possible to learn the material if you put a lot of effort into it, which you need to do if you really want to learn Calculus.I can see why reviewers would find this book difficult to use though. Truthfully, I found the Calc 1 material much more difficult than the Calc 2 material, probably because more of the calc 1 material is based on theory. The section about graphing fuctions using derivatives is especially difficult. It is extremely difficult to take the derivatives of some of the functions the book gives you, let alone find the critical points, etc. Also, some of the maximinization problems are virtually impossible to solve and a number of the related rate problems are very tricky. Finally, I think that I can truthfully say that I rarely solved integrals correctly by the long way (using summations).Some people think that Calc 2 is the hardest math subject in the world, but I found the calc 2 material much easier than the calc 1 material. The calc 2 chapters deal more with just solving problems particularly limits, integrals, and series, and the \\"proofs\\" for equations are just given on the side or in the appendex. You should already know the basics, so there is nothing really tricky here (except maybe integration by partial fractions) and if you put the effort into working problems, you will probably do ok. Calc 2 is all about 1) Learning how to solve problems by recognizing trends and 2) Commiting some formulas and equalities to memory in order to solve problems and learn about applications of math. As far as I can see, Stewart's problems are as good as any to learn Calc 2.If you plan on studying Calculus in college, I would suggest first buying the book \\"Calculus the Easy Way\\" to look over first. It is pretty good; it covers all Calc 1 material and a good chunk of Calc 2 material. I would also suggest buying the solutions manuel to Stewart's text because it is helpful to see how the problems are worked out. My advice is to just put a lot of time into Calculus (no matter what book you use) and you should do ok. Its just math."},{"Title":"Single Variable Calculus (with Tools for Enriching Calculus, Video Skillbuilder CD-ROM, iLrn Homework, and Personal Tutor with SMARTHINKING)","review":"In the world of introductory physics, there is clearly a division: those who hate Stewart, and those who love Stewart. I, frankly, am neither: but I realize that Stewart's many strong points outweigh the weak points.Beginners often will find pure theory and proofs alien to their minds, as they are just trying to grasp how to apply what they are learning --- like how they may go about obtaining derivatives and plotting periodic functions. Stewart handles this well: while providing a good theoretical background (he states theorems and proves most of them quite clearly and succintly) he does not inundate the wide-eyed innocent with epsilons and other frightening Greek characters. Stewart stresses some very important and difficult concepts to grasp --- like the many methods on integration involving 'guessing' substitution methods and others ways of integrating which involve understanding what the answer might be in advance by scanning the integral first, etc. Stewart also introduces some differential equations and has a wonderfully long section on series which stress their most useful applications -- the convergence and divergence of series and the Taylor and Maclaurin series representations of functions.Stewart's text is clear and easy for the student to work through either in a class setting or independently. I should know -- I taught myself Calc II (integration to series) using this book, and now I am doing quite well in advanced calc (integral transforms, partial differential equations, etc). Stewart sets the stage for success.This book can be easily used by students at any age who have had up to the level of trigonometry."},{"Title":"Single Variable Calculus (with Tools for Enriching Calculus, Video Skillbuilder CD-ROM, iLrn Homework, and Personal Tutor with SMARTHINKING)","review":"Specifically, This book...Contains many errors, which have been discovered by students.Offers far too few examples for the student to learn from.Generally, students who use this book need to consult other books to learn the material."},{"Title":"Single Variable Calculus (with Tools for Enriching Calculus, Video Skillbuilder CD-ROM, iLrn Homework, and Personal Tutor with SMARTHINKING)","review":"I think the author of this book tries his hardest to make the problems as confusing as possible. Especially the even ones. There are many times when an even numbered problem is extremely difficult, but there is no similar example out of any of the explained odd problems in the text. The only thing I would say is good about this book is possibly one or two of the earliest sections and the cd, which isn't even all that good as far as text book cds go. I guess the people who rated it well must have already had a pretty good handle on the concepts already, but for someone who has never had calc and who is not the best at math, this book just makes things more confusing. Your best bet would be to hope you have a very good teacher, and maybe to join a study group because the book definitely is no help."},{"Title":"Single Variable Calculus (with Tools for Enriching Calculus, Video Skillbuilder CD-ROM, iLrn Homework, and Personal Tutor with SMARTHINKING)","review":"this text is hard to understand.

Stewart often presents complex concepts very quickly, with only the simplest of worked examples. This often makes the end-of-section problems bewildering, as the reader has not seen how to approach a given type of problem. Of course, there's nothing wrong with a textbook presenting some problems that require \\"outside the box\\" thinking and extension of chapter material, but I think it's a sign of shoddy writing when one's given such little guidance on how to do even simple problems. The book is serviceable for Calc I and very early Calc II (chapters 1-7), since Calc I material isn't nearly as difficult as Calc II. But the later chapters really suffer from Stewart's spartan presentation. Especially badly done are the sections on centers of mass, polar coordinates (especially the area between two polar curves), Taylor's Inequality, and the multiplication/division of power series. I was lucky to have a good professor who cleared up much of the material in lecture, but autodidacts are out of luck. I give this book two stars only because it's written in complete, grammatical sentences, and it does not contain glaring errors."},{"Title":"Single Variable Calculus (with Tools for Enriching Calculus, Video Skillbuilder CD-ROM, iLrn Homework, and Personal Tutor with SMARTHINKING)","review":"I was asked to serve on the calculus adoption committee this spring. Over the holidays, I examined some of the texts submitted for our consideration. With each, I started with the presentation of the Mean Value Theorem because this theorem is fundamental to the understanding of Freshman calculus. I was disappointed at the poor presentation of this material in Stewart.4.2 Mean Value Theorem, pages 234-239p. 234 Stewart says that &quot;to arrive at the Mean Value Theorem we first need&quot; Rolle's Theorem. This is not true. There are many ways to prove the Mean Value Theorem. I don't like a text that tells my students there is only one way to prove a certain result.p. 235 The margin comment seems to imply that a student can trust the graph shown by a graphing calculator. The section gives no example to demonstrate possible pitfalls of graphing technology.p. 235 Stewart says that Joseph-Louis Lagrange was French. This is not true. He was born in Italy and baptized in the name of Giuseppe Lodovico Lagrangia. His great-grandfather on his father's side was French and Lagrange leaned toward his French ancestry. A college text should be more careful when discussing historical facts.p. 235 The text gives students no idea about the meaning of the word &quot;mean&quot; in the Mean Value Theorem.p. 235 I find the use of &quot;we&quot; and &quot;let's&quot; throughout the text to be old fashioned and presumptuous. When the author says to a student &quot;we can see&quot; (last paragraph) he is assuming that he and his reader have similar backgrounds. Overall, the writing style is uninviting.p. 236 Again, in the proof of the Mean Value Theorem, the author claims that &quot;First we must verify that h satisfies the three hypotheses of Rolle's Theorem.&quot; As a mathematician, this offends me.p. 237 I consider the Mean Value Theorem to be the most important theorem in Freshman calculus. The author's statement about the &quot;main significance of the Mean Value Theorem&quot; gives students no idea about the fundamental importance of the theorem.p. 237 The numbering system in the book would be awkward to use in class. Each section begins anew with Figure 1 and Theorem 1 and Equation 1. The standard convention is mathematics texts is to number Figures and Theorems by chapter, as in Figure 4.1.p. 238 The exercise set is short --- only 34 exercises. Of these, there are only 3 exercises dealing with trigonometric functions (Exercises 3, 18, and 29.)p. 239 Exercise 9 I don't like the wording in part (c) of this exercise. As a student, how am I to verify to my instructor that I have &quot;noticed that the tangent line is parallel to the secant line?&quot; I would prefer something more challenging, such as &quot;show that the tangent line is parallel to the secant line.&quot;p. 239 Exercise 22 Stewart refers to a function having &quot;roots.&quot; I checked this in the James and James Mathematics Dictionary and Stewart's use of the word is incorrect. Equations have roots, graphs have intercepts, and functions have zeros.p. 239 I have heard that Stewart has challenging exercises. Yet, I see that two of the more challenging exercises in this set are accompanied by &quot;Hints&quot; that give the solution away.p. 239 Exercise 33 This exercise is nonsense. On page 118 the author defines &quot;position function&quot; to refer to straight line motion. Yet, it is not given that runners are traveling in a straight line. Don't runners commonly run around an oval track? In such a case, what does the author mean by the term &quot;velocity?&quot; Does he really mean &quot;speed?&quot; The author makes a point of saying the runners &quot;start at the same time.&quot; The point of the using the Mean Value Theorem is that the runners travel the same distance during the same interval of time."},{"Title":"Single Variable Calculus (with Tools for Enriching Calculus, Video Skillbuilder CD-ROM, iLrn Homework, and Personal Tutor with SMARTHINKING)","review":"I used this book for Calc 1 and 2.

I opened the book and beginning with the first page of the lesson, I read all the examples and explanations so I completely understood everything (often had to do MANY times). You really need to understand all the prior lessons to learn a new one because it all builds on itself.

I would advise taking at least some of it with a grain of salt, though, as she does rather go on about the fictional Celtic Great Goddess and the equally fictional Tree Calendar a bit. She seems to take all sources as equally valid, citing authors like Robert Graves, Mary Daly, and Kaledon Naddair along side authorities like F. Marian MacNeill and Anne Ross and more technical documents like pollen studies.This said, she seems to be an excellent source for Gaelic names of plants, medicinal traditions in the Highlands and Islands, and material regarding fiber arts and dyeing. She falls down a bit where she goes with Gravesian and NeoPagan sources for spiritual information.

The Guardians have special magical powers that are from nature. He is sent by the Council to deal with a rogue Guardian, Lord Drayton. But something goes terribly wrong. Caught by surprise, Simon is trapped by a transformation spell. Only Drayton can release him. With no hopes of returning to his human form, all seems lost until he meets an interesting and mysterious woman.Meg is a simple young woman in Drayton's care. After unwittingly causing Simon to be captured, she helps him escape before Drayton can kill him. With Meg's help, Simon is able to return to his human form. He realizes that Meg is a victim of Drayton's magical manipulations as well. As he begins to heal her, Simon sees she is a beautiful woman full of powerful and wild magic. No wonder Drayton was so strong. He was tapping into Meg's energy. Because he is still vulnerable to the transformation spell, Simon needs to have Meg close to his side. What better way than to pretend that they are married? Together, they must find a way to break the spell and find out Drayton's plans before it is too late.Stolen Magic is a multi-layered paranormal romance. For the first time in years, Meg is truly herself. Without Drayton's influence, she is a vibrant young woman who is eager to experience life. She is attracted to Simon, but in many ways she is still a child. He is the first man who doesn't covet her for her abilities. As they get to know each other better, Meg begins to see the differences between a girlhood crush and love. When she gains confidence in herself and her magic, she truly will be Simon's equal.Simon leads a solitary life as an enforcer for the Guardians. His ethics and commitment have made him few friends. When he meets Meg, she opens up his emotions. He experiences jealousy, rage, pride and love. His first instinct is to protect Meg even at his own expense. She becomes his weakest link. Meg makes him believe that there is life outside of just being an enforcer, a future with the woman he loves. That is something he never thought could happen to him.The secondary characters open up a larger canvas to the magical world. I even think that the magic is a character. It's influence is far reaching and stirs up things that are unexpected. Each time I think I understand the story, Ms. Putney introduces another character or magic that adds yet more layers to the story. It kept me glued to the pages. Stolen Magic is an absorbing story of love, power and magic that I very much recommend.LeeReveiwed for Joyfully Reviewed"},{"Title":"Stolen Magic","review":"This is a wonderfully and imaginatively written novel. Putney does not disappoint in her sequel to A Kiss of Fate (also highly recommended). In this book, we have Guardians of magic, and we have Simon, enforcer of the Guardian Council, who becomes snared in a net of black magic which transforms him into a unicorn. And thus the tale begins. Simon's struggles to regain and maintain his human form, save the innocent, and defeat evil are aided by Meg, a magical woman who has been hidden in plain sight. They also manage to make England safe for the industrial revolution. Trust me: All of this weaves together wonderfully for a most satisfying read, with strong characterizations and plot.Those who are looking for more a plain vanilla romantic tale may not enjoy Putney's foray into the realm of fantasy and magic; personally, I can't wait for the next installment."},{"Title":"Stolen Magic","review":"I am familiar with M.J.P., and have enjoyed quite a few of her books. This one wasn't one of them. It was pedantic, and written in a lumbering style: I was always aware that I was READING; whereas I generally seek out authors good enough that I LIVE in the book. The sex was dull, the plot was unbelievable (I pretty much quit after the Council trial...PLEASE!) and I had no empathy or respect for the characters.

I was thrilled to know that it was out on the shelves, so I went to Barnes & Noble. Incidentally, I almost never buy hardcover books; I prefer to wait until the book is published in paperback. Because of this, I was in Barnes & Noble nearly every day until I was finished with it.You can't put the book down. It just doesn't work that way. In \\"A Kiss of Fate,\\" we become acquainted with Lord Simon Falconer, the chief enforcer of the Guardian Council. In this story, we share Simon's despair as he is temporarily overthrown by a particularly stubborn and maddeningly clever rouge mage (Drayton). We also meet the lovely maiden with whom Simon becomes acquainted, and whom he also frees from a spell of enthrallment. Because of this action, they are bound together to defeat Drayton. As their relationship develops, Drayton's power increases. Because of this, we become more acquainted with the other Guardian Council members. Very interesting character developments.This story is one that keeps you on the edge of your seat; I had to keep coming back to read it. The characters were well-developed, the general plotline was very clever and made you smile several times throughout, and it forever kept one guessing where the plot would twist and leave you clutching the arm rest. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and found it pleasantly reminiscient of her other romance books. However, instead of contrasting, the science fiction/fantasy element compliments her style very well.I'd reccommend this book to anyone who enjoys science fiction/fantasy, and to anyone who is looking for a good read. Keep in mind that it isn't necessarily a floaty, light read; in fact, it has a large dose of dark undertones, and a heart-felt wish that the antagonist suffers a long, painful death."},{"Title":"Stolen Magic","review":"The author of A Kiss of Fate has done it again! Award-winning Mary Jo Putney has a second book in her new historical fantasy / romance series. Stolen Magic features the strong female characters and interesting plots that Putney is known for. It's a good read!Guardian Simon Malmain sneaks into the castle of a Guardian Lord Drayton, who is being investigated for misusing his power. Simon expects his job to be easy: to announce that Drayton must appear before the Guardian council to answer charges. However, Simon is surprised by the incredibly strong and powerful magic Drayton has when Simon is transformed into a unicorn. He manages to escape, but is later captured by Drayton's men who use a virgin, one of Drayton's simple servants, Meg, to lure him into a trap. Simon is later freed by Meg, who loves horses and is dismayed that she has been used to trap this beautiful and powerful unicorn creature. They escape Drayton's power together, and Simon is returned to his human shape when Meg, who is bleeding, tends to a wound on his leg. Apparently when the blood of a virgin is mixed with his blood, it will turn him back into a human.Simon and Meg flee to Lady Bethany's estate, where they are protected by her strong magic, but it is apparent he needs Meg by his side - for he turns into a unicorn whenever he gets angry. They decide on a sham marriage. The catch is that Meg must remain a virgin until Drayton is vanquished - and to say the least, it complicates their intense attraction to each other and adds, as we'd say today, some sexual tension and sizzle.Simon also realizes that Meg has her own strong magic, and she has been feeding into Drayton's powers for over ten years. She has no memory of who she is or where she came from. Meg is freed from Drayton's thrall, and Simon releases her from a spell that has changed her appearance.

The female voices were excellent as were all the regional accents.

That and a touch of humor made this story quite sweet."},{"Title":"Stolen Magic","review":"The 'Guardians' work together to protect innocents from rogue mages. A few of their number are called to become hunters, seeking after rogues and bringing them to justice. It's a dangerous task and, despite its importance, the hunters are often feared by others. One of the best of these hunters is Simon Malmain, Earl of Falconer. Simon's investigations lead him to Lord Drayton--but the rogue Guardian doesn't seem worried. And when Simon attempts to subdue him, Drayton turns the tables on him, turning Simon into a unicorn and attempting to kill him to gain the power of his unicorn horn. It's impossible for Drayton to hold such powers, but apparently he's done the impossible--and Simon thinks he can see how. Drayton is robbing the power of other mages.Drayton's guards stake out a handy virgin to capture the unicorn--and capture him, she does. But the virgin, Meg, is really one of Drayton's thralls--the magic-rich sources of his power. Together Simon and Meg attempt to bring Drayton to justice--only to find that the prejudices against Simon allow Drayton to escape from justice again. And now Drayton is fully warned--and intent on having his revenge and recovering the source of so much of his power.Author M. J. Putney continues her historical paranormal series with STOLEN MAGIC. Set in 1748, just before the dawn of the industrial revolution and after Bonnie Prince Charlie's doomed invasion, STOLEN picks a critical time in history. Invention is popping out everywhere, offering both promise and threat to established powers. When Drayton summons a meeting of inventors, one wonders whether he might attempt a powerful combination--creating a battery for magical energy, for example.The mystical attraction between the virgin and the unicorn (and although Simon regains his humanity, his unicorn side always threatens to break out) is interesting and sexy. Drayton's ability to draw on the powers of other magic holders adds an element of threat and evil to his character. And Putney's strong writing makes STOLEN easy to get into and hard to put down. Still, compared to Putney's A KISS OF FATE, STOLEN falls a bit short. Simon claimed to have evidence of Drayton's wrong-doing when he first apprehended him, yet he offered none of this evidence at Drayton's trial, when that evidence could have avoided all of the trouble to come. His willingness to strip Drayton of his power (frustrated by Drayton's unicorn spell) seems at odds with his later discussion of the difficulties in getting permission to do that very thing. And for me, the strong sensual element of the attraction between unicorn and virgin drowned out much of what I look for in a romance--an attraction between two humans.Don't get me wrong--STOLEN MAGIC is an enjoyable story. It just fell a bit short of what I expect from this talented writer."},{"Title":"Stolen Magic","review":"IN 1748 England, the Guardian Council Chief Enforcer of the use of magic, Earl Simon Malmain travels to the castle of Lord Drayton to charge him with using his mage skills to abet the Jacobytes.

They had a friend, Simon, Earl of Falconer, who is a very powerful mage and an enforcer for the Guardian Council. He had some tough things to do in that book. This story is continuing where Simon had discovered during the Jacobite rebellion that some rogue mage was \\"helping\\" BOTH sides stirring up the unrest and increasing loss of life.That mage is Lord Drayton. Guardians are humans with special powers and responsibilities and they take an oath to not interfere in the \\"mundane\\" world (non magical). Lord Drayton has violated that so Simon Malmain is going to confront him and possibly strip him of his powers. Simon knows of Lord Drayton as they are both members of the Royal Society, a society of mathematicians, inventors. Simon knows that Lord Drayton has only moderate power so he believes he can handle him alone. However, Lord Drayton is expecting him and has laid a trap with his power enhanced by a woman he holds in thrall.Simon turns into a unicorn and is about to be killed by Drayton but manages to escape aided by a servant, Meg. Meg seems rather slow to the other people in the castle and very homely. Lord Drayton tries to use Meg who is a virgin to trap Simon in his unicorn form so he can kill the unicorn and have its horn which possesses a great deal of magical and healing power. Meg is an animal lover and seems to be able to mind-talk animals. Simon is drawn to her as unicorns are attracted to virgins. She sees the trap and runs with him riding on his back. When they are far enough away, she sees he is bleeding from a wound and tries to stem the bleeding with her hand that has a cut in it. When her blood and his mix, Simon is returned to human form, albeit naked. They go to a nearby home of Lady Bethany Fox, also introduced in the previous book, who is on the Guardian Council. Simon also discovers that Meg is a beautiful young woman who was bespelled by Lord Drayton for ten years. He is only able to tie off the magical cord that Drayton has on Meg but is able to remove the spell that changed her appearance and blocked much of her mind. Meg cannot remember her past however, that is still blocked. Lady Bethany gives them aid and suggests they marry to stay together in case Simon turns back into a unicorn. They are both against marriage for different reasons but do agree to pretend they are married so they can go to London and find a way to stop Lord Drayton.Ms. Putney has advanced the start of the Industrial age a bit for purposes of the plot line but it works well nevertheless. The secondary characters such as Sarah and David White and some of the other Council members such as Lord Sterling and also the others Lord Drayton holds in thrall are nicely developed and make the story interesting.The romance is also well done especially since they must remain chaste so that Meg can help Simon when he loses his temper and turns back into a unicorn!A fun and lush romantic fantasy!"},{"Title":"Stolen Magic","review":"Plot:Simon sensed/knew there was a a force spreadig chaos during the Jacobite uprising.

It had many layers, stories and surprises. Overall it was better than expected. It was great!"},{"Title":"Stolen Magic","review":"I can only re-iterate what I said for A DISTANT MAGIC! I enjoy magic/immortal romance stories and Mary Jo Putney has it all."},{"Title":"Stolen Magic","review":"What I really enjoyed about this story:One: The hero, Simon. This guy is so compassionate, strong-willed, yet understanding and giving. MJP, for the most part, does such a good job with the character of her heroes, in terms of overall balance. In fact, I find that the real display of deep romantic emotion as well as passion comes from her heroes. The problem is, the heroine usually dumps so much cold water on the romance that readers are quick to say that the story doesn't have any.Two: The unicorn-virgin angle. I really liked this. I expected him to change into something typical like a werewolf, and I so liked the fact that he didn't. And the unicorn's reaction to a virgin, though over the top, is great. I commend the writer for not being afraid to create a combination like this.Three: The concept of stolen magic and how it is done was interesting to me and the primary reason why I finished the story. I liked all the information and details the writer provided and the way she integrated them into her fiction.But there were things I just could not abide:One: The way that the author wastes her hero. She makes her heroine so insistent upon showing that she can take care of herself, that there are several distinct times in which I asked, \\"Why did the writer even put Simon in this scene? Why didn't she just let Megan keep doing her heroine-thing instead of bringing Simon into the act just so Meg can show him up?Two: The pitiful sexual encounters between Simon and Megan. For example and without my going into all the details, consider this: You have two people who are seriously-magically-emotionally-and-mentally bound up with each other. You have a scene where Simon is sexual aroused enough to make them both burst into flames. In response, Megan makes some weak, unperturbed statement like, \\"Your valet is going to be upset that you've ruined another set of clothing, and you're so \`ready' now that it won't take much.\\" And believe me, it did not even take the author one full sentence to tell--not show--how Megan administered the little that she had decided Simon needed. The scene was pathetic. It should have been left out all together. One exchange after another was all talk, talk, and more talk about how much they wanted each other, followed by one glass of cold water after another thrown on every little spark of passion. Finally, any time they even hinted at sex, I just thought, \\"Yeah, right.\\" I gave this book two stars because I liked Simon so much in Kiss of Fate. In this story, Stolen Magic, he is always having to feel embarrassed and to apologize. There is no way that much man should have to apologize all the time!Three: There was too much practical magic. If you're in a place where magic is the way of things for everyone, you expect even the simplest things to take place with the wave of a wand or the sending of a thought, but in this setting with this select group of magicians coupled with the need for countless references to all the magic required to train initiates, the endless, commonplace magical acts simply grate on the nerves. Also, the transformation of Simon in the final part of the book should have been a joint effort instead of all the ability to do so resting with Megan. Sometimes this author goes too far in making her women's ability surpass that of the men, and she forgets this is supposed to be a romance involving the strengths of both partners.Most of the secondary characters were interesting, and I genuinely disliked the villain, no matter how much depth his character did or did not have.I finished this story because I wanted to see the idea of the stolen magic to its completion. The ending was exciting and dramatic and confusing, with so many actions triggering counteractions that did not follow any rational explanation. So, if you decide to go ahead and read it and care to share your insight on the events in the final chapter before the Epilogue, feel free to do so.As for my next romance book, I've heard that Kleypas's Lady Sophia's Lover has too many sex scenes. I prefer audiobooks. I've heard a sample of this one, and I like the reader's voice. I can only hope the book lives up to its notoriety because neither passion, romance nor sex were the operative words in Stolen Magic."},{"Title":"Stolen Magic","review":"This is my first Mary Jo Putney book.

For ten years, Meg has been locked in thrall to Drayton, with no memory. Now, she is free, and Simon wants to see the girl come into her own for Meg could be the most powerful Guardian ever. Yet, despite their freedom, mental chains still bind Meg to Drayton, threatening to pull her into the darkness again, and one moment of anger could turn Simon back into a beast. Though Meg can free him, and he can free her, since the spells might reactivate at any moment, they are forced into a marriage. This wouldn't be terrible if the key to Meg's power to help Simon didn't lie in her virginity. Until Drayton is stopped, neither can be free and the love they have begun to feel is something to be held at arm's length.***** Very few books that are different ever come along these days. This one is one of the very few, and is easily Ms. Putney's best book to date. For many reasons, Simon is a most unusual hero, a true white knight in direct contrast to Drayton, one of the most evil villains ever created. The way the author manages to emphasize the value of chastity, yet retain a sensual quality to the book is another mark of distinction that others would do well to copy. *****Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer."},{"Title":"Stolen Magic","review":"I read Mary Jo Putney's novels during my Regency period 20 or so years ago. I'm now into fantasy and noticed this title. This was really a disappointment. I almost stopped reading halfway through it was so bad, but I wanted to know in how she wrapped it up. I didn't read the first book in the series since the reviews were not as good as this one. I certainly won't now.The problem seems to be that Ms. Putney is just doing it for the money and not from a writer's perspective of weaving story lines and characters together. The plot lines seemed contrived and just thrown in. I laughed out loud (not in a good way) at the unicorn and virgin. There were also discrepancies. Her heroine was strong and learning new skills until each time she ran into the bad guy when she seemed to regress. It wasn't very logical.The author would also throw in random bits of history as if to make the book more worthwhile. It didn't work."},{"Title":"Stolen Magic","review":"I have not enjoyed Putney's magic series as much as I have liked her other books, but she is just about the best romance author there is, so even these I have liked. Stolen Magic is full of adventure and it is a fun read."},{"Title":"Stolen Magic","review":"I truly love this book. It takes you to a place that is simply wonderful."},{"Title":"Stolen Magic","review":"I love all of Putney's novels - especially her early books set in the Regency era. This one is a paranormal and I loved the twists in the book. It continues the Guardian series that began with A Kiss of Fate, which is another great book. This novel was named a Top Ten Romance of the year - honored by the American Library Association. If you like romantic fantasy, unicorns, a strong heroine, and magic, you should give this book a try. I loved it!"},{"Title":"Stolen Magic","review":"Yes, the novel is fast-paced, but (in my opinion) at the expense of character development. The book seemed rushed. I found the characters flat, and their dialogue often weirdly abrupt in a way that interrupted the flow of the story. I also felt that the characters had too much power, mastered their \\"magic\\" way too easily, many times conveniently discovering new powers when in a tight situation.On the other hand, as many of the concepts were interesting and well thought out. There were a few different twists from the usual alternative histories/fantasies I've read. For that alone, the book is worth reading. And if you're tired of bog-standard sex scenes, you will definitely appreciate the way sex was handled in this story. :)- Rue"},{"Title":"Stolen Magic","review":"I have read Ms. Putney's books in the past with a mix feeling so I wasn't sure what to expect when I started reading this book. I thought the idea was unique and refreshing but there were a few things that kept me from enjoying this book fully.First, the author paid too much attention to the explanation of guardian rules, how the magic must be used, etc..etc.. I had to skipped pages and pages of these sections bcs it's downright boring!Second, I thought the reason why Simon went to confront Drayton in the opening chapter was due to the overwhelming evidence he has gathered against Drayton? Yet when he finally got his chance to appear in front of the guardian meeting he only presented his accusations without his so-called evidence? That's so lame..!Third, I couldn't warm up to both Simon and Meg. I'm still not sure why.. They just didn't appeal to me as hero/heroine.Anyway.. I don't think I'll be picking up anymore of this series."},{"Title":"Mutant, Texas: Tales Of Sheriff Ida Red","review":"I like Ida because she is fun and is a good role model for girls.

It makes me also think I am a hero too."},{"Title":"Mutant, Texas: Tales Of Sheriff Ida Red","review":"This is the first compilation of Paul Dini's MUTANT, TEXAS comic stories. The star is Ida Red, a winsome yet spunky orphaned Texas gal who discovers amazing powers lurking just beneath her supposedly \\"normal\\" exterior. J. Bone's artwork has the timeless look of classic cartoons and the amusing supporting cast of talking armadillos, comical Texas politicians and villainous coyotes make this series a winner. I can't wait for more!"},{"Title":"Mutant, Texas: Tales Of Sheriff Ida Red","review":"The creative genius behind BATMAN THE ANIMATED SERIES, JINGLE BELLE and writer of the current hit ABC series LOST delivers his most imaginative work to date. Set in a marvelous, mystical corner of the southwest, MUTANT, TEXAS chronicles the adventures of Ida Red, a young cowgirl blessed with amazing powers. When her humanlike animal and plant friends are kidnapped and sold as freaks, it's up to Ida to assume the role of Sheriff and track down the villain varmints. Think Buck Rogers meets Roy Rogers with a big helping of Dale Evans thrown in, too. J. Bone's illustrations perfectly match the wit and whimsy in Dini's script. Bone's Ida Red is the consumate cowgirl, brave and strong of course, but playful and prone to the occassional moments of doubt that every young heroine must (and does) overcome. The chapter where Ida faces down an angry jaguar and tames it like a bucking bronco is a tall tales scene that would do old Pecos Bill proud. MUTANT, TEXAS is a delight for all ages. Kids will love Ida and her talking animal friends (Rolly the armadillo in particular is a hoot) and adults will enjoy the sly humor found in Dini and Bone's western wonderland."},{"Title":"Fallen: Confessions of a Disbarred Lawyer","review":"Did you ever see the Abel Ferrara movie \\"Bad Lieutenant,\\" with Harvey Keitel? It's about a NY cop on the edge of annihilating himself, whose behavior and character have so deteriorated that it is unclear that redemption is even possible.One might well call this book, which purports to be an anonymous memoir, \\"Bad Attorney.\\" Only it's not fiction, and at the end of the book no gesture of redemption seems forthcoming.But it's a mesmerizing read. The author begins his tale by describing a single lawsuit over a fall from a horse in which he was never able to bring himself to file the papers necessary to go to court. He goes on from there to recount in affecting detail his grossly incompetent lawpractice, his systematic deceit of clients, the day-trading habit that he embezzled money from clients in order to support, and his eventual disbarment.Woven into this narrative of self-destruction, too, is the author's infidelity to his wife, the dissolution of two marriages (the second to a woman twenty years his junior), his brushes with various characters who wish him harm, and his attempts to make a living first selling cars and then as a pop-up advertiser and salesman for \\"work-at-home\\" scams. The tone of the narrative is neither apologetic nor proud; if anything, it tends toward shell-shocked. Read it as a cautionary tale about procrastination, or as a warning to take extreme care when picking out your next lawyer."},{"Title":"A Survival Guide for Truck Drivers: Tips From the Trenches (Medium/Heavy Duty Truck)","review":"After reading this book (and surviving 29 years in the trucking industry) I am greatly inclined to agree with Mr. Pendergast's points of view. Too much is wasted on trying to fit in with a lifestyle that needs to change, not \\"be adjusted\\" to. Sweatshops on Wheels was the definitive book on the current \\"race to the bottom\\" of the trucking industry. Want poor wages (when you add up your TOTAL time put in) and NO life ? No real health benefeits or pension (if your non-union) ? Then by all means come join us in the trucking industry and completely throw your life away.

This book is several hundred pages long with tiny print, and so packed with information, that you'll know everything possible about Anglo-Saxon history. Stenton always prefers the probable to the outrageous and does not seem to go with the popular opinions about kings, queens, or events. You must read this, but only if you're really, really interested in the subject. Otherwise, it'll go right over your head."},{"Title":"Anglo-Saxon England (The Oxford history of England)","review":"Sir Stenton has composed a masterpiece of a history text in his most famous book. A caveat, however, in that the text itself was written by someone who was a professional historian. As such, the text is as dry as you would expect. It is, perhaps, the most comprehensive text on the subject available to the open market, but while it is very name, date, and place intensive, there is little in the way of anecdotal information that might interest the merely casual reader. For someone who is interest in more an introduction than an indepth analysis, I would recommend The Anglo-Saxons, edited by James Campbell."},{"Title":"Anglo-Saxon England (The Oxford history of England)","review":"This book is the single best source of information about Anglo-Saxon England. I would only caution that this books is not for the novice historian. Unfamiliarity with the topic will leave you wondering what your reading and completely lost."},{"Title":"Anglo-Saxon England (The Oxford history of England)","review":"From the research I have done, this is THE book on the Anglo-Saxons. I have read 18 other books on the Anlgo-Saxons and this book by F. M. Stenton is from which they all derive. They would reference their debt to Stenton in their introductions and declare that their work merely a repackaging, or an extending of this book. This book contains the most knowledge about the Anglo-Saxons, and no other author has yet to approach it's breadth. This is the most complete singular source on the Anglo-Saxons you will find, and does an excellent job incorporating textual and place-name evidence into the narrative. If you are looking for recent impacts of Archaeology on the topic, Stenton did not use them to great extent, and you will have to look elsewhere, specifically in some of the more recent books. All in all, if you want to start reading about Anglo-Saxon history and do not want just a mere survey, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Anglo-Saxon England (The Oxford history of England)","review":"A fascinating read, which takes the reader right through, from the migration period, to the 11th Century. Overall, an excellent book!"},{"Title":"Anglo-Saxon England (The Oxford history of England)","review":"This work is one of the most important studies ever written on this topic. In painstaking detail, Sir Stenton addresses the development and structure of Anglo-Saxon society, political structure, economic structure, religious structure, relationship with the continent, etc. The book is quite readable and packed with information.As others have noted, this is not the best book to start out with however. In particular the lack of maps can make it hard to follow especially if you can't tell Mercia from East Anglia. The book presupposes a reasonable understanding of English geography and political boundaries during the Anglo-Saxon period, so other books are necessary to fill that gap.On the other hand there is simply no other work written which does as good a job in providing a detailed, comprehensive picture of Anglo-Saxon England as this one. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Anglo-Saxon England (The Oxford history of England)","review":"Eighteen chapters and an epilogue that run through almost 700 dense pages and covers all aspects and vicissitudes relating to Anglo-Saxon England. Covering in one single historical frame, and a linear storytelling, all the historic regions of England and their connections with the Continent from the end of the Roman times to the end of William the Conqueror's reign. Encyclopedic in scope, Homeric for its breadth of characters. Masterful all in all. Not for the general reader, but not exclusively for the scholar either. A classic since 1943, its first publication. Demanding, of course, but rewarding in proportion to the care and interest deposited in its reading. I myself skipped many passages that were not of my own interest, which didn't prevent me form picking up the story later on, safely, without feeling historically stranded. The index of contents plays in this book a life saving role, due to the density of each chapter, which flows uninterrupted throughout.The effort that such an enterprise entails, the mastery in the telling and the knowledge of the subject matter demonstrated, must ensure that this book continues to be a classic for generations. However, I am giving it 4 stars, and not 5, because I believe this should have been not one book, but several, dealing with the different topics separately. Despite the talent of the writer, it is still too heavy a book to swallow."},{"Title":"Anglo-Saxon England (The Oxford history of England)","review":"As everyone else says, this is a person, place, date, event intensive survey of Anglo-Saxon England. What is missing is some sense of what made Anglo-Saxon culture different from the pre-existing British-Roman culture in England and different from the Frankish culture that was emerging at the same time on the continent. It is clear from the events that the Anglo-Saxons had a lot in common with the Franks, Danes and North Germans and almost nothing in common with the British but why this might have been is simply not explored in this book.I found it helpful to imagine the individual Anglos-Saxon movers and shakers before Alfred the Great who are and chronicled in this book as the kind of people described by Sam Newton in \\"The Origins of Beowulf\\" and by JRR Tolkien in \\"Finn and Hengest\\". Newton's \\"The Origins of Beowulf\\" is very readable; Tolkien's \\"Finn and Hengest\\" is not so readable but it is rewarding.If you think you might be interested in the Anglo-Saxons, begin with \\"The Origins of Beowulf.\\" If you want to know more about these late Migration Period North Germans, Danes and Geats, and especially if you are interested in Anglo-Saxon as a possible North and Baltic Sea lingua franca, then go to \\"Finn and Hengest.\\""},{"Title":"Anglo-Saxon England (The Oxford history of England)","review":"Not a popular history.

Its very, very detailed, the nights at spahn's ranch and barker's ranch- you get the feeling of actually being there. Paul recalls alot of the experiences which we are all so curious about. what you have to keep in mind is that this is only HIS drug influenced perspective and not necessarily the facts as they were in reality. When he starts talking about helter skelter and hiding out in fear of the race war - this was actually when charlie had shot -in self defense-who he thought was a black panther member (crowe)..it was over tex watson ripping the guy off. Only a few of the family members were aware of the shooting of crowe (who actually lived although manson didnt find this out till much later). So when charlie was in fear of retaliation from the panthers, the \\"family\\" was hiding out but not knowing the REAL reason why, they were under the 'helter skelter' idea which was just \\"tripping talk\\" among all of them and NOT some race war plan that charlie was trying to execute. Thats a bunch of junk the prosecutor was pushing. Watkins doesnt even mention the shooting of crowe, telling me he wasnt even aware.l suggest reading 'manson in his own words', there is a line throughout the book which gives a clearer image of manson.

Imaging modalities have exponentially increased since the last Stedman's Radiology word reference [1995], and with it, the imaging vernacular has exploded. This third edition has accomplished its mission.Many more diagnostic and interventional terms are at hand, as well as mammographic, CT, MRI, nuclear medicine, ultrasonographic and neuroradiological terms. All, of course, are thoroughly cross-referenced.Additionally, five handy appendices are added: 1) 19 pages of anatomical illustrations, the first 5 pages of which demonstrate anatomical planes/positions, 2) 4 pages of various contrast media, 3) common radiological oncologic terms, 4) sample radiology reports [14, mind you] ranging from the simplest to nuclear medicine/MRI/CT, etc., and 5) common terms of procedures.This nearly 1000-page imaging tome is the tops!

A classic of science (and mathematical) fiction!"},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"Flatland is Edwin A. Abbott's depiction of A. Square's (the story's narrator) odyssey though the spaces of many dimensions. It was written in Victorian England and is a very stylized piece. The book is divided into two parts. In Part I of the book Abbott describes Flatland and particularly its social structure in a satirical nature (akin to Animal Farm). Part II of the book is where the more mathematical and geometrical concepts are expounded upon. This section of the book is also written in the spirit of Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland. A. Square (analogous to Alice) ventures back and forth through Pointland (no dimensions), Lineland (one dimension), Flatland (two dimensions), and Spaceland (three dimensions). A. Square even eventually speculates the appearance of the inhabitants of a land composed of four dimensions! Flatland will appeal to both mathematicians and lay people alike. If you are curious about dimensionality and the world in which we live, and would like to see it presented in a playful and charismatic manner, then Flatland is the book for you. Although initially taken at face value, Flatland is very deep and fully of many hidden mathematical and satirical jokes waiting to be discovered by its readers (again similar to Alice in Wonderland). Furthermore, Abbott's style tends to be very wordy. To that end, his sentences are jammed packed with ideas. These final two aspects of the book may deem a reread useful. Nonetheless, Abbott blesses us with phrases such as &quot;dimensionable Dimensionality,&quot; &quot;Thoughtland,&quot; &quot;Spacious Space,&quot; and perfect perfection.&quot; Brilliant! I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"I'm still not sure to this day if Abbott's geometry students grappled how fantastic a book it was that their teacher had written for them. First off, my geometry skills improved two-fold after reading this. Second of all, the book was a masterful satire of the times society. Women being regarded as witless beings, and soldiers portrayed as violent louts. Finally, it practically started the entire religion of modern illuminism. First, Abbott shows that even he who is regarded as the wisest in the land can be ignorant, and some &quot;priests&quot;, or government officials, may not tell all of the facts. Lower planes may be ignorant, but with the help of a being in the higher dimension anyone can be guided. Further more, it suggests that there are limitless multitudes of higher dimensions."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"First of all, the book does appear sexist by today's standards.

The book fascinated me, and I went on (probably not because of it, but certainly in appreciation of it) to study Mathematics at University. I even sometimes bring it up in my consulting engagements as a way to explain how different types think of their world and learn.

Author, Edwin Abbott, was an educator, theologian, and mathematician who lived and wrote during the Victorian Age with all its narrow-minded weirdness. That might seem sufficient reason to run, not walk, away from purchasing this book. Two reasons though to buy and read it: Best reason first, it is thought-provoking and requires the reader to imagine a --perhaps-- different realm and mode of existence. Second, the message is relevant even now when Western societies, as a whole, rarely question the critical social importance of quality, universal education.How easy is it though to let our thinking become just as two-dimensional when we are contending with an intransigent \\"other\\" or seemingly immutable status quo?Flatland is an engaging read that is short enough, and rich enough, to warrant rereading.

It takes a very elementary view point on mathematical dimensions. Through its simplicity it makes the sometimes complicated topic of understanding the implications of multi dimensional objects in relation to each other. Latter in educational life understanding the functions of higher dimensional objects becomes very important especially if you ever plan on getting into the quantum aspects of math. Some of the most useful equations used in finding new fundamental elements are based around 11 dimensional objects at least in the derivative. This book doesn't get into all of that but it forms a basic understanding on 1 dimensional objects up through 3 dimensional ones, it even alludes to 4 dimensional ones. The simplicity with which this book lays out the limited interactions of 1-3 dimensional objects is truly aw inspiring and I feel that I could have gleaned a deeper understanding about geometry with 1 month in jr high and this book than I have in 10 years working dry equations out of book after book that just assumes understanding through math and never gives any prospective.If you're a science or math buff or just want easy good grades through high school and college then you have to check out this book or at least read it to your kids a few nights for story time.

To a certain extent I was judging the device more than the story, but the salient criticism here concerns the illustrations. If you don't have a pretty good topographical idea of what's being discussed here, you're likely to be left behind by the referenced but non-existent illustrations.

If you are familiar with basic mathematics and geometry (eg: you know what two and three dimensions mean), and want to experience life in other dimensions, than Flatland is a 'must read' novel.The story is narrated by a Flatland citizen, who has become 'enlightened' of the third dimension (our dimension), and is trying to explain to the readers (us), how Flatland works.The first part of Flatland is written in a somewhat descriptive manner. The narrator discusses how Flatland works, what their society is like, what sort of laws there are, etc. The narrator describes everything--from the way that Flatland maps are drawn to the complex classes and statuses of various Flatland citizens. I found this part of the book to be extremely interesting and thoughtful, and I found it fun to read through and imagine.The second part of the book discusses the enlightenment of the narrator--or how he came to understand the third dimension (us). This is especially interesting (I won't spoil it), as it contains extremely visual descriptions of how one might peer from dimension to dimension, and is very humorous.Overall, Flatland is an incredible book. It is not only very well written, but I found it to be very imaginative and enthralling. I frequently found myself engulfed in a two dimensional world while reading the book, and the narrator's tone and wording seemed a perfect match to describe the Flatland world and draw me into it. Furthermore, the book is not math heavy, and was easy to read. There is also another level of meaning and importance behind the mathematical and dimensional storyline--which is of course a reflection on our society and law. The book did an amazing job of discussing several very complex topics in a simple and intuitive manner.The mathematical concepts displayed in the book are very elementary, but I would suggest that readers have taken at least a simple geometry course before reading the book, as it will be much easier to understand.If you're interested in imaginative and exciting books, you need to read Flatland."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"Story a bit confusing at times but once understud the position of each shape,duty and dimension they represent; things starts to shape up opening a fresh way of thinking and interact.

But its short so whatever. It seemed like it took forever to arrive though."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"Flatland, the masterpiece of nineteenth century cleric and wit Edwin A. Abbott, is an initially slow-going and slightly abstract but also witty and memorable classic of speculative fiction. It can be extremely difficult to put yourself into the 2D POV introduced in this story, but it ultimately pays off when the revelation of a third geometrical dimension comes near the end. The ultimate testament to this story's power is that, while identifying with this 2D world, I was similarly amazed and astounded by this revelation, and I now look around my 3D world with new eyes. How fortunate I am to be living in a world of three dimensions, with all that implies! And through short ventures to lineland and pointland we become all the more aware of the true limitations of our understanding that is imposed on us by the nature of the universe we inhabit.Flatland is a story literally bursting at the seams with ideas. The fascinating concepts relating to the philosophy of physics, dimensional mathematics, and epistemology would be surprise enough in such a short and imminently readable tale. But it is also famous for its clever social satire, much of which still carries over today, if not as forcefully (this was specifically poking fun at the social mores of Victorian England, after all).Abbott does a good job of giving these creatures a life of their own, though, apart from the ideological and intellectual concerns. We learn about their history, their culture, and get a sense of what it would be like to have grown up this world.Finally, if you are religious this book will give you an interesting new perspective on the supernatural.What ultimately makes this succeed is that it would be so easy to make this material dry and inaccessible. But this is FUN and absolutely joyous, and is filled with a love of the curiosity and openness to life which characterize the spirit of youth. Flatland succeeds on all counts and I'd recommend unconditionally to anyone who has any sense of curiosity whatsoever or even just enjoys a good story.I suppose I should comment on this edition of the book. It is absolutely Spartan: the story and nothing else. Like all Dover publications, the binding is good, and this is the full and original version of Flatland. So there are no extras, but it costs 2$, which is a pretty good deal for this little story."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"Intriguing. I don't know why I enjoyed this book - I really don't. Does give me a wholly new way to think about the phrase \\"I feel you, man!\\" LOL!I do wish that I hadn't read the introductory material first. Perhaps, then, I wouldn't have been evaluating each and every word for the social commentary that the introductory material said was one of the primary reasons that Abbott wrote the book.Of course, the real theme of the book, which isn't subtle at all, is the risk of assuming the world is as \\"you\\" see it and that governments tend to reinforce that collective viewpoint. Perhaps in the day it was written the very concept of dimensions beyond the three that we can \\"see\\" was an explosive issue. If so, that must have been detonated only in a select circle (snark). I can't \\"see\\" that this would have been typical drawing-room conversation.I thought Square's commentary on Flatland's social classes - even the almost malicious view of women - was very funny but, I have to admit, I did tend to get distracted with pragmatic questions such as \\"how does a square \\"sit\\"?\\" Square would hit me, just as this distraction started, with phrases such as \\"the reader would be bored if I went into detail about how we in Flatland sit.\\" LOL!As I said, I don't know why I enjoyed the book but I did and will go onto the supposed sequels - \\"Sphereland\\" and others - to see if those authors' efforts intrigue me as well.DL"},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"I heard about this book in a chemistry course I took in college I think it was. Several years later I had the chance to read it. I am very glad that I did.Not only does this book give a reader a new perspective in looking at space and maybe even time, but might also be extended to give a new perspective on almost anything. It may show us that at least in many cases, it is how you look at something that can determine what you see.In any case, the book helps readers get an intuitive idea of what 4 (or maybe more as well) spacial dimensions mean. That is not as easy a thing as you might think. Give it a try before you read the book and see. I think that I got at least a glimpse as I neared the end of the book.The author used a method of showing how worlds with fewer than three spacial dimensions might operate, and how a higher dimension being would be perceived by them and vice versa. This concept was used in many respects in Rucker's more recent book SPACELAND - also worth a read if the subject interests you.I have read that Flatland was also originally meant to provide some social commentary, but this may be in large part lost on us today as times have changed I guess. Or maybe not?The book is short and not that mathematically challenging if at all.

One day he discovers that another dimension exists and it changes his life. This 19th century classic is not only an explanation of dimensions, but it is also a social commentary on Victorian England. I was disappointed in this story. I was looking forward to an interesting look at geometry and dimensions, but mostly I was bored, especially with the first half of the book. I had to repeatedly remind myself that it was social commentary and that the horrible description of women may have been commentary and not the author's real feelings.

Flatland, by Edwin Abbott was absolutely horrible. This man should have been locked up when the book was written in 1895 or '96 (whenever it was written). I had to read Flatland for my Geometry class and let me tell you, just by reading the description online sent me into a fury. I had no interest in reading about a two-dimensional world with shapes that move about in a society based on how many sides they have. But I did try to keep an open mind - but that (as you can see) didn't work. You have to be truly TRULY interested in that sci fi dimension hogwash to completely understand and fully enjoy this book. Maybe I disliked it so because I had to read it over my 90 days of summer vacation as well as 4 other non intersting and unentertaining &quot;books of literature&quot; (I think summer reading really makes students dislike reading even more). I personally enjoy reading the newspapaer, National Geographic magazines, and some books that may grab my attention at BARNES AND NOBLE (just for those who believe me to be some hot headed teenager who dislikes a good book).

It is perhaps the most utterly boring and fanatical piece of fiction I have ever read. Not only is the book completely devoid of plot, it is lacking in all aspects of what a true work of fiction should include.This book has not educated me further on geometric concepts, nor has it enlightened me of any time period of which this book is said to be mirroring. Instead, it has wasted my time, which is precious to me now, and has completely confused me. Do not purchase this book. Do not assign it as required reading and most definitely do not read it for pleasure. There are other 80 page books that you can spend your time on.Read anything else before you read Flatland."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"Worst book ever written.

This book helped me remember I need to be more empathic to others when they are limited in thier perception. And for me to never stop dreaming."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"This book was written in an attempt to prepare the minds of the Victorians to the concept of a fourth dimension, as a side story it is a commentary on the sexist and stratified society in which the clergyman, mathematician and head master Mr. Abbott found himself in. Abbott draws our attention to the lowly status of the \\"irregulars\\", triangles and in particular female \\"lines\\" not because he agrees with their plight but to highlight the inequity and absurdity that the majority can be lorded over by the minority. But I digress. The main story is about enlightening a people accustomed to 2 or 3 dimensions to the prospect of 3 or 4 dimensions respectively. I only gave it three stars as I dislike the first half of the book in that it doesn't have a coherent story - rather a series of chapters each on a different area of 2D society. A story is developed in the second half of the book and this is where it really picked up for me. While I would have liked to know how lines \\"give birth\\" to polygons I understand that this is a minor technicality and the concept is still sound without that detail being included.A note to teachers: Don't set this as required reading, your students won't like it, they already know all about the 3D world and the 4D concept isn't alien to them like it was to the Victorian society it was written for. Instead read them Planiverse by A.K. Dewdney it will blow their minds."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"This is one of my favorite books of all time.

This book is written from the perspective of a 2 dimensional being. His world consists of length and width only. The first half of this book is the main character describing every aspect of this two dimensional world. The second half is where it gets interesting. Our 2 dimensional main character interacts with a 3 dimensional being and a 1 dimensional being and describes how these interactions might take place. All this sets the stage for the 3 dimensional reader to ponder the experience of the 4th dimension and what 4 dimensional beings might be like."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"The justly famous Flatland by Abbott stands out for several reasons1. Its old Victorian style writing which is written from the somewhat &quot;distant observer&quot; viewpoint with the accompanying Englishness to go with it. It is full of social mores of the time (1884) such as the role of women in society or the very specific roles of the &quot;lower classes&quot; and those of the higher levels of society. Included also in this is the social graces themselves where his &quot;feeling&quot; inserted into the book as a means of differentiating various shapes is really a metaphor for the almost repugnant consequences of a meeting between a peasant and a member of the Aristocracy. As such the book is a superb example of he Victorian Age.2. Another aspect, maybe not so much mentioned, is the fact that the book presents a fine example of the fact that people are trapped by their own culture/upbringing, this time dealt with through the idea of a 2 dimensional being not being able to comprehend 3 dimensions. Apart from the fact that the mind is not able to get around the concept of dimensions higher than the usual 3 I believe the book was intended maybe even accidently to support the idea of a prison of your own culture. However Abbott goes on to show that people are infinitely adaptable and there are ways to meet these seemingly insurmountable challenges. Again a path breaking book when looked at from this angle, who before Abbott would have considered such a view.3. Finally the book presents many wonderful examples of the illumination of strange concepts not even considered in ordinary life through the vessel of the trek of the square who attempts to grasp his new world with the aid of a sphere.A wonderful little book containing hitherto unexpected insights."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"I bought this book on a whim because it was so cheap, and I rather enjoyed it, despite it being a very short book. At the minute, it is circulating among my friends.The first part deals with the social structure and mores of the flatland society. I've heard that it's a critique of the way life was set up when the book was written, but I can't confirm that. It describes a world where women are seen as worthless nobodies who are dangerous without really noticing, and where people are judged and placed in social classes based merely on their appearance (more specifically, how many sides they have).The second part is why you should buy this book. It is the tale of what happens when one of the members of this two-dimensional society is taken and shown how life is lived in worlds of one, zero, and three dimensions. It is this part of the book which is absolutely fascinating, and convinced me that I will never be able to envision a fourth spatial dimension.I highly recommend this book as a singular novelty, and a very good read."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"Flatland was interesting, bur only if you paid very close attention to every part. I dislike the fact that it was never translated to new English."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"This book is in a way very prescient: its portrayal of the Flatlanders foreshadows the atrocities, oppression and victimisation that would characterise despotic regimes such as the Nazis and Soviet Russia that were yet to come. For example, women in Flatland are considered lower than the lowliest in the social hierarchy. They are \\"consequently\\" assumed to be devoid of brainpower. (Some critics have viewed Abbott's portrayal of women as misogynistic. But Abbott repudiated this saying that his work was a warts-and-all picture of Victorian England.) In another sense - scarier and more dystopian, perhaps - if we view the book as reflecting events from history prior to 1884 (when it was first published), it is as if the story reflects an atavistic propensity of the human species for oppression and self-destruction that has depressingly never left us.The book has been variously categorised as fantasy, science fiction or mathematical fiction. Science writer John D Barrow (in his book, \\"The Constants of Nature\\") even saw parallels between the Flatlanders' inability to comprehend the third dimension and the prevailing scepticism in some parts of Victorian society about the spiritual realm. (A creature in Pointland - a land where there is only one dimension - thinks it encompasses the entire world within itself- subject, god all rolled into one. Contemplating other dimensions is therefore a wasted exercise.) However it is viewed, this book is quite unique as it has such abundance of exquisite satire and observations that can without difficulty be applied to the nature of things today.Now to the negatives: although only 60 pages long, some may not find this book an easy read firstly because the language feels so archaic. Secondly, at least a sizeable part of it reads rather like a dry treatise on social anthropology. It does not grab the reader's imagination as and attention as much as other similar works do - such as \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" (ironically, also written by another mathematician and first published in fact a couple of decades before this one)."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"Flatland may be famous, the message may be good, but as a story it's terrible. The first half of the book (I'm not exaggerating-- it was 52%) is an infodump. Complete backstory explaining how Flatland actually works. But then, nothing actually happens in the 'story' after that anyway. The main character visits 2 other lands as the author attempts to teach us how we have to try to see things from a different perspective, or from a different angle because there might be more to the universe than we can currently see. Nice sentiment. I agree with that (it's always bugged me that scientists say life couldn't exist on Mercury, for instance, simply because nothing from Earth could survive there), but if you're going to sell/ describe something as a story, then make it interesting. Make something actually happen. Have some conflict that has us wondering what's going to happen.And for all the people saying it's a lesson in geometry... What? Just because it has some shapes in it doesn't mean it's teaching you something about geometry.I heard about this story about 10 years ago and have been wanting to read it since because it sounded interesting. That 10 year wait is the only reason I finished it-- that and an increasingly despairing hope as I read that something was going to happen. Well, something did happen... It ended, and I was grateful."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"This is Social commentary in the guise of mathematics, written by a contemporary of Dickens. It is somewhat heavy-handed, primarily because that was needed at the time to convince people that they were reading allegory and satire. Gender and class bias were so ingrained in society that violent methods were required to get the reader's attention. Still relevant today, but less likely to win converts - polarized positions cause people to reject different ideas out of hand."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"Although it isn't very long, Flatland does take a long time to read. This isn't because it is boring, or because it is hard to read, but because of the large amount of digestion one need's to fully comprehend (and to fully enjoy) this book. Even this book contains only 82 pages, it is by no means light reading. The book was originally released in 1884 under Abbott's pseudonym A Square. In the story we follow the journey of a square who lives in a land of two dimensions--a flat land. In it class, and ultimately intelligence, is determined by the amount of sides that a shape has. As the amount of sides a shape has decreases, we find that it also is more emotional and apt to cause destruction through their pointed corners. Women are depicted as straight lines, but one has to take into account the time that this book was published. One can also disregard the story as having any relations to anything in our society and enjoy it for what it is, a mind bending social criticism. In this tale we follow the aforementioned square through his everyday life. we learn what it is like to exist in only two dimensions. We learn of how rain falls form the north and disappears to the south and how gravity is a minute force that pulls to the south ever so slightly. We follow him through the government and through social classes, and the discrimination that comes with them. When his son talks of geometric impossibilities such as 23 (cubed) he has a dream of a lesser land than his, a land called line land. IN it there is not two but only one dimension of being. Through discussion with the kind of lineland, we are offered insight into why our hero the square cannot conceive of the third dimension. Later our hero is visited by a great being, a sphere that appears to him seemingly out of nowhere. This confuses the square very much, and even more when the sphere tries to explain how he passed into his dimension from the third. After heated debate, the sphere takes him and shows him the third dimension, turning our hero into an evolved form of him self, a cube. Form his higher vantage point the square is able to see the innards of those who reside in flatland. He receives tutoring from the sphere about this new dimension and all that it entails. He learns of how limited the field of vision is for those living in flatland, both literally and figuratively. With his previous limits of reality stripped and with his eye opened to the truth, the square quickly follows logic and asks to see the insides of the sphere, and wishes to ascend further into greater dimensions, fourth dimensions and fifth and onward and upward. The sphere is appalled by this heresy and send our hero back to the limited realm of flatland. Here he tries to convince others to be enlightened, but cannot find success. He has a second dream involving the dimension of pointland, no dimensions. The being inhabiting this land is of nothing and knows nothing but itself, which is nothing. There fore this being cannot be disappointed by anything, because it cannot conceive of anything other than itself. We can see the religious parallels to Hinduism and Buddhism here. The completely content creature is of nothingness, much like the state that Buddhists try to achieve, and the outward ranking by dimension not sides can be seen in Hinduism in the spiral path towards God that the Hindu believe they travel along passing from one point on the spiral to another with each passing life. In this land of math all of the lands are contained within each other, much like the rings of the spiral. Finally after this dream the square realizes the futility of trying to convince others through speech, and he feels he must do it through demonstration. Folks hear of his heresy and bring him to the court for the climax of the book. Whether or not the plot of the novel itself is very entertaining, the ability to get your head around concepts that can only be experienced through the mind is challenged thoroughly by this novel. It is a must read for anyone who thinks that they are well educated, as it will quickly tell you just where you stand, theologically, philosophically and mathematically."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"Flatland is a unique and brilliant treatise on a trifurcated level. It is a sociological statement, a mathematical statement and a religious statement all rolled into an incredibly astute 82 pages. The book centers mostly on the differences between a two dimensional world and a three dimensional world; but comments on society, law, prejudice, religion, and proselytizing.The book especially points out the difficulty in envisioning a greater reality and a greater vision than is commonly observed by any individual in any dimension or society. The author's premise relates to things existing in a \\"plane geometry\\" world as opposed to a \\"Euclidian Geometric\\" three dimensional figure universe. The book carefully illustrates to one denizen of Flatland how the three dimensional world of space works and/or exists. Upon finally understanding the \\"Gospel of Three Dimensions\\" our protagonist goes on to try and apply the same arithmetic logic and geometric analogs to a fourth dimensional universe. Shouldn't there exist a fourth dimensional universe that allows an entity to look down upon the three dimensional universe with as much transparency as one can from three dimensions to two?Alas, things become different in dimensions other than the first, a world of lines, the second, a world of shapes and the third, a world of objects. In the zero dimension, all things are a point. Mathematically we know that any number raised to the \\"0\\" power equals 1 and therefore, all things in the zero dimension resolve into one single omnipotent point. This condition would also exist in the fourth dimension; as those of us in the third dimension have no model to compare it to. Envisioning a fourth dimension, even with time as the fourth dimension is truly difficult or impossible for us in the third dimension.Interspersed with this witty and intellectual dialogue are comments on society and its structure. He specifically comments multiple times of the degradation of women in society to the lowest social status. Only men are educated in Flatland. Interestingly, he paints a picture of an authoritarian society in which people are judged by their shapes and angles. This reflecting the Victorian societal values around him at the time of his writing.Flatland is recommended to all those who seek to enlighten their view of the universe and of potential universes. It is especially recommended to those seeking higher knowledge of any type. Flatland is truly a multi-dimensional experience and worth every minute."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"Flatland is THE must-read for anyone interested in getting a feel for higher dimensions. The book is extraordinarily readable and succeeds even with people that are afraid of mathematics. Abbott's charm lies in his ability to write simply and clearly about a topic that has its share of very unreachable, esoteric books. You fall into the story (whose plot is by no means secondary to the mathematical ideas), and before you know it you find yourself in contemplation of things like the fourth and fifth dimensions. The visual image that this book provides is a necessary step to envisioning and then understanding the idea of higher dimensions, even for those already versed in the mathematics of it. You never know, after you read this, you might even be willing to try your hand at things like Einstein's relativity. A little on the social aspects of the book: keep in mind that it was written in the very late 1800's. Hidden within the philosophical and mathematical ideas is a satire of the social climate of the times: how women, the military, the upper echelons of society, and just about everyone else were viewed. Flatland makes you think, and think deeply, on many different and sometimes unexpected levels."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"Warning: this is a terrible reproduction of the wonderful classic Flatland. I bought copies for college students and was very disappointed in the presentation. Very small print, poor contrast, and no decent formatting. Try to find an older printing, used if need be."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"From the square character's world of two dimensions in Flatland to the Sphere's three dimensional Spaceland, one comes to recognize the role of dimensions in geometry and in thinking in Abbott's Flatland. Both a mathematical essay and a satire the book challenges readers to discover dimensions for themselves in an unusual story. Beyond the story of the square lawyer protagonist and his adventure with the Sphere is the satire on Abbott's English society. Women are depicted as lines with the power to destroy men with there sharp, pointed ends. They are forced to remain in a constant waving motion as a courtesy to men in order to remain visible. An interesting predicament surfaces when coloring becomes a popular practice in identification. Women from certain viewpoints appear the same color as priests, much to the priests' chagrin. In sum, the women appear to have an inferior role to the multi-sided men as women faced inequality in late 19th century society. Secondly, the shapes themselves present a hierarchy of society. From the irregular figures to the noble Circles, each shape has its own ranking and occupations. Moreover, each shape is subdivided into figures that have a higher status in the Flatland world. For example, the equilateral triangle is seen as superior to any of the other isosceles triangle with top angles of less than sixty. These shapes have little hope of progressing; hope lies in their offspring which may possess a more respected number of equal sides. This can be seen as an analogy to the lower classes struggle to achieve success in the society dominated by the wealthy or aristocratic. While the story of Flatland may be a mockery of Victorian England, its heart is its mathematical meaning. It serves as an interesting and understandable window into the subject of dimensions. From Lineland, which knows no left or right directions, to the abstract Fourth Dimension, where it is possible to look inside a solid object, readers are introduced to new ways of thinking not usually encountered in math class. Most importantly, the text of the book is not beyond the scope of someone with a casual interest in the topic. Anyone can appreciate the search for the meanings of dimension and truth in easy to comprehend analogies presented by the author. Another math topic addressed is the discovery of new ideas themselves. Abbott shows that math is a field where anyone with an interest has a chance to succeed just as the main character stumbles upon the meaning of dimensions from thoughts from his grandson. He pursues his hypothesis on the dimensions of Spaceland as well as develops the ideas for the Fourth Dimension on his own. Although he is imprisoned for his thoughts and attempts to teach others, the square keeps his theories, not letting the views of society interfere with his work. It is interesting that he faces this fate when trying to educate the public about the truth of their world and beyond. On the whole, Flatland is more than just a short book with intriguing mathematical ideas. It is an opening experience to the search from the truth behind the world through the subject of dimensions. While mocking the English , the book also introduces readers an odd world of shapes and figures. Lastly, math is encouraged even though it may go against the grain of society. Any book that introduces readers to a new way of thinking is worth reading."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"Flatland is subtitled \\"A Romance of Many Dimensions.\\" I wouldn't call this book is \\"Romantic\\" in either the original or the modern sense of the term, but it certainly does include many dimensions. . .And much more. With this one little book at the centre, one can discuss a wide array of topics: literature (late 19th century British satire), history (relate the satire to Victorian society), mathematics (beyond what you get from your typical proof-laden geometry class), physics (String Theory fits nicely), art (the influence of such mathematics on artists such as Dali and Escher), theology (pythian theology: God as The Being of Infinite Dimensions), and even a little climatology (how does it rain in a two-dimensional world?).The first part of Flatland is an extensive description of life in a two-dimensional society. This is where most satirical elements can be found, but you don't have to know about British Victorian-era society to benefit by learning to viewphysical reality more perceptively. How often would you ordinarily stop to consider what the social interactions and the houses and the weather and the class structure and so forth of a two-dimensional world might be? In addition to gaining a new appreciation for planar geometry, you will learn how very fortunate you are to have the extra dimension--but what if someone other entity is thinking the same about. . .In the second part of Flatland, things really get spicy from the mathematical/physical/philosophical perspective. If you thought the preceding material was mind-expanding, just wait until A. Square travels to Sphereland, Lineland, and (my favorite) Pointland. This engages your brain in a way that no ordinary, prosaic math book can. Everything is explained in a manner that is easily understandable--but at the same time impossible to comprehend. You'll know what I mean when you try to apply the transition from Pointland to Lineland to Flatland to Sphereland to a like voyage to a fourth spatial dimension, and it seems like you should be able to do so, but you can never quite visualize the next dimension. You simply CANNOT. But, oh, what a savory intellectual treat it is to try!Flatland does not have a plot--at least not until the very end, which is the book's most enduring satirical moment. How sad that this is based in reality. (It is also much like something one might read in. . .dare I say. . .a dystopia.)If you really want an intellectual trip, contemplate temporal dimensions in a like manner. Yummy. . .. . . but Abbott poses an even greater enigma: why is it that Flatland residents with the most acute angles are the most mentally obtuse (and vice versa)??~pythia~"},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"Abbot was passionate about addressing a Christian concern that I share: differentiating mere superstition from the supernatural. Flatland was written with this in view: to make a parabolic case for the dynamic of the &quot;higher order&quot; of things and how it would thus relate to us. It is also hilarious social and spiritual satire. While often portrayed as a treatise on mathematics, the math was only the idiom. He was trying, by way of parable, to show the rationality of belief in the supernatural.The first half of the book is a set-up for the second half where the action takes place. The first time I read it (age 17) I thought it was a bit tedious till I got to the middle. But the first half must be read for the MIND BLOWING second half to make sense. When older and on second read, the first part is now my favorite. For Abbot is not just describing Flatland, he is satirically lampooning Victorian culture, priggery and prejudice. To think how this book must have made people's blood boil back then, just as it does now!As for style, Abbott has a way of constructing a phrase that is just plain delicious once you get into the flow of it. He waxes most eloquent (in the voice of the &quot;square&quot; narrator) when he is most absurd and wrong, and this--you must admit--is a little too close for comfort as well.A friend of mine called me at 4am several years after I gave him Flatland, having finally read it straight through, and said &quot;I think I now 'get' the Revelation!&quot; I hope it has a similar encouraging effect on you--either by humorous, pithy satire or spiritual insight."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"This book should be required reading for students in both mathematics and social studies. The explanations by Abbott of how three dimensional beings would appear to a two dimensional creature have never been improved upon. I have seen them reproduced in nearly every book that I have read about space with dimensions more than three. Since we cannot visualize objects in four dimensions, the best that can be done is to describe them mathematically or by using an analogy to the dimensions that we can visualize.However, the book is also a satire about the English social structure of the nineteenth century. Abbott was a champion of the rights of women, so his caricature of females must be read with that fact foremost in mind. His description of the society of Flatland is meant to be a critique of what he saw in an enormously class-conscious England with a distinct privileged class. Read with that foremost in mind, his caricatures of the inhabitants are quite amusing.This is one of the very few books that I have read over three times. It has never failed to keep my interest, containing some of the best teaching analogies ever created. I even read it when it appears paraphrased in books written to describe the principles of space with more than three dimensions. I have no doubt that this is a book that will still be interesting to people thousands of years in the future."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"I first read &quot;Flatland&quot; when I was studying mathematics as a university first-year. I have just been re-reading it.In my naivity, I first thought that Abbot was exhibiting his own prejudice against women and lower classes. I realise now that it is his very clever way of satirising his own culture - and he chose an ingenious way of doing it, by choosing a setting that was as far removed from the real world as is conceivable - the world of abstract mathematics.The culture and society of Flatland are wonderfully developed, and the very human personalities of the square, circular, linear and hexagonal characters are colourful and vivid - displaying all the passions, corruptions, and emotions of our own, three dimensional world.In addition, this book is a remarkable lesson in how higher dimensions can be conceived by beings who inhabit worlds of lower dimensions. And Abbot's eloquent and humorous writing style is a great pleasure to read."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"This classic short novel is centered about intelligent beings that live in only two dimensions. One of the inhabitants, Mr. Square, describes his world and visits a one-dimensional world. He later encounters beings from the third dimension. Mr. Square finally considers even higher dimensions. This tale by Edwin A. Abbott (1839-1926), an English clergyman and academic, has become quite popular with those physicists and mathematicians who study higher dimensions. It is also regarded as a classic in the development of speculative fiction. I really enjoyed reading it. I've had a copy on my shelf for over forty years and I have never met a Ph.D. in physics (or math for that matter) who has not read it. Any student of the development of science fiction should also have a copy."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"This book was written by a theologian, not a math professor, and it's not about geometry. The author uses geometry to create a parable that was intented to help open the mind of the reader to spiritual reality.What happens when a lowly square receives a revelation of a higher dimension of reality from a sphere, and then tells the other flat shapes what happened to him? He gets presecuted and thrown in prison. Does that sound vaguely like something that might happen in our world and has happened over and over again in history?Anyway, it seems our Westen Civilization is getting flatter all the time. Read this book, and gain some insight into our human condition, and some funny insights into the culture of Victorian England. How can you miss at this price? This book really is a classic."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"Although the decidedly Victorian language may sound a bit strange to the 21st Century ear, Abbott's approach is classic: assume a set of social rules that is driven by an alien environment. In this case, assume the constraints (and freedoms) offered by living in two dimensions. Further, imagine encounters with life in one or three dimensions. Do you mock those living in one dimension? Do you gape in awe at the three dimension world? You might read Flatland to appreciate the historical foundations of modern sci-fi. You might contemplate the themes for personal reflection. You might share it with others to sponsor interesting conversations. No matter how you use it, it's worth the read."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"I just finished reading &quot;Flatland&quot; by Edwin A. Abbott and I'm not entirely sure what to think. While this book challenges the imagination of the reader with the possibilities of any number of dimensions, I found the language of the book a bit harder to wade through. While only around 100 pages, I feel it took me a longer time to read it than a longer, modern fiction, as the language is a bit older, complete with whence, thou shalts, and so forth.However, I still think this is a worthwhile read, as the ideas are still applicable, especially with modern physics and with string theory claiming that more dimensions do indeed exist. I encourage you to pick it up if you're at all interested in mathematical curiousities and having your knowledge of 3 dimensions pulled and twisted a bit. Also, the social structure of a two-dimensional society is extremely interesting.The first part of the book describes the world of Flatland, a world restricted to two dimensions and the society contained therein. In this world, each human is a shape, and irregularity is highly condemned. Women are straight lines and the highest class of society is filled with circles, or many sided polygons. Our author is a square, who describes to us the ways of life in Flatland, from how to recognize each other (as every shape would appear as a straight line seen edge-on), to how the laws of nature grant that successive generations may gain a side, thus rising on the social ladder. Also, he tells of the history of Flatland, during the trying times of the &quot;Universal Colour Bill&quot; and the &quot;Suppression of the Chromatic Sedition.&quot;In the latter part of the book, our square friend tells us of his vision of Lineland, whose inhabitants are confined to one dimension. Sadly, he cannot convince the Lineland monarch of the existance of another dimension. The next day, however, he is visited by a sphere from Spaceland. Through much demonstration and persuasion, the Sphere finally convinces the square of the existence of a third dimension, by bringing him into it. Sadly, after the sphere departs, and the square is again restricted by Flatland, he is unable to convince his Flatland companions of this miraculous third dimension. He is sentenced to a life in prison, taunted by a knowledge of an extra spatial dimension, yet forbidden by his two-dimensional world from ever entering it again."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"Abbott's imagination is just fantastic. And I say fantastic in the most realistic sense. He has so many amazing ideas and makes everything so believable, but also makes you consider the possibility of something, some world completely beyond your conception; completely beyond your reality. It's entertaining and interesting and left me turning page after page, not putting the book down. Anyone who would like a good, interesting book should check this out. It's great for everyone because not only is it a fabulously well-written imaginitave piece of literature, it's very short. Short enough to finish in a day as I did."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"This is a book, indeed a fable, that was exquisitely designed to expand the mind. By showing how incomprehensible a three-dimensional world would be to two-dimensional entities, Abbott opens the door, and the mind, to speculation on higher dimensions. That is why the principles of this story are summarized in virtually every text dealing with the 4th dimension.I believe Abbott framed this tale primarily to serve as a philosophical and mathematical justification of spiritual and &quot;heavenly&quot; subjects. After all, if a Sphere seemed a supernatural entity in Flatland, would not a 4th Dimensional entity seem so to us? I suspect that Mr. Abbott was also a Freemason, since the &quot;regular progression of science from a point to a line, from a line to a superficies, from a superficies to a solid&quot; is the way Freemasonry explains the process by which the Deity brings the four levels of existance into being. Actually, this is a neo-platonic teaching device that can be traced through the literature of the Renaissance, via medieval Spain, to Alexandria....An examination of Theosophical Society literature from this period will also show a fascination with the 4th dimension as an explanation for spirit phenomena. Personally, I believe that this train of thought is still a quite valid analogy.I found this book a joy to read, but then, I was trained in classical Euclidian geometry and formal proofs as a boy. I understand that such training is quite extinct in most modern public schools...."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"Certainly the saving graces of this little gem are its brevity and Abbot's creativity. Much more of the descriptions of life in Flatland would have bordered on tedium. However, the explanation for the banishment of color in Flatland was very clever and one of the better parts of the story. As it is, it's a humorous, demure satire in the Swiftian vein whereby the protagonist, A. Square, teaches us about his world, has a series of adventures, and learns lessons about life (and mathematics) along the way.I question its value as a teaching tool, though. I fear the Victorian niceties employed in the exposition will seem stilted and nigh unbearable to today's younger audience, especially if assigned as schoolwork. But, I think those who already grasp the mathematics involved (basic geometry) will enjoy it. Also, A. Square's unabashed enthusiasm and thirst for knowledge are qualities one would happily encourage in students.My favorite part of the whole book has got to be the visit to the King of Pointland. The way Abbot so succinctly portrays humanity's capacity to ignore evidence that does not conform to preconceived notions, then force the facts to fit long established beliefs is a stroke of genius. In Pointland, ignorance really is bliss.This little tale definitely provided excellent entertainment for the price I paid here at Amazon. If it sounds interesting to you, I suggest putting it on your wish list, and then adding it to the next purchase you make (your wallet will barely feel it)."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"I can see this book being interesting to two types of people.First, the book is based on geometrical concepts to create a vision of Flatland. The descriptions of how to visualize different dimensions and the question of higher dimensions are simply explained. I believe someone who knows nothing about math would find the explanation satisfactory.Second, the book is a satire of Victorian society. It's important to remember that the author does not actually think women are inferior, just that he is mocking the world around him. I also found an interesting passage where the author describes how the inhabitants of the southern latitudes (e.g., Africa) are savages because their air inhibits the ability to distinguish shapes. This compares to the northern latitudes (i.e., London) where fog allows better sight. Trust me, it will make sense when you read it.This is just one of the examples of satire in the book. I thought the book was excellent and can easily be read in a few hours. Plus, it costs a buck.."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"I disagree w/last reviewer. Flatland doesn't just lampoon the 1880's. Victorian is Abbott's writing style. But his social comment is as sharp today as Gulliver, and Screwtape's. If you can't spot the irony the entire book is offensive. If you do spot it, the parallels between say - its women &amp; the current suppression in Afganistan, or education &amp; Chinease purges, or angling up &amp; US college sport programs - are hilarious and bone chilling. Abbot's guesses on equator based navigation are quite accurate. North swimming bacteria actually have a lot in common with the travelers in Flatland."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"This edition is terrible on the Kindle.

I have fond memories of reading this book as a child, but this was my first time revisiting it since then--and it was quite an experience. What I remembered best is a brillaint, unique concept, and that's still there: there's nothing else out there like Flatland, a world that appears utterly alien but is in fact too well-realized to be unfamiliar. It's ingenious, and a delight to rediscover. Yet this slim volume offers more than that idea alone. About half the book is given over to infuriating social satire, which I'd forgotten about completely. The satire isn't always obvious as such: Flatland's society has an extreme view of the misogyny, classicism, and essentialism present in our own (and particularly in Abbott's Victorian era), but the sad truth is that it's not a grand exaggeration--and it's presented so blandly that it reads more like an unfortunate relic of prejudice than any sort of social commentary. As such, I worry that the satire may go over the heads of younger readers (I can't remember if it went over mine) and would be taken at face value; regardless, it feels almost out of place--not that it doesn't have moments of keen, even painful, insight, but it is quite disparate from the fascinating physics lesson that fills the rest of the book.To wit, the other half of the book is a novel exploration of dimension, verifying and exploring the existence of four or more dimensions by exploring two and fewer. It may not render comprehensible the incomprehensible, but it's a strong argument for some sort of world greater than the one we know. Meanwhile, the dimensions explored by our narrator the square are fascinating. Abbott succeeds by taking his concept to its furthest extent: the lines and shapes have unusual societies which are greatly influenced by the nature and limitations of their worlds, surprisingly simple diagrams help the reader to enter these unusual lands himself, and Abbott often anticipates--and then answers--the questions and doubts that surround his strange ideas. He takes what seems to be a pure mathematical novelty and renders it from a dynamic, convincing first-person perspective--and while it remains just one imaginative interpretation of the issue at hand, it's a brilliant one and a great read. Abbott's voice can tend towards stilted and dated, but Flatland's combination of breadth and brevity nonetheless make it compelling. This may not be precisely the book that I remember, but it provides what I loved and remembered best: something ingenious and brilliantly realized, something intriguing and delightful and thought-provoking. I take more issue with Flatland now than I did then, but I find it fascinating above all and so recommend it despite lingering reservations."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"This novel is a short classic that was written by a school headmaster as both an educational tool as well as a criticism of victorian society.The novel follows the life of A. Square. Square is a lower middle class inhabitant of a 2 dimensional world. The polygon world and its politics are explained in the book as well. The square is visited by a 3 dimensional being (a sphere) and is taken to point land (1 dimensional) and is also taken to see the hidden inner workings of his own society.The work is a commentary not only on mathematics, but is also a commentary on British society, repression of women, repression of the lower class, slavery, euthenasia, social dominance as well as religion (the sphere can symbolize educational or spiritual enlightenment). While this may all sound boring as hell, dont be fooled, the story line is fascinating and the plot is great. Additionally, the ending is a real killer! You wont be disappointed in the ending here!Definately buy this book as it is a literary classic. The math behind it is very elementary and is easy to understand. It should be noted it had to be written this way since Abott could not come out and directly criticize the monarchy without being politically quited.Definately buy this book and read it. This is a great piece for in depth literally analysis for class as there is tons of social commentary in it. Great plot, hidden meaning, awesome ending.. you cant lose!!"},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"Flatland is a two part book, and I think a review should reflect that.The first part is the narrator explaining the workings of flatland to someone from our dimension. He goes into detail about social hierarchy and the physics on how things work. It's all very fascinating, and goes to show that the author put a lot of thought into it (and why shouldn't he have, he was a college dean). The only down side is that it is dry language, with plenty of big words that can confuse people at times.Don't get me wrong, it's totally readable, but you have to take your time.On to the second half. This part details how the narrator became knowledgeable about the workings of other dimensions by way of experience. I won't ruin it, but this part is totally engrossing, and you won't want to put it down. It's an easy read that draws you in with it's thought provoking ideas.All together, i give this 5 stars because the only thing negative about it is it's older language, which is understandable, considering it was written in the 1800's.I would recommend this to anyone interested in 4th wall breaking, or ideas and conceptions that have to do with out-of-the-box thinking.

But I want to know where the illustrations are? I admit that I am not reading this on an actual Kindle but rather Kindle For Mac. However, the locations of the illustrations are clearly marked and labeled, but there are no illustrations visible. Otherwise, the formatting of this ebook is quite good, and it is much more readable and navigable than are many of these freeby Kindle classics.The book itself is unusual. It is a geometry lesson, a Plato's Cave type philosophical treatise, and a morality tale. But beyond that, it is an early science fiction / fantasy novel. The basic premise is that a 2 dimentional character from a 2 dimensional world is confronted by someone who claims to be from a 3D world. Our protagonist doesn't understand or believe the visitor, so the visitor takes them them to a 1D world and then later to the 3D world. Upon returning to Flatland the protagonist is a changed person.

Another human then turned to her side orthogonal to the first would then appear just a line. We...turn to adornment to reveal a contrived identity, whether true or deceitful.

My teacher didn't speak English; there were all these formulas, theorems, and postulates that we had to memorize; and we spent all our time doing useless proofs. But this is getting into my high school career, and away from a review of this book.Even though I didn't enjoy geometry, I found this book fascinating. Don't be deceived by the subtitle; it's not a love story. Abbott uses the word \\"romance\\" in the sense of \\"epic.\\" I guarantee that you will stop at least once while you're reading this book to try to wrap your mind around what the fourth dimension must look like.The only criticisms I have are about the misogyny and the pacing. In Flatland, women are treated as second-class citizens, but this is not a major theme. A few times, particularly during A Square's conversation with the King of Lineland, I got bored.

But once you get used to the writing style it becomes a great tool for thinking about perception. I especially like the section on shading and how that can determine what it is you are looking at. It is a short book but it does take a little a time to get through. Overall, it is a very good book."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"The persecution of individuals is an abhorrent way of life in some lands. To be repressed simply for preaching a new view of things. To be imprisoned for your beliefs. I am thinking, at this moment, of one individual in particular who has had to suffer the humiliation of life without parole simply because he chooses to see things in a different way. Should the fact that this person is merely a square (four equal sides and corners) be any kind of an impediment towards our full understanding of him? As a recent convert to three-dimensional worlds, the author of \\"Flatland\\" (given, originally, as merely A. Square) describes his own two-dimensional existence as best as he is able. It is hoped that perhaps by publishing this petite memoir of his world and experiences he may shed new light on his predicament and perhaps even win a follower or two.The world of Flatland (as opposed to our own multi-dimensional Spaceland) is a simple one. In it, the more sides an individual has, the (supposedly) greater intelligence and influence. Therefore it stands to reason that circles (which is to say, many sided polygons) rule as priests and all hexagons, squares, triangles, etc. hope to someday ascend or let their children ascend to that most worthy class. Women, sadly, are given short shift. They appear as lines (though the narrator does concede later on that they are perhaps more accurately described as very thin Parallelograms. The narrator goes on to describes how shapes in Flatland recognize one another, what their lives are like, and even gives a bit of brief historical background regarding the great Chromatic Sedition that almost made all shapes equal under the eyes of the law and society. The square then recounts the adventures he had when, in a dream, he approached Lineland and then was visited by a sphere preaching the gospel of the Spaceland. With the discovery of a third dimension the square is given to preaching about this new place to his fellows and, for his efforts, is summarily arrested and cast into prison from whence he writes this book.\\"Flatland\\" was originally published in 1884, a fact that places some of its odder elements into (ha ha) perspective. Appended with a Preface that accompanied its second revised addition, the \\"author\\" (A. Square) responds to those critics that accuse him of classism and sexism. The square admits that years in prison may have, since the publication of the book, given him greater insight into both women AND his \\"betters\\". Just the same, it's difficult for a reader today to hear that women are \\"consequently wholly devoid of brain-power, and have neither reflection, judgement nor forethought, and hardly any memory\\" and not feel a little put out. On the other hand, we're dealing with some serious satire here, and we should treat the book accordingly. In general, it's a delight. Paving the way for such modern classics as \\"The Phantom Tollbooth\\" or even \\"A Wrinkle In Time\\" (the latter making at least one direct reference to \\"Flatland\\"), the book is a satire in the finest sense of the word. The narrator is, undoubtedly, unreliable which makes the entire book just that much more enjoyable. Author Edwin A. Abbott put an extraordinary amount of effort into this story. As is often the case with authors that slum in fiction, children's literature, or works of humor (right off the top of my head I'm thinking of Gilbert & Sullivan and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle), \\"Flatland\\" was written as a bit of fluff and ended up (whether Abbott liked it or not) as the author's best known work.Though a lovely concept, this book is perhaps best read by teens and adults rather that kids. I'm not saying that there won't be the spectacularly brainy ten year old who's a fan of both Math AND English and speeds through this book like butter. I'm just saying that such a child is in the minority and that you probably shouldn't foist a tale that contains such sentences as \\"Now, all our lines are equally and infinitesimally thick (or high, whichever you like): consequently, there is nothing in them to lead our minds to the conception of that Dimension\\". You get the picture. One fact I discovered to my own delight was that this book does not, in fact, require a firm grasp on geometry. It couldn't hurt, and I'm sure you'll get quite a lot more out of it than if you've heard of angles or circumferences, but it's not a prerequisite for enjoying this tale. As long as you've a certain amount of imagination and a will to suspend disbelief, you should be in the clear.The Saturday Review of Literature once said that Flatland was, \\"One of the best things of its kind ever written\\". This seems to me to be somewhat backhanded praise since very few \\"things of its kind\\" HAVE ever been written. And shouldn't it be unequivocally be pronounced the best by default alone? To my mind, the book's well worth the reading. It deserves its praise and should be remembered amongst the best of the fantastical satires (\\"Gulliver's Travels\\" for example). It's a short book too, so you've really no excuse for not reading it. A delightful dip into the unknown."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"Besides being a &quot;Romance&quot; about higher and lower dimensions, and the ingenious way in which Abbott uses geometry to show us the limitations imposed by our own limited world view, this is also a very pointed social satire about Victorian England.For example, in the main character's flatlander universe of two dimensions, one's intellect and social class are determined by the number of sides you have as a polygon. If I recall correctly (it being 35 years since I read it--someone please correct me if I err in the details) workers have three sides and are triangles, the middle class consists of squares, and the professionals and the nobility have five sides or more. But basically the principle is, the more sides you have, the higher up the social scale you are.Therefore, the king of this odd dimension has so many sides he is basically a circle. Then there are the women, who are virtually straight lines, pointed at each end, which basically means they have no intelligence at all! Furthermore, if a woman bumps into a &quot;higher&quot; polygon she will puncture their side and instantly kill them. This means women are both the dumbest and most dangerous creatures in this strange dimension. If a woman is coming at you straight on, she is essentially invisible, and you can bump into her without knowing she is even there and accidently kill yourself. Hence, there is a law requiring women, when they are out and about, to make a lot of noise so that other polygons will be able to avoid impaling themselves.Anyway, as you can see, there is a lot of vicious social satire in this short work. The author's satirical portrayal of social class issues and especially of women is even more prescient in view of social developments over the next 100 years, at least in the west."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"This book is utterly amazing; by playing out &quot;mr. square&quot;'s life on a 2-dimensional surface, and soon his realization of the first and third dimensions, the reader is left pondering over the things beyond our world. ....................To those who are ignorant torwards the enlightening proposals of this book, and think you might rate it like the person before me, save yourself some time and return to your &quot;alice in wonderland&quot;...

I downloaded the Kindle version and discovered that there are references to diagrams but they are not included (that I could find). This book is impossible to enjoy without them."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions is an 1884 novella written and illustrated by Edwin A. Abbott. Here, a square that lives in a two-dimensional world relates his experiences there along with his travels in one- and three-dimensional worlds.The social classes of the country of Flatland are described in such a way as to lampoon the Victorian social hierarchy. Every inhabitant of Flatland is devoted to climbing the social ladder; order is prized more than liberty; women belong to a lower class of their own. Abbott here is not particularly subtle in his criticisms, and one must imagine that the narrow thinkers that accused Abbott of misogyny really must not have been paying very close attention (these are the nineteenth-century analogs of people who think Stephen Colbert is really a conservative).This dated aspect of the tale may not have particular relevance for a modern audience, but Flatland still has plenty of value. Abbott's one- and two-dimensional worlds are impressively imaginative and quite well thought-out. Flatland is immersive, and along the way, Abbott manages to work in a number of profound thoughts on existence.Flatland's lasting legacy is its discussion of dimensions. Just as Abbott takes the reader through the two-dimensional square's travails in comprehending a third dimension, so the reader is challenged to imagine a fourth. And Abbott does an excellent job of this, whether one considers this fourth dimension as time (as per general relativity) or an extra aspect of space (this is quite a bit harder to imagine). It also works if you consider the tale an allegory for God and the spiritual realm (Abbott was a rather prodigious theologian), which is not by any means a stretch given the \\"preaching\\" done in the story. In any case, it's marvelously thought-provoking.On the whole, Flatland is a well-imagined, well-reasoned, stimulating work."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"Yes, it's free.

Would be interested in paying a little money for a version that displayed the original artwork, but am not confident that Amazon is labeling these accurately."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"Back in the nineteenth century, the book was described both as being &quot;fascinating&quot; and &quot;mortally tedious&quot;. I can see how both apply. For the most part, the book is amusing. It follows the world of A. Square who is, as his name indicates, a square. The first section of the book describes the world of the square, Flatland. The inhabitants range from the women who are straight lines, to the working isosceles triangles to the grand priest, a polygon of a great many sizes that he appears as a circle. The society boasts of a strict hierarchy where figures of greater sides are thought as smarter and better than the rest. The book describes how the shapes recognize each other. The book even goes into detail about a social upheaval where colour was introduced. If any section could be described as tedious, this part would be. However, picturing the actual society was indeed, very entertaining and amusing but at times, certain facts seemed insignifcant.The second half of the book devotes itself to describing the discovery of other dimensions by A. Square and the consequences of him trying to attempt to explain these discoveries to his world. This part of the book would be the part considered prophetic and charming. First, A. Square stumbles upon one dimensional world. Then accompanying a sphere, he visits a third dimensional world and then a zero dimensional world (a point). Through his discoveries, he even contemplates universes of higher dimensions, the fourth and the fifth and so forth. Eventually his efforts to spread the knowledge end in vain with social ostracization.The book truly shines in the detail of its description of the different worlds. In language, it could be described as somewhat bland, and stiffnecked but the worlds it describes are truly fascinating. Plus this book is a classic sci-fi and if you ever want to read more about hyperspace and so forth, many non-fiction books refer to Flatland."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"Here is a book on the principles of dimension in mathematics that is fun to read, but explains the principles so well. Flatland is a classic dating back to 1880, but reads like a delightful fairy tale. It thoroughly explains the concepts of lines, planes and the limitations of our dimensions in space.There is some amusing stuff here; the author is apparently a misogynist --women in Flatland are needle-thin, (well, that's not all bad) stupid, because of the size of their pointy heads (hey!) and violently dangerous due to their shape and lack of higher reasoning power.Despite poking fun at females, this book is amusing and valuable since it can teach some great math prinicples. There is a \\"sequel\\" Sphereland published in the 20th century by a different author, that goes into dimensions higher than 3. It's fun, too. As an explanantion of the concept of dimension, plus for imagination, Flatland is a real classic and a favorite of mine."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"Flatland is a good primer for understanding the basics of the different dimensions of our world. It presents a simple, easy to follow story of how a person living in 2-D would view and interact with a person living in 1-D and then with another in 3-D. This is a great launching point for further, more mind provoking and brain-teasing books like &quot;Surfing Through Hyperspace,&quot; etc.Good starter that gets you thinking."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"Can you even imagine the lateral thinking it took to write this? Even though it seems basic after reading it, this book must have been quite a groundbreaker when first published.

A copy of Flatland was in my mailbox awaiting my return to the &quot;real world&quot; (i.e. Flatland San Jose) after a P.A.C.E. Seminar I attended in Carmel in 1972. It caused me to do a lot of thinking, visualizing and reading over the following years. However, one of the unanticipated benefits for some readers is the fact that Flatland can help one easily visual some aspects of math. [BUT, I do think you have to be in the right mood, space and timeframe when you read it. It would be easy to put this book down for some of the reasons already discussed in other reviews.]"},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"Abbott has more visibility and insight into current social structures, intellectual development and spiritual awareness than most of our current &quot;masters&quot;. I was introduced to Flatland many years ago and it has been an inspiration for many new thoughts and ideas since.

I recommend Flatland to all those who have any questions regarding socially accepted paradigms of intellect, spiritual awareness and just plain fun.Chuck Mackarness"},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"I wanted to read this book because I'm a math major; I found myself loving this book because of my minor in Women's studies. E.A. Abbott was an 18th century idealist and feminist, and FLATLAND is an incredibly idea-packed, well-written little book. It takes on class conflict, women's roles and narrowminded bureaucrats with a very subtle sense of wit and satire. If you read it, pay special attention to the parts about color and women's language versus men's language.

But even more, even more, it's an appealing story. If you read and loved _The Phantom Toolbooth_, or have an even passing interest in mathematics, herein will you find the sublime"},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"I read it for the premise of geometry: how a Square, a mathematician of Flatland, had come to--not without resistance--grasp the existence of a higher Dimension (and conjectured many more above it).I came away pondering about Abbott's satirical view of the Victorian era: its rigid, hierarchical and caste-based society as well as its dogmatic resistance to consider a higher point of view, or indeed anything even slightly outside the norms of the Regular Figure. The Sphere taught the Square to see beyond the former's circular slices and \\"see\\" the whole picture, and in the process allowed the latter to see Flatland as it really was--the insides of everything visible to him in an enlightening vision from Above. Above, but not Northward. So did Abbott, I think, lamented his contemporaries' short-sightedness and closed-mindedness."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"This is an absolutely fascinating book. It's also a classic, written in 1880, that has definitely stood the test of time. I am mildly interested in math and fascinated by science, and the concept of multiple dimensions (or fewer dimensions) is one of great interest to me. The notion of Pointland, Lineland, Flatland, and above and beyond into 4-D, 5-D, 6-D, and more is, to allow my geek side to show, exciting. The book also has some interesting social statements to make. I can't recommend this book enough to anyone at least mildly interested in math or science."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"This book is a great piece of very clear, very convicting prose, using well-explained mathematical analogies for classism, sexism, and close-mindedness. I think it's a great analogy for people's willingness to accept paradoxes and the possibility of a spiritual realm. It was written by a minister, so that's not so much of a surprise. I highly recommend this book! The mathematics are simple and not intimidating. Mind-opening."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"(...). The obvious is that it is a math-ish book, just as any book written in English is also an English language book. To me, using an imaginary world of 2 dimensions and a journey into 0,1,3 dimensional worlds the author is revealing to us a potentailly new way in which to look at our own life, the universe etc. Its less a mathematical book and more a philosophical/spiritual book. The author's background should be an additional pointer towards this conclusion.The message is that there is more to us and our life on earth than is commonly understood. That our perception of the universe need not limit it to just that in reality. The story itself is a highly interesting illustration of this fact using mathematical concepts. And the best part -- the author commendably stays away from actually expounding any theories or belief systems. For anyone interested in spirituality, this book will be mighty enjoyable."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"to the person who said &quot;there ARE three dimmensions and we are NOT shapes&quot;....the book is an allegory, and nowhere does it state that there isn't a third dimension. The book uses an IMAGINARY, multi-dimensional universe inhabited by shapes to convey the idea of higher and lower dimensions to us, who live in a three-dimensional world. the shapes aren't the point. the point is, (in my opinion) that we can use the same argument presented by A Square to A Sphere concerning higher dimensions, and apply it to our universe, and our dimension. I had to read this book over the summer as well, for freshman math, and i think it is great. It teaches you to think in entirely different ways, and i realize that a lot of people my age simply aren't up to that."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"This book is a good read because it's interesting, makes you think, and it's short.The story is pretty obviously divided into two sections: One which describes a two-dimensional land and its inhabitants, one which describes how these characters react to the realization of a three-dimensional land like our own. The entire book satirically illustrates many social/cultural themes under the pretext of describing this two-dimensional civilization.The book does an good job of detailing how the characters live and thrive in their two-dimensional world, as well as contrasting how many objects and actions which we take for granted in our world are not feasible in theirs.Also, the author does a good job of making the reader think about how we perceive our world, as well as how we would see (or not see, as it were) a mythical 4D world. Drawing parallels between how we think about a 4D world and how the main characters think about a 3D world, I think, helps to further enjoyment and understanding of the book.I usually like short books -- I can get through them, feel like I have accomplished something, and move on to another book. However, I feel this book was a little too short. Just when I was really getting involved, the book ended. I think it could have been taken so many more directions (or dimensions.. ha ha).Nonetheless, I would recommend this book for anyone who likes to think casually about how we perceive (visually and physically) our universe. Even if you don't like to do that, it's kind of a fun story and a good satire. :)"},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"A brilliant book even for today's science although it was written over 100 years ago.

I especially enjoyed the sections where A. Square explains how two dimensional shapes see, hear, move, and live. Although it could be slow at times, it really helped to visualize how creatures of other dimensions might behave. Especially those of a fourth dimension, since we live in a three dimensional world.The book is highly conceptual, and while I think that someone who isn't well versed in math or theory could enjoy this book, I think that someone with at least basic understand of shapes, dimensions, and theory would come away with more.

I have an interest in science/math b.) a friend recommended it.Overall, I was a bit disappointed. Abbot starts off explaining what Flatland is: a purely 2D environment inhabited by various kinds of regular polygons (and circles). Shortly after, Abbot discusses flatland politics and this is where the book loses interest. While some of this discussion is indeed necessary for understanding what happens at the end, some of it is downright frivolous and unnecessary. I have absolutely no idea why, for instance, he discussed the \\"color revolution\\" at all.About halfway through, Abbott finally discusses the more interesting aspect of the book: what happens when a 2-D object enters a 1-D world? Or when a 3-D object enters a 2-D world? Or what both \\"thought experiments\\" imply for an (n+1)-D object entering an n-D object, where n is an arbitrary non-negative integer. Of course, the book was written before time was ultimately considered to be the 4th dimension, so the reader needs to keep this in mind when Abbott treats the 4th dimension as spatial.My advice to anyone considering this book is to read the beginning 10 pages or so, skip to the 2nd part of the story if it gets too boring, then finish it from there. It's a shame that the beginning has to undermine an otherwise interesting and thoughtful story."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"Smooth transaction, careful and fast shipping, very nice product, couldn't ask for a more wonderful buying experience.

It is not nearly as enlightening as some reviewers have made it out to be, though there are a couple of great endearing ideas that will stick with you.Unfortunately, what starts off as a great book quickly becomes mired in tedium. Part of the tedium stems from the vast difference between 19th and 21st century cultures. Abbott works hard to describe a society for one-dimensional or two-dimensional beings based on his own Victorian era. Unfortunately it is written in such a way that the difference in values between our two eras adds confusion rather than enlightenment to the message of the book. We can't identify with the society, and that identification is crucial to the usefulness of the story. Second, there is entertaining fiction, and then there is ad-nauseum details which detract from the plot. His penchant for tangents (pun intended) reminded me of how boring the Iliad could be at points.The book receives an A for originality. As for simplifying weighty concepts and making the matter entertaining, it receives only a passing grade. It is so far entangled in a social scheme that is outdated as to detract from the overall enjoyment."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"Even if you hated geometry class, you will love this book."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"Abbot has a commanding style as he weaves a tale using geometry to challenge the way people view the world. Through a cunning use of analogy, though admittedly more suited to a younger, school-age audience, he challenges the way people view the world, urging them to be more open-minded and less narrow-minded, or &quot;flat,&quot; in their view of events around them. He also obliquely deals with the antagonism between the sexes, somewhat outmoded in today's culture, as well as the resistance of society in accepting new ideas and the power of government to corral the thoughts and images available to the public."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"Behind the 19th century english text is mind-boggling exploration through life on various dimensional planes from the perspective of a square that ultimately is liberated from his two- dimensional realm."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"You have to follow geometry and be able to read with your index finger to follow this book. That is its greatest fault. It presents an interesting satire on Victorian social structure, but the main purpose, mathematics, is mind boggling. I am not an inept reader, but I found myself having to reread several parts just to make sure I go the jist of them.I will say that the most interesting part is how Abbott decides to describe the social structure and how it changes certain aspects of their existence. For example, although it was a bit convoluted for the aforementioned reasons, the way that the shapes reproduce was one of the more interesting parts of the book. I also enjoyed the way that each succeeding generation had more sides, thus making them higher on the social ladder. Then, once Abbott begins to go into the other dimensions, it become even more fascinating.

It is a great reminder to us that, when we are talking to people from other religions or belief systems, it will be very hard for them to understand us. We have to really bend over backwards to translate our message into something that they can latch onto and understand. Fine. But here is the problem: Today, people are using this film to convey a very different message. They try to leave the impression that anyone who disagrees with their agenda (political, environmental, gender, whatever) is (1) wrong, (2) too poorly armed to ever understand them, and (3) therefore not worth trying to reason with. The result of this line of \\"thought\\" is that they will simply have to impose their wisdom on the Others. This leads to having government health care, whether you want it or not; using politically correct language, whether your want to or not; for your own good! So, the only problem with the Flatland story is that it fails to remind us that most people who go against the crowd are simply wrong. Sure, everyone laughed at Einstein and he turned out to be right. But everyone also laughed at millions of clowns who were simply nuts. The idea that anyone who is different is therefore right, is wrong. The idea that there is no point in reasoning with your adversaries, is also wrong.

As a high school math teacher, I first read it planning on using it in my class to teach geometry. However, almost as interesting and its mathematical observations are its metaphors and, in my opinion, satires of Abbott's 19th century society.All inhabitants of the novel's world, dubbed Flatland, are polygons, the narrator being a square. Flatland features a strict caste system, with a polygon's class being determined by his number of sides. A square is higher on the social order than a triangle, for example, yet lower than a pentagon. The rulers, or priests, are circles. Well, actually they are polygons with very many sides, approximating a circle. The lowest figures in Flatland are women, who are straight lines. One can interpret this fictional social order in a number of ways, including accusing Abbott of being classist and sexist. I happen to see this as a critique, even a satire, of our (spaceland's) social order, replete with classism and sexism. &quot;Flatland&quot; also spoofs eugenics and political short-sightedness, so there's plenty to choose from.After introducing Flatland's social order, the narrator describes a journey he takes to lineland and spaceland, which offers a great way of looking at dimensionality, even for mathematics laypersons. I'd advise reading it slowly or even more than once to be sure your mind grasps all the interesting narrative and dialogue.Mixing a clever introduction of mathematical concepts with an element of social satire, &quot;Flatland&quot; is well worth reading, even for those who are normally averse to anything that has to do with mathematics. While I still plan on using this novel to teach geometry, perhaps I'll also infuse some social justice issues into my lessons."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"+++++In order to understand this twenty-two chapter book (first published in the mid-1880s) by Edwin A. Abbot (1838 to 1926), you have to understand what is meant by the word \\"dimension,\\" a word in the book's subtitle \\"A Romance of Many Dimensions.\\" A dimension is any measureable distance such as length or width. So something that has one dimension has only one measurable distance, something that has two dimensions has two measurable distances, and so on. You also have to realize that there are geometrical forms that can be drawn in these dimensions. Thus a line is such a form that only has one dimension, a triangle is such a form that has two dimensions that appears flat and non-solid, and a sphere is such a form in three dimensions that appears solid. (Another name for three dimensions is space.)Part one (twelve chapters) of this book gives us a glimpse of the two-dimensional land where the narrator, Mr. \\"A. Square,\\" comes from. This place, called \\"Flatland,\\" is inhabitated by two-dimensional beings of which Square is one. These beings no nothing of \\"up\\" and \\"down.\\" Square tells us details of Flatland society such as its resident's domestic life and its political turmoil. It is a place dominated by such things as a rigid social hierarchy, sexism, and closed-mindedness.Abbot was a Victorian and his description of Flatland is meant to be a parody (using wry humor and biting satire) of English Victorian society. Abbot seems to have fun mocking the upper classes of the 1880s in his book. I found that much of what Abbot says can be applied to modern society.As an example, Square tells us of the social hierarchy that exists: \\"Our women are straight lines. Our soldiers and lowest classes of workmen are Triangles with two equal sides [called an Isosceles triangle]...Our middle class consists of Equilateral or equal sided triangles...Our professional men...are Squares...and five-sided figures, or Hexagons, and thence rising in the number of their sides till they receive the honorable title of Polygonal, or many-sided...Finally when the number of sides becomes so numerous...that the figure cannot be distinguished from a Circle, he is included in the Circular or Priestly order; and this is the highest class of all.\\"Part two (ten chapters) of this book is very interesting since Square tells us of his visits to \\"Lineland\\" (a land of one dimension), \\"Spaceland\\" (a land of three dimensions, a land Earthlings are used too), and \\"Pointland\\" (a land of no dimensions). Readers will find that they will have to adjust their thinking every time the two-dimensional Square visits a world of different dimensions. For example, when Square meets \\"Sphere\\" (of Spaceland), the reader will have to \\"see\\" Sphere as Square does--in two dimensions. The end of this part has Square realizing that three (and perhaps more) dimensions exist and trying to tell his fellow close-minded Flatlanders this.My favorite sentence in part two occurs when Sphere makes an unexpected visit to Square's home (and Square doesn't know who Sphere is, fearing that he is a burglar). Square says, \\"The thought flashed across me that I might have before me a burglar or cut-throat, some monstrous irregular Isoceles, who by feigning the voice of a Circle, had obtained admission somehow into the house, and was now preparing to stab me with his acute angle.\\"Abbot, besides being a writer and educator, was also a theologian. So are their any spiritual or metaphysical aspects to this book? The answer is yes but this is not always obvious. For example, when Sphere makes his first unexpected visit to Square's home, he slowly seems to materialize in front of Square. Thus Sphere seems to be a supernatural, supreme being and Square refers to him as \\"your Lordship.\\" Another example is Sphere sees Square as \\"a fit apostle for the Gospel of the Three Dimensions.\\"This book is written in Victorian English that may be difficult (for some) to comprehend at first. But I found that as I progressed further into the book and got used to this type of English, it becomes much easier to comprehend. The sketches found throughout the book also help immensely in getting across what Abbot was attempting to convey.This book raises a number of questions, some of which are as follows:(1) Why does our universe have three dimensions and not two or four?(2) In what ways does our three-dimensional universe affect its physical, chemical, and biological properties?(3) Do universes that have two, four, five, or more dimensions exist?(4) If other universes of different dimensions do exist, then are there beings in these other dimensions?Finally, for those who want a good non-fiction account of possible other dimensions, I recommend Dr. Michio Kaku's book \\"Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the 10TH Dimension\\" (1994).In conclusion, this is a unique book that sparks your imagination and raises certain questions. Be warned though! By reading this book, you may become one in \\"a race of rebels who...refuse to be confined to [a] limited dimensionality.\\"+++++"},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"This has always been a favorite of mine, so I wanted to christen my kindle with it.

Abbott. Here, a square that lives in a two-dimensional world relates his experiences there along with his travels in one- and three-dimensional worlds.The social classes of the country of Flatland are described in such a way as to lampoon the Victorian social hierarchy. Every inhabitant of Flatland is devoted to climbing the social ladder; order is prized more than liberty; women belong to a lower class of their own. Abbott here is not particularly subtle in his criticisms, and one must imagine that the narrow thinkers that accused Abbott of misogyny really must not have been paying very close attention (these are the nineteenth-century analogs of people who think Stephen Colbert is really a conservative).This dated aspect of the tale may not have particular relevance for a modern audience, but Flatland still has plenty of value. Abbott's one- and two-dimensional worlds are impressively imaginative and quite well thought-out. Flatland is immersive, and along the way, Abbott manages to work in a number of profound thoughts on existence.Flatland's lasting legacy is its discussion of dimensions. Just as Abbott takes the reader through the two-dimensional square's travails in comprehending a third dimension, so the reader is challenged to imagine a fourth. And Abbott does an excellent job of this, whether one considers this fourth dimension as time (as per general relativity) or an extra aspect of space (this is quite a bit harder to imagine). It also works if you consider the tale an allegory for God and the spiritual realm (Abbott was a rather prodigious theologian), which is not by any means a stretch given the \\"preaching\\" done in the story. In any case, it's marvelously thought-provoking.On the whole, Flatland is a well-imagined, well-reasoned, stimulating work."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"It's probably a well known fact that this book is used by math teachers everywhere as an invaluable guide to understanding dimensions. It probably also well known that Flatland is an effective illumination of Victorian class structure. What I wasn't expecting was that this book would open my eyes in a profound way. For me, I found that Flatland was, more than anything, a call to imagine the unimaginable. The metaphor of the protagonist trying to conceive of something beyond his ability, but unequivocally existent nonetheless, was the perfect sentiment for me to try to approach things with a more open mind.The only thing stopping me from rating this a perfect '5' was the beginning chapters that seemed to drag on monotonously, for me. Also, as far as this Kindle edition goes, the ASCII illustrations didn't appear on my Kindle 2. I didn't really mind at all, though, and for the price, I'd be mad to complain. That's why I love the Kindle freebies, life changing novels -or novellas, in this case- for $0.00.Flatland is a book I am not likely to ever forget."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"Although this book was written in the time when Hinton and his pseudo-analyses of higher dimensions ruled the popular masses (mostly as a semi-plausible explanation of the existence of ghosts), it delves a lot deeper into the nature of things, and, as noted above, even delivers a forceful parody of the society.The author of the book is a Square, a perfectly flat creature that lives in a flat society in an ideally 2D world. His four equal sides (irregulars are always killed or imprisoned due to the confusion of recognizing an irregular figure from looking at its side) give him the status of lawyer (the number of sides denotes the social rank). His amazing visions and visitation give this flat and narrow-minded individual the understanding of the worlds outside his own.First is the visit to Line Land, where all persons are lines of different lengths and vision is limited to a single spot. Naturally, bypassing anyone is a geometric impossibility, but, strangely, the denizens of that land live happy lives.Next is the visit of mysterious Lord Sphere, who, due to the lack of dimensionality, has to resort to manifesting himself as his cross-sections which the square can see. He delivers to the Square the Gospel of Three Dimensions, and, when the complacent Square refuses to comprehend, Spherer pulls him out into 3D (i.e. puts him at an angle to his own flat space).Finally, we are given a view of Point Land, inhabited by but a single creature of no dimensions and no coprehension of others beside it, hearing all and attributing all to its own grace and might.The book is extremely sarcastic and acidic: a 2D woman is a straight line, invisible when seen head on ( and lethal if met headfirst due to her sharpness), and is always reduced to constantly emit her Peace Cry. Color is forbidden because it causes too much confusion. Criminals are those whose sides are not equal. Etc. etc., etc.Read this book and stop to think from time to time - this is the sort of book that rewards thought."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"Edwin Abbott's \\"Flatland\\" is a story that can be read as many things: as an Orwellian satire on The State, as a contemplation of dimensions (even ones we do not know yet), as a philosophical variation of Plato's Cave, or simply as a delightful sci-fi story.Flatland is broken up into two parts. The first sees our main character (a square who is a mathemetician - how cute!) telling us - those who live in \\"spaceland\\" - about the ins and outs of flatland. He teaches us both about how life is lived as a two dimensional object, explaining such things as how one can recognize by sight a squre from a hexagon without being able to see the angles. Also, the square explains how flatland's class and government system works: how women, for instance, are inferior to men and do not attend school, how polygons are superior to lowly squares and triangles, and how the circles make the laws.It is this first section that is both a savy critique on government and the then prevailing social mores. Also, this seciton is fascinating from a mathematical point of view, answering questions that the astute reader is bound to have. (How, for instance, is sight possible in two dimensions?)The second section of the book is where stuff gets even more intersting. This is the section where our square mathemetician both finds himself (in a dream) having to explain the concept of a second dimension to a \\"linelander\\", and is visited by a \\"spacelander\\" who must try to convince our \\"flatlander\\" that a third dimension is possible.This section is most interesting from a philosophical perspective. How, for instance, is it possible to explain a third dimension to one who only knows two dimensions? To the flatlander, terms like \\"up,\\" \\"down,\\" \\"above,\\" \\"below,\\" \\"vertical,\\" (etc.) have no meaning as they presuppose knowledge of a third dimension. That is, can a spacelander use \\"two diemsional language\\" (language presupposing no familiarity with any but two dimensions) to explain a third dimension? (Edwin Abbot thinks he can, but the astute reader will notice Abbott's linguistic fallacy in how he brought this about!)At any rate, it is this part of the book that can also be seen as a variation on Plato's Cave. (Plato's Cave analogizes us to people looking at the back wall of a cave open at the other end, who see only shadows of objects outside the cave, but who are convinced that what they see is the real things.) That is, \\"Flatland\\" very beautifully articulates the idea of someone realizing that what they assumed was a complete view of reality was only a partial view of reality. And now, the flatlander bears the burden of trying to convince other flatlanders that the reality they take for granted as \\"all there is,\\" is, in fact, not a complete view of reality at all.Can he do it? Will he run into the same linguistic stumbling block already spoken of? More interestingly, if the \\"linelander\\" was wrong in assuming only one dimension, and the \\"flatlander\\" was wrong in assuming only two dimensions, might the \\"spacelander\\" be wrong in assuming only three dimensions, and so on? And how, if possible, could we find out?These questions and more are artfully and skillfully broached in Edwin Abbott's mathematical classic \\"Flatland.\\" Even if all you want is an intersting science fiction book, \\"Flatland\\" will do the trick. But for those who want a great \\"thinking\\" novel, \\"Flatland\\" is an outstanding choice!"},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"This edition is essentially unreadable and not representative of traditional printings.

I came away from this book realizing their are more dimensions out their that science has yet to discover. This book also has a hidden message in the book that most people are completely ignorant about the world around them. They think they know it all and have no desire to educate themselves further than the little education they already have.People believe in myths and assumptions and are ignorant and don't bother to seek the real answers in life. This message was very powerful to me and an important lesson. This author was concise, wasn't wordy like so many sci-fi/fantasy authors now, and didn't fill the book with nothing but metaphors and similies, and got right to the point in his writing. It took me the same time to read this book as it takes me to read most of the long wordy sci-fi/fantasy novels out their now.

This triumph of penmanship is of multiple dimensions; where the planes of scientific inquiry, dimensional mathematics, social forces, Christian ethics, women's rights and aristocratic roots all meet--to name a few.

You really don't care about the characters at all, and it's a book you can read in a couple sittings. However, what you can take away from the book is just as much, or more than a 500 page novel.The entire book illudes to Victorian Society and how strict their lives were lead. \\"Flatland\\" is narrated by A. Square, a two dimensional square. He lives in Flatland, a completely two dimensional world. From here he narrates how he came to learn about the third dimension.The laws within flatland are extremely strict. A. Sqaure tells of their geometric heirchy: Irregular peasants, Triangular tradesman, square and polygonal politicians, and spherical priests. The inhabitants are classified according to their shape. Their shape determines how well off they are in society.Anyway, after learning how life is lived in Flatland, A. Square begins to tell of his encounter with a Sphere and the reactions of his own world. After he is exposed to the wonders of the \\"third dimension\\" he comes eagerly back to the second dimension in hopes of enlightening his peers of his experiences. The government immediately sends A. Square to jail after hearing his story. No one belives him and they deem him insane.The most interesting part of the book is learning how life functions within Flatland. It really makes you think. From a two dimensional perspective, it's really interesting to imagine how they would recognize one another. From that perspective everything would look like a straight line. According to A. Square, they use \\"feeling\\" in order to distinguish the degrees of one angle, thus be able to figure out how many angles are on that shape. A. Square also continues to describe their homes, weather, writing, families, etc.\\"Flatland\\" is one of the most interesting books I have ever read.

No arguing it's entertaining, if a little clothy, but ultimately it is (by the standards of modern literature and mathematics) woefully shallow.It's worth reading (in any edition), and it's thin enough to fit in a small gap, so won't impose badly on your bulging bookshelves, but I wouldn't hunt it out especially."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"While Flatland is a great book, the Kindle edition is missing all of the pictures/diagrams."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"The Kindle Edition does not include figures - the comment from Amazon support on this was:\\"Occasionally, conversion to digital requires modification of content, layout, or format, including the omission of some images and tables.\\""},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"The classic \\"Flatland\\" covers many topics in surprisingly few pages. In fact, it's hard to say what the main point of the book is, if indeed there is just one. Mathematicians use the book to explain and explore the concepts of dimensionality from the perspective of a two-dimensional being; once we understand his world (in the first half of the book), we then learn how he perceives both lower- and higher-dimensional objects. There is some interesting social and political commentary along the way, clearly satirical of the class structure and gender roles of Victorian England, but still amazingly relevant today in the United States. The persecution of prophets is also a major point of the end of the story as the two-dimensional being tries to explain the three-dimensional world to others in his planar world; you can interpret this in a pro-religious sense (Jesus) or in an pro-science sense- another reviewer mentioned the trials and tribulations of Galileo Galilei. However you approach this classic story, there is definitely a lot to chew on.For whatever reason I never was required to read \\"Flatland\\" in high school. In hindsight, this is probably a good thing because I probably wouldn't have appreciated the story as much as I do now. Some of my work as an engineer has me in six- and nine-dimensional space, and I can say that I understand the math a bit better after reading this story...and a few thought experiments, much like the main character in the story. I definitely recommend this book for a variety of audiences, but I don't know that using it in a high-school math class is a good idea- the prose is a little flowery and long-winded by today's standards, and without any prior knowledge of Victorian culture this book might be mistaken as misogynistic (see some of the other reviews)."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"A must-read for all who appreciate geometry. Expect an older style of writing. Realize that it is not purely a mathematical book, but has a Victorian theme, too. Appreciate the geometry concepts in their historic context. Look at the original publication date of Flatland (not this edition), and imagine the author contemplating the fourth dimension back then. Put yourself in this frame of mind, most suitable for truly enjoying the concepts and details of this classic work. A must-read if you enjoy geometry. This thrift edition is a bargain, too."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"I have read this book at least a dozen times. It's a must read for anyone, a satire of many dimensions. While the aspects of dimensionality apply to the math geeks, the pun on straight-laced Victorian society actually mirrors many of the things we face in our society today, but with a different twist. This is a great way for a lay person to understand the concept of dimensionality. If you like this book, I also highly recommend reading Rudy Rucker's Spaceland and Ian Stewart's Flatterland. Both are great sequels to this original classic and absolutely hilarious!"},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions is an 1884 novella written and illustrated by Edwin A.

However, the novella's more enduring contribution is its examination of dimensions; in a foreword to one of the many publications of the novella, noted science writer Isaac Asimov described Flatland as \\"The best introduction one can find into the manner of perceiving dimensions.\\" As such, the novella is still popular amongst mathematics, physics and computer science students."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"I read this title because it was mentioned in David Foster Wallace's opus \\"Infinite Jest\\" which I am also rereading at this time and IJ is highly recommended (5 Stars).This work, \\"Flatland: a romance of many dimensions\\" is hard to get involved in, much of the early exposition concerning life in Flatland is tedious, though some is thought provoking as a statement about society, please feel free to jump ahead, you will not miss much.

It was cleverly written and an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"If you're obsessed with math but need a break from equations and formulas, pick up a copy of Edwin Abbott's Flatland and go to town. Published over a century ago, this book illustrates the faults of politics and nobility as it explores the delicate relations between the inhabitants of Flatland. As the book progresses it diligently explains the factors of the known dimensions, and the obstacles that separate them. This book is a great read for anyone who loves history, math, and a good laugh.This book follows a square that is set in his ways about the world. As an inhabitant of Flatland, this square ranks as a \\"Professional\\" or \\"Gentleman\\". He is joined by every other imaginable regular figure, and all have their place in the world according to their shape. The chain of nobility begins with women, who are, as Abbott repeatedly mentions, \\"straight lines\\". Following the women are Isosceles Triangles, who make up the army and servant class. Next come Equilateral Triangles, followed by Squares, Pentagons, Hexagons, and the rest of the regular Polygons follow suit. At the top of the pyramid rests the Priestly Circles, along with Polygons made up of so many thousands of sides they appear to be circles. Each level is smarter than the previous, starting with women who are like goldfish in their mentality, and ending with the Circles who occupy the highest roles of society. The second way Abbott connects the generations is highly entertaining for me, so I'll just leave that treasure for you to discover on your own.Abbott has a lot of fun in creating the geometric figures' way of life. For instance, he has made recognition of another figure possible by sound, sight, and touch. The women have to take special precaution due to their dangerous shape. Abbott goes to the extreme when describing their circumstances, which I believe to be rather humorous.The second part of the book follows the Square as he is shown dimensions that are unimaginable as well as down right silly in his perspective. He's shown Lineland, the world of one dimension, in a dream. Later a figure appearing to be a magical circle shows him the way to Sphereland, the world of three dimensions. Lastly, the Square is shown the world of Pointland, a place of no dimensions consisting of simple dots. Each world evokes a different response from the Square as his mind is opened to the various spaces surrounding him.All in all, the book was a fun read. The best part to me was Abbott's many explanatory diagrams. However, being a female I was severely disgruntled by the low intelligence and mockery of women. I did find peace in knowing that our sharp points could be the weapon of ultimate destruction, as ironic as that may be. The line of nobility definitely revealed the books age, and also evoked several strong feelings I have towards equal rights. I love how I was connected to the troubles and controversy of an older era while learning about present day mathematics. Honestly, if you are a person with strong opinions who loves to argue, this book will give you and your book club things to talk about! One factor that kept me zoned in throughout the story was the reoccurring mention of the phrase \\"straight line\\". This redundant fault of Abbott's was a rather comical feature for me, and I have to say it was interesting to see how many times it popped up.This book is a fun way to view the world as it exists in two dimensions. The flashbacks to historical ideals make for a highly political and controversial read that will surely keep the reader interested. Once Abbott starts explaining the multiple dimensions and their connections, the book becomes a whirlwind of that \\"I know what I mean but I just can't explain it\\" feeling of frustration and determination. If you or anyone you know enjoys geometry, controversial issues, and puzzles, this book is sure to be a hit.For hundreds of great reviews of young adult books by young adults themselves, be sure to check out notrequiredreading.com."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"Originally written with a Victorian theme, it is now a must-read classic for anyone who enjoys reading about the fourth dimension. The story is about a two-dimensional being (called A Square) living in a two-dimensional world (hence the title, Flatland). As a three-dimensional being imagining this two-dimensional world, you come to realize that you can understand higher-dimensional space through lower-dimensional analogies. In fact, A Square meets a three-dimensional being (A Sphere), and takes a journey beyond the second dimension. Although some readers may enjoy the book for its historical and Victorian period merits, math lovers can enjoy the book for its geometric insight.If you are curious about the fourth dimension, you should also read:-Spaceland: A Novel of the Fourth Dimension, Rudy Rucker's novel of the fourth dimension-Flatterland: Like Flatland, Only More So, a continuation of the geometric idea from Flatland-The 4th Dimension: Toward a Geometry of Higher Reality, Rudy Rucker's classic introduction to the fourth dimension-The Visual Guide to Extra Dimensions: Volume 1: Visualizing the Fourth Dimension, Higher-Dimensional Polytopes, and Curved Hypersurfaces, a modern geometric introduction to the fourth dimension"},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"Yes, many young people have been required to read Flatland against their wills. Yes, many people have missed the real point of the book. This book stretched the mind and imagination in ways that are fun and challenging. The author might not have been entirely serious in writing the book, but nonetheless provided serious food for thought.I believe Flatland is an excellent (and quick) reading experience for minds in the formative stage, a stage I recommend maintaining throughout life. The book's theological implications were the most important to me. I had always wondered where heaven might be, how God can see inside us, and what the spirit is made of. I do not know if extrapolating the Flatland concepts into a fourth (or fifth) physical dimension reflects ultimate reality, but it provides a sufficiently possible and plausible explanation to remove rationalist objections.The 3-D sphere that intersects the plane of reality provided the \\"Aha\\" moment. The sphere embodied perfection and could mysteriously appear and disappear. Explaining the view from above the plane to a flat square is as difficult as explaining the spiritual realm to a person unable to envision beyond the world seen with the eye. A greater-dimensional being floating above the plane can see inside the geometric shapes, reach inside their skins without intersecting their boundaries, think far more complex thoughts, and take them out of their limited reality to a better place they could not have imagined. If a Flatland person had no thickness, he would have no volume by our reckoning, and therefore no real existence. If there is a spiritual dimension and a person has no thickness in that direction at all, then he may not really exist either.We have learned to adjust to modern concepts of reality that are no longer Euclidean and Newtonian. Perhaps we need a view of creation that is not limited by unfounded presumptions of limited dimensionality. After you ponder the concepts of Flatland and extrapolate them to your life, I wonder what new thought may form."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"This book is often recommend by theoretical physicists and mathematicians (most often mathematicians involved in hyperdimensional topology) to their students.It was written by a Shakespeare scholar in Britain more than 100 years ago. The reason it is recommended by theoretical physicists, etc., is it provides the reader with a framework for understanding and trying to visualize dimensions above or beyond our ordinary four-dimensional world (length, width, heighth, space-time).It deals with a two dimensional world with two dimensional beings and what happens when a third dimensional being interacts with a two dimensional world and what the two dimensional beings would see. It also does this in terms of a one dimensional being and one dimensional world interacting with a two dimensional world and two dimensional beings (or structures).This book written with apparently some intent on commenting on Victorian England and its values (with what appeared to me to have some misogynistic comments within it), was otherwise an enjoyable book and really does provide a good analysis on multi-dimensional view points and visualizing or imagining hyper-dimensions.If you are interested in advanced theoretical physics, hyperdimensional geometry or topology or mathematics, this is a very interesting book and may be useful. If you are just interested in a good unique science fiction story, I would highly recommend this. This is not an (explicit) math or science book - so you won't find any explicit mathematics (i.e., no math is required).Excellent."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"Keep in mind that this book was written over a hundred years ago, and consider the incredible ground it covers with this little tale: geometry (obviously), physics, government, politics, the clash between the sexes, class structures, manners, human nature, psychology, philosophy and even neuroscience (consciousness)! At first reading, it's deceptively simple, but explain it out loud to someone else and you'll find yourself noticing new things. If something doesn't seem to make sense, ask yourself \\"why?\\" This story is an allegory, a metaphor for so many things that fall into disjunct categories.

This is the same title and author and about the same price, so it is about the same book. It's an entertaining story about analogies between two and three dimensions mainly, to come to an idea to percieve four and more dimensions, although for me some ideas were new, I can't say that I can imagine 4 spacial dimensins now, a two dimensional square with four one dimensional line borders leeds via a three dimensional cube with six two dimensional square sides to a fourth dimensional \\"supercube\\", with eight cubes as borders and twelve cornerpoints, how I must imagine that is not clear.

The third dimension becomes unimportant, and can be dispensed with completely. Taking this further, we are left with a \\"society\\" of circles, triangles, and other 2-D geometric figures, all living in Flatland.As a science and math teacher, I found this book an inspiration for thought-provoking questions, such as: How would you describe the sphere to someone living in Lineland or Flatland? How, for that matter, would you communicate the very concept of thickness to someone living in Flatland? Or volume?Visualize a sphere crossing Flatland. It starts as a point, then a circle of expanding diameter, then a circle of decreasing diameter, then a point, and then finally nothing. Other 3-D figures can be visualized in comparable manner. The possibilities are endless!"},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"This book was slow at times, but I still enjoyed it. Edwin Abbott clearly put a lot of thought into how a two dimensional society would work, and thus Flatland felt like a real place and (ironically) hardly felt flat at all. My favorite part of the book, however, had to be when Mr. Square and Mr. Sphere visit Pointland, a plane of existence consisting of zero dimensions. The self proclaimed God of Pointland talks to himself in an endless soliloquy of purple prose, and believes itself the end all and be all of everything despite not even understanding the concept of the number 2. Overall, while the book is dense and is not a light read, it was still quite enjoyable, and will leave your head buzzing with thoughts of four dimensional cubes for days."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"Even if you aren't crazy about math, this book makes the concepts accessible and entertaining.

A fun sci-fi classic."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"The fantastical setting of Edwin A. Abbott's &quot;Flatland&quot; is one of the most curious in literature: a two-dimensional world in which all the inhabitants are sentient flat shapes which slide around on a plane with no knowledge or conception of a third dimension. However, the book's theme -- the importance of unimpeded scientific inquiry and the danger of denying the possibilities of infinity in all its forms -- is treated with the didacticism of a tendentious theological tract, leaving the reader, who probably was already well aware of the book's implications long before he even heard of the book, gasping for breath.We are introduced to the nature of Flatland by the narrator, a nameless Square, who describes his world as being populated primarily by regular polygons. A citizen's social and occupational status is in direct proportion to his number of sides, so those with so many sides that they approximate circles achieve the highest ranks. These circular elite are dubbed &quot;priests&quot; and rule Flatland apparently on a parliamentary model. At the other end of the spectrum are the Triangles, who constitute the working class. Even lower than the Triangles, however, are the simpleminded Lines -- and these are Flatland's women, useful only for procreation. It takes little imagination to guess what the irregular polygons represent.The Square's purpose in writing this report is to rejoice in his discovery of the (previously unimagined) third dimension, revealed to him by a helpful Sphere who visits from Spaceland. The Square, now in possession of arcane knowledge and an intuitive conviction of the existence of higher dimensions, assumes an evangelical role and ultimately emerges as a Promethean figure when he is imprisoned for the heretical act of preaching a third dimension.&quot;Flatland&quot; has been compared to &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; and &quot;Gulliver's Travels,&quot; but I'd say there are clearer parallels to Huxley's &quot;Brave New World&quot; (in the classist regimentation of the Flatlanders' society) and Samuel Butler's &quot;Erewhon&quot; (in the Flatlanders' strange and limited belief system). The difference is that the aforementioned novels employ both irony to qualify as allegorical satires and narrative integrity to endure as pure fiction, whereas &quot;Flatland&quot; is so earnest in its delivery and so ineffectual in its impact, it feels like a pebble in an avalanche. Too obvious and elementary to be a scientific or mathematical essay, too obtuse to be a philosophical treatise, too moralistic to be a good example of a novel, &quot;Flatland&quot; misses its mark and slips silently through the cracks."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"Ok, great book. Also, this book was not centered on spirituality or Christianity as some of you morons thought it to be. It's just a book that opens your mind up to the possible and what is beyond our grasp. To always search for the truth, no matter where it leads us, or whatever preconceptions it shatters. G'day to you all!"},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"Flatland is one of those pseudo-scientific novels that has since become a piece of the scientific canon in the same way that Alice's Adventures in Wonderland has; when attempting to explain theoretical physics to a class, and at a dead-end, a professor is most liekly to turn to an analogy from Flatland. Which makes sense. Flatland is the story of A. Square, a resident of the two-dimensional Flatland, and how he comes to understand that there are universes in every dimension. Previous to this, the idea of any universe but his own two-dimensional universe was unthinkable; by the end of the novel, he is positing the existence of a great, infinitely-dimensional being-- god. This is not surprising; Edwin Abbott was a theologist first and foremost. What is surprising is how modern eyes have seen this tale, and it gives us a perspective on the endless debate as to whether the author's belief about his story is the final and &quot;right&quot; one.Abbott meant his book as a treatise on theoretical physics-- if at all-- in only a minor way. According to Abbott himself, his main goal in the writing of Flatland was to produce a kind of &quot;satire of manners&quot; on Victorian England. And, given what little I know of the ways of life in Victorian England, he seems to be right on the money. But what do I know? Abbott's assertion is backed up by the structure of the novel, certainly; the first hundred pages of this small (hundred fifty page) tome are devoted to the customs and mores of Flatland. How stinging a criticism they are of the values and mores of Victorian England is not for me to say. Thus, those of us who are not historians are left with the final fifty pages, and the impact of the first hundred pages upon them (which, aside form the knowledge gained therein, is minimal); and, at least as far as the physicists go, the book has metamorphosed into a trestise on theoretical physics.I'm not a theoretical physicist, either, but I've always been interested in mathematics in a sort of hobbylike way, and the math presented in Flatland is good, solid theory that also happens to be thought-provoking. Seeing how A. Square's realization of how the third dimension works dawns on him, and seeing how Lord Sphere explains the mechanics of the third dimension to A. Square, it is easy to take those arguments and make them to postulate a theoretical fourth dimension (albeit one that is impossible to visualize, at least within the narrow scope of my mathematical knowledge) and its supercubes with sixteen points and eight faces, and the like.The point is, however, we seem to have taken a minor part of the book's appeal to its original audience and made that its full appeal today. We still think it's good (or it wouldn't still be in print a hundred sixteen years after its release, no?), but we think different aspects of it are good. The opinions of the artist have passed on, and the work itself remains in a different perspective."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"This book could have been reduced to ten pages. Great for for someone with a third grade education. May be that was the point."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"When I read this book, I was struck by how harsh the government was. In fact, most of the book was dedicated to describing the government. The main character is sentenced to life long inprisonment, just because he's explaing his views. It was interesting, tho, when he discovered the three dimensional world and asked his pal, the sphere, to open his guts. I assume that the sphere was a human."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"Every young math student should read this book. And every budding philosopher. It speaks to life as few others, perhaps Animal Farm. A must read again if it has been a while. It is a short but worthwhile read. It can be read aloud easily."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"I own a hard copy of Flatland and heartily recommend it.Despite the title this is not illustrated. Where there should be illustrations are labels listing 'ASCI Illustration Follows.' Now if there were at least the ASCI illustrations I would have given this a higher score, but even the ASCI representations seem to be missing.The text is at least formated properly, something that not all the kindle versions of Flatland have going for them."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"This is speculative fiction at its finest: the premise of an unreal world (two-dimensional) allows the exploration of both mathematical and political issues from a new, exciting, perspective. The horrible Victorian social atmosphere of Flatland is reflected perfectly in its mathematical rigidity, and the subtle criticism of a society with rigid social classes is amazing -- even as spoken from the mouth of a square who truly and honestly believes that this is how society should be."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"Abbott's masterful novel Flatland is something that one must take the time to read. The only reason I even knew about this book was because my high school algebra teacher made a mention of it once in class. Suffice it to say, this is not known as one of the standard must-reads from the nineteenth century canon.Abbott gently walks the reader through a door into his thoughts concerning such disparate issues as the stifling and,oftentimes baffling, Victorian-Era class distinctions of England in the 1880's, Euclidean Geometry, the existence of dimensions that we can not yet recognize and the difficulty one faces when attempting to share a revelation with his fellow man.This is a tall order for one relatively short book that is narrated not by a person, but literally by a square. The flow of the book is gentle and the premises are thought-provoking without being heavy handed or dogmatic.I truly loved reading Flatland. Rare are the moments when an author urges readers to share in the love of pondering the what-if's and how-come's with open eyes and open minds."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"Flatland is a very enjoyable book. It is quite a challange to try to realize all of the different worlds described."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"Not bad, but not good either. As short as the book was (~100 pp.) it was tedious and dull. Abbott wastes lots of time explaining the most simple ideas (e.g., the appearance of a square in 2-dimensional space (ch. 1)). Furthermore, there were several impossiblities encountered. For example, A. square is always in 3-space, but is only able to sense 2-dimensions. He therefore will never be able to &quot;see&quot; 3-D, even when he is &quot;pulled out of the plane&quot; by the sphere. I also am curious as to how he is able to understand 3-D, if he is a 2-dimensional creature. Among humans, only the most brillian can begin to understand higher dimensions, but among 2-D creatures, a lowly square can understand 3-D??"},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"I read this book over 20 years ago for extra credit in 10th grade geometry. It has the effect of compressing your mind like a spring, (into 2D) then releasing it. What I got was a different meaning than most. And that is...this could explain \\"where\\" Heaven and Hell are. If our 3D existance is a subset of 4D or higher as the book suggests, then it \\"fits\\" for an answer to a rather basic question of faith in God."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"Flatland is an interesting piece of fiction. On the one hand the ideas it presents are endlessly intriguing, and trying to percieve what they speak of is much like running in a dream (at least for me). On the other hand, the book is too short, a thinly veiled lecture, in which the societal patterns in Lineland aren't explored to their full extent.One main problem I had in the novel was the main character's view of women (despite the cryptic apology in the Preface). Women are seen as unskilled &quot;lines&quot;, the simplest of figures, dominated by their emotions, ignorant, and dangerous. While this might seem like a commentary on the ways women are treated today, I threw this idea aside: the fact remains that many of the harmful descriptions are proven true by the narrative. Should not they be contradicted to make such a point?But I digress. I understand the novels purpose is not to improve the role of women in society, but rather to convince the reader of the existence of a fourth dimension. At this is surely succeeds. I still am wondering is whether the added dimension might be spacial, temporal, mental, or something entirely different. It truly elicits thought.To continue, I enjoyed the book. However, it isn't for everyone, and at times I simply wished to hurry through it to finish and get on with things. But at a slim 80 pages, it is decidedly worth it. I would have given a four star rating because of this, but length seems like a poor measure of quality.Also, allow me to commend Dover for their Thrift editions of books.

I was intrigued by the premise - a comparative story of different lands, each of which features a different number of dimensions - and by the fact that its author had written the book in the 1800s, long before Einstein's theory of relativity and theories of time as the fourth dimension were common parlance. It was written by a non-mathematician and non-scientist. And it was only 75 pages long! I figured I had all the ingredients for a great, interesting, informative - and above all else, quick - read. Not so, she said. It took me forever to finish this extraordinarily short book, and it was a huge disappointment.

From what I've heard, they did that when this book came out in the late 19th century.This book isn't science fiction in the classical sense; compared to A. K. Dewdney's Planiverse, the science in it is actually quite bad. It's more valuable as a cultural benchmark describing the class strictures of Victorian Britain in an unusual setting than anything else. Its overriding message of being open to different thinking, while admirable, is lost in the portrayal of a society whose strictures are not merely cultural but biological, rendering the point of the book somewhat vague at best.It's interesting, yes.

But it's heavy-handed and lacking in any real sense of wonder such as you'd expect from a Jules Verne or Arthur Conan Doyle."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"A whimsical introduction to the concepts of multidimensional mathematics, this book is very much the product of the 1880's Victorian era in which it was written. In a preface to the book entitled \`\`Limitations'', Isaac Asimov writes, \`\`This book, then, should lead us to question the limitations we set to our Universe generally, not only those that are mathematical and physical, but those that are sociological as well.''Indeed, this book taught me more about the backward attitudes of Victorian society than it did about mathematics. It does a nice job of illustrating what it means to project, say, 4-dimensional space into 3 dimensions, by starting from physical concepts we can grasp, namely, the projection of 3-space into 2 dimensions. However, if you're already familiar with such concepts, there's not much else here to recommend this one.

I haven't found the time to start Flatterland but by the blurb on the jacket and other reviews, I am looking forward to it. I recommend this book to any high school student or slightly younger students interested in math or science. Of course, I recommend this to adults as well."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"Do not miscast this wonderful little book as being merely \\"sci-fi\\". Two-dimensional \\"worlds\\" exist within ours, if only in a somewhat pragmatic sense. If we imagine some \\"thing\\" intellective within such a world, then we have little difficulty seeing that our humble narrator, Mr. A. Square, might be such a world's most insightful oddball. The book is a classic exposition in basic geometry, but it is more than this. Abbott uses mathematics to make some very telling observations about human minds and psychologies.Edwin Abbott (1838-1926) was a clergyman and a math geek. He was an educator, an expositor of English literature and New Testament studies, a notable headmaster, and the author of something like 40 books on widely varied themes. Today you will probably have a difficult time finding any of his other volumes, but Flatland is said to have never been out of print since it was first published in 1884.No need to retell A. Square's big adventures here, other than this bit of dialog between our two-dimensional thinker and his three-dimensional visitor/teacher (Square is given to thoughts of still higher-dimensional worlds):\\"SPHERE. But where is this land of Four Dimensions?[A. Square]. I know not: but doubtless my Teacher knows.SPHERE. Not I. There is no such land. The very idea of it is utterly inconceivable.\\"Abbott offers his allegory of physical and conceptual limits with an economy of word and thought that is nothing less than extraordinary. A great many volumes, five to ten times as large, conclude having said far less than this little parable. Read it. You will take from it what you are willing to take. If you find little or nothing here, you are indeed a citizen of Flatland."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"&quot;Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions,&quot; by Edwin A. Abbott, is a marvelous tale that I regard as a pioneering piece of science fiction. According to the introductory note in the Dover edition, Abbott was an English scholar and clergyman, and the book was first published under a pseudonym in 1884. The book is enhanced by the author's own delightful illustrations.&quot;Flatland&quot; is told in the first person by an intelligent square who lives in a fantastic two-dimensional world. He describes in fascinating detail his own world of Flatland, going into such topics as architecture, war, genetics, medical arts, law, and family values. Particularly fascinating is his account of his society's rigid stratification by class and gender. The square tells of his visions of zero- and one-dimensional worlds, and of his life-changing contact with the three-dimensional world.Abbott succeeds in a task attempted with varying success by generations of science fiction writers since him: he creates an alternate world which is utterly alien, yet disturbingly familiar--a world that is complete and consistently compelling. &quot;Flatland&quot; could certainly be read as a satire of Abbott's own world; parts of it are laugh-out-loud hilarious. Whimsical yet possessing a biting edge, this is a brilliantly conceived and wonderfully written book. For a companion text, try A.K. Dewdney's &quot;The Planiverse&quot; (also about contact between two- and three-dimensional worlds); also try Aldous Huxley's &quot;Brave New World&quot; (an equally intriguing view of a stratified sci-fi culture)."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"Easy on the eyes.As an artist, I have to protect my eyes.

Once again I had to turn to that classic parable of ideas and society, Flatland. My God, he had never heard of it! The story contains some of the most direct metphors in all of literature. Part of the genius of this book is the way its metaphors both illuminate subtle mathematical/scientific concepts and satirize society AT THE SAME TIME.

This book is first and foremost a book on philosophy and a social satire, and secondarily a book on religion.Why?Well, the long running theme is the socio-economic class system of Flatland, which is not simply unjust, but more accurately elitist, and misogynist. Polygons are just metaphors; well-off people get better off more quickly for every successive generation, and low poor working class people are stuck in a perpetual circle of poverty but always wishful to achieve higher status in the next generation.The trips to Lineland, Pointland, and Spaceland illustrate the stubbornness of mankind and the irony of that stubbornness. After his dream that Lineland people and Pointland person are too stupid to accept Flatland, Square himself was regarded as too stupid to accept a higher form, i.e. the Spaceland. The Sphere, in turn, refused to accept an even higher form just after he admonished the Square for refusing to accept a higher form to him.Granted, the details on geometry and polygons and the line on 4th dimension are pretty well-written, but such focuses are brief in this 81 pager, and briefer still when their metaphorical powers are accounted for.

He does it by presenting creatures that live in a two dimensional world and tries to capture their perspective. The battle he faces is that the two dimensional world is in fact imaginary, while the world we live in is real. Points and lines do not have width and the planes they occupy have no depth--yet the creatures he tries to create must have depth in order to exist in the way that we know existence.

I bought four copies of this edition for gifts and had to trash them all. Flatland is a very well written, profound, thought provoking discourse of our inability to comprehend life in more dimentions than the three that we occupy, and it is a shame that this edition, well done in all other aspects, contains this fatal flaw, rendering it junk.

Galileo, who expanded the universe a thousand fold, was put into house arrest by the inquisition...those priests refusing to \\"look through his tube\\" (a telescope). We pay the Edison company for a Nikola Tesla product (the inventor of alternating current). Tesla died almost forgotten and penniless. When demonstrating the first electro-magnetic device, Faraday was asked what good is it? His response, \\"I don't know...what good is a newborn baby? Someday they will learn how to tax it\\". The history and drama of the discoverer is the story of \\"square\\", his newly acquired cosmological knowledge through meeting \\"sphere\\", and what happened when he tried to disclose it to flatlanders. \\"Square\\" was a spacelander in a world of flatlanders."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"Like many readers and reviewers, I heard of Flatland long before I got around to reading it. I expected it to be conversational in tone, but all about the geometry of one, two, three, and four dimensional space. To my surprise, the book is as much about the foibles and prejudices of England's class-based society as it is about the explanation of contemplating more dimensions than one can directly perceive. While it has valuable insights on both dimensional space and class politics and mobility, as well as a light, humorous, conversational tone, the mix is an odd one, and ultimately a combination that is bound to be a bit disappointing to those reading it solely for the math and those reading it solely for the social commentary. A good, ground-breaking book, clearly ahead of its time, but neither a light, pleasant read nor especially deep on the substantive topic. Still, a short, intriguing read for those who like to think about abstract concepts, both mathematical and political. Recommended. Donald J. Bingle, Author of Forced Conversion and GREENSWORD: A Tale of Extreme Global Warming."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"Flatland is a two-dimensional unvierse, inhabited not by people as we know them, but by shapes - triangles, polygons, circles, etc. The narrator, A. Square, introduces the readers to the customs, class distinctions (based on geometric shape), male and female roles, how to tell one another apart, and on general life living in a world of only two dimensions. Square's life is turned upside down when, on the eve of the new millenium, a strange visitor literally drops into his home. This visitor - a Sphere - has chosen Square as his apostle to teach the two-dimensional masses about how more to life there is beyond their flat world view.At first glance, this comes across as a novel about higher math: geometry, 2- and 3-dimensions, the possiblity of higher cimensions after the third, etc. Author Edwin Abbott examines and illustrates what life would be like living in such flat world, in which everyone resembles a straight line - whether the \\"person\\" is a circle, a triangle, or a square - because only one side of them can be seen. On a deeper level, though, Abbott offers a scathing parody of Victorian society. (After all, the book was first published in the late 1880s.) Class distinction based on birth is rampant. The \\"lower\\" beings, such as isocoles triangles and irregular shapes, live in shame and are looked down upon by society. They will never attain the good paying jobs or respectability that those shapes with more sides have. Women are seen as merely lines, very dangerous to society, though, so they must be kept uneducated. Their main purpose is to help their male counterparts achieve higher and higher status through breeding.Quite a remarkable book for its time."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"It's hard to believe that this book was published in 1880. Abbot, the author, was in my eyes, a genius. I read this book and was amazed by several things:1-All the amazing concepts in this book were incredibly easy to understand-even for a high school student. The diagrams included also help a lot. I did not know or understand much about dimensional theory before reading this book, but after, I'm amazed at how much I learned from an amusing book written in the late 1800's.2-This book should not be taken just for its mathematical simpleness and genius, but also for it's amusing writing. The story was funny, often satirical of the Victorian world which Abbot lived in. This is one of the reasons the book was so easy and quick to read-it is interesting in a literary as well as a mathematical sense.3-The book contains no complex math equations involving numbers what-so-ever. It only explains theory in an easy to understand way that does not limit the concept that the author is teaching.These and other details make Flatland one of the best books I have ever read. If you liked Flatland after reading it, also read Sphereland.

The characters of the book are lines and geometric shapes. The main character lives in a two dimensional world, then is exposed to the third dimension. Returning to the second dimension, his heightened knowledge is marginalized. Overall, the book reminds me of Plato's allegory of the cave."},{"Title":"Flatland","review":"The premise of this book is an exploration of a two dimenional world of people of various shapes - - more sides, and sides of equal length imply greater status - - but the shapes are not easily discerned (in a 2d world, you cant float to 'see' a square, because floating means travel in a 3rd dimension). Consequently, the order of the status quo can be difficult to maintain. By extrapolation, these limitations as we imagine them suggest limitations for us. And it's in the suggestions that that I find this book has its particular value. In Flatland, society finds a way to rank people. It's not easy but they do. And whether or not we think that ranking is valid is irrelevant - - it's THEIR ranking. What about ours? Gotta love it!"},{"Title":"Language and Responsibility","review":"A good part of this book may be enjoyed without prior knowledge of Chomsky's linguistic work. I shall quote some highlights. Human language capacity is innate and one should \\"seek to determine the genetically fixed mental structures\\" (p. 95), which will be some sort of \\"universal grammar\\", an abstract essence common to all languages. This is of course very different from blank-slate, functionalist viewpoints. \\"No one finds it outlandish to ask the question: What genetic information accounts for the growth of arms instead of wings? Why should it be shocking to raise similar questions with regard to the brain and mental faculties? ... Nobody would suggest that a group of cells decides that perhaps it would be a good idea to become a heart because such an organ is necessary to pump blood. If this group of cells becomes a heart, it is due to the information present in the genetic code, which determines the structure of the organism.\\" (pp. 84-86). \\"Looking at the history of human intellectual endeavor from this point of view, we find curious things, surprising things. In mathematics certain areas seem to correspond to exceptional human aptitudes: number theory, spatial intuition. Pursuit of these intuitions determined the main line of progress in mathematics, until the end of the nineteenth century, at least. Apparently our mind is capable of handling the abstract properties of number systems, abstract geometry, and the mathematics of the continuum. These are not the absolute limits, but it is probable that we are confined to certain branches of science and mathematics.\\" (pp. 67-68). \\"I should also mention work on the history and philosophy of science ... This work ... has gone well beyond the often artificial models of verification and falsification, which were prevalent for a long time and which exercised a dubious influence on the 'soft sciences,' as the latter did not rest on the foundations of a healthy intellectual tradition that could guide their development. It is useful, in my opinion, for people working in these fields to become familiar with the ways in which the natural sciences have been able to progress; in particular, to recognize how, at critical moments of their development, they have been guided by a radical idealization, a concern for depth of insight and explanatory power rather that by a concern to accommodate 'all the facts' ..., even at times disregarding apparent counterexamples in the hope ... that subsequent insights would explain them.\\" (p. 73)."},{"Title":"Language and Responsibility","review":"Chomsky as an academic is a pain at times in so far as writing style is concerned though the more i read the more i can agree with him though he remains an enigma tp mos but especially to the generally brainwashed American public where he has wrongfully been demonized."},{"Title":"Hal's Magical Cruise-Alaska: Alaska, the Inside Passage","review":"Very fun book!

It's refreshing to see the male nude treated with a real eye for form, shape and texture."},{"Title":"Men Two","review":"Men Two follows much the same format and style as Klaus Gerhart's Embracing Men book. The theme is young athletic nude men, usually photographed in isolation against natural settings. Sometimes he photographs two men together, but mostly the men are alone and their shape is contrasted against nature such as showing the muscles of young man's legs against the twisted image of drift wood or the curves of a young man's butt against the sand dunes that mirror or repeat the same curves. Thus the photographer reveals his philosophy that male beauty is a natural phenomena to be enjoyed and viewed the same way that any beautiful object in nature may be viewed. Remember that in some cultures, people may admire trees, rocks, waves, clouds, insects, animals, and all manner of nature but the human form is viewed as forbidden, sinful, shameful and not to be admired for it evokes lust. The issue here is that Gerhart would probably say that lust is a natural phenomena, just the same as admiration for human beauty. Another clue as to the artistic philosophy of Gerhart is that the face is often not emphasized and more emphasis is placed on the body. This removes the photographs from the realm of portrait and recognizability. The human figures are sometimes dwarfted by the natural settings, again speaking to the role of man in this natural world.The work is beautiful, with around 60 to 80 photographs in black and white. I admire Gerhart's ability to integrate the beautiful male into his work while maintaining a steady esthetic vision. Never really commercial, despite the beauty of the models, the works remain fine art."},{"Title":"Duets #44 (Excuse Me? Whose Baby?/Follow That Baby)","review":"&quot;Excuse Me?

Few knew he was paying tribute to another writer, now almost forgotten, who wrote about the mean streets of London's Docks around 1900. In TALES OF MEAN STREETS, CHILD OF THE JAGO, and THE HOLE IN THE WALL, Arthur Morrison wrote about the world into which he was born. (Interestingly, he also wrote some great detective novels at the same time that Doyle was writing his Sherlock Holmes stories.)Some of the stories in TALES OF MEAN STREETS seem sentimental today: There is no lurid sex, the cursing is subject to the &quot;code&quot; of Queen Victoria's day, and much of the violence takes place off stage. If you accept the givens of that day, you will enjoy Morrison; and you will see how the American detective novel and the film noir owe far more to Morrison than to Conan Doyle or anyone else. Morrison deserved to be remembered and honored."},{"Title":"The Case of Charles Dexter Ward","review":"The Case of Charles dexter Ward -which remained unpublished during H. P. L. 's lifetime- is certainly one of the most readable and enjoyable efforts of the old gentleman from Providence, even for people who are not addicted to &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot; role-playing games and similar items about which Grandpa Theobald would probably have been both rather amused and irritated.The story, unfolding slowly but with an ever increasing pace, revolves around the uncanny relation between one Charles Dexter Ward -a young antiquarian of an old Providence family, quite an alter ego of Lovecraft himself- and his ancestor Joseph Curwen, a Salem warlock from the 17th century. The descriptions of old Providence and its surroundings are exceedingly beautiful and graphic and reveal much of H. P. L. 's affection for his hometown. The story, of course, also has its great moments of cosmic fear, and the accounts of the good people of Providence's raid against Joseph Curwen and that of Dr. Willett, the avuncular and benevolent medical doctor of Ward's family, descending into the sheer abyss of horror (without even a drop of blood being splattered) belong to the most frightening and effective episodes in all of horror literature.Lovecraft delves deeply into occult lore and black magic, much more so than in most of his other stories, where he mainly relies on some name-dropping, usually of the Great Old Ones and his own invented grimoires (like the Necronomicon &amp; Cie.) to provide a touch of witchcraft, but he does it with utmost effectiveness, in total contrast to many of his contemporaries (and successors). The reason for this is certainly that he was a complete non-believer concerning anything supernatural.The way the ever increasing atmosphere of threat and madness is built up is masterful, even though the end of the story is not really a surprise for an intelligent reader (especially anyone used to Lovecraft's work, which almost never offers that kind of thrill, &quot;The shadow over Innsmouth&quot; being probably the only noteworthy exception). Nevertheless he manages to keep a tantalizing amount of uncertainty for quite a while, much more so than, e. g., in the much-admired &quot;The shadow out of time&quot;.The so-called Cthulhu Mythos plays only a very minor role in &quot;The Case&quot;. To give an example -for those cthulhuoid guys out there- I fully agree with S. T. Joshi who once admitted that he never could really figure out what Yog-Sothoth exactly meant in this novel (does anybody know what it really meant in any H. P. L. story, by the way ? I don't talk about August Derleth's and Lin Carter's kids and grannies versions of the Mythos, which have become so well-liked by most of the would-be Lovecraftians. Except for Cthulhu himself, H. P. L. always kept a veil over the deities of his pantheon).The novel offers everything you can excpect from the undoubted master of the macabre in the 20th century, suspense, chills &amp; thrills and all-out horror, but in a subtler and more convincing way than in most of his earlier and some of his later works. A recommendable book for everybody interested in good, well-(love)crafted horror stories, and certainly not only of historical interest."},{"Title":"The Case of Charles Dexter Ward","review":"This is HPL's greatest work, bar none.

It is not directly focused on terrible, grothesque monsters, like so many other stories, but concentrate on the absolute evil of a man and his dark magic (witch, of course, has its source in the Mythos). The tale of how young Charles Dexter Ward is fooled by the promises of power offered him by evil forces, and of how the courageous doctor desperately tries to uncover the truth about the youth's physical and personal change will give you ice-cold shivers all the way through. The lenght of the novel gave Lovecraft the opportunity to develop more personal characters than in his shorter stories, and this provide the tale with a &quot;real&quot; touch, witch is quite rare when it comes to Lovecraft.

Although I knew about 40 pages before the end how it wasgoing to end, it was still a hair-raiser. Something to be savored morethan once (I've read it five times)."},{"Title":"The Case of Charles Dexter Ward","review":"A critic once said that whereas Lovecraft fails as literature, it succeeds as psychological case-history. Lovecraft stories are all the same -- the same horrible monsters squish wetly down from the attic/up from the basement in response to the same predictable incantations of occult lore. Having said that, the critic notes that when all the hysterical words of eldritch and unspeakable cliche have been stripped away, there still lurks a residuum of power. And so it is with this novella -- perhaps the best worked-out of all HPL's weird stories. If you don't like creaky tales of horror, you'll hate this. But if you are into spine-tingling atmosphere and don't mind the over-wrought prose, you'll love it. You won't be able to put it down. The story will stick fast in your brain and cycle round and round as if to the idiot pipers of Nyarlathotep until it drives you MAD and you are reduced to a gibbering THING capable of uttering only the dread syllables YOG SOTHOTH! YOG SOTHOTH!"},{"Title":"The Case of Charles Dexter Ward","review":"Read 'em all! They beat the hell out of anything being written today. Stephen King and Clive Barker and them got nothing on ole H.P.

Here Lovecraft used all his talent to freak all his readers with a diabolic scheme filled with a frightful environment full of madness! Here the main character has discovered through Joseph Curwen's manuscripts (An ancient resident involved with macabre subjects) some obscurities of the underworld. The more he gets involved with those things, the more he changes in a queer and sinister way. All the facts about the terrible deeds of Mr. Curwen and Charles's insane behavior are described step by step by a third person (Charles's doctor, Mr. Willett).Lovecraft doesn't used to write long stories, but he made it perfectly. I grant this a masterpiece title and it's the best of his works I ever read!"},{"Title":"The Case of Charles Dexter Ward","review":"What is amazing about THE CASE OF CHARLES DEXTER WARD is that what we have of it is a rough draft that was never polished or readied for publication. The history of its discovery is wonderful. One half of the MS was discovered among Lovecraft's papers, and eventually the second half was discovered. It's first publication (abridged) was in WEIRD TALES. The text we have in this convenient mass market edition is corrupt due to poor editing on the part of August Derleth. (The best paperback edition of the novel may be found in the Penguin Classics edition, THE THING ON THE DOORSTEP AND OTHER WEIRD STORIES, in which the corrected text is graced with 170 [!!!] annotations in the notes at the back of the book. That edition is available here at Amazon.)Lovecraft has been criticized as unable to create character -- but that is pure nonsense. Each character in this novel is superbly portrayed, distinct and fascinating. We learn exactly what we need to know about each character for the novel to move toward its macabre climax. The character of Joseph Curwen is stunning, and the legend of his life before his neoteric resurrection is haunting and hypnotic. The tragedy of Charles Ward's fate, though subtly expressed, is deeply felt, as is the effect of his alteration on his unhappy parents.The supernatural has never been dealt with in such an interesting and unique way. The suggestions concerning Yog-Sothoth and the properties with which this daemon are composed are tantalizing indeed. Most of all, the portrait of Lovecraft's beloved city of Providence is poignant and heartfelt. This is a classic of supernatural fiction, and this small book, although not the corrected text, is a handy edition to carry around in one's pocket. Michael Whelan's cover art for this series has long been a favourite of mine. High recommended!"},{"Title":"The Case of Charles Dexter Ward","review":"For fear is around the corner. For Howard Phillips Lovecraft, death was never a worry. For many of the characters in his books, death was almost a relief from the torture. It was fear and madness that was always being confronted head on. The mind of man is quite fragile when placed in situation of unexpected terror. And Charles Dexter Ward, occultist and antiquarian is no exception. Ward was a quiet man who moved into his great great grandfathers house eventually to investigate his past. Set in New England to give it the right mixture of genuine fright and eeriness. Lovecrafts masterful style, remiscent of Por, is gorgeous, rich in detail and content. Full of information on the history of New England. One can get the sense that Lovecraft knew his locales almost better than his characters. Aside from his historical geography, Lovecraft also had a very good understanding of occultism and the ancient languages of Hebrew, Latin and Greek. Well versed in many of the ancient texts. Of course, this book also brings out the controversial book the 'Necronomicon.' Some of the finest in horror written to date that will make you squeamish with fear, for the most part without the blood and guts. The imagination is more powerful than the written word, and Lovecraft knows this as well."},{"Title":"The Case of Charles Dexter Ward","review":"Charles Dexter Ward is a young man in Providence, RI who is fascinated by antiquities --- too fascinated, perhaps. He becomes obsessed with an ancestor, an alleged warlock named Joseph Curwen who escaped persecution in Salem over 200 years before and fled to Providence. A unusually long-lived ancestor, I might add.If you aren't used to reading Lovecraft, or other writers of the same time period, the language and writing style might be a little tough at first, but it is well worth getting into. Lovecraft leaves a lot to the imagination of the reader --- a device that works quite well in this story.This is one of my favorite novellas --- actually, one of my favorite stories, even. I first read when I was in high school, and I have re-read it every few years ever since. I re-read it again a couple of days ago and I still love it. This is Lovecraft at his best."},{"Title":"The Case of Charles Dexter Ward","review":"The Case of Charles Dexter Ward has long been one of my favorite books. Charles Ward is an intellectual young recluse steeped in antiquarianism (much as Lovecraft himself was) who discovers horrible secrets about a distant ancestor, one consciously expunged from public records and histories at the end of his ill-begotten life. Ward engulfs himself in a genealogical and historical pursuit of knowledge of this man, a passion all the more emblazoned by each mysterious discovery he makes. This ancestor, Joseph Curwen, was reputably a dabbler in the black arts who fled from Salem in advance of the remarkable witchcraft trials in that town. Finding refuge in Providence, he lived a reclusive, mysterious life, made even more mysterious by his eternally youthful appearance. A recluse by nature, he spent most nights at a farmhouse in Pawtuxet. A continuing series of terrible cries and noises detected from that farmhouse, in conjunction with a number of missing locals and rumors of brutality against Negro slaves surreptitiously brought to that abode culminated in a raid by local citizens determined to put an end to whatever monstrous acts the strange man was committing. No member of that raiding party ever dared discuss what he saw or heard during that awful night. Ward's knowledge of Curwen is greatly advanced when he discovers an old painting of him (revealing a face virtually identical to his own) and a set of personal papers hidden behind that painting. He then launches into terrible studies of the occult at home and abroad, then returns home to put to use the arcane secrets he has learned. His doctor and father eventually grasp the nature of Ward's actions and unite themselves in a determination to block Joseph Curwen's ancient ambitions and plans to once more walk the earth with the aid of his great-great-great grandson. The horrors they encounter in the pursuit of this objective are richly described and deliciously gruesome.This story is pretty much straight horror with no deeply mythological overtones beyond those of necromancy. Lovecraft does an excellent job of always pushing the action along while providing a rich, deep, historical background of both Curwen and young Charles Ward. The ending chapter contains some of Lovecraft's most terror-inducing, menacingly evil scenes and is not to be missed by those with a gratuitous admiration for the macabre. For those readers who find the Cthulhu Mythos stories too strangely remote and otherworldly, this novella provides a more practical, more individualistic vision of horror sure to affect the reader more viscerally than do mysterious references to the Ancient Ones. Anyone considering reading Lovecraft for the first time would do well to make this book his introduction to the master of horror. This is everything a horror story should be."},{"Title":"The Case of Charles Dexter Ward","review":"Although The Case Of Charles Dexter Ward is one of the few old-fashioned horror books I have read, I found it quite interesting. The plot isn't as far-fetched as so many plots of modern-day horror stories are, but it's still fiction. The horror/action doesn't unfold too early in the story, but when it does you won't stop reading. The descriptions, in the book, of different regions are so clear and imaginable you will be able to draw pictures and design maps. The ending is unique, almost predictable, that's what makes you want to hurry-up and finish the book. Another thing I like about the book is the use of language. I think it goes perfect with the setting even though I had to read some lines over in order to understand them. To write this book in modern-day language would set it apart from other horror stories in that it wouldn't be as good."},{"Title":"The Case of Charles Dexter Ward","review":"This is one of THE Lovecraft stories to read alongside The Call of Cthulhu, At the Mountains of Madness, The Dunwich Horror, and The Shadow Over Innsmouth. No one writes horror like Lovecraft. His cold and analytical style somehow makes his works even more terrifying. It may be the shock of the rational scientific minds of his character's seeing something that goes beyond explanation that makes his stories so jolting, or the horrifying results of what happens to those rational, scientific, and inquisitive characters, like Charles Dexter Ward, who seek the truth and discover too much of it. But maybe the reason Lovecraft is so scary is because all positive human emotions such as love are abandoned leaving only fear. The Case of Charles Dexter Ward is chock full of fear and little else as it takes you through the paranoia of the American colonial days, through the degeneration of a young man's sanity, and through the ancient catacombs of an old house where something inhuman screams from the bottom of a pit. The mystery aspect of the story isn't too hard to figure out, but that may not have been so back in the 1930's when it was first written, but the journey is absolutely terrifying. Lovecraft puts pure fear on paper and that's something no modern horror writer I can think of has been able to do since."},{"Title":"The Case of Charles Dexter Ward","review":"Lovecraft definitely proves his worth as a flat-out horror writer with this tale of necromancy, intergenerational creepiness, and New England spookery. Modern readers will find it more Blair-Witch style scary than Freddy/Jason style gruesome, but in my book that can be a good thing. (And for you purists, yeah, it's much better than BWP, I'm just trying to draw an analogy here.)The one big fault to be found is that an alert fan may be able to guess the ending before it's time, but that's not strictly old H.P.'s fault, but more to be laid at the feet of the hordes of imitators who have made some of his best ideas into cliches."},{"Title":"The Case of Charles Dexter Ward","review":"This is the type of story that you sit back and imerse yourself in the setting. With each new tid bit of information the horror of Joseph Curwen becomes clearer and clearer. The final chapter however sent chills down my spine, as Dr Willet searches through Curwen's undergroud, antedeluvian laboratory. The dank putrid odors, the slime green walls, and the horrific wailing from the darkness... the build up is phenominal, and the pay off will have you sleeping with your lights on!Great read, you will go back to it again and again."},{"Title":"The Case of Charles Dexter Ward","review":"Others have summarized the plot of this excellent story better than I can; I just wanted to mention two things: this is one of, if not the longest Lovecraft work (and the best-structured of his longer works), and it was made (adapted) into a fair-to-middling movie called The Haunted Palace in the early 60's, starring Vincent Price and, I believe, Debra Padgett. I think they had run out of Poe stories."},{"Title":"The Case of Charles Dexter Ward","review":"This was the very first book I read, written by Howard Philips Lovecraft.A friend had tipped me about H.P.

Don't expect to find words describing the unspeakable horror for this is truly a work which employs the creativity of imagination to evoke the chill of dread at discovery of quintessential evil.

Know the answer to what turns one's hair white prematurely!"},{"Title":"The Case of Charles Dexter Ward","review":"If you want really classic Lovecraft at the top of his form, then this novel is it. It is a good, tight, driven read- except for the extensive prose tour of his beloved old Providence near the beginning. Yet, even this detailed introduction helps to weave an unmatched atmosphere that draws you deeply into Lovecraft's world. This is an ode to Providence, and to those unobtrusive and unlikely heroes that would keep it safe from cosmic evil.Lovecraft carries us from colonial days to the \\"modern\\" 1920's in this tale. We are introduced to the hidden brotherhood of dark magicians and necromancers- those to seek to wield unnatural power from beyond the grave and beyond the stars. So much concentrated occult information, or rather enticing hints of such information, is packed into the narrative. Mystery within mystery unfolds. Yet, it is rather ordinary men that are called upon to confront this inconceivable evil, even though it threatens their very sanity.Besides being an extremely well written tale of supernatural suspense it also serves as a teaching tale. There is madness out of time and a horror from beyond the spheres that threatens to entrap and destroy the unwary. Do not call up what ye lack the power to put down. Upon this depends more than can be put into words- all civilization, all natural law, perhaps the fate of the solar system and the universe. Perhaps even more than this- all because one fool opened a door and there was no one there with the knowledge to close it..."},{"Title":"The Case of Charles Dexter Ward","review":"Perhaps a bit of this novel's history might not be amiss. _The Case of Charles Dexter Ward_ is a 48,000 word novel that Lovecraft wrote in 1927. It is his longest work. A handwritten copy of the manuscript languished in HPL's files while he puttered around with an essay on the supernatural and a travel book on Canada (for which he was paid nothing). Several publishers had expressed an interest in a novel by Lovecraft. But he did not want to bother with the rigors of typing and revising the work. After Lovecraft's death in 1937, the manuscript was discovered in sections. It was serialized in the May and July 1941 issues of _Weird Tales_. It has since been published as a solo novel or as a part of various collections. I have read that the current version of the novel is faulty because of August Derleth's editing, but I reserve judgement on this issue._The Case of Charles Dexter Ward_ is one of Lovecraft's better stories, but it requires a certain amount of patience to appreciate. A supernatural horror novel by Theodore Sturgeon, Fritz Leiber, Ray Bradbury, Stephen King, or Ramsey Campbell usually has a fair amount of narrative action. Characters act and react with the supernatural forces throughout the novel. Think of _The Dreaming Jewels_, _Conjure Wife_, _Something Wicked This Way Comes_, _It_, and _Hellraiser_. The Lovecraft novel doesn't have a lot of action, and it gets off to a rather slow start. Instead, it has historical accounts, letters, medical reports, diary entries, and newspaper quotations. Not exactly spicy reading on the face of it. But they provide authenticity and detail. Slowly, slowly, a little bit at a time, Lovecraft makes his horror real. When he pulls out all the stops at the end, the results are completely believable.The story itself involves a modern young man with antiquarian tastes (much like Lovecraft himself) who becomes fascinated with an eighteenth century ancestor of his named Joseph Curwin who was suspected of black necromancy. He retreats into a laboratory, and his behavior becomes more and more bizarre. Only Dr. Willett, the family doctor, suspects that Charles Dexter Ward is not quite as insane as most people think. Blended into the mix are Ward's parent's, a frightened butler, an unwholesome portrait, some sinister servants, ghoulish goings-on in the local cemetery, attacks by wolflike creatures, books of spells, and the bodies of strange creatures washed up on the Providence Bay rocks.Sometimes Lovecraft's sense of delicacy misfires. When he discusses a ghoulish discovery made by some truck hi-jackers, he says: \\"It would not be well for the national-- or even the international-- sense of decorum if the public were ever to know what was uncovered by that awestruck party\\" (76). We learn little more about it. But at other times, his sense of the old-fashioned can be appropriately creepy. Here is Dr. Willett observing a possessed Ward:It was not wholesome to know so much about the way the fat sheriff's wig fell off as he leaned over at the play at Mr. Douglass's Histrionick Academy in King's Street on the eleventh of February, 1762, which fell on a Thursday; or about how the actors cut the text of Steele's \\"Conscious Lover\\" so badly that one was almost glad the Baptist-ridden legislature closed the play two weeks later. That Thomas Sabin's coach was \\"damned uncomfortable\\" old letters may well have told; but what healthy antiquarian could recall how the creaking of Epenitus Olney's new signboard (the gaudy Crown he set up after calling his tavern the Crown Coffee House) was exactly like the first few notes of the new jazz piece all the radios in Pawtuxet were playing? (83)The action of the story is in and around Lovecraft's native Providence, Rhode Island. It is an asset. Lovecraft knows the town-- its buildings, its legends, its history. Realism of setting helps to make the fantastic elements seem credible. Yes, it is old-fashioned. But it is worth your attention. I believe that it is the best of HPL's long pieces of writing."},{"Title":"The Case of Charles Dexter Ward","review":"The Case of Charles Dexter Ward ranks as one of Lovecraft's best stories he ever wrote. Unlike some of Lovecraft's other stories, which are nothing more than incoherent ramblings about elder gods and old ones, this short novel actually has a plot, and is very engrossing. While at first the novel seems quite straightforward and almost boring, there soon comes many different plot twists, all of which kept me guessing until the very end. And also, unlike other Lovecraft tales, this one wrapped up in the end, with a decent conclusion. You have to read this novel in order to see Lovecraft's fiction at it's best."},{"Title":"The Case of Charles Dexter Ward","review":"At 48,000 words, this is the longest tale that H.P. Lovecraft ever wrote. It is also his best.This novel has both good plotting and an otherworldly atmosphere that pervades the book. The setting is 1920's New England where there was a revival in interest in the occult. However, the key to the tale is the 18th Century New England scene that Lovecraft had a lifetime interest in.The character of Charles Dexter Ward was based on Lovecraft himself: a lonely intellectual who was an antiquarian who detested the Industrial Revolution. Ward's research into the occult leads to the reincarnation of one of his ancestors who in turn hatches a plot with both Ward and one of Ward's friends for a mass resurrection of the dead who would become mindless zombies dedicated to both the destruction of heavy industry in America as well as the forced expulsion, if not mass murder, of the Roman Catholic immigrants who Lovecraft detested so much from America.The Case of Charles Dexter Ward is a fantasy/horror novel that tells you a lot about its author. H.P. Lovecraft was a self-styled aristocrat from a decadent Old Money family who bitterly hated the Roman Catholic Church and especially the Irish and Italian immigrants who by 1928, when this novel was first published, had already assumed a position of political power at the expense of the WASP elite that Lovecraft was a member of. Clearly, The Case of Charles Dexter Ward was reflective of Lovecraft's religious bigotry and his hateful tendencies towards certain ethnic and religious groups. It should come as no surprise that during the 1930's, Lovecraft frequently praised Adolf Hitler and the Nazis.The Case of Charles Dexter Ward is a uniquely powerful and compelling work by a master of horror fantasy."},{"Title":"The Case of Charles Dexter Ward","review":"The impact of this novel is materially diminished by its reliance on obsolete paradigms of the previous century. Science seeks to reanimate creatures of the past not with incantations, wall inscriptions and the usual mumbo gumbo of witchcraft and sorcery, but with the information storing capacity of DNA macromolecules and cellular implants. In Lovecraft's works, as in certain scriptural references, matter is endowed only with minimal capacities to create the inorganic realm - but living creatures need to have the influence of nonmaterial spiritual influences from BEYOND. Lovecraft hints at methods and materials used in the &quot;experiments&quot; he describes, but relies too heavily on &quot;fancy&quot; language to create atmosphere...a practice losing its impact after frequent repetition. This novel also develops much too slowly......the material would have fit more comfortably in a short story or a novelette. In addition, I think H. P. might have started writing a handbook for tour guides of Providence, R. I. and took a sudden turn on Route 2 in Cranston. The thought is amusing to this writer to consider the REAL Providence and its appeal - consisting until recent times - mainly of sidewalk art of prostrate bodies, being accosted by pan-handling bums, or rats scurrying about freely in daylight along the canal. In spite of these comments I would recommend this book. Read this volume and then go for a walk in the environs described therein ---watch out for &quot;incomplete&quot; rats......"},{"Title":"The Case of Charles Dexter Ward","review":"The impact of this novel is materially diminished by its reliance on obsolete paradigms of the previous century.

The fact that there is no central character with which one can associate and sympathise is one of the worst features of The Case Of Charles Dexter Ward for it prevents the reader from being involved in the story (something that the horror novel needs to do to captivate the reader).Still, I believe that this book is worth reading (127 quick pages).

We both together tried some things out!!! We made several different very effective weapons.Quite a bit of shuriken, nunchaku, yari, tetsubishi, and ninja-to. They do work out very effective!!! I would highly recommend this book to anyone who needs weapons to practice or whatever, and cannot afford ones in magazines. Also, I do agree that these weapons if made correctly, are of much betterquality than the manufactured. This book gives you step-by-stepdirections, how to measure the weapon correctly, temper and heat the blades, also what kind of material to use. Both Traditional and some modernized versions. It has everything from the Ninja-To, Tanto, Shuriken, Yari, Nunchaku, Tetsubishi,Kusari-gama, Kusari-fundo, Kyoketsu-shoge, etc.Also, some more exotic examples of some of these weapons.Again, I would highly recommend this book for anyone who is interested in making ninja weapons as a career, or if you need a fast way to get practice equipment, or collect them, etc.I hope you all will like this book as we have!!! Good Luck!!!"},{"Title":"Secret Guide to Making Ninja Weapons (B-102)","review":"The tidbits of history that accompany most of the weapon instructions and in the Forward are educational and interesting.The Samurai were the wealthy warriors of feudal Japan. Throughout the history of the world, we see the powerful subjugating the weak. To combat this, the Koga Ninja, who were the poor farmers and could be put to death for owning any kind of weaponry, became the black clad secretive, silent Ninja. These warriors learned to create weapons from whatever material was available -- wherever they were; often hiding them in many different stashes around the farms.Their weapons had to be inexpensive, easy to make, and disposable if the need arose. This is one of the most important factors in the weapon designs from the Koga Ninja. Why? &quot;Concern for losing a weapon might cause one to hesitate, and at that moment of hesitation might cost the Ninja his or her life.&quot; (Toshitora Yamashiro, Forward to &quot;Secret Guide to Making Ninja Weapons.&quot;)All weapons are extremely dangerous. The black and white photographs of Ninjas holding the weapons, and of these lethal tools, show how to carry, defend, or attack with them. These weapons have the ability to maim or kill the Ninja warrior who is practicing if they are used incorrectly.It is imperative for a Ninjutsu to study under a master. Do not take the patterns and create weapons that you do not have the skills or knowledge to use. The Master teaches how to use each weapon, and the concentration, dedication, and spiritual growth required for a true Ninja.I cannot stress the need for training enough..... The photographs of Ninja, information about the various weapons, the metallurgy, searching junkyards for components, and the patterns and directions to make them are the details that add veracity to fiction, fantasy, and history books; they allow the reader to suspend disbelief and trust the writer.Why would a warrior choose a To or Tanto instead of a Yari?The To, approximately thirty-six inches long, is a sword. It is the weapon that no Koga Ninja would be without; this means if a Ninja had to abandon the To in the process of completing a mission and escape, it would be the first weapon that was created when he or she had found safety.The Tanto is the assassin's dagger. This sharp blade was designed to penetrate armor and is often painted for camouflage, as are many of the other weapons. Directions include how to make a scabbard for the To and Tanto. The Yari is a spear that is used as a thrusting weapon. The spearhaft is generally five feet long, but can be as long as twenty feet, which would require both strength and skill to manipulate. In movies we see martial arts experts grabbing poles for defensive/aggressive maneuvers -- this is a lot more deadly.The next weapons are of the Kusari class. Though they all begin with a length of chain, the Kusari Fundo (Manrikgusari) is the simplest weapon to make. The Kusari Gama requires a sickle while the Shoge adds a spiked blade. The Nunchaku adds two metal rods and uses a shorter chain.Blow guns, Tetsu-Bishi (flat four pointed star) and Shuriken (several star weapons the fit together like a puzzle to form a deadly ball) are described in detail. These are often shown in movies. The perfect Ninja throws the Tetsu-Bishi with the ease that most of us think about when skipping stones across a lake -- though I've only achieved that feat a few times.I will never make a weapon. I do not practice Ninjutsu, but the heroes and heroines in my stories, particularly the S/F trilogy I am writing, do. Writing with detailed information is imperative. Research is what turns good writing into great stories.This book is not one that I would ever willingly give up. It is five stars and more -- depending on the writer, the genre, and scenes.Victoria Tarrani"},{"Title":"Secret Guide to Making Ninja Weapons (B-102)","review":"This book is disgustingly bad and a good way to get yourself killed or arrested. This book was written during the ninja boom of the 80's by a karatedoka(note his use of the word \\"koga\\" people from the region of Shiga which is the modern name for that area use a different pronunciation, the \\"koga\\" spelling is used by people who know nothing about the area or its inhabitants) donning a fake Japenese name and black pajamas to jump on the band wagon. Not only is 99% of the info in this book inaccurate, but making weapons is a very specific skill that takes decades of training.

They'll remember to never hold your breath while scuba diving and not to exceed ascend rates or bottom times. However, a few individuals want to know more about the underlying science of diving, and they should read Diving Science by Doctors Michael Strauss and Igor S. Aksenov who are both hyperbaric medicine experts as well as experienced divers.Diving Science is sort of a mix between medical textbook and general purpose reading for an interested non-medical audience. The writing style is clear and concise so that it can easily be understood, but it never talks down to the reader. Expect a good share of medical terms and terminology, but everything is well explained and illustrated. The overall purpose of the book is to help divers anticipate, recognize, understand, and react to the physical, physiological and psychological stresses encountered in recreational diving.Diving Science is organized into three major sections:The first -- The Underwater Environment -- explains the basics of diving, not unlike what one learns in a diving certification course but with considerably more detail.The second -- Physiological Responses to the Underwater Environment -- describes in detail how the various parts of the human body react to diving: heart and vascular system, the respiratory system, blood and muscles, and how the body reacts in cold water, how it best moves and orients itself. This section also contains fascinating comparisons betwen human divers and diving mammals. For example, did you know they breathe out before they dive, not in?The third, and longest, section deals with the Medical Aspects of Sports Diving. That includes medical preparation, fitness and nutrition, and then the numerous potential problems a diver may encounter on the surface, while descending, while at the bottom, and while ascending. This third part reads a bit more like a medical textbook but frequent Bringing it all Together summaries that describe real world scenarios help readers understand.The book closes with an excellent Diving Medicine from A to Z appendix that concisely describes numerous diving facts, and reference sections on diving organizations, medical texts and manuals, recommended equipment and supplies, a very detailed glossary, suggested reading, and even a list of luminaries in diving medicine.Overall, Diving Science should be required reading for anyone who wants to know more about the medical and scientific aspects of diving than what is included in the certification class manuals. While there is a lot of medical detail, readers also learn numerous interesting facts and statistics as well as how all this science affects divers in specific real world scenarios."},{"Title":"Diving Science","review":"Strauss and Aksenov, both experts in the field of diving, have gathered an amazing number of hard to find facts to incorporate in this book. There are statistics and facts in this volume of which most people in the diving business are unaware. It is well organized and a vignette or case history at the end of each section entitled \\"Putting it all together\\" illustrates in a practical manner how the material presented relates to the real world. Most Scuba students do not learn the science of diving, or the details of the pathology of embolism or bends. Scuba instructors have enough to teach proper diving technique and do not wish to dwell on material that might frighten potential customers. This book supplies all the information the average diver might want to know. The reader is led through the psychological problems of diving and divers, problems on the surface and the descent, factors influencing the diver while on the bottom and potential problems encountered on the ascent. There is also an excellent section on hypothermia, what the limits are and what the diver can do about it. This important subject is not even mentioned in the typical Scuba diving course sylabus. The book also has a chapter dealing with marine animals and mangagement of injuries including envenomations. For the Scuba instructor this book is a superb reference source for answers to the surprising questions Scuba students often ask. The book is well indexed. The authors are to be commended. I give it five stars!Eric P. Kindwall, M.D."},{"Title":"Diving Science","review":"The book \\"Diving Science\\" is the best source I have found for understanding divers and scuba related injury and illness. It is detailed enough to provide an excellent understanding of why certain events occur and organized so that it can be used as a quick reference when an emergency physician is evaluating a patient for the potential of diving related pathology. One might think this resource should only be included in the basic reference library of emergency departments near the ocean, but scuba is a rapidly expanding sport in fresh water as well as salt water. In addition, because a plane flight can precipitate a diving related problem, every emergency physician, regardless of where he or she works, will need to confront the possibility of diving related pathology. \\"Diving Science\\" is enjoyable and useful reading for any physician with a sense of curiosity and the drive to continue to learn. I strongly recommend this book as a primary emergency department resource.Gary Moreau, M.D."},{"Title":"Diving Science","review":"\\"DIVING SCIENCE\\" is an outstanding resource book for both professional and recreational diver's. It serves as my personal \\"Diver's Bible.\\" I considered the book important enough, with reespect to diving safety, that I presented a copy to the Diving Medical Doctor for the Island of Maui, Hawaii - one of world's top diving destinations. I am particularly impressed with the book layout and ease of reference; the presentation of material is exceptionally clear and concise. The chapter previews, images and diagrams are also convenient. \\"DIVING SCIENCE\\" should be recognized as a model for all other practical science manuals!John Dunbar, Adventure Enthusiast and U.S. Navy SEAL (retired)"},{"Title":"Diving Science","review":"Drs Strauss and Aksenov have achieved a remarkable coup. They have written a rigorously scientific book, but still made it understandable to the diving lay person. If you flunked Science 101, don't be put off by the \\"Science\\" in the title. You will love this book. It is meticulously set out with illustrations and tables that make the text even more clear. The language is friendly, with explanations -in plain English-of terms that might be new to the reader. The medical subject matter is carefully handled, so that conditions can be understood in the context of physiology. It clearly explains the rationale for treatment .I referred a recreational diver with a problem to this book. She got a clear understanding of her alternobaric vertigo, the physiology behind the problem, and thus the reason for the way to prevent it.The subject matter covered is comprehensive, well referenced and indexed. It would be of interest not only to diving or medical professionals but makes great reading for the recreational diver who wants to know more than basic training. A nice touch is the \\"Further Review\\" in the form of questions to test comprehension of the chapter content.This is an outstanding volume and most readable for the interested lay person. It would also make a great introductory text for students of hyperbaric medicine who need a good overview of the subject of Diving Science."},{"Title":"Diving Science","review":"While still in dive class this was my first dive book. I am reasonably intelligent with a medical background yet deficient in grasping the concepts of science. This was exactly what I was looking for to explain dive physiology on a level far above the lowest common denominator yet I could grasp the relationships in this unique and alien environment. I recommend it every opportunity asked and feel Conrad H. Blickenstorfer review has captured the essence extremely well."},{"Title":"Diving Science","review":"I purchased this book to give me more information on the science of scuba diving for my Dive Con and Dive Instructor courses.The book give detailed information on the various theories, gas laws and how they interact with the human body. Examples of real life stories are also given.If you are interested in get truly advanced knowledge of the effects of scuba diving on the body, I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Diving Science","review":"Be ready for that dive emergency that nobody sees coming. Belive me when I say it's coming sooner than you think."},{"Title":"Diving Science","review":"This book is very good if you want to understand what goes on in your body when you dive. It takes the form of comparative physiology; what are the adaptations that diving mammals have, which humans do not. The book is well written (not too heavy in the sciences)so that the non-science minded individual can understand it. It also has good diagrams. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a greater understanding of the effects of increasing pressure (with depth) on the various organ systems within the body."},{"Title":"Diving Science","review":"In summary, book is great, rich with original information not so common to find in similar literature. It's intended for far too advanced readers, it's a good repository to have it if you are a medical doctor or so, or doing some research on the subject, it's great for learning and for references. It's generaly not for sport divers. I myself like it very much for all the data I found in it, becouse it feeds my couriosity."},{"Title":"Diving Science","review":"Poorly organized content as well as scarce and bland illustrations make this book not worth its money. In addition to following a totally unintuitive and strange organization, the information presented is superficial and, if I had to guess, 20 years outdated in many places. Also, the authors completely dropped the ball on providing references in the text, an oversight that is inexcusable in such a dynamic and ever-changing field as dive medicine. The only reason I gave two instead of one stars is that the chapters do include real-world examples of the material covered, mostly in the form of diving incidents and accidents. However, when I wanted to learn the latest and greatest about nitrogen narcosis, for example, the entry on wikipedia turned out to far outperform the chapter in this book. Personally, I would not buy this book again and don't recommend it."},{"Title":"Diving Science","review":"What this book does well is the section on the physics of diving - maybe because it hasn't changed much over the years. But the standard training manuals from BSAC, NAUI, PADI etc do a good job of this too, so (unless you don't have your course materials) it's not worth spending $[...] for redundant information.I had high hopes for this book, based on the other Amazon reviews. And when I started to write this, my intent was to ultimately recommend it too. However when I realized how outdated the bibliography was, I changed my mind.Specifically...1) The large font (seems to be a feature of Human Kinetics Press - the otherwise excellent 'Scuba Diving Safety' from HKP is the same) immediately reminded me of those large print books for old people. No harm in that, but the prospective reader of this is likely to be young and fit with good eyesight. Perhaps the real reason is to pad out the text to make it big enough to publish?.2) The silly anecdotes. For example the 'Diving Scenario' on page 16. Are we trying to rescue the victims before the explosion? In which case they're not victims (needing rescuing) yet. Or perhaps we're meant to rescue them after the explosion? But they've just had a free cremation courtesy of the negligent chamber operator...so not much point. This could have been a plausible example of the universal gas law with sensible editing.Another silliness? From page 12: 'Archimedes described the principles of buoyancy over 2000 years ago, and they are as valid today as they were then' Why wouldn't they be? Scientific principles don't have expiration dates...3) The typos. Normally totally forgivable, but the faults with the rest of the book make them stand-out. For example, Table 1.1 on page 6: 'inches of mercury' are not 'mmHg'4) The irrelevant anecdotes - page 19. 'Tragically, an explosion occurred in the Apollo 1 space capsule. .. The caspule was pressurized to 1.2 ATA .. All the astronauts in the cabin were immediately incinerated'. It's true, and it's tragic - but what's it got to do with anything sub-aquatic? More padding?5) The mistakes: Page 79 - aspirin does NOT prevent red blood cells from sticking together: it's platelets that are affected by aspirin. (To be fair, the authors get this right 50 or so pages later).6) Out of date material. Some history is always a good thing, but I was astonished to see the citations in the scientific bibliography are mostly from the 1940's, 1950's, 1960's and 1970's. The most recent citations are: three from the 1980's, one from 1991 and one from 2000 (this is just a general physiology text).In summary this book feels like a 1970's PhD thesis that's been rewarmed for publication. I know most of my criticisms are just pedantic - these should have been fixed by the editor. The authors are clearly passionate about diving - I've no doubt they are professional, diligent and expert physicians who I'd want treating me if I were bent. But they've been badly let down by Human Kinetics Press who failed to edit the book professionally.The real problem is the accumulation of these irritations - on the stuff I know about - is enough to make me unsure of the stuff I don't know anything about - do I believe it or not?If you need a good text on underwater science and medicine, there're several to choose from. The 2nd edition of 'Deeper into Diving' for example. Though it's pricy - and I had to order it from Australia - is a much better bet.PS - to the authors: Feel free to counter-attack - I can be reached at [...]"},{"Title":"The Flame-Coloured Dress (From the Portuguese.)","review":"I must first admit that I know very little about Jose Regio and that this selection of short stories was my introduction to reading him. There are seven relatively short works in this volume, all of which focus on women in Portugal--their influence over men, their victimization, their dignity....given from various points of view (though unless some of the narrator voices are female, never overtly with a woman's voice). I can't say that I enjoyed reading these stories though at the same time, reading them was not a waste of time; my rating of three stars reflects my ambivalence towards them and particularly to the style the writer employs. He is compared to Eca de Queiros on the back cover; however, this is, in my view, an untenable comparison, likely made to stimulate sales by placing Regio next to a well-known name (this may well just reveal my ignorance of Portuguese literature, I admit!). Whereas Queiros consistently applies the lightest of touches in both novels and short stories and perfectly sculpts ironic situations (a coutour of innuendo that doesn't insult the reader's intelligence), Regio forges ahead, at times seemingly quite oblivious to the reader's ability to take a hint. The stories are consistently (but not uniformly) depressing though not overwhelmingly so. In about half of the tales we are exposed to the petty squabblings, unrealized dreams, passionate excesses (all kept under wraps), scandal-mongering, and general unlikability of the Portuguese bourgeoisie in the early 20th century; the other half consists of a fairly unvarnished depiction of the lower classes. Of course, Regio makes his point as a social critic, but again, to my tastes, he sometimes speaks with a megaphone where a normal conversational tone and an occasional knowing wink would do. I'd say I enjoyed \\"A Brief Comedy\\" the most simply because of the genuinely humorous notes Regio strikes here. The title story is an unusual psychological study tracing the disintegration of a marriage through distrust, bickering, and eventually violence, all in a bizarre, though not graphic, milieu of sexual lust. \\"A Sad Smile\\", like the previously mentioned tale, is more hand-wringing about \\"Did I do the right thing 20 years ago?\\" narrated by an aging upper middle class professional. Of course, one might say that Regio, in showing how ridiculous these men are in their \\"confessional\\" scribblings, is pounding his point home about the vacuousness of the class he criticizes--but again, the operative word here is \\"pounding\\".If you are new to Portuguese lit and you're looking for truly inspired irony which covers some of the same ground of social criticism (though a little earlier in time), but with an undeniable master's touch, start with Quieros, especially a novel like The Illustrious House of Ramires. Regio is still worth reading, but there are others out there demanding your time, too.One last thing: though Margaret Jull Costa (the translator) is consistently praised for her translations of authors like Queiros and Pessoa, she needs either to find a better editor or to bone up on some basics of English grammar--a little disappointing in this area though not fatal."},{"Title":"Rifles For Africa","review":"Gregor Woods is one of the writers for Magnum, a South African hunting magazine. While this book is not written in the same style as John Taylor's great classic \\"African Rifles & Cartridges\\" it still covers much the same ground and brings the material on the topic of African rifles and ammunition up to date. (The book was published in 2003).The discussion of terminal ballistics, in two sections, \\"Bullet Design and Construction & Ballistics and \`Killing Power\\" is one of the best I have ever read. These two sections in the book alone are worth the price of this entire book. Woods first discusses in detail \\"premium bullets\\" which weren't around in 1948 when John Taylor wrote his book \\"African Rifles & Cartridges.\\" Woods correctly points out that if \\"premium bullets\\", like we have today, were around in the 1920s or earlier the advice, passed down, from professional hunters and sportsman from that era would be much different.In the section \\"Ballistics and \`Killing Power\\" He also debunks a lot of myths, such as hydrostatic shock, and looks at what really happens when bullets collide with flesh. Woods points out that it is the mechanical damage to the actual organs and bones, which count! In the later chapters of this section he also covers practical exterior ballistics in the field.Gregor Woods feels that the best bolt action is the 98 Mauser and its variations. (Winchester Model 70, Dakota Model 76, CZ 550/ZZK 602 and Ruger Model 77 MK II) A view shared by many other people. This is in sharp contrast to Taylor who felt that fine English double rifles were the best. On this same topic of double vs. magazine rifle some very interesting problems are discussed with regard to the double, aside from just the expense. Woods points out how sensitive doubles are to any variation in loads. Then there is a phenomena called \\"over stressed steel.\\" Where pre-war doubles, when using monolithic solids have the barrel split lengthwise. Not a good situation when you have spent $ 50,000.oo USD on the rifle! (Time to break out the tranquilizers and anti depressants!). And speaking of used doubles, there seems to be quite a bit of fraud going around in the market, such as coating chambers so that pits will not show, polishing up bores and other slick horse trader/used car salesman tricks. Hence, unless you buy your double new fraud is always a danger. I can attest from first hand experience that a well made double is a thing of beauty. Are they worth the $25,000 + price tag? I doubt it, except in a few very narrow applications.Finally, Woods discusses scopes and how to mount them on rifles. This to is topic that is often ignored. According to Woods a scope should be mounted as low as possible so that a firm cheek weld is obtained. The importance of a cheek weld is also something I learned in shooting high power rifle. I applied some of his ideas, such as mounting the scope as low as possible They worked just as he said it would.In closing I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in hunting rifles. At least 85% of the information contained in this book is transferable to hunting anywhere on earth."},{"Title":"Rifles For Africa","review":"I bought \\"Rifles for Africa\\" prior to a 2004 safari to Tanzania, and found in it a treasure trove of practical information. Although JohnTaylor's \\"Big Game and Big Game Rifles\\" and \\"African Rifles & Cartridges\\" have long been considered the standard works on the subject, both are somewhat dated, having been originally published in the 1940's. Woods addresses the substantial technological advances that have occurred since then, particularly with regard to bullet construction, which he fully explores and discusses. In addition, Woods devotes entire sections of his book to recommendations regarding optics and calibers. \\"Rifles for Africa\\" displays a wealth of practical information, derived from Woods' lifetime of hunting throughout the African continent: he names names and pulls no punches. It is also illustrated throughout with highly interesting photographs and informative diagrams. Despite its encyclopedic scope, I found \\"Rifles for Africa\\" to be entertaining and fascinating, and consider it an essential addition to any sportsman's library."},{"Title":"Focal Easy Guide to Final Cut Express: For new users and professionals (The Focal Easy Guide)","review":"Rick Young's Final Cut Express guide is the best I've found, and I've checked out half a dozen.

Lyon, Christina and a few others from the first book made appearances, while introducing a few new characters to continue the series, Jade's brother Nathan and Caine's brother Colin.

True, he's blindsided by Lady Jade's beauty, blah blah blah...still....Cripes!We're never informed of Caines mind-set, (his thoughts concerning Jade). We're told of his attraction to her (which is understandable since this is..afterall, a Romance Novel first and foremost). But JG never gives any real details of what Caine is really, actually thinking/feeling concerning Lady Jade.. or how slowly/quickly he's falling. Next thing we know, they've \\"done the deed\\".

He prepares a trap for the mysterious pirate, Pagan, of whom not much is known except that he killed Colin. Cain's plan is to set up shop at a bar on the seedier side of town and act as if HE is Pagan. Cain figures that once Pagan hears of the imposter, he'll make an appearance. Cain waits patiently each night, prepared for Pagan's wrath. One night after closing, he hears the door of the bar slam open. He turns, expecting to see Pagan and prepares for his revenge. He does not expect to see the beautiful but disheveled Lady Jade and he is really not prepared for her offer. Thinking Cain is Pagan, she offers him 30 pieces of silver to kill her.(And this is just the first chapter!) There are so many twists and turns in this story. Everyone seems to be lying or bending the truth about their circumstance, past, and even name.I thought the the true strength in the plot was the romance between Cain and Jade. Cain falls in love with Jade first. He tells her that he loves her first. He is perfectly content to to say &quot;I love you&quot; without hearing Jade say it back. He's confident that he will hear her say it when she is ready. A bit arrogant? He is that, and overprotective, demanding, bossy, and cranky! It is all part of his charm as a man in love. He is so supportive of Jade, especially when he realizes that all of her loved ones have left her at some point in her life. Cain calmly waits for Jade to realize that he's not going anywhere.I did think that when all the explanations were handed out, the story dragged on a bit. Everytime a character appeared that was out of the loop, the explanations were given again and again. It all could have been said the one time and alluded to after that.Cain's butler was hysterical as well as Uncle Harry (how many pairs of spectacles does one man need?).All things considered, there are a lot more strengths than weaknesses in the plot. I will keep this book and enjoy it repeatedly."},{"Title":"Guardian Angel","review":"In Julie Garwood's GUARDIAN ANGEL, Jade is a strong, beautiful woman with flaming red hair and green eyes, and some secrets of her own. Her love interest is Caine, an imposing man with dark hair and gray eyes. In the beginning of the novel, Caine is seeking out a pirate named Pagan whom he believes killed his brother. In hopes of drawing the pirate out, Caine masquerades as Pagan, knowing the pirate will be enraged upon hearing of someone else stealing the notorious pirate's name. Caine's plot is interrupted somewhat when the beautiful Jade knocks on the door of his home later that night and begs for his protection against people who are trying to kill her. The rest of the novel is colored with intrigue in the war department, pirates, murder plots, and the growing romance between Jade and Caine as Garwood keeps us madly turning the pages to an ultimately satisfying conclusion.So why did I give it less than five stars? Well, I'd like to point out I felt there were good parts and bad parts about GUARDIAN ANGEL. I was very intrigued by the plot because--well--pirates are just plain sexy!! C'mon ladies, we can admit it--pirates are VERY SEXY! However, I felt as though the pirate aspect of the novel wasn't played up as much as it could've or should've been. Instead, GUARDIAN ANGEL was more concerned with the political intrigue and the on-going power struggle between Caine and Jade. However, in its favor, GUARDIAN ANGEL does actually have a plot. (All of us who regularly read romance novels recognize sometimes the plot becomes nearly an afterthought to the characters' relationship!)My concerns about the plot itself were relatively minor. My main reason for not giving the novel a higher rating was the characterization of Caine and Jade. I liked Jade's character because she was intelligent, independent, and clever--someone who was able to look out for herself and think fast on her feet in difficult situations. So when she started being treated as Caine's doormat, I was left with my mouth dropped open in surprise and shock. It irritated me that although she was so brave and strong, she could be reduced to being anyone's doormat, least of all the man who was supposed to love and cherish her. I think Garwood asked too much of us when she asked us to believe Jade would back down so easily.I certainly didn't hate the story, but Garwood just didn't develop Caine's better qualities well enough for me. Garwood should've made him more tender towards Jade, instead of putting his needs above her own. After meeting him in her novel THE GIFT, I was left with a sour taste in my mouth when Caine grabbed Jade roughly enough that he actually left bruises. I think a man who uses his strength to protect \\"his woman\\" instead of to hurt her is much more attractive! The male characters in the other Julie Garwood books I've read have been less controlling and possessive, and more \\"manly\\" for it.My only other complaint is how similar all of Garwood's female characters are. They are all excessively beautiful, have a sprinkle of freckles on their noses, moan sexily while being intimate with their husbands, and smell like ROSES--they ALL smell like ROSES! I like roses, but maybe someone could smell like...oh, I don't know, lilacs? It would be nice to have more variety with Garwood's female characters instead of feeling like you're meeting the same character in a different story. I love reading about brave, beautiful women, but I do prefer feeling as though they're unique individuals.Enjoy this book if you've already picked it up, and if you're Julie Garwood fan looking for another of her \\"pirate\\" novels, pick up THE GIFT. Otherwise, I recommend Garwood's novel RANSOM or SAVING GRACE."},{"Title":"Guardian Angel","review":"I love all of Ms. Garwood's books. Although they are predictable in general, they are great fun to read. They are some suprising twists in this book that I specially enjoyed. Jade is unusually exciting and her protectiveness and honor is very touching. The supporting characters are all very interesting. It was great to see a little bit of Lyon and Christine from 'The Lion's Lady' in this book. The identity of Pagen is a great setup for the novel. I won't tell you who it is... you will have to ready it yourself. However, my favorite Garwood so far is still 'Ransom' but you might want to read 'the secret' before reading 'Ransom'."},{"Title":"Guardian Angel","review":"It had a wonderful plot, but I would have continued reading even if it didn't. The banter and confusion between Jade and Caine kept me laughing long after I put this book down. This is why I read books; to be left with a smile and a warm feeling when the last page is turned. Thank you Ms. Garwood for an outstanding book. The only two books I've reread more than this one is Perfect by Judith McNaught and, as it was one of my first regency romances, it's hard to beat and the Duke and I by Julia Quinn. Give this book a chance and I promise you won't regret it. :-)"},{"Title":"Guardian Angel","review":"Ms. Garwood surely knows how to write, and it's cleary proven in her novel, Guardian Angel. Jade, our fabulous heroine, is on a mission to protect Caine, our gorgeous hero. But in order for Jade to keep Caine safe, she generates lies in order to cover up her true identity. what her true identity is, I cannot say, for that would ruin the story. However, the romance between Jade and Caine I can write about. The love between Jade and Caine is extremely emotional. Love for Caine comes pretty easily to him, but for Jade it was a lot more difficult for her to express her emotions. Jade grew up with an extremely harsh childhood, only with her brother and her uncle taking care of her. But her brother and uncle would always abandon her, or more like leave her at home so she could be kept safe, while they were off on important sea business. Jade learns quickly about keeping up appearances, in other words, masking her true feelings. But as soon as she meets Caine, she realizes that Caine is able to make her be her real self, and feel love and feel cherished.The book is filled with cute and funny scenes. Little endearments that Caine uses on Jade, and especially the ending, is wonderful! Read the book, you'll love it.P.S. This is the second novel part of a 4-part series. The Lion's Lady, GUARDIAN ANGEL, the Gift, and Castles."},{"Title":"Guardian Angel","review":"Caine (our hero) is out to avenge the man he believes killed his brother, Colin, .... the allusive pirate, Pagan; in his quest to attract Pagan's attention, Caine stumbles across Jade (a women in need?) .... she looks just like an angel, and totally out of place in the run down, ill reputed place he's in! Jade is an independent, feisty, passionate heroine with a mysterious past .... and full proof plan to capture Caine - she wants him to kill her! A tale filled to the brim with action, humour, passion and romance. As usual Julie Garwood will manage to capture your attention with her excellent writing style and colourful characters .... I thoroughly enjoyed this story and have read it, and read it, and read it again! This is one of my favourite Garwood stories ... and if I could add an \\"A+\\" on the end of the 5 star, I certainly would. In two words: top shelf!"},{"Title":"Guardian Angel","review":"When I first read this book, I could not put it down. I've read it three more times since then. I would give it ten stars if I could. The action is fast paced. It's hilarious. I loved Jade and Caine. This book has everything. Good characters. Interesting plot. Steamy love scenes. Never a boring moment. And it was refreshing to see a heroine who could rescue herself. This book is only surpassed by it's sequel--The Gift."},{"Title":"Guardian Angel","review":"It's been a long time since I really fell into a book, but this one had me hooked. I admit I had doubts; the writing style of the first few chapters is fairly elementary. However, the story was captivating.The plot begins with out hero, Caine, trying to find his brother's \\"murderer.\\" The twists and turns of the plot are fairly predictable to the experienced romance reader. It's worth the ride though, as all the major revelations are done with just the flair and humor they deserve.Jade was a good heroine with courage and honor (though she did lose some steam at the end of the novel). The \\"secrets\\" surrounding her past were predicable, but she had enough spunk to make it interesting. Caine was a fantastic hero, achieving that rare blend of shadow, strength, and vulnerability.I agree with those who say the ending is a bit hard to swallow. Though not bad, Jade is not the commander she plays at the beginning. I still decide to give this novel five stars because of the wonderful reactions of the other characters to Jade's past. Topped off with a host of entertaining secondary characters (Jade's Uncle Harry and Caine's faithful butler), this one is a keeper."},{"Title":"Guardian Angel","review":"This is the kinda book I'm talking about!! It was so good! In the beginning it kinda keeps you guessing and I was like, \\"When am I ever going to find out what happened and find out the truth!\\" But I was not thinking these things in a bad way. I just wanted to know!! It was written very well.Basically the story is about Marques of Cainwood avenging the death of his brother Colin whom he thinks was killed by the pirate named Pagan. Then comes Jade asking him to kill her (yeah that's right). He of course doesn't do it, but she then asks him to protect her because people are after her. She comes up with some good stores, or lies if you will, which some he believes and some he does not.Jade is funny. You learn pretty soon that she is trying to protect Caine. She is playing a part of a timid, crying and over reacting women but really that is far form the woman that she is. She has grown up with her uncle Black Harry and has lead an eventful life. She is very strong but has a fear of abandonment. This fear came from being left by her brother and from when her uncle would leave her to do business. She stands up to him a lot and argues (or as Caine would say, debate) with him all the time.Caine...hmm...the man is kinda dreamy. He really is the perfect hero. He is strong; he worked in the war department and was known as \\"Hunter\\". But he is sensitive and so freakin sweet. He does and say's things to Jade that is just so nice and thoughtful. He took the time to get to know her and understand how her mind works and made a few decisions easier for her. He is a little arrogant but you start to like that about him because he does not take it too far.This is the kinda book I am talking about! It has a mystery and a little bit of suspense and a whole lot of good romance. All I can say is....OH YEAH!!Chrissy"},{"Title":"Guardian Angel","review":"This was a really good book I love Jade because she is reliant on herself and only herself. I think that Caine was a really good male character he didn't try to make her change she made the decicion herself. She did not try to be anything she wasn't without good reason. I liked this one but I really liked Castles it was the best out of the two books about Jade's and Caines siblings Colin and Nathan."},{"Title":"Guardian Angel","review":"Thank you for this one, Julie. It is one of my favorites. I read it over and over and over."},{"Title":"Guardian Angel","review":"This book was great. Familiar characters . Great humor, Julie Garwood is one of my favorite authors.

The characters weren't as well developed as they could be. The plot is not impressive."},{"Title":"Guardian Angel","review":"I've read this book so many times but enjoy it more with every reading. She uses humor as well as suspense so well. I do appreciate the older books more than the newer ones."},{"Title":"Guardian Angel","review":"What a great book!!!!!! So romantic, funny and precious. I hated it when it ended.

I never even finished this one. My bookmark is still on page 235 (out of 375) and I don't foresee myself getting to it any time soon. In fact, I have read three other books since I started this one. It just couldn't hold my attention."},{"Title":"Guardian Angel","review":"I am big fan of Julie Garwwod but found this book just didn't meet up to my expectations of this author.It needed to give more background information on Jade and her fears especially of being left. I also found that Caine fell in love with Jade a little to easily as well as being fooled by her. I just expected a little better out Ms. Garwood.I will continue to read her books though because one of my all time favorites is The Wedding!"},{"Title":"Guardian Angel","review":"Normally, I like Julie Garwood's work. I've read most of her more recent efforts and like them alot. I was very disappointed in this particular book and, once I looked at the original issue date, I realized that it was an earlier effort. Nothing else could explain the ridiculously convoluted plot and the lack of depth in any of her character development. I found Jade, the female lead, to be extremely annoying. Though part of her motivation was to purposely confuse the male lead with her illogical and rambling chatter, this was taken to such ridiculous lengths that even a man with the patience of a saint would be hard put to endure it, let alone be attracted to her. By the time a few crumbs of reasonable plot line are dropped in I ceased to care about her at all. The only interesting characters here are Caine, the lead male character, Jade's brother Nathan and Caine's friend Lyon. Altogether a disappointing read. Look for Garwood's more recent works, they are more worth your time."},{"Title":"Guardian Angel","review":"I read The Gift a while back, so when I picked up The Guardian I was expecting a halfway decent story. NOT SO!! This book was terrible from start to finish. It was completely predictable, boring, and the characters had absolutely no substance. This is the first novel that I have ever had to FORCE myself to read to the end. This book has completely turned me off of Julie Garwood's books."},{"Title":"Guardian Angel","review":"I couldn't even finish this novel and I love Julie Garwood books, but this one was the worst book, worst then come the spring and that's a tough act to follow."},{"Title":"Guardian Angel","review":"Very entertaining!

Guardian Angel 3. The Gift 4.

She was the strongest female character I have yet seen in any of these books."},{"Title":"Guardian Angel","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. It was great fun guessing who pagan was and other twists... I think Julie Garwood is an outstanding author and she doesn't disappoint with this one! The chemistry was wonderful and the love scenes erotic... Need I say more?"},{"Title":"Guardian Angel","review":"I just finished reading this book and had to hurry and write a review! This book is phenomenal! I fell so in love with Caine! And it was very refreshing to see a bok in which a woman can take care of herself! It had me laughing out loud! Unfortuantely I have read this entire series backwards. I read Nathan's story, The Gift first and then I read Colin's story, Castles, and now Guardian Angel! And I have just bought The Lyon's Lady so I cannot wait to read Lyon's story! Every single book in this set is absolutely wonderful! Once again, Julie Garwood gave me a book that took me to another time and place and captivated me until the very last page!"},{"Title":"Guardian Angel","review":"Garwood has done it again.Jade is a notorious thief and liar and she gets the love of a lifetime in Caine, the man who she is lying to.Caine is trying to avenge his brother who was killed by the pirate Pagan until Jade comes and he feels the need to protect her.What Caine doesn't know is that Jade is really trying to protect him. And while they keep going at crosspurposes, they, of course, fall in love, with some extremely hilarious conversations on the side that had me doubling over with laughter.I won't give too much else away, so you'll have to see what happens yourself."},{"Title":"Guardian Angel","review":"The 'Emerald' flew across the seas, its black hull teasing the waves, its sails whipping on the wind. Abroad was the pirate Pagan -despised by the ton, whose riches this scroundel plundered: beloved by the poor, whose plight was eased by the pirate's gifts.The Marquess of Cainewood vows to hunt down the pirate wretch in revenge for his brother's death.But when Jade, an enchanting vision of riplling red hair and yes of fire green,appears at his door to beg desperately for his protection, the Marquess agrees to keep her safe from the villians who want her dead.Jade is infuriating, exasperating and gorgeous; caine is nole, strong willed and powerful. No woman has ever befuddled him so, nor so deeply roused his desire. But as Jade responds to his knowing caresses with an innocent, wild abandon, they are drawn into a web of treachery that will test the very heart of their love! (text taken from book cover)Another charming book by Julie Garwood. A funny, sensual book. Its not really a pirate story and the mystery is one which alert reader will discover almsot immediately but still this does not detract at all from the charm of this book. As I think most of ms Garwood's heroines, Jade is an adorable clumsy creature ...at least she acts like one - she gives rise to some rather humorous situations. No real sense of danger in the book - its an easy and pleasant reader which most readers will certainly enjoy."},{"Title":"Guardian Angel","review":"First think I want to say is that I CANNOT believe people are giving this books something other than a 4 or 5! I don't think they were reading the same book as me, especially the one who thinks that she is named Sara!? How do you get Sara out of Jade??? Well anyhoo...I could not put this book down. The beginning is hilarious...I was laughing so hard I had to wipe the tears that were blurring the words on the page from my eyes!(I had that problem a lot during this book!) Right from the start Julie Garwood spins a magnificent tale around Jade and Cain. The dialoge is funny and witty, the plot is VERY well thought out, I, who usually guesses who the bad &quot;guy&quot; is well before the mystery gets unraveled, was amazed with who it was, I mean I would have not guessed in a thousand years it was.....well, i'll let you find out for yourself.Even though this book was great from the first page until the last, The best scene is where Cain is with Jade's uncle and her men and they all are telling Cain what their nicknames are for her, I just wish I were really in the book to see the look on his face. Oh well, All in all, you are crazy if you don't buy this book, and even crazier if you don't like it!!! In my opinion, and lots others, this is WELL beyond a 5 star book!"},{"Title":"Guardian Angel","review":"I loved Jade, and the fact that she was hesitant to love Cain. I adored the fact that Cain always told Jade he loved her, and said it to her before she said it to him (it seems that in all of JG's books that the heorine always says 'I love you' first. It was fabulous to see it the other way around). Jade was a wonderful heoroine because she never let any man boss her around and did what only she wanted. You have to read the quintet, it is wonderful."},{"Title":"Guardian Angel","review":"This is the first book in a sort of unfficial trilogy.

All three are very enjoyable!"},{"Title":"Guardian Angel","review":"I thought this was a terific book. At each page there were new suprises. I loved the characters and their development throughout the novel. This was the first book i have ever read by this particular author, I'll be reading more in the future.

A great catch, everyone should read it."},{"Title":"Guardian Angel","review":"This was the first book I read from Julie Garwood and I had fallen in love. She is a must-read romance novelist. This book kept me entranced from the beginning to the end. Of course, I couldn't put it down so finished it the first night I had it. The characters are witty, intelligent and strong. The two main people, Jade and Caine, were made for each other.It was a book that made you laugh, cry, and anticipate the next moves. Julie has a subtle way of putting humor into her novels and it is that subtlety that makes her novels the more interesting. This is a must-read book so if I were you and you love romance, get off the computer right now and go get it. Happy readings!"},{"Title":"Guardian Angel","review":"This is the 2nd book in a series, The Lion's Lady is the first. You can read this book on it's own, but it does visit the characters from the previous book. This was a reread for me. It's not my favorite Julie Garwood book, but I still think it is really good. I enjoy it everytime I read it.The Marquess of Cainewood (Caine) is on a mission to trap a Pirate. He is masquerading as his enemy, the Pirate Pagan, at a local watering hole. He is hoping that his deception will lure the REAL Pagan to him. Caine wants to kill Pagan, as he has been told that the Pirate is responsible for his younger brothers recent death.In walks Jade. She is beautiful and certaintly doesn't belong in this bar. She walks up to Caine and asks if he is Pagan. When he says yes she has a strange request.Caine is intrigued.To tell you more would spoil some surprises.This is a good read. The \\"mystery\\" parts dragged a bit for me, but I think the wit and loveability of the characters more than make up for it.It's fun to see how Jade and Caine work together. They compliment eachother well. She is clever, quirky and a little unusual. He is steady and logical, but Jade brings out a lighter side in him. He handles her insecurities beautifully."},{"Title":"Guardian Angel","review":"I liked this book a lot. Enough to want to buy it.

Caine, of course, refuses and then throws her into the Thames, jumps in after her trying to escape whomever is chasing them. This is an extremely exciting story. Jade is such a strong woman.

Loved it!"},{"Title":"Guardian Angel","review":"I read a lot of reviews saying there was too much political intrigue and needs more romance. Therefore I was a little wary when reading it, however after finishing it, I highly disagree. It was balanced perfectly; how many romantic scenes can you continue reading without a break? Because the author inserted other issues to think about, it felt nice to read about the romance in between; otherwise anyone would get tired of the same repeated phrases because how many different ways can you describe the love scenes? I liked the political intrigue, it gave some mystery and good plot to work with. I didn't think the book was as good as Lion's Lady, the first in the series, but it certainly was better than the third, The Gift."},{"Title":"Guardian Angel","review":"Caine the sexy and strong hero is looking for the pirate Pagan one night when this women who he thought was an angel from heaven her beauty walks in and asks him for shocking favored..Jade the red hair and green eyes beauty walks in to finds Caine there.

Before when reading The Gift and Castles I was sort of not sure about earlier events but Guardian Angel answered all my questions. I was really surprised about who Pagan really was and now I know. Cain and Jade were delightful characters and easy to get into. Nathan and Colin were also delightful,but to me their Uncle Harry broke the mold he was really fun and easy to get to know. I will not go into detail of the story because we all know it,but it will go on my keeper shelf with the other three. I also forgot to mention Lyon and Christina,loved seeing them as well. A very fun and exciting read. I highly recommend it.

I'm pratically in love with all her characters and would love to see more of the Scotland, England tales. Since I'm in the U.S. it makes me want to go see the rest of the world especially Scotland. If your new to reading her she goes into great detail about the characters, and their feelings. It's almost like your in the story.

An exceptional novel that I wish everyone would take a chance and read...you wouldn't regret it!!!!&quot;"},{"Title":"Guardian Angel","review":"I am a huge Garwood fan (the Bride, the Wedding Honor's Splendour, etc), but this book was a major disappointment. I didn't even finish it, it was that bad. The beginning starts off alright albeit a little strange (with Jade requesting to be killed), but the story gets lost in all the twists and turns. Jade comes across as vacuous, yet she is supposedly some sort of genius piratical figure. She is abrasive, rude, and arrogant. The male lead is more tolerable, but overwhelmed by the female lead. There is little to no chemistry between them.The book read like a term paper written by a high school student. I was hoping for some sort of redemption, but about 3/4 of the way through the book, I gave up on it. It's the first romance novel by anyone of Garwood's caliber that I've ever not finished.The plot gets lost in the details and the conversations are very difficult to read. The conversations between the characters do not flow at all. For example, here is the type of conversational writing in this book (not an excerpt, just the style of writing):Jade: Caine, I want to speak with you.Caine: What about, Jade?Jade: I am mad at you, Caine.Caine: But Jade, I think you're overreacting.Jade: No, I'm not Caine.etc. The main characters use each other's first name in nearly every sentence spoken to each other, which is unnatural and choppy. I had to include this in my review because it bothered me to no end.Very, very disappointing. You would do better to save your time and money and get another Garwood book."},{"Title":"Guardian Angel","review":"I am a big Judith McNaught fan and was told to try Julie Garwood because her novels are just as good. I bought Guardian Angel, Ransom and The Bride and decided to give Guardian Angel a whirl first because I like Regency-era romances. Caine, the Marquess of Cainewood, is after a pirate that goes by the name of the Pagan -- a Robin Hood-like ruffian who steals from the rich to help the poor. Caine wants to avenge the death of his brother and will do anything to capture and kill the pirate. He has a plan to pass off as the Pagan in order to anger him and have him expose himself. But when a beautiful and spirited young woman called Jade walks into his life, paying him silver coins to have him kill her, his life isn't the same. Before he knows it, his life becomes a shambles with a great deal of political intrigue and treachery from the woman he vows to protect. There are various twists throughout the novel.At first, I thought this novel would be a riveting read full of romance and adventure. I also loved the whole pirate angle. Pirates are sexy. Robin Hood types are sexy. Protective and possessive alpha males are sexy. So why am I disappointed? Political aspects monopolized the plot. It takes away from everything else that is supposed to be important in the story, including the romance. Yes, there are plenty of romantic scenes between Caine and Jade, most of which center on a power struggle over each other. I like Jade and her no-nonsense, rebellious and independent personality. While not totally believable given the time frame, she is a breath of fresh air because she is no ninny. That is, of course, until Caine tries to break her spirit at all cost. Caine annoyed me to no end. He is too moody and bossy for my taste. He tries to be the proverbial alpha male, but comes out as someone with a personality disorder instead. His abrupt mood changes from seductive and amused to angry and domineering irritated me. It's a good thing Jade doesn't always put up with him. I know the whole purpose to the story is that he isn't used to someone like Jade, but still -- ugh! I would've liked to read more about piracy and the Pagan himself than see how Caine tries to turn Jade into an \\"yes, sir\\" woman. I noticed that this is the spin-off of a previous novel based on the characters Lyon and Christina. From what I read about these characters, I don't think I want to try reading their story. Alas, I was underwhelmed with Garwood and Guardian Angel. I will give the author another shot because I've heard her work is wonderful. I hope I have better luck next time."},{"Title":"Guardian Angel","review":"This is an exceptionally interesting story literally beginning on page 1. There's lots wrong with this book, but the plot is top notch. Jade's one of the best heroines ever. And one can't ever discount JG's talent, wit and humor - unmatched by any other author. However, I wasn't overly pleased with Caine. I hated the way he groveled over Jade when he decided he loved her. I never really got the convincing feeling he was that handsome, strong, masculine, or anything else, unlike, say, Gabriel from 'Saving Grace.' Now he was the perfect hero. NO FLAWS. I usually find JG's arrogant, macho heros endearing and loveable, but this Caine fellow was abusively possessive. It's one thing for the hero to give his lady a possessive stare, a jealous growl, even a word or two about how she 'belongs' to him, but Caine bruised Jade by grabbing her arms! What an idiot! Jade, as I mentioned, was truly a great character, very strong, very intelligent, until her relationship with Caine became serious. Then she turned into an imbecile, weak, submissive, and ignorant. Here was a woman who'd survived by her wits, and along comes Caine, who thinks she can't even walk without him telling her to put one foot in front of the other.In the fabulous book, THE GIFT, Caine is a totally different character. He's a mild gentleman. But Jade is nearly unrecognizable. She's so overly domesticated her spirit seems to have been crushed somewhere along the way."},{"Title":"Guardian Angel","review":"I LOVE Julie Garwood's books but this one was just not up to her standards at all. The beginning was cute but the more into the plot I got, the more bored I became. Ususally I hate to put her books down but this was a stuggle to get through. Jade was a contradiction in character and Caine was bossy and controlling. The only book left by her I haven't read is The Gift and now, I'm not so sure I want to read it."},{"Title":"Guardian Angel","review":"This is an exceptionally good book, with action and intrigue starting on page one! It has romance,wit, humor, and the reader is carried through an outstanding plot. Jade is one of the best heroines ever created. There are so many wonderful facets to her personality, only the genius of JG could pull it off.I didn't give this book 5 stars because of the hero, Caine. He was promising in the beginning, but his appeal tapered off drastically as the story progressed. I've loved every one of JG's heros, arrogant though they were, but I hated how Caine would grab Jade's hand and squeeze hard enough to hurt her (and not let go for the duration of the scene), simply to prevent her from leaving the room, or to find her own chair. And I thought it a little crude when Jade's Uncle Harry said that he should have 'cut' Jade's face when she was younger because she was so beautiful. A little over the top, I think. But all in all, the actual story was fantastic. I'm glad Lyon was in it as much as he was, and I liked Nathan and Colin. The servant Sterns was a great character."},{"Title":"Guardian Angel","review":"This book is the second book of a series of four: The series begins with the Lion's Lady, followed by The Guardian Angel, then The Gift and lastly, Castles. The characters in all 4 books are friends/related to each other. It is more fitting if you know each character before reading the next book. If you read it in this order, I think it will bring more excitement as some questions are answered on the later book. Some secrets are also revealed beforehence.The reason why I didn't give this book a 5 star rating was because the love story of Cain and Sara wasn't as appealing as I thought it was in the beginning. They were both interesting at first (how they met, their personality and how the story moved along) but the action twist over shadowed their romantic relationship. Towards the middle &amp; to the end, their relationship begun to sound too 'ordinary' for my taste. There was no more excitement... kindda like I knew what was gonna happend next. The romance wasn't as heart warming as i expected it to be.Despite my above comment, I find the action twist of this book rather exciting. The true identity of Pagan, which I may say was a total surprise to me. The suspense of an unexpected turn of situations and scenes, all made this book a page turner. All the secondary characters such as Sara's brother (Nathan-who will be the hero in THE GIFT), Cain's brother (Colin-who will be the hero in CASTLE), the family and the ship crews contributed a lot in making this book worth reading for.It may not be a 5 star rating for me but it is definitely still a good book to past your time. Also, a keeper in your collection."},{"Title":"Guardian Angel","review":"This novel was somewhat of a departure from Garwood's normal plot line. Caine is on a search for the evil pirate Pagan, whom he believes has killed his brother. Pagan, though, knows who is searching for the pirate and the danger facing Caine. Through a twist of events the seeker becomes the sought.To avoid giving any of the story away, I'll stop the description there. But, I have to say that this was one of my favorites - and I've loved every Garwood so far."},{"Title":"Guardian Angel","review":"What I loved best about this book was the humor. It was one of the funniest romances I've ever read. I can't remember the last time I laughed outloud so many times. But it's more than that. The author hasn't forgotten to add very serious romance to this otherwise humorous novel. The romance is hot and sincere. And while I normally am able to predict everything that happens in romance novels, I have to admit, she got me on this one. I did NOT predict the turnout. Give this one a read!"},{"Title":"Guardian Angel","review":"This was the first Julie Garwood book I ever read, I have since read almost all of her books. Jade is one of her most memorable charactors.

On the whole, this book is good and I completed it in 4 to 5 hour. I first brought this book from a best sellers list and did not regret it. I can feel myself as part of the story watching it like a movie. Pity I don't get to know what Jade read about Lyon and Caine, it would be nice to know about the things they do for the goverment. I would promote this book to everyone except for those who can't stand love scene."},{"Title":"Guardian Angel","review":"This book is the best I've read from Julie Garwood. The plot was exciting. I loved the characters Jade and Caine. Jade's actions were suprising and so were Caine's. They make a terrific couple.Jade comes into Caine's life, asking him to kill her. Caine refuses. He does tell her that he would take care of her from the men that are chasing her. Jade was playing Caine. She never really needed his help. All she was doing was to try and distract him from something. During her plan, she never thought that love was coming her way.This book rule's. If you want to know what happens to Caine and Jade, read the book. I guarantee you that you would laugh your head of from some of the scene's from this book. You would even cry from the heart-felt scene's.Please read this book."},{"Title":"Guardian Angel","review":"WOW... I love all her book and own all of them. She is really great.

Miss Julie Garwood, I wish you the best and luck and may you produce the greatest yet to come.For your fan in Brunei Darussalam."},{"Title":"Guardian Angel","review":"I found this story - and the related &quot;Lion's Lady&quot; -disappointing. And I rate them 2 stars because other Garwood books - The Wedding, Saving Grace, Gentle Warrior - are so much better than this. Part of the problem - Garwood tends to write in a very modern voice, with characters saying things that you and I would say today. Somehow, this works just fine with Scottish clans in 1100 - but it just doesn't &quot;click&quot; with Regency characters. Another problem - the non-romance plot gets muddied and rushed here, with characters thrown in to &quot;solve&quot; the mystery. The pirate plot could have been so much more successful. Both Lion's Lady and this book are very rushed at the end, trying to wrap things up. My recommendation - skip this and read Saving Grace instead!"},{"Title":"Guardian Angel","review":"I had a difficult time getting into this book. I suppose I have been spoiled like many other JG fans by THE SECRET, RANSOM, and THE WEDDING to name a few of her 5+ star books. I have read some of her other Regency books and have not enjoyed them as much as her Medieveal books. For some reason, these books don't &quot;feel&quot; like Regency books if that makes any sense. And I have to agree with some of the other reviewers in that if you read these particular Regency books close together it is difficult to tell the characters apart (freckles across the nose, etc.). However, as I got into the story I did enjoy it. I liked Caine and Jade very much, but call me a prude, but I do get turned off a story when the characters are sleeping together before they are married. Overall, I think this is a good read, just not Ms. Garwood's best."},{"Title":"Guardian Angel","review":"The year is 1815 and we are introduced to Caine, the Marquess of Cainewood. A government spy on the hunt for the infamous pirate Pagan, whom he assumes killed his brother Colin, Caine is at his usual haunt at a seedy pub in the slums of London where he hopes to catch the pirate, when in walks a beautiful woman who dumps a bag of silver in his lap in exchange for the most outrageous and unheard of request that he has ever heard - for him to murder her. Yet unbeknown to him, Jade has come to him under the pretext of being in grave danger, and Caine is unaware that his hunt for Pagan has reached its end.When Caine takes Jade under his protection, little does he know what a merry chase he would be involved in, for along with trying to protect Jade from her \\"would-be\\" attackers, he finds himself being driven demented by the woman who is quickly stealing his heart. Jade, on the other hand, is learning more things about Caine that was never included in his official government file, things that render her heart vulnerable for the first time in her life. But she knows that she must protect her heart or risk getting hurt by Caine's hatred once he learns of her true identity.With espionage, piracy and betrayal, one would expect an action-packed roller-coaster ride while reading this novel. Unfortunately, this falls a little short of the expectations. The tangled political intrigue is one that's enough to put a reader off the story - leaving you confused and distracted from the romance between the main characters. As for Caine and Jade, both are likable enough, though I didn't find them as endearing or memorable as other Garwood characters. I feel that more emphasis should have been given on developing the relationship between them. But I did enjoy some of the banter between them, and also laughed at some of the supporting characters (notably Caine's butler and Uncle Harry), and I loved the fact that the hero isn't afraid to declare his love for the heroine. That, for me, is the most wonderful aspect of the book, though these weren't enough to sustain the excitement to make me not want to put the book down.Overall, GUARDIAN ANGEL didn't leave a lasting impression on me. The first book, THE LION'S LADY, is much better than this one."},{"Title":"Guardian Angel","review":"Julie Garwood is my favorite author because her characters are so fresh and humorous. I just fell in love with Caine and Jade- I can't imagine anyone not liking them! The story was very entertaining and the ending was NOT predictable. It is one of those books that you can read over and over again and STILL find it refreshing. I liked the fact that it previewed Nathan's story- that's also a fabulous book, check it out- and followed up on Lyon and Christina's life. A must read."},{"Title":"Preaching While the Church Is Under Reconstruction: The Visionary Role of Preachers in a Fragmented World","review":"Thomas Troeger is an amazing writer, capturing the heart and imagination of preachers seeking new vitality in proclaiming the Gospel. He starts his extended analogy with a parable of a collapsing dome, decorated with ancient mosaics. The piece of the roof that crashes to the church floor had contained an image representing God the Creator. From there, he discusses this &quot;God-shaped hole&quot; not only in the roof of a building, but also the ones in the individual believer and in the church in a time of massive change.Troeger is not some off-the-wall change agent, or a pessimist about the state of the church. He is a man profoundly rooted in salvation history. He brings across the stage of our 21st century consciousness the challenges faced by the Church throughout its past. From the confidence of God's work to prosper (and not just to preserve) the Church in prior times of upheaval he speaks of hope to be found and preached in the current societal, scientific, and technological challenges facing us in the early third millenium.This is definitely not a how-to book on constructing a sermon. It is rather a captivating extended parable designed to free the heart, soul, and mind of those who are charged with speaking the word of God to the men and women who come into the worship time needing hope and strength."},{"Title":"The Oxford Dictionary of Foreign Words and Phrases (Oxford Paperback Reference)","review":"If you find yourself skipping words and phrases in articles and books that you sense everyone but you understands this is an excellent addition to your dictionary collection.

My family has been connected to that town since 1939. I have read the book in question, and without a doubt it is a necessary book for anyone wanting to know Hughes's true intent for the establishment of Rugby in 1880. Its purpose was to inspire young men from England to come to what was then a rather remote region of East Tennessee, to work the land and make good for themselves. I would not recommend it for the casual visitor or tourist who comes to Rugby (several thousand per year)but only for those who have a strong attachment to the Rugby community, or to those who may be studying Thomas Hughes's life. He was an extraordinary character. He was a member of Parliament, Queen's Counsel, lawyer, judge, promoter of a movement known as Christian Socialism in the mid 1800s. This book would be of great value to someone doing detailed research on Hughes and his life. End."},{"Title":"The Man Who Made Husbands Jealous","review":"I love Jilly Cooper. Her books are always packed with characters. \\"The Man Who Made Husbands Jealous\\" was not my favorite of hers,however I was still wild about it. This book was enormous, but it was paced perfectly and Lysander was just as sweet as pie.I was rooting for him all the way through. I just know he and Kitty will live happily ever after... My main complaint is that I felt there were a few loose strings dangling at the end of the book, but all in all this was -in typical Jilly Cooper fashion- a definite keeper."},{"Title":"The Man Who Made Husbands Jealous","review":"Although Lysander is supposed to be the lead character being the man who made husbands jealous, it was a good idea to focus on the several couples' marriage & their respective disasters. Here we witness the various forms of marriage...those out of comfort, convenience & love. It might have been too wild with all of Rannaldinni's promiscuity & scandalous sex practices (oh morality, whert have thou gone?)but the writer tempered the scenes with humor so as not to totally appall the readers.Some scenes were sort of weird especially that of Rannaldini's well-planned & well-executed Othello party (but of course, what do you expect of that devil!) & a bit too long for Lysander & Kitty to finally stage a courageous happy ending. But overall, it's a funny read & highly entertaining. You can't help but curse some characters but fall for others.P.S. Meredith... is superbly witty & funny :)"},{"Title":"The Man Who Made Husbands Jealous","review":"I believe Jilly Cooper is continung to make her mark on the publishing world.

This book is definately good, but it is lacking when compared to her other works (Riders, Rivals, Polo, Appasionatta). Whereas those books were exceptionally witty, had very engrossing characters, and fun plots this book frankly does not. The main character, Lysander, is just not very likeable, and the plot gets tedious.In a nutshell, if you're a fan this book is a must.

It paints a wonderful and almost true picture of the English countryside and lifestyle of the rich and famous. For pure escapism and a joyful read, this is it."},{"Title":"The Man Who Made Husbands Jealous","review":"I agree with the reader from Minnesota - this is pretty good, and you can definitely read it without falling asleep.

Lysander is a fun and different hero -- he may not be as smart or as witty as the leading men in previous works (like Rupert) but he has a charming innocence despite the &quot;job&quot; he's been hired to do of making womens' husbands jealous!

Picture a modern day young man, perfect in face, form, and sporting and social accomplishments and heterosexual to boot! Lysander is the product of an English public school upbringing, unbelievably handsome but a modern day Bertie Wooster in that this paragon, although tender hearted and well meaning, is as thick as a brick. He is invited to be a guest in a small, upper class neighbourhood where several of the husbands are totally neglecting their wives, and, to use the book's own words, bonking everything else in sight. The husbands grow very edgy seeing their wives transformed, under Lysander's tutelage, into svelte, beautifully groomed, and obviously well loved women. There is a wonderful cast of villains and heroes supporting Lysander the beautiful, who falls genuinely in love with all of his adoring new female friends, one at a time.

I have experienced the joy of time afield with special hunting partners (two- and four-legged) and have made wonderful memories. Spiller recounts hunts and hunting partners in a conversational tone that makes you feel like you are sharing a spot around the campfire or the hearth, after a day in the woods.

Spiller was an avid grouse (and woodcock) hunter in New England prior to WWII, and he recounts many of the funny stories, strange people, and passes on some of his hard earned grouse-hunting wisdom to future generations of hunters in this book. In the 80-90 years since this book was originally written, grouse hunting (surprisingly) hasn't changed a whole lot. The birds generally aren't quite as prevalent, and it may take a little more effort (and driving) to find that secluded spot, but anyone who has been toting a shooting iron through the woods for hours anticipating a few seconds of excitement at the flapping wings of a thunderchicken will enjoy this book. This book is easy to read, and Spiller's writing style is such that you feel he is sitting right beside you talking to you about his lifetime of experience - there isn't really a single plot line, the recounting just meanders about as Spiller talks about this subject and that, all the while the reader wishes he or she could get out into the woods (at least that is what I kept thinking about). The only reason that I give this four stars is that this book isn't nearly as good as some of the masters of the outdoors/hunting genre (e.g. Robert Ruark, Gordon MacQuarrie, etc.). Decent, but not something that one is likely to read over and over again.

I also experienced a great love from my step dad, Marcel , followed by the same great love from my father Alfred (died in 1944) and than a tremendous overwhelming love from God, our Father. Arms enveloping me all three together as one being. Having been terribly afraid of death and not believing that I was good enough to receive eternal life, this experience gave me the answer to the question of life after life. At that same moment I was lifted above the couch, saw my non-moving body on the couch, saw my funeral procession with my children, husband and tried to get up from the couch and could not until I truly believed that if I let go of my self-centeredness I would be free. I immediately remembered that my 2 year old daughter, Lisa was napping and told myself that I needed to come back to take care of her.

Can't even really make conversation regarding the contents after this read."},{"Title":"Life After Life","review":"Life after Life is a must read book! Dr. Raymond Moody interviews people who were clinically deceased and came back to life. The book presents the Scientific and Christian thoughts on this subject and lets you, the reader decide. Example - One woman clinically dead and came back said she overheard the surgeon and nurse talk about dinner or music. When she woke up and said she overheard them they were amazed! The scientific explanation is that the anvil and stirrup inside her ear recorded the audible sound, stored it, and when she awoke remembered it. The Christian belief is her spirit heard it.Dr. Moody says most people are reluctant to share their experiences because of scorn or ridicule but he did get enough interviews to complete this wonderful book.Some people experienced a warm, loving light, deceased family members in spirit form, and communicated via thought. They said that the light showed them their life from beginning to ending in a montage in a loving way and then communicated to them it wasn't their time. The persons didn't want to leave this warm loving comforting unconditional love but did as requested and returned back to their body. One woman had a small child to raise. All persons felt they had a new lease on life and to live it to the fullest and not waste it.One person committed suicide and said that when he died it was like watching a video of this awful deed replaying it in vivid detail before his eyes and then rewinding the video and playing it over and over again. He said it was hell and no escape. Another person only saw darkness with dark black shadows and hands groping-pulling him down. He cried out to God because he remembered going to church when he was little. He saw one small spectoral light that looked miles away, but it was his only hope. As the darkness and hands engulfed him pulling him down his terror rose to a fever pitch and kept screaming out begging, pleading to the light far away. The light got brigther and closer and before long he was pulled up and out of the Abyss and returned to his body. His life was forever changed! I can't tell you more because I don't want to spoil it for you:)Recommend a book by Robert E. Howard born 1906-1936 who committed suicide. He created Conan the Barbarian, Kull, Solomon Kane, and others. In the book The Savage Tales of Solomon Kane by Del Rey copywright 2004 by Robert E. Howard - The Hills of the Dead page 223, the story is about a man (N'Longa)who leaves his body in spirit form while it sleeps and the spirit travels to another area miles away. It's fascinating and creepy at the same time."},{"Title":"Life After Life","review":"LIFE AFTER LIFERaymond A. Moody, JR., M.D.Copyright 1975HarperCollins Publishers, Inc.Many of us have all experienced some relationship with death; whether or not it is an intimate relation, most of us unanimously agree that death is a feared but inevitable fate. We know that every being that has life must end with death; there is no way around it. Yet it is something that no one truly understands. In this era we have had many new technological and medical breakthroughs and yet not one of the \\"super geniuses\\" has ever been able to understand death. Maybe death is not supposed to be understood; just maybe it is meant for each of us to fear, so that we might live every day like it was our last, because none of us truly understand death, so how will we know if we will ever have the chance to live again?Dr. Raymond Moody interviewed over 150 people that had either been pronounced clinically dead, came very close to physical death, or the experiences of persons who, as they died, told them to other people who were present. Due to the high volumes of cases interviewed Dr. Moody only put about 50 of the most relevant cases from persons actually being pronounced clinically dead, or that had come very close to physical death, in his book Life After Life. Each person was interviewed in great detail, and was asked what happened once they died. To Dr. Moodys astonishment many of the same occurrences happened in each case.There were ten experiences of death that were common in most of the 50 cases interviewed.The first experience \\"Hearing the news\\". In this stage you are already clinically dead; however you are still able to see your surroundings and hear what people were saying in a telepathic sense.The second experience \\"Feelings of peace and Quiet\\". Many people explained intense pleasant feelings and sensations of unimaginable peace, and serenity.The third experience \\"The noise\\". In many cases there was a loud noise present during clinical death. Some portrayed the noise to be more of a loud \\"brrrrnnnnng-brrrrrnnnng-brrrrrnnnng\\" while others said it was a beautiful noise that was similar to majestic Japanese wind bells.The fourth experience \\"The dark tunnel\\". Often occurring with the noise, people had the sensation of being pulled rapidly through a dark void, tunnel, vacuum, trough, or funnel type space. Many claimed that the \\"tunnel\\" was extremely dark and small, and there was just enough room for there bodies to fit in.The fifth experience \\"Out of the body\\". After their passage through the dark \\"tunnel\\" many times the person found themselves looking at their body from a distance, many times in the same room. However now they no longer posses a body, but a mere cloud of grey mist that has no weight, or boundaries.The sixth experience \\"Meeting others\\". Usually early in the experience deceased loved ones would show up, and be there to help the transition of life to death.The seventh and eighth experience \\"The being of light\\" and \\"The review\\". While in the dark tunnel many attested to seeing a bright light, in fact the light was the brightest thing they had ever seen, and yet it never hurt there eyes, or obstructed their view in any way. Then the \\"being of light\\" telepathically began talking to them, and showed them their entire life in an instant. Not just as pictures but as 3 dimensional movies, and each \\"picture\\" was displayed at the same time. It only took an instant to view ones entire life history.The ninth experience \\"The border or limit\\" There were a few people in this study that made it passed the tunnel, into the area where a border existed. Some said it was a door, others said it was an ocean or a mist. However their descriptions were some what different they all seem to be portraying the same thing. There was something that couldn't be seen until they were officially dead, the line or border couldn't be crossed until there were no chances of coming back to life on earth.The tenth and final experience \\"Coming back\\". Each person that was interviewed all ended up surviving the \\"illness\\", and in many cases people experienced a being \\"pulled back\\" into their bodies, many of them not having a choice in the matter.My OpinionI really want to believe in life after death, doesn't everyone? Through the years my fate has taught me to believe that there is a God, and after death if you followed his path that he laid out for you, your \\"soul\\" will be rewarded with admittance into heaven. However it is something that has to be believed or learned, not something you can experience first hand, so you must be able to trust the unseen. Since I have never actually intimately experienced death I have only seen hypothetical experiences in movies that portray death as an encounter quite similar to this book, however not in such detail. I will admit that I am very afraid to die, I am not only afraid of what might happen to me, but what might happen to my family as a result of my demise. As I read this book I was trying to think of logical reasons to why these same things were happening to many of the people interviewed. I did come up with some explanations but none that would most likely hold true. I think that Dr. Moody had such an awesome experience to be involved in such an aw-inspiring research project, and I am sure it has completely changed his life. If this book is actually telling the truth about death then I cannot wait to go to the other side and meet God, which is the ultimate goal after all. But sadly I am still in a transitioning stage in my faith, yes I believe in god, and his power, but I am not sure of my beliefs of life after life."},{"Title":"Life After Life","review":"This book is the perfect read for anyone who has lost a loved one or wondered what the \\"other side\\" just might consist of. Dr. Moody provides some amazing individual accounts from folks who have died, but were able to return to this Earth to tell about it. If you are closed minded and don't believe in the after life, this book isn't for you...however, if you believe that we live on even after we leave our physical body, don't hesitate to order this one. Brought up some scenarios which I encountered as I watched my Dad die at home of cancer...really provided me with a great deal of comfort knowing that he is truly in such an awe inspiring place."},{"Title":"Life After Life","review":"I read the original first edition of this book. It had an \\"afterword\\" in which Moody discussed many people who had truly horrifying near-death experiences - returning with incredible horror and terror at what they were about to enter. It changed their lives, and caused them to re-examine who they were and how they lived.I feel it was nearly criminal to cut this most-important, balancing section out of later editions, as it leaves people with the erroneous idea that everyone faces a beautific afterlife with a loving God, which is certainly not true. Moody's actual, complete, balanced research, shows exactly what we're told in scripture - that for those who know, love, and obey God, there is an afterlife of bliss and beauty and love. For those who do not honor God in this life, there is an afterlife of horror and agony. No surprises in that.But how misleading to cut that original material out of his book!"},{"Title":"Life After Life","review":"I read Raymond A. Moody, Jr.'s LIFE AFTER LIFE after a friend recently recommended it to me. The book first came out some 25 years ago, and this new edition comes with an update in the form of an Afterword by the author. I was pretty familiar with the contents of LIFE AFTER OF LIFE already, for when it was first published in 1975 the book received considerable media attention and the idea of \\"near-death experiences\\" (NDEs, a term coined by Moody) was thoroughly discussed in the press. Nonetheless, I enjoyed reading through the book and refreshing my memory about the touchstones of the NDEs, such as the tunnel, being out of the body, the being of bright light, and the warm, euphoric feelings attending the experience particularly towards the end.LIFE AFTER LIFE begins with a description of how Moody came about doing research in this area. He then gives as much of a common picture of the NDE experience as his 150 examples allow. Moody proceeds to give examples from specific cases of people he interviewed who claimed that they had had an NDE. (It might be possible that Moody might have been \\"leading\\" his subjects in the interviews, but it's clear that Moody regarded his role as an interested but neutral listener.) The author describes similar experiences described in religious and other nonfiction literature, some better known than others. (I found it curious that he did not cite works of fiction, such as Tolstoy's \\"The Death of Ivan Ilych,\\" which, too, reflects some of the experiences described in Moody's book.) Finally, Moody lays out the various types of explanations for NDE--that is, aside from the idea that these people actually died and really experienced an afterlife--mainly with the aim of showing how the various scientific explanations fall short. Moody is careful to claim that he is \\"not trying to prove that there is life after death\\" (p. xxvii), but it is apparent where his sympathies lie.Moody is right to suggest that the reductionist explanations from physiological, pharmacological, and neurological standpoints really haven't yet explained why people have these kinds of experiences. On the other hand, Moody adopts the classical concept of a mind-body dualism in discussing why people with NDEs describe, albeit with difficulty, having a new body, that in the midst of the NDE they can see their physical body, and how their minds feel unusually free, unclouded and ready to learn new things. This dualism is not well supported by science (it's not just the brain that \\"thinks\\"), and contemporary theology, too, would argue against it (\\"The only reality is the unity of the living creature called man...\\"--Wolfhart Pannenburg). It also raises the basis question in consciousness studies: can there be consciousness apart from the physical brain? I don't think it's too much of a leap to suggest that most brain researchers would probably say no, though many people with religious convictions would hold on to the idea that at the least something of one's personal identity--the \\"I\\"--survives death. Hence the question of life after death remains, essentially, a religious one.There are those who might be drawn to the stories in this book as comfort in the face of the very natural fear of death. I would point those individuals to an online article by Kevin Williams, who accepts NDEs as actual life-after-death experiences, but who also maintains a healthy skepticism. He explains why it's irrational to fear death. See: http://www.near-death.com/experiences/articles007.html.As I noted above, I found the book interesting to read, and might have appreciated it more if I didn't have such a d&eacute;j&agrave;-vu feeling in reading it. Again, I think most people nowadays are familiar with the NDE concept. But this is where it all started, and it's good to have the baseline of this book as a reference to what's been discussed since."},{"Title":"Life After Life","review":"This book should be read by everyone, and especially those interested in the afterlife/NDE, spirituality, and psychic ability.

I recently read it again and it has lost none of it's impact over the years. Moody provides us with much to think about and does a wonderful job of presenting his facts and findings. Addressing a subject that cannot be proven one way or the other is a daunting task to say the least and Mr. Moody has done what is probably the best job thus far.

Her expereiences correlate with what is reported in this book and on the video by the same name.I think one of the great things about the video is that it addresses different aspects of the experience, and actually shows the people who have had them reporting on how the experience occurred for this person, and this person, and this one. To me this gives validity to the experiences. There is a common thread that runs from experience to experience, person to person, which transcends personal experience and points to something Universal. It is a convincing case for the existence of life after death, and the ecstatic union that later life entails.This book/video has the power to unwrap the fear that we have around death and liberate us.

What I disliked was the short excerpts of the accounts. I was hoping for more full length detailed accounts, and this book only tells about a paragraph of each experience.

The author often uses the same words repeating, for instince: had had, etc. This book is neither exceptional or bad in my opinion."},{"Title":"Life After Life","review":"This is a fascinating look at a poorly-understood phenomenon. the author tries to give an abstract model of the accounts of many people who have come close to death or who have been &quot;clinically&quot; dead for some time. He mentions the characteristics that any NDE's tend to be a subset of: Out-of-body experiences, going through the tunnel, meeting beings of life, seeing dead relatives, the loud ringing sound, and so on. Very little speculation is done here (and I think that is for the better), but rather the existential aspects are emphasised. Rather than impressing me with the possibility of life after death, the book seemed to mark upon me the untapped potantials of the human mind, which are just beginning to be learned about. the book will do little to convince any serious-minded reader of the actuality of life after death, which is a good thing, I think . . . when dealing with such matters, I do not think one should rely on a book, but on direct experience. So I do not believe that the reality of &quot;only life&quot; can ever be scientifically proven. Nevertheless, a study of such matters may provide a valuable psychological asset in the study of human beings. For a more detailed and scientific look, please refer to Ian Richardson's and Kenneth Ring's research."},{"Title":"Life After Life","review":"I first read about Near death experiences from Elisabeth Kubler-Ross.

Very meaningful to me."},{"Title":"Life After Life","review":"Life After Life by Raymond Moody, Rider (Random House), 1975, 208 ff.Dr Raymond Moody is an American philosopher and psychologist who has specialised in a study of afterlife experiences. Though he is not suggesting that his work \`proves' the existence of a sentient afterlife, Moody's own beliefs on NDEs (a term that he coined in this book), can be summed up with the following quote from his television interview with Jeffrey Mishlove, PhD:\`I don't mind saying that after talking with over a thousand people who have had these experiences, and having experienced many times some of the really baffling and unusual features of these experiences, it has given me great confidence that there is a life after death. As a matter of fact, I must confess to you in all honesty, I have absolutely no doubt, on the basis of what my patients have told me, that they did get a glimpse of the beyond.' [quoted on Wikipedia]This book describes the experiences of those who have undergone what Moody calls NDEs.What is both remarkable and reassuring is the similarities of the experiences described by intelligent and often highly educated people: \`The people I have interviewed are functional well-balanced personalities . . . very capable of distinguishing dream and fantasy from reality'. Moody is not dealing with people seeking to build a reputation on sensationalism in the popular press.The degree of detail recounted repeatedly by many different people denies the possibility that some of the features - the \`bright light', \`the journey through the long dark tunnel', \`visions of one's own body and those nearby at the time of \`death' as seen by an observer', the \`welcome by deceased relatives or friends', the \`reluctance to return to earthly life', the \`sense of tranquillity and oneness of all that is' - could simply be imaginary. These features are also endorsed by spirits who manifest to materialisation mediums.To qualify these accounts, in Chapter 2 on The Experience of Dying Moody points out that \`no two [accounts] are precisely identical'; \`no one person . . . reports every single component of the composite experience'; \`no one element of the composite experience . . . crops up in every narrative'. Not all people pronounced clinically dead, or whose heart and lungs are stopped for such operations as cardiac bypass surgery (such as myself) report NDEs. But there is at least one patient - Pam Reynolds Lowery - whose brain was also stilled who reported an NDE (not described here but in Michael Sabom's book \`Light and Death'). The phenomena are not restricted to any one country or religion.Accurate description of events going on around the patient after they are clinically dead according to all medical monitors are some of the most convincing and verifiable evidence of the validity of near-death phenomena. Interestingly, patients' description of their spiritual body are very similar to the subtle body (as it is usually called) described by mystics of eastern faiths. It is described as like a misty hologram of the dying individual or their relatives who come to assist their passage.To me, a rational scientist trained to look for explanations for practical, empirical findings, the stories presented here are highly cohesive, persuasive and reassuring though, like Dr Moody, I have never experienced an NDE or OBE myself.Glimpses of Eternity (Mind Body Spirit)Consciousness Beyond Life: The Science of the Near-Death ExperienceThe Afterlife Revealed by Michael TymnHoward Jones is the author of The World as Spirit"},{"Title":"Life After Life","review":"No matter what your personal views are on religion, spirituality, or death, Life After Life is an important book because it is the first of its kind--no one had given the near death experience, or NDE, the scientific time of day until Moody came along. He stays grounded throughout the book, simply describing actual NDEs and tying together the common elements between them without making too much of a statement of opinion. (Incidentally, the follow up book The Light Beyond sees Moody start to go off the deep end and explore pseudoscientific topics such as \\"mirror gazing,\\" something that is clearly explained by other scientific phenomena, though it also has more legit NDE information.)I am a person who is fascinated by the very real experience of NDE whether it's indicative of an afterlife or the complexities of our own brain. If you share that interest (or think you might), this is the definitive book to start with. Overall an easy, enjoyable read that is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Life After Life","review":"One of the best books I have ever read by an astutely credible source. The purpose of this book is not to convince the reader to believe one way or another, but to encourage continued thought provoking research and open-mindedness toward the phenomena of what happens to us when we die. Since reading this book many years ago, I have spoken with three people who confided in me their similar experiences which are discussed in this book. They all have said, in one way or another, that they are selective with whom they discuss these events and requested that their information not be spread carelessly, for fear of being looked upon as worse than merely odd. Since then, many more of these occurences have been publicized due to our increased medical ability to bring people back from the clinical dead.

It has helped me to better understand the death process of others and my role in supporting the dying one. I have been made aware that the subject is the star of this scenario and that focusing on their physical, emotional, and spiritual needs, the joy one has known in the relationship, and the willingness to surrender the subject to death make the subject's transition from life to death as serene as possible. I learned to do my grieving later, on my own time, so as not to interfere with this process by holding it back with my own bereavement. Finally, this book has given me the support for the eventual death of my earthly body and the transition of my soul in joining Spirit and begining a new adventure.

This is what comes to mind as I read the reports of Dr. Moody's patients. They speak of an experience outside of time and beyond three dimensions.For us to conceive of something requires that there be a prior three dimensional experience, in time, for us to develop a concept. That is what makes these reports \\"inconceivable\\", yet \\"believable\\", just like what is prior to the \\"Big Bang\\" wherein the Cosmos \\"emerged\\" from a \\"point of no dimensions\\". This also is inconceivable and consequently not a \\"fact\\" in the usual sense of scientific data.After Jesus said, \\"Metanoiesete\\", he went on to say that the \\"good news\\" is that the Kingdom of Heaven is \\"within\\" you, not conceivable but believable.Moody's small book is mind altering."},{"Title":"Life After Life","review":"To the best of my memory, there are only three books I have read three times in my life: The Bible, Death Be Not Proud and this book, the 1975 classic by Raymond A.

There is a life after this and how we feel and treat others does and will matter.This book talks about many nde'ers and points out the facts the evidence both for and against, there by being truly scientific. Don't be one of those narrow minded scientific explanators of NDE's. they try to pass it off as a hallucination from a drug produced by the mind. These people don't even know the effect hallucinagen have on the mind. First they cause hallucinations that change in ways that the non-contradictory NDE's occur, second hallucinagens, paticullarly narcotics, cause disturbing hallucinations to occur. Third if hallucinagens Are the cause of the NDE's wouldn't all Drug users Have NDE like experiences and suddenly become religious turn from the narcotic after the first use and become wonderfull members of society like all NDE'ers become. Second they say the dieing of the brain from the outside to the center causes the tunnel effect the problem is this would cause people to loose their more logical parts of the brain and the experience would become more animal like but just the opposite occurs. They (the near death experiencer's) have a highly stimulating very civilized discussion with a highly intelligent being (God!).Now on to the non-truth some of the NDE's seem to be created by people who want attention or some other reason to make up their own NDE.Try being open minded, Don't go around like those skeptical investigators The very title \\"skeptic\\" such go into an investigation intent to disprove, they come up with the first doughtfull idea (no matter how rediculuss) and say it (the supernatural occurence) is not true and pretend their narrow minded position is WISE.

In 1975, it was fitting to approach these topics with great caution, because the default attitude was so skeptical and so likely to invite ridicule if not ruin a person's entire reputation.Toward that end, Moody (originally a skeptic in his own right), approaches the topic of NDEs with the attitude that almost no one will believe what he is saying. He gives the personal accounts, not trying to convince anyone of anything, but definitely making broken-record statements throughout that he wouldn't blame anyone for rejecting all of it.The fact that the book was written for such a highly skeptical audience made it tedious for me because I, myself, am already a believer.

Due to his background in both philosophy and the medical field, he is able to present an incredible case for the afterlife. Much of his credibility comes from the fact that he does not speak from self experience but from the accounts of his patients. This gives his writing a very objective approach not tainted by his own biases.A very easy to read and understand book, LAL expounds upon such things as God, eternity, spiritual bodies, and many other accounts of the afterlife. One of the most well written books in its field, Life After Life continues to draw reader's minds into endless possibilities, and the one unanswered question: What if?"},{"Title":"Life After Life","review":"Moody is critical enough about what is going on that he makes a good investigator into the NDE phenomenon. There are too many flakes in the field and too many people aiming to crown themselves as spiritual gurus via their claim of having revelations during an NDE. Moody quite simply surveys people who have this experience and notes their similarities and differences. Then, he tries to put it into perspective - how might it be explained physically, psychologically, spiritually? What other phenomenon produce experiences that overlap with some of the ones reported in NDEs (e.g. high-gravity simulators)?What I like most is that he just lays down the evidence without trying to overextend himself by speculating on what is really going on. The book is relatively short, but well-written and will keep your attention. I felt it fell a bit short of 5 starts for two reasons. First, he neglects to mention at all the negative NDEs or \\"Fear Death Experiences\\". How common the FDEs are is the subject of debate, but he does not even touch the topic. Second, it's really just a brief mention, but he cites the Bridey Murphy reincarnation study as if it were believable - but it was discredited a long time ago (1950's?), so I'm dissapointed he apparently either didn't know that or wasn't skeptical enough to follow that through prior to putting it in print.Other than minor problems, though, this is really a very interesting book."},{"Title":"Life After Life","review":"Among the books on the topic of life after death, this 1975 book \\"Life After Life\\" by Raymond Moody is a undoubtedly a better written one. It is an well-organized first person account of near-death experience, based on the interviews of 150 people. At the end of the book, the author offers a number of plausible explanations of the near-death experience. Raymond Moody is better qualified among authors of books of this genre. He is medical doctor and has doctorate degrees in psychology and philosophy. His academic credentials make his writings on the topic of life after death more credible (See Note). Throughout most the book, Moody tries to be neutral, although his leaning in the belief of life after death is apparent. I was an agnostic before I read the book; I remain one afterward, but I become more knowledgeable on the topic. At the end, it is up to the reader to decide whether life after death is for real.Note: Moody's 1975 book was followed by a torrent of publications on the topic of life after death, many written by authors who claim to be mediums with special psychic ability and can communicate with the dead or authors with minimal qualifications on the topic. I find their writings suspect."},{"Title":"Life After Life","review":"This work by Raymond A Moody is approximately 40 years old in 2011. It was ground breaking at the time and to this day remains so. I have owned several copies of this great work. I loaned copies out several times, sadly never were they returned. My interest in this stems from the fact that I suffer from hypertension and sleep apnea. Both of these health conditions led to my experiencing near death and out of body experiences. I thought I was losing my mind until I read Raymond Moody's book \\"Life after Life\\". I have been investigating the phenomina for 40 years and haven't found a more accurate book on the topic anywhere, period. I know human personality survives death. I know there is reincarnation of human personality. This flies in the face of modern Christianity. It was not until I studied the life of Christ, I understood that reincarnation was taught and understood by early Christians and Jesus Christ. Reincarnation as a topic of theology was taken out of the cannodical Bible in the Sixth Century for many reasons, chief among them was the desire of the businessmen of the church to control adherents. Wealth was easier to extract from people who were taught only the permission of emmisaries of Christ could relieve sin upon physical death. Jesus said in several places in the New Testament, \\"You must be born again.\\" That is the only vestage of the original teaching which survives. Though this has nothing to do with the subjects covered in \\"Life After Life\\", it may help you understand that survival of human personality is a FACT long known but suppresed. I am not interested in a religious philosophy, but several of them say the same thing; particularly Hinduism. I am interested in convincing you, who may be facing death in the immediate future, there is nothing to fear. Death is as natural a transition as infancy to pubescence and pubesence to middle age, and middle age to geriatric age. If you need guidance to other sources, view \\"What the Bleep Do We Know\\" (Amazon and Netflix), \\"What the Bleep Do We Know, Down The Rabbit Hole\\" (Amazon and Netflix).

Reading this book gave her much needed comfort and understanding about her experience.I know that most people (like me) who have never had an NDE, are curious about them. And this book satisfies that curiosity, at least partially.But for those who have experienced them, a book like this provides much-needed comfort and understanding. This is partially due to the fact that it is difficult to talk about your own NDE with someone who doesn't understand them, or may even be skeptical.

I don't believe in \\"proofs\\" but rather \\"evidence\\" and \\"theories.\\" I don't think it was the author's intention to prove anything, but rather to show the peculiar patterns among those people he interviewed. I really liked his non-partisan, matter-of-fact approach; he would make no personal judgments or conjectures as if there was a political or religious agenda behind the project. Instead, he would methodically log and categorize the commonality of experiences.I regularly send this book to those friends and family who are in grieving. My hope is that it might give them a perspective that brings some comfort and hope in a world obsessed by the \\"neuro-biological materialism\\" that seemed to brainwash us in the 1960s. I still have my former Holy Grail on my bookshelf -- B.F. Skinner'sBeyond Freedom & Dignity. I can't really say how Life After Life is truly received by my friends and family.

No doubt it was very controversial when it was originally published. Dr. Moody does a very good job of compiling and comparing data from interviews with the people who had these experiences to capture the \\"essence\\" of dying and how it changed their perspective on life. This is definitely what he does best. The part to support NDEs through sources like the Tibetan Book of the Dead and the writings of Emanuel Swedenborg was lacking. But in his defense, it had to be put in there or the book would have been classifed under fiction."},{"Title":"Life After Life","review":"I first read Dr. Moody's collection of near-death experiences in the mid-1980s when death was only an academic subject for a thiry-something person. I was fascinated by the accounts he and pediatrician Melvin Morse had collected from patients and felt a sense of reassurance that the compiler was a scientist. These reports changed my outlook on life. Now, about two decades later, it makes it easier to accept a most shattering loss, the passing of my partner and husband of 33 years. However, I'm more drawn now, not to the accounts of \\"tourists,\\" who have gone and come back, but the permanent residents whom mediums like George Anderson have interviewed."},{"Title":"Life After Life","review":"\\"Life after life\\" is Raymond Moody's classical book on near-death experiences (NDEs). It was originally published in 1975.Unless I'm mistaken, the very term NDE was invented by Moody himself. I read the book during my most materialist-sceptical period, and was deeply intrigued by it, although I still came out as a non-believer in the end. I also read Sabom, Morse and Brinkley. How I reacted to the latter, you might as well imagine!Today, Moody's book gives a strangely nave impression. Yes, really! He seems to have been genuinely convinced that the phenomenon he was describing was something more or less unheard of before. In reality, of course, NDEs in one form or another have been reported throughout recorded history. Indeed, Moody did find similar experiences when reading ancient religious or philosophical literature, including the famous \\"Tibetan Book of the Dead\\" and the writings of Emmanuel Swedenborg. Visions of departed loved ones are even more common, and detailed in a later book by the author, \\"Reunions\\".Another nave trait of \\"Life after life\\" is the almost rational and logical way in which the author describes the near death experiences. In reality, many NDEs are (frankly) pretty weird, as the ones described by Moody's own assistant Brinkley in \\"Saved by the Light\\". Nor are all NDEs necessarily positive, although many of them are. For the darker side, see P.M.H. Atwater's \\"Beyond the Light\\".Perhaps \\"Life after life\\" was written during a period when respectable society was still too secularized and materialist for the heavier stuff to be widely accepted? Even the author himself seems surprised by his findings. Yet, they simply confirm what \\"folk psychology\\" has always held true: for good or for worse, there is indeed life after life. ;-)"},{"Title":"Life After Life","review":"Although this book is a classic, Raymond Moody later wrote another book called \\"The Last Laugh\\" which he wishes was an addendum to \\"Life After Life.\\" In \\"Last Laugh\\" he has backed off the claim that NDE's are evidence of an afterlife. However, if one is interested in an indepth assessment of the afterlife evidence, then I highly recommend Stephen Braude's \\"Immortal Remains\\" which also gives very good reasons why NDE's are poor evidence for the \\"survivalist\\" hypothesis. If you examine much of the survival evidence, it's not clear what to say. It's not clear to what extent it can be explained away in terms of normal or abnormal processes, or even in terms of paranormal processes among the living. Some of the so-called evidence scarcely makes sense even if one accepts the idea of postmortem survival. These are matters that Braude's book examines at length, and he still comes to the assessment that the best cases for mediumship, reincarnation, possession, and hauntings do better support the view that some aspects of our personality and personal consciousness survives the death of our bodies, at least for a time."},{"Title":"Life After Life","review":"The book was everything I expected.the book was everything I fxpected"},{"Title":"Life After Life","review":"This book was a good book to read it makes you feel better about life and death. It doesn't matter if you don't belave in life after death, because when you read it the book makes you think, could there be a life when you die. The author has style in his wrighting and he explans lots of what he puts in the book. Dr. Moody says there are many things that people expernce one of them are death. in his book he says he knows people that have came back to life.The things I like about this book is that it made me feel better. It made me look at death in a different way like I never wanted to die. I always though that everything was over and I would just be gone ,but now I think different about it and im ok about the whole thing of death. I think there is a God and we do get to see him in another life. He also has a gold book that says if we were nice or bad.The author tells about when he was a yong kid he got to know a teacher when he was in college. This teacher had told about his near death experence, but Dr. Moody did not beleave in it then later on in his life he talked to more people that had experence the same thing. Thats when he started to want to know more about this near death stuff. I think don't think somethings not true just because you have not experence it your self. there are other people that have and could live to tell about it. Thats why I think this is a good book to read it could change your life or it could change what you think about death."},{"Title":"Life After Life","review":"Moody's book may not have been the first analysis of the near-death experience, but it was the first that brought this phenomenon to the public's attention in a popular form. I give Moody credit for writing a classic, and cannot hold him responsible for the direction the NDE survival community has taken since then. Moody was investigating a topic that interested him, and wanted to share his observations with a wider audience. His investigations fit into the burgeoning interest in death at the time, which included Elisabeth Kubler-Ross' categorization of the stages of grief, and Jack Kevorkian's advocacy of death with dignity. None of these topics had been discussed before in the popular arena, and Moody's work was pioneering.Of course, belief in life after death goes back long before Moody's work - another writer claims that it goes back at least to the Neanderthals. This is a stretch, as remains of Neanderthal funeral rituals may imply but not prove this - specific Neanderthal beliefs will forever remain a mystery. Moody's cataloging of NDEs was an attempt to find commonalities between stories, which would suggest that the subjects were experiencing real, objective events, and not individual hallucinations. In other words, if hundreds of people visit Paris and return to tell of it, one may assume that Paris really exists. In the case of NDEs, this is an invalid assumption.Nathan Ausubel relates a story of two Talmudic students who were arguing over the merits of their respective rabbis. One claimed that his rabbi ascended to heaven each night to speak to the prophet Elijah. When the other student asked how he knew this, the first student said that his rabbi had told him. \\"And what if your rabbi is lying?\\" asked the other student. \\"Impossible!\\" cried the first student. \\"A man so holy that he ascends to heaven and speaks to the prophet Elijah is incapable of lying!\\"I am not saying that all NDEs are fabrications, although surely some of them - recent popular accounts by Don Piper, Todd Burpo, Kevin Malarkey, Bill Weise, and others - seem geared more toward marketing to a sympathetic audience than relating actual events. But in the case of legitimate NDEs, one may ask, where is the subject going, and how can we tell if the information received is accurate?It may seem obvious, but 100% of NDE subjects returned to life. Not a single one of them stayed dead, for if they had, we never would have heard their story. Therefore, the sample is biased - like conducting a poll limited to Ron Paul supporters, and concluding from the results that Ron Paul enjoys 100% support. Assuming that subjects of NDEs, and the truly, permanently dead, have identical experiences, cannot be proven with the existing data. It can never be proven, until some way is found to communcate with the dead, and in that event, we won't need the stories of NDEs anymore - we will have the real thing. Unfortunately, the field of mediums is rife with frauds and charlatans like John Edward, James van Praagh, and many other professional cold readers. So it is impossible to assert that NDEs are any indication of what happens after real and permanent death. When I was growing up in Los Angeles in the 1970s and 1980s, the area around Los Angeles International Airport was rife with strip joints and girlie bars. A traveler on a brief layover, who ventured out of the airport into the immediate surrounding area, would have concluded that Los Angeles consisted solely of those establishments. And if a denizen had informed him that the Statue of Liberty and the Eiffel Tower were to be found downtown, he would have no way to verify this. Concluding that the perceptions of a NDE are indicative of actual life after death is based on a similar level of knowledge.The other problem is veracity. Moody found no single feature common to all NDEs. Despite commonalities, taking the events of a NDE as revelatory of some absolute, universal truth is unwarranted. All NDEs also happen to human beings, so we would expect them to be similar to each other. Since \\"Life After Life\\" was published, several specific NDEs have been presented as \\"proof\\" that the subject's consciousness at least left their body, even if it did not travel to some other realm. The \\"shoe on the ledge\\" story has been discredited, and is not even used anymore by NDE survivial advocates. The \\"denture man\\" story depends on the account of the attending nurse, since the subject himself was never interviewed. The \\"Pam Reynolds\\" case hangs on the assumption that the earplugs the subject was wearing prevented her from hearing anything. Even these dubious accounts occured entirely within this world, not the next one.Moody's inquiries have since been supplemented by more rigorous research, with no definitive proof yet forthcoming. One drawback is that a NDE cannot be studied while it is taking place, since the NDE is usually revealed after the subject wakes up. It would be unethical to induce a dangerous condition in a healthy subject in order to give them a NDE so they could be placed in a fMRI; generally the attending medical staff is performing resucitation while this is going on. Claims that the NDE took place while the subject was \\"dead\\" ignores the possibility that they could have occurred earlier or later, while there was still some brain activity.Belief in life after death is long-standing and widespread, probably held by the vast majority of people across the world. So the effort to \\"prove\\" life after death may be unnecessary. To quote Horatio, \\"There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave/ To tell us this.\\" And the specific impressions - a light, meeting departed relatives, a life review, a judgment, bliss - fit in well with the expected afterlife for believers in any of the Abrahamic religions, probably comprising close to half the world's population. And given the political and cultural dominance of those particular people, this vision of the afterlife is probably the best-known of any. So it is no surprise that people from different cultures experience similar impressions. What I would be interested in is a study of whether different cultures, in the past as well as the present, viewed the NDE process itself. It is by no means a given that a NDE would be recognized as taking place while the subject was near death; without modern medical technology, it would be difficult to tell if the subject was merely asleep. The experience could be taken to signify something other than a vision of the afterlife - it could be perceived as guidance in one's place in the community. The Dreamtime of the Aborigines, the Native American Visionquest, and other extreme experiences were intended to guide the subject in this life, not to provide knowledge of the next. Outside of Pentecostal Christianity, Hasidic Judaism, and a few other traditions, there are very few opportunities for modern Westerners to have an ecstatic experience of the divine, and in general, these experiences are frowned upon by the larger society. Maybe it takes being near death on an operating table to have any hope of achieving these states in modern society.Belief that the NDE demonstrates the eternal survival of the human consciousness corresponds to many religious traditions, and quells our fear of the eternal void we will experience after our deaths. For some reason, the eternal void before our births is of little consequence. I am reminded of Walt Whitman's closing to \\"Respondez;\\" \\"Let the limited years of life do nothing for the limitless years of death! (What do you suppose death will do, then?)\\"Leopold Bloom \\"When they was no meat, we ate fowl. When they was no fowl, we ate craw-dad. When they was no craw-dad to be found, we ate sand.\\""},{"Title":"Life After Life","review":"And I still have sentimental feelings for it.

For the most part this is a well-organized book that has some interesting stories told by people who were changed by their experience with death.Before reading this book I didn't know that some people heard music or other sounds as they died. Other than that I'd heard about most of the steps people go through when they die. Floating above the body seems very common and seeing relatives is also expected.

For example, after their experience some people develop psychic powers and are able to read people's thoughts.I recently readSaved by the Light: The True Story of a Man Who Died Twice and the Profound Revelations He Receivedwhich is a very exciting book that describes heaven. While \\"Life After Life\\" is still compelling it lacks descriptions of heaven or hell.

I would recommend this book to the bereaved and to those facing the impending death of a loved one."},{"Title":"Life After Life","review":"Raymond Moody's book is a must read for anyone interested in the scientific proof that goes along with this type of investigative study. Written from the perspective of a once-sceptic, he quickly moves through the stages of doubt to belief when the details of patient after patient reveal earily similar cannot be denied details of what happens after we pass and that is - simply that we don't die!"},{"Title":"Life After Life","review":"Gives accounts from persons that have had a near death experience and also discusses the notion of life after death.

I picked up this book hoping to learn a bit about the early research into NDE. I was not disappointed. The book is informative without being preachy, letting the readers draw their own conclusions."},{"Title":"Life After Life","review":"In September last year my darling mum died. She had cancer but died a peaceful and almost painless death. Mum had no fear of death or dying. But from the moment she died, I have desperately wanted to know where she went. I do not believe that a human being's life is completely snuffed out upon death. Reading Raymond Moody's book confirmed my belief. I no longer wonder what happened to Mum, where she went or even where she is now - I am at peace about all that. All my life I have deeply feared the inevitability of my own death. Now, when I think of death, I am no longer anxious and afraid. Again, I feel peace. Dr Moody's research has given me an intelligent, substantiated answer to what I once believed was an unanswerable question about the unknown. His book went straight to the heart of my need. If you fear death, or have lost someone you love, read Life after Life. It will answer many of your questions, diminish your fear and relieve some of your pain."},{"Title":"Life After Life","review":"Raymond Moody did a survey of people who had near death experiences. He found that all of the participants in the survey experienced God unconditional love. I believe this is the first publication about these experiences. It must be the survey Lewis makes reference to in his book An Encounter With A Prophet. It is enlightening to see how all of these people responded to these questions before the media got a hold on the subject and attracted the fundamental religious fanatics"},{"Title":"Life After Life","review":"This book is a wonderful gift for our recently bereaved friends, or those who have notyet accepted the loss of a loved one. It is compatible with most religious outlooks anddoctrines.This very original work is a joy to read, and is a great solace and comfort to anyonewho has ever had to deal with death of friend or family. Insights are given as to the truenature of death as a sequel to life, and the reality of a glorious afterlife. Largely due toimprovements in medical technologies, many people are now brought back from near-death, oftenwith reports of their experiences upon entering and glimpsing another world just over thethreshhold between life and death...Their first hand reports are thrilling. The manner in whichDr. Moody presents these experiences, shared with him over the years by his patients, is sensitiveand meaningful, never morbid or frightening. Upon completion, the reader may well exclaim, &quot;Death,where is thy sting?&quot;.This is a &quot;must read&quot;!"},{"Title":"Life After Life","review":"It does not matter what race you are, but if you have experienced or know anyone who has experienced near death than this is a book that you should definately consider reading. It does not matter if you are a religous person because there are several people who give their experiences of near-death that are not religious. This wonderful book is about people's experiences with near death. Each and everyone of us will experience death in many different ways, in which Moody has shown throughout his book. He touches on the phenomenon of death, the experience of dying where people actually say they travel rapidly through a very dark long tunnel, paralles, questions, explanations, and people's impressions of the overall book.The reason why I have chosen to read this particular book is because my grandmother experienced a near death situation. She was rushed to the hospital one night where she remained in the ER for several hours because of heart failure. The nurses and doctors told us to go in a hold her hand and say our last words with her because they thought that she wasn't going to make it. When I was in the ER I could tell that she was in severe pain. She kept saying, Please don't let me die...\\" As she was repeating herself over and over she had her hands raised in the air like she was reaching for something. Later after she recovered she told us that she saw two angels and a bright light, therefore Moody has won over my decision on whether or not people experience a \\"real death\\" experience.In this book Moody tells his readers what it is like to die. Several people are affraid of facing death, but this book has made me over come my fears of dying. Moody presents real life experiences that people have submitted to him of their near-death experiences. Many people wonder if they are hallucinating or really experiencing death. Although, Moody says death is only where resuscitation is not taking place, even though these people truly believe that they have experienced what death is going to be like. Some people say that they are glad to know that they have lived life right because it showed them going to heaven rather than hell. Also, there were several people who mentioned that they could hear the doctors pronounce them dead and they tried to tell the nurses and doctors that they weren't but felt that they could not talk or could not move.After reading this book I was so amazed to find that Moody showed two sides to his argument. He showed the side of what he believed, which was that people really were experiencing near-death and the other side which is where people did not believe that this was true. Moody inserted and question and explantion section in his book, which made it really helpful to see both sides of the argument. He even presented questions that contradicted what he believed and he did his best to give a clear explanation of why he believed in near-death. Moody also was very honest and told people when he agreed with their reasoning on certain subjects.Moody clearly explained his views in such a profound and meaningful way throughtout his entire book. In the end of the book Moody says that everyone should not fear death after reading several people's experiences. He says that death should be an everlasting exerience that should be filled with joy and ever lasting life on the other side. You can either take his word or live life worrying when your time is going to come to move on. I strongly consider all people who are striving for a degree in the medical field to read this journey of death book. This book will make you want to keep reading to find out what else others have to say about their near death experiences. I hope you enjoy the book!"},{"Title":"Life After Life","review":"Before reading this book, I didn't believe in life after death. After reading it, I did. I'm not the gullible type. This is a sincere book, not a fraud, and its conclusions are reasonable. While many other books in the New Age section seem questionable to me, this one doesn't."},{"Title":"Life After Life","review":"If you want to know more about matters of life and death, there are far, far better books than this one. Copyright says it was first published in 1975. Maybe Mr. Moody has come a long way since then, but I don't know as this is the only book of his I've read, so far.I've been studying this subject for about 8 years, now. This book has serious problems regarding the impressions it can leave you with. The only part of this book that I find useful are the cases of NDEs Moody's recorded. I applaud his efforts, and they are admirable. He's done a lot good in this area.However, with respect to this book, his philosophical and religious speculations leave a great deal to be desired. On these subjects he didn't have the shoes for the territory. He's even inconsistent in his speculations with some of the accounts of NDEs he's relating in this book.IF you want to read on a more seriuos level about what's beyond this life, then I suggest Michael Newton's two books on \\"life between lives.\\" Look up his name here and get both books. There are others that have written on this subject too, but Newton is the only one that I know of who spent decades with hypnosis patients and compiling his data. It makes a difference. To have someone relate to you what they know from a near-death-experience is very limited. Deep hypnotic states reveal far more.I also highly recommend Brian Weiss' book, Many Lives, Many Masters; also read William Buhlman (2 books) and Robert Monroe (3 books). Weiss has written other books, but read the one above first, if you're new to this topic.If your're a serious minded seeker of after-life knowledge, you'll get nothing more than a few cases of NDEs in Moody's book, and some seriously flawed meanderings on philosophical matters. To some people that may make no difference; to others it will. This book is also written in an extremely casual style, rather on the level of news paper articles."},{"Title":"Life After Life","review":"I had a NDE in 1981. At the time I thought I was just hallucinating. I never mentioned it to anybody for fear of ridicule. After reading Dr. Moody's book, I was astounded at the exact experience that these other people had that was just like mine. I learned that the purpose of life is to experience and pass on to others, God's great love for each one of us. I think this is clear from the interviews in this book. It is also in a video that you can rent at the videostore. Don't worry...be happy! Smile, God does love each one of us just the way we are.Jeff Sears"},{"Title":"Life After Life","review":"I didn't need this book to know there was life after death. But through a trauma-stressed relationship experience which got worked out, I now have a furocious interest in the paranormal and miraculous phenomenon investigations. It intersts me. Never though I would relate to some of it either but this book is so well written. The style is different and catchy and the topic is wonderful. I've read several of Moody's books now. It's intriguing along with the science of it."},{"Title":"Life After Life","review":"I have owned this book for more than 10 years, and I have read it and reread it many times. I already had believed in life after death, but after reading Moody's book, I felt like I actually understood it (as much as you can understand it). I also feel a peace about death that I did not feel before. I HIGHLY recommend this book to all, especially those who are afraid of dying."},{"Title":"Life After Life","review":"One day in 1995 I died, and had a NDE. Ever since then, I've been reading everything I can on the subject. According to most stories I've read, I had an unusual one, not going down a tunnel, but experiencing many interesting phenomena all the same. It seems to me that there are some NDE books and magazine articles that are just hype, and published just to give recognition. I have found, through my many years and multitudes of books on the subject, that there is an underlining truth and spirit that pervades the true experiences. So, I have compiled a list of my best reads for NDE books - ones that I consider genuine and adding validating light to the personal NDE experience. I have left out compilations, these are personal narratives. I hope you enjoy them too.Embraced by the Light ------by Betty J.

People having a near-death-experience are not in position to be fabricating an outlandish story. Although such experiences tend to clash with conventional Judeo-Christian beliefs regarding the after-life, they simply cannot be dismissed. This book can and does force one to rethink matters of the spirit."},{"Title":"Life After Life","review":"This is the book that seems to have initiated the avalanche of popular interest in the near-death-experience (NDE) phenomenon back in 1975. Not only does it contain many (very similar) testimonies from various people who have had the experience, but it also contains discussions on ancient writings (by Plato, in the Tibetan Book of the Dead, etc.) that describe essentially the same things. The author has also included chapters in which he fields various questions that he has been asked about the NDE phenomenon, as well as on various attempts at explaining it. This edition, published in 2001, is the 25th anniversary edition of the book that was originally published in 1975. In addition to the original text, it contains a new preface by Dr. Melvin Morse, as well as a new afterword written by the author. Since this book's original publication, much has been written about NDEs in medical journals and popular literature alike; research and debate on this issue continue to this very day. The writing style is very clear, concise, friendly, authoritative, widely accessible and quite captivating. This is a book that can be read with utter fascination by anyone."},{"Title":"Life After Life","review":"I bought this book for a relative who was grieving a loss. She mentioned that she'd always wanted to know more about life after death. It brought her great comfort. I bought a copy for myself because that made me curious. This book is clear, easy to digest and minimally leaves one with an understanding that death is not an ending but a transition. It is both interesting and reassuring."},{"Title":"Life After Life","review":"Raymond A. Moody's Life After Life: The Investigation of a Phenomenon--Survival of Bodily Death (New York: Bantam Books, c. 1975) was my first exposure to a scholarly investigation of near-death experiences, and it remains one of the more trustworthy guides to these phenomena. Moody earned a Ph.D. in philosophy from the University of Virginia in 1969 before going to medical school and becoming a psychiatrist. The book takes a tentative but respectful attitude towards the subject that makes it compelling, in part because Moody is less a true believer than a receptive hearer, less an advocate for immortality than a reporter telling us what trustworthy witnesses attest regarding it.We human beings have forever pondered death's mystery. \\"There is a graveyard in Turkey which was used by Neanderthal men approximately 100,000 years ago. There, fossilized imprints have enabled archeologists to discover that these ancient men buried their dead in biers of flowers, indicating that they perhaps saw death as an occasion of celebration--as a transition of the dead from this world to the next. Indeed, graves from very early sites all over the earth give evidence of the belief in human survival of bodily death\\" (p. 13). In accord with this ancient inclination, when Moody (quite inadvertently) began to hear reports from people who claimed to have \\"died\\" and lived to tell of it, he was motivated to study some 150 such accounts.The people he studied (mostly through personal interviews) came from remarkably different \\"religious, social and educational backgrounds\\" (p. 15). Nevertheless, they had remarkably similar \\"experiences\\" (p. 21). Crafting a composite of such experiences, summing up his findings, Moody urges us to envision the following:A man is dying and, as he reaches the point of greatest physical distress, he hears himself pronounced dead by his doctor. He begins to hear an uncomfortable noise, a loud ringing or buzzing, and at the same time feels himself moving very rapidly through a long dark tunnel. After this, he suddenly finds himself outside of his own physical body, but still in the immediate physical environment, and he sees his own body from a distance, as though he is a spectator. He watches the resuscitation attempt from this unusual vantage point and is in a state of emotional upheaval.After a while, he collects himself and becomes more accustomed to his odd condition. He notices that he still has a \\"body\\" but one of a very different nature and with very different powers from the physical body he has left behind. Soon other things begin to happen. Others come to meet and to help him. He glimpses the spirits of relatives and friends who have already died, and a loving warm spirit of a kind he has never encountered before--a being of light--appears before him. This being asks him a question, nonverbally, to make him evaluate his life and helps him along by showing him a panoramic, instantaneous playback of the major events of his life. At some point he finds himself approaching some sort of barrier or border, apparently representing the limit between earthly life and the next life. Yet, he finds that he must go back to the earth, that the time for his death has not yet come. At this point he resists, for by now he is taken up with his experiences in the afterlife and does not want to return. He is overwhelmed by intense feelings of joy, love, and peace. Despite his attitude, though, he somehow reunites with his physical body and lives.Later he tries to tell others, but he has trouble doing so. In the first place, he can find no human words adequate to describe these unearthly episodes. He also finds that other scoff, so he stops telling other people. Still the experience affects his life profoundly, especially his views about death and its relationship to life (pp. 21-23).Though there is a commonality to the reports, some of the book's statements are most memorable. In the section on \\"ineffability,\\" for example, one woman said: \\"'Well, when I was taking geometry, they always told me there were only three dimensions, and I always just accepted that. But they were wrong. There are more. And, of course, our world--the one we're living in now--is three-dimensional, but the next one definitely isn't. And that's why it's so hard to tell you this. I have to describe it to you in words that are three-dimensional. That's as close as I can get to it, but it's not really adequate'\\" (p. 26). Recounting his out-of-body experience, a \\"young informant\\" said: \\"I was sort of floating about five feet above the street, about five yards away from the car, I'd say, and I heard the echo of the crash dying away. I saw people come running up and crowding around the car, and I saw my friend get out of the car, obviously in shock. I could see my own body in the wreckage among all those people, and could see them trying to get it out. My legs were all twisted and there was blood all over the place\\" (p. 37). Most of the witnesses say they entered into another body, different from but decidedly resembling their earthly body. It's a \\"spiritual body,\\" weightless and time-transcending, but still a body! \\"A person in the spiritual body is in a privileged position I relation to the other persons around him. He can see and hear them, but they can't see or hear him\\" (p. 46).Virtually all the people encountered a bright, warm, loving being of light. Some think it was an angel. Others think it was Jesus. Subsequently, they all considered loving others and gaining knowledge the great purpose of life on earth. Many who had little interest in such things come back to life with a deep determination to spend the rest of their days loving and learning, activities that will flourish in the hereafter. As a Christian, I find Moody's account fascinating--not as the basis for, but a corroboration of, my faith."},{"Title":"Life After Life","review":"I had heard and read so many positive reviews of this book that I had to read it for myself. After reading it in one sitting (I couldn't put it down), I wholeheartedly agree with those readers who gave it five stars.While I find the subject matter of near-death experiences extremely fascinating, I was drawn to this book primarily due to a good friend's recent and -unexpected- passing. I wanted to know, that being the wonderful and giving person that my friend was throughout life, he experienced the all-permeating joy and Light when he passed from this physical life. I am a Christian and thus, strongly believe in an afterlife in Heaven. So I didn't need this book to \\"prove\\" an afterlife to me. Nonetheless, reading it gave me much comfort.I also appreciated Dr. Moody's clinical & unbiased approach to his research. I also found his writing style to be engaging and clear.If you're at all remotely interested in learning more about NDE's, I highly recommend reading this book. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Life After Life","review":"I really enjoyed this book, the ground breaker for Near Death Experiences by Raymond Moody. It definitely is more in depth than most of the televisions shows I've seen on this subject over the years.The book naturally goes into the phenomenon and experiences themselves with its various similarities. The out of body, bright light, the review, the noise, the dark tunnel, meeting others, the being of light and its affect on them.What I really enjoyed was the parallels of the Bible, Plato, the Tibetan Book of the Dead and Emanuel Swedenborg, so he enters into some of the spiritual and philosophical models that have profound teachings. All four, the Bible more the exception, relay life after death. Plato believed as the Tibetan Book of the Dead, in that the death of the body would release the consciousness or higher mind into a clearer more lucid understanding without the bodies or ego's conceptual grid and conceptions.A short comparison is given with NDE's with the various explanations; the supernatural, the scientific (physiological and neurological, the psychological of isolation, dreams hallucinations and delusions) explanations, neurological. It was found that no drug used has achieved the same common affects and attributes of the NDE, but that only near death or at death do this occur.A great sequel with much more information that continues here is Melvin Morse's Book, \\"Closer to the Light,\\" written around 10 years later where Morse attempts to achieve by experiments what Moody has set forth."},{"Title":"Life After Life","review":"The book Life After Life is a book about peoples experiences with death and how they felt emotionally and physically during these experiences. It is a good book to read if you have any doubts or fears about death and lets you know that death is not the worst part about dieing. It is you waiting to die that is much worst than the actual experience. This book was wonderful keeping me intrested the whole way through, but got slow at a few parts, and lost me a little. But once you get past that i really liked this book, and i think you would to. So in conclusion i really suggest you read this book if your looking for something to read and be entertained."},{"Title":"Life After Life","review":"I was present when my father died after a lengthly illness and this book was terrific to get me through some tough times.l would recommend this book to read either just before a death or just following a death.lt makes you realize what is going on."},{"Title":"Life After Life","review":"Interesting but could be more involved in each experience.

It is written by a world renowned and respected scholar and medical doctor. And, in spite of the fact that I am a Christian, with conservative beliefs, and even though I maintain my faith carefully focused on God, I do nevertheless give the accounts in this book some credence (along with its companion, written subsequently, \\"Life Beyond Death\\"). I invite you to read it and see why."},{"Title":"Life After Life","review":"As someone who had an NDE I wish Moody would have interviewed me. I was racing on my motorcycle and flew over the handlebars and landed on my head to which I was unaware of my surroundings and a fellow rider picked me up and got me to stagger home.

My father died when I was 5 and I never really understood the relationship between life and death, people who tell the stories in this book have been through it, it's real and its amazing."},{"Title":"Life After Life","review":"While the subject of life after death and what people experience after they die is extremely interesting to me, I found the majority of this book rather boring. The people's accounts of what happens were quite interesting (which Moody did not write), but I found Moody's introduction and analysis to be somewhat lacking and surface oriented. He seemed to be saying the things that any reader could gather from reading the testimonials on their own. The best analysis he gave was when he drew parallels from other religions, but even this section could have benefited from more research and more sources.I also found his analysis of the testimonials to be too biased, he clearly wants to get across the idea that there IS life after life without saying it, but I think this bias makes me less likely to believe what he is writing about. When he poses questions regarding the reliability of these accounts or alternative explanations, he seems to go around the question so his explanation can support his view. While I do believe that there is life after death and your soul travels without your physical body, I would have liked to see Moody go a bit more in depth with his research and analysis."},{"Title":"Life After Life","review":"This book is considered by many to be the authority on the topic of Near Death Experiences. It is very scientific in nature, but I found it to be monotonous because of its droning defense of the author's work. It doesn't so much focus on the NDE itself as much as the author's scientific approach to the topic. It has case studies that are highly susceptible to outside influences and hazy memories (as most stories are being told many years after the event happened), but at the time it was the only book on the market. It is still hard to find much literature on this subject, so it is a valuable read, but it would be quite easy for an author in today's world to write a current and more accurate work if someone had the opportunity."},{"Title":"Life After Life","review":"This is the book that touched off the near-death experience craze in the mid-1970s. In my town at that time, preachers were making the NDE the subject of their sermons and asking congregants to identify themselves in the sanctuary if they'd had a near-death experience. I was a green newspaper reporter just out of J-School and working for a small-town daily. I hatched the idea of doing a localized story on the phenomenon and called up Life After Life author Raymond Moody, an M.D., for an interview. To my surprise, he returned my call a few hours later from his office in Virgina. I recall that he struck me over the phone as a very nice and intelligent person, and was an excellent interview subject, full of interesting details. Of course, I read Moody's book and was thunderstruck by the circumstantial evidence it presented for life after death. The most impressive -- and evidential -- aspect of NDEs were accounts of patients resuscitated after a lack of vital signs -- as recorded by machinery -- and yet able to describe blow-by-blow what happened while they were clinically dead. Let me emphasize: Resuscitated patients were accurately describing things happening while the MACHINES in the room reported them clinically dead, flatlining. Despite the passing of more than three decades, this book and its sequel -- Reflections on Life After Life -- are still quite absorbing reads."},{"Title":"Life After Life","review":"Brief stories of those who were chosen to see Heaven before their earthly life was completed.

I suspected the body only housed our souls, now I am convinced. It didn't make sense that everything would end with the death of the physical body. I am now convinced that death is the end of a short life on earth and the beginning of our eternal life, wherever we may go after we die. I am not religious. I resent organized religion as their main concern is with with the size of their membership, power and even money. I also resent organized religion due to all the violence committed in the name of religion in some places in the world. When I watch what people do to enforce Theocracy or their religion upon others, I believe the world would be better off without it. But it's organized religion, not God. You don't have to be religious to be spiritual. Even if you don't believe in God, you can still be a decent, loving, unselfish, giving and kind human being who will someday be worthy of living a better life.

What was even more exciting was that as I told many people about the book, two said \\"It's true!\\". They then told me about their own near death experiences. Reading it in the book was wonderful; meeting one employee of mine and one good friend who actually experienced it, changed my life. I've bought or found many copies and handed them out to those who needed them most. During the decades, I learned much about eastern religious philosophy (The Tau of Physics by Capra)and how these phenomena in Life after Life could relate to discoveries observed in the labs of celebrated quantum physicists (The Holographic Universe by Michael Talbott). I also met Ray Moody, spent some time with him, and found him to be very credible.

Jessica Zemsky focusses mainly on gouache paintings, but also has a sufficient sample of watercolor, pencil, oil, and pastel work. I especially love the poses she uses for the children's portraits. They are full of life and much different from the traditional &quot;posed&quot; look. The book is full of great ideas, from the expressive color of her gouache and oil painting to the sensitivity and softness of her pencil and pastel work. She includes color recipes for mixing various colors, using combinations you would not normally think of. This is a wonderfully inspirational book for those wishing to paint children."},{"Title":"Capturing the Magic of Children in Your Paintings","review":"I just love this artist's work in her book on painting children mostly with gouache paints.

This guide does not appear useful to me. Information on length of hike and difficulty are buried in the text which often begins with a personal story. In order to follow the indicated hike, it looks like you need an ordinance survey map (different map for each hike). Instructions on finding the starting point for the hike often seem vague and are buried in the text.The guide might be useful if you are more familiar with Scotland and were interested in the personal stories."},{"Title":"The Belting Inheritance","review":"A thriller published in 1964 and authored by longtime British crimewriter Julian Symons, \\"The Belting Inheritance\\" uses as its core a gripping idea, the return from war of someone long thought dead. This plot archetype is perhaps best known from \\"The Return of Martin Guerre\\" and hinted at but not exploited in the BBC miniseries \\"Downton Abbey\\". Symons effort predates both of these and plants the idea in the aftermath of World War II.\\"The Belting Inheritance\\" is a very traditional British thriller in many ways: a rich upper class family living in an antiquated country villa, a self-conscious narrator who is part of this family yet not really part of it, and an often wry tone. Symons assembles the story well, with the first half of \\"Belting\\" showing a knack for plotting and for foreshadowing and setting up plot developments. The basic idea of the storyline is absolutely compelling. I should mention that I have read this book twice, once many years ago and just recently as I had vivid memories of the first reading. Any book that can evoke such a response can't be a bad one.That said, I saw significant weaknesses in plotting later in \\"Belting\\" that prevent me from giving it five stars. The most prominent problem occurs in the narrator's visit to Paris, where most of the cast of characters from Belting reassembles, for reasons that are not convincingly explained. The narrator's visit to Brighton is also marred by unbelievable coincidences.In short, a basic idea that grabs you, a convincing exposition and lazy plotting round off for 4 stars."},{"Title":"Blood Trails II: The Truth About Bowhunting (Outdoorsman's Edge (Woods N' Water Press))","review":"Unlike Philbert Suggs review, which is obviously, a sarcastic, soap-box stance, of a denial ridden, brain damaged animal rights/anti-hunting advocate who has not read the book in the first place. He is obviously shrouded by self-substantiated lies including his false profile in which he says he is a hunter and uses Elvis as his picture (a drug-ridden, stammering bafoon such as himself, evidently). Such people could benefit from reading such books in which denials of natural processes of life and death are not tolerated and truth is spoken. People are hunters by nature, Ted has always promoted that as he does in this book. Ted has never tolerated false idealistic views such as those perceived by Mr. Suggs who thinks his food has never had an effect on an animal or the environment or has denied that his actions through his course of life has never lead to the death of an animal or destruction of their environment. People who share views as those of Mr. Suggs pave a dangerous path to destruction of humanity through denial and lies. Rock-on Ted, and keep on spreading the truth of humanity and our impact of the environment, helping to preserve habitat and the abundace of wildlife for generations to come, and teaching kids to not just \\"Say No\\" to drugs, but, to kick the dealer in the balls, drag them in to the street, smash them into the curb and leave them to rot in the gutter.

Poirots first taste of a traditional English Christmas ends in him solving the disappearance of a Princes ruby. After recieving a sinister note warning him not to eat the Christmas Pudding, a mysterious visitor in the night and his host nearly choking on the Christmas Pudding he sets a trap for his suspect and a joke on the children of the household. Not only in this story does Poirot retrieve a stolen ruby but he also helps his hosts to rid themselves of a problem of their own. This is a brilliant book and well worth the read."},{"Title":"The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding","review":"Agatha Christie serves up mayhem in six well-plotted stories. Originally released in 1960 at a time when an annual \\"Christie for Christmas\\" had become an anticipated tradition for the reading public, the famous author broke with tradition and gave readers a novella length new Poirot tale which was used for the title and combined it with four older Poirot stories and one older Miss Marple story.\\"The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding,\\" according to the author's own foreword, recalls the pleasurable Christmases of her own at her brother-in-law's home (Abney Hall) in the north of England. Christie was enchanted by huge country house Christmases that included stockings at the bed in the morning, the Church service with all the Christmas hymns, a dinner of gargantuan proportions, presents, and the final Lighting of the Tree. Even in her older years, this was still a wonderful memory to her so she dedicated this book to the hostess who gave her such fond memories. In this tale Poirot experiences these same treats as he pursues a red ruby stolen by a young woman who has stolen it and the affections of a prince betrothed to a woman in his own country. In a secondary plot, the master sleuth also manages to intervene in the romance of his host's granddaughter and avert a practical joke in the form of a mock murder.\\"The Mystery of the Spanish Chest,\\" is a longer version of \\"The Mystery of the Baghdad Chest,\\" originally published in 1939. In this Poirot and his erstwhile companion Hastings become involved in the murder of a man whose stabbed body is found stuffed inside the elaborate chest of a man rumored to be the lover of the dead man's wife.\\"The Under Dog,\\" originally published in 1951, concerns Lily Margrave, paid companion to Lady Astwell. She seeks Poirot's help in solving the murder of her employer's husband who has been killed in the tower of his estate. Though all circumstances point to a nephew who has argued with the deceased, the widow is sure someone else killed her husband.\\"Four and Twenty Blackbirds,\\" originally published in 1950, is the tale of a murder concerning eating habits. While dining one evening, Poirot notices a lone man whom he discovers has been eating at this restaurant every Tuesday and Thursday night for a decade. When he learns the diner came in on Monday night the week before, his little gray cells are activated and he is soon on the trail of a murder.\\"The Dream,\\" originally published in 1939, features a reclusive and eccentric millionaire who summons Poirot to his home to interpret his recurring nightmare of committing suicide. An usual request for the dapper detective, but one which he handles with aplomb.\\"Greenshaw's Folly\\" had appeared previously in a magazine in 1957 but this is its first publication in book form. It is also the lone Miss Marple story in this collection. Raymond West, Miss Marple's novelist nephew, is travelling with a literary critic whose hobby is collecting architectural monstrosities on film. The two visit Greenshaw's Folly, a hideous Victorian mansion now occupied by Miss Greenshaw, a spinster who is the last of the Greenshaw family. West arranges for his wife's niece to help Miss Greenshaw edit her grandfather's diaries and while doing so, the niece witnesses the brutal murder-by-arrow of Miss Greenshaw. The gardener, an avid archery buff, is accused, but it will take Miss Marple's acute perceptions of people to solve this murder."},{"Title":"The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding","review":"\\"The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding\\" may not be the most auspicious title for an Agatha Christie novel, particularly when one takes into account her tendency for high body counts and gory deaths, but the subtitle \\"and a selection of entrees\\" reveals Christie's intentions for this particular short-story anthology. \\"Christmas Pudding\\" is just a bit of fun, dedicated to the memory of her Christmases spent as a child at her brother-in-law's house.The six stories here are long enough to be described as novellas, with the first five starring Christie's most famous Belgian detective Hercule Poirot, and the sixth featuring her spinster sleuth Miss Jane Marple. All the stories are vintage Christie, though they contain more of a romantic air this time around, with stories that feature stolen rubies, Spanish chests, precognitive dreams, hypnotism, tower rooms, and old run-down estates.In \\"The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding\\" Hercule Poirot is called away from his cozy winter apartment in order to spend Christmas with the Lacey family. The police have reason to believe that the priceless ruby, stolen from a foolish Indian prince, will turn up in this particular household. Begrudgingly, Poirot accepts the invitation and is introduced to the Lacey family - which includes a group of children who plan a \\"murder\\" for their guest. It doesn't take a stroke of genius to guess where the missing ruby ends up. All that Poirot has to deduce is how it got there, and how the children can help in the capture of the culprit.\\"The Mystery of the Spanish Chest\\" deals with the gruesome discovery of a body inside the titular chest. Mr Clayton was stabled to death at some point during a soiree taking place at Major Rich's apartment, at the same time he was meant to have been called away to Scotland on business. All the evidence points to Major Rich, especially since he's in love with Mr Clayton's beautiful wife Margharita - but Poirot is not so convinced he's the murderer. Perhaps Shakespeare's \\"Othello\\" holds the key...A lady's companion's reluctance in summoning Poirot to a murder scene only piques his interest in the case, and he travels to the house of the Astwells to investigate the death of the bad-tempered Sir Rueben Astwell. Once again, there is a suspect to whom all the evidence points, but the victim's wife insists that it was her husband's secretary that is responsible - her intuition is never wrong! But the case itself seems clueless, and Poirot has to resort to several psychological games in order to unearth the murderer.\\"Four and Twenty Blackbirds\\" and \\"The Dream\\" are the two shortest stories in the anthology, and the most simplistic. In the first Poirot is intrigued over the tale of a long-time patron at a certain restaurant suddenly changing his dinner order for no discernable reason, something casts suspicion over his death a few days later; in the latter Poirot is summoned to a wealthy businessman's office in order to discuss the precognitive power of dreams. Benedict Farley has been having a reoccurring dream each night in which he shoots himself in the head at exactly twenty-eight minutes past three. Poirot is at a loss to explain the phenomena to his client, but sure enough, Mr Farley commits suicide just a few days later. Did the dream come true, or was something even more sinister at work?Finally, \\"Greenshaw's Folly\\" moves from Mr Poirot to Miss Marple. Whilst staying with her nephew Raymond West, Miss Marple gets a secondhand account from his wife of the strange occurrences at Greenshaw's Folly, the ramshackle old estate that bankrupted its original owner. With something of a turf war going on between the housekeeper and the gardening boy, Mrs West tries to keep her head down as she organizes old Mrs Greenshaw's memoirs. To her horror she is witness to the old woman's murder, watching helplessly from within a locked room as Mrs Greenshaw is shot dead with an arrow. All possible suspects have an alibi - so whodunit?These are not Christie's finest by any means. The culprit of \\"Christmas Pudding\\" is so obvious that it becomes a case of how rather than who, and Miss Marple's solution to \\"Greenshaw\\" seems to have been pulled out of a hat. But you can tell that Christie had a lot of fun with these particular mysteries, especially the first, where the warmth and fun of a typical English Christmas has been drawn straight out of her own memories. There are numerous cameos from various side-characters, including Miss Lemon the efficient secretary, George the devoted manservant, Raymond West the successful novelist and Doctor Stillingfleet (who pops up again inThird Girl), and because of the relative simplicity of the plots, many readers may find that Christie is unable to pull a fast one on them - so long as they pay careful attention to the clues."},{"Title":"The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding","review":"I can't say enough about how Agatha Christie is the queen of mystery writing. No matter if you are into the hard-core P.I.'s, the bumbling amateur detectives, the Police dramas or cold hard forensic stories, you still can't touch Agatha Christie for classic mysteries! This is such a joy to read---especially if you love Hercule Poirot! I loved this book."},{"Title":"The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding","review":"After reading several of Agatha Christie's detective novels, I was somewhat disappointed by this collection of short stories. While a few of them are clever, the short length of each story is insufficient for the character development that is Christie's hallmark. The plot tends to be too simple and predictable."},{"Title":"The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding","review":"This is one of those books that evoke warm, cozy images of a proper English Christmas. I have owned the hardcover of this book for over a decade and it's a private little Christmas tradition for me. I read it every year, sometimes several times, and this warm story in the typical Hercule style gets me into the holiday spirit."},{"Title":"The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding","review":"A wonderful story, though short. But the CD was damaged upon arrival and won't play on any of my CD players except my DVD player. Go figure. I've got to return it."},{"Title":"The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding","review":"As usual very high standard of short stories, though not the best in my view (I would rank labour or Hercules as better). The most memorable of these stories is the one about the pudding, which is very fun, though with an overconvoluted plot which would not really occur in real life (.. but again this is fiction right, and the character of Poirot is hardly realistic, which is also what makes him likeable). Note that the last story isn't with Poirot but with Ms Marple: to be honest not my cup of tea, as I much prefer Poirot, but in comparison with almost any crime writers out there, still head and shoulders above today's standards."},{"Title":"The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding","review":"I so enjoy listening to this over and over.

The reason for only three stars is the mere fact that I was expecting a complete book, not short stories. I suppose it is my fault for not evaluating my purchase in-depthly enough. However, I did enjoy reading the stories. And they suit a person well who is not wanting to get involved with a book but still wants to read a good mystery."},{"Title":"The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding","review":"Disappointed that these were short stories, and not Agatha's best. I love her work, but these were a bit too pat."},{"Title":"The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding","review":"This is a good starter book if you have never read an Agatha Christie mystery before. Poirot is one of her re-occuring characters who is as smart as he is odd. In this case, he has to uncover the mystery of how a ruby got into the pudding of the family he is staying with in England. Many other odd things start unfolding and he has to use his guile to solve it. This character is better than her Miss Marple in my opinion, so people new to this genre should really try it out."},{"Title":"The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding","review":"Great facsimile of original UK version book.Agatha Christie does not dissapoint her readers.

Contact me if you have question regarding the case - I'll be happy to answer them."},{"Title":"Nove Noites","review":"Apparently part autobiography, part biography, and part fiction, &quot;Nove Noites&quot; speculates on the psychological makeup of a precocious Columbia University anthropologist. Buell Quain, a North Dakotan, committed suicide in northern Brazil in the company of the aboriginal Krah tribe he was studying. &quot;Buell Quain killed himself on the night of August 2, 1939,&quot; writes Carvalho--&quot;the same day that Albert Einstein sent President Roosevelt the historic letter in which he alerted him to the possibility of the atomic bomb.&quot; (P. 15.) Quain died at age 27, and although the gruesome manner of his suicide is documented, the reasons for it remain mysterious.Carvalho becomes obsessed with discovering more about the reasons for Quain's premature demise, and &quot;Nove Noites&quot; is a narrative of his investigation coupled (in the sections printed in italics) with fictional speculation about why he might have ended his life when his future as a distinguished anthropologist seemed so assured. Suspense builds as Carvalho travels to Krah territory in remote northern Brazil and to New York City in an effort to tease out information that might lead to an explanation of Quain's death and, by extension, his philosophy of life.Unfortunately, as far as I know &quot;Nove Noites&quot; hasn't been translated into English, and I'm not sure that any of Carvalho's work has. Someone should undertake this task. At a minimum, this is the most captivating biographical work I've ever read about anyone who hailed from North Dakota--imagine that it should come from Brazil! Carvalho's descriptions of Quain's family members and their role as prominent early citizens of Bismarck, N.D., although brief, ought to be interesting to those who want to learn more about North Dakota history.Carvalho occasionally philosophizes on contemporary issues, and one phrase is particularly memorable. Speaking of September 11, 2001, and its aftermath, he says, &quot;Hoje as guerras parecem mais pontuais, quando no fundo so permanentes.&quot; (I.e., &quot;Wars today seem to occur at a more precise point in time, but deep down they are permanent.&quot;) (P. 13.)"},{"Title":"Warcraft: The Roleplaying, Game Manual of Monsters","review":"I used this book in addition to the standard core rule book for DnD, I would like to say that this Manual of Monsters really puts a spin on &quot;well-known&quot; creatures of RPG gaming.Take the Troll and the Quimera for example, they would seemed twitched but actually they are a different breed, a WarCraft breed (they are very nice fitted and adapted from the RTS).There are several other creatures that can be used for a normal campaign, such as the Nerubian ( a spider like race ) the Tuskar ( a walrus like race ), Thundering Lizards, Wendigos, Murlocs even Nagas ( here is another interesting change from the typical DnD creature) that come all from the RTS video Game.It comes with a change for dragons, because it actually includes 5 dragon flights or species: black, blue, bronze, green and red, each with historical facts that fit quite well in any campaign or ingoing game.Finally it includes several heroes taken from the video game, Sylvanna, Arthas (as the Lich King), Mannaroth, Kel'Tuzad, and others, I must say that these are epic NPC that only fit on high level campaingns ( Arthas merged with the Lich King has a CR of 50!!)The only drewback is that it lacks some monsters from the game, while it appears they included several critters from the WarCraft III Expansion (such as the Dragon Spawn, the Mountain Giant or the Obsidian Destroyer) it lacks others that I think would spice it more: the Coatl, the Spit dragon, the Faceless Ones, the Temptress, the Makruras. Overall is and incredible book and I really recommend it for both fans of the WC Universe and for the Role playing fans."},{"Title":"Warcraft: The Roleplaying, Game Manual of Monsters","review":"The long awaited monster manual for Warcraft. Lets admit it no one wants to run a setting game without its proper monsters, so we all complain and whine when they take 3 months after the setting to release it.This one is worth the wait if any monster manual is.The monsters are inovative adaptations of the games monsters, though not always accurate and sometimes the spirit of the monster from the video game loses some.The details for each monster are abit lacking but they give all the necessary information, just some lack of the added fun details we all sometimes enjoy.The art is of the same quality as the previous Warcraft books and games, enjoyable for its unique qualities.Two things shine out even beyond the rest.The dragonflights are marvelous, five different species of dragons at similar power levels, but that are actually different. Sword and Sorcery/ White Wolf, could teach Wizards that you don't always need to make something stronger to make it different.The Second asset is the CR range. For once a monster manual actually has lower CR monsters and a good range over the scope. As much as lots of powerful monsters are cool, low level people need something to fight too. Wizards forgot this, and WW remembered happily.The addition of some major villains stats at the end is a nice touch too, though some hero stats would be a good thought but oh well.Anyways, some minor faults but a quality manual over all.A good addition to your dnd library."},{"Title":"Warcraft: The Roleplaying, Game Manual of Monsters","review":"I bought this to go along with my copy of the World of Warcraft RPG, and I don't regret it (especially since, as of this writing, the \\"Monster Guide\\" is still months from seeing print).While there are quite a few omissions that players of the MMORPG will miss (such as Worgen), it covers most of the really distinctive denizens of Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdoms - and even a few from Northrend. It provides a lot of background information for most of the monsters, and was well worth the read just to fill in some story details that I hadn't yet picked up from the Warcraft games.Even for players of regular D&D;, this book offers some interesting twists on more \\"traditional\\" monsters that you might find in the \\"Monster Manual\\". And, the monsters here are still usable with the \\"World of Warcraft RPG\\" book. (Just keep in mind that \\"Dexterity\\" is now \\"Agility\\", \\"Constitution\\" is now \\"Stamina\\", and \\"Wisdom\\" is now \\"Spirit\\". It's mostly just a change in terminology to match that of the online game.)My main qualms would be with certain omissions. For instance, there is some fascinating information on various types of Nerubians ... but specific statistics for each type are missing from the book. There's an interesting entry for the \\"Obsidian Destroyer\\" - though the description conflicts with the illustration, and there's no background information. (It's of little use to have statistics for an \\"Obsidian Destroyer\\" if I don't know what it is or what place it has in my campaign.)Also, please note that this isn't completely exhaustive, nor is it a complete replacement for the D&D; Monster Manual; it only includes monsters unique to the Warcraft setting - or which are significantly different from their D&D; counterparts. If you need statistics for an elemental or a worg or a warhorse, you'll have to look in the D&D; Monster Manual - not here.I still hope that a future \\"Monster Guide\\" will fill in the blanks for a few of the \\"missing\\" monsters (introduced in the online game since the time this book was published), but until then, this is a must-have for anyone planning on running a World of Warcraft themed d20 RPG campaign."},{"Title":"Warcraft: The Roleplaying, Game Manual of Monsters","review":"I bought both the RPG book and this book for just the theme info.I enjoyed this one more.

For many of us, McNair Wilson has painted (with great accuracy) our spiritual heritage (the good, the bad, the ugly, the ridiculous) with his vivid recollections of &quot;life in captivity.&quot; It is, indeed, an irony that, while we were supposed to be learning the tenets of spiritual &quot;freedom,&quot; many of us were acquiring emotional straighjackets in which to live out our spiritual &quot;liberty.&quot; McNair Wilson shines his hilarious spotlight on this dark corner of our faith. It was of infinite value to me that he did not throw out the babies of grace and honor with the skewering bathwater.

McNair's family dealt with the frustrations that come with an active-church life with humor, a method we could all use a little more! My only complaint was that McNair painted himself and his family as the heros at first, and everybody else was always in the wrong. Eventually though, he admitted to his family's mistakes, which made them seem very real and personal. I think this book would be great for anyone who is carrying around bad memories from a childhood spent in church, especially those who have left. It is also a very encouraging book for artists of all kinds. I found it a little pricey, but still worth the extra dollars."},{"Title":"Religion: Bane or Blessing","review":"&quot;Religion&quot; is an amazing work. It is an incredibly thorough and mind opening epic that reads as entertainingly as the best of novels, while providing about ten times as much information. In a time when we are questioning the subject of world religions, this book is a much needed discourse written by a truly brilliant man who takes the reader from the basics up through very recent events.While some may feel that the in depth study of religion would be dry and snooze-inducing, this work is anything but. It is exciting, highly educational and fills the mind with very useful information.Its interesting style of going back and forth between the ups and downs, positives and negatives, of many of the world's religions, is enjoyable and refreshing.Its breadth of facts and insightful data will completely satisfy and often startle you.I highly recommend this immensely important work!"},{"Title":"Religion: Bane or Blessing","review":"In the very beginning of his eye-opener book, Dr. Charles Meister tells us that there are two kinds of religion...the divisive and the unitive. Religion: Bane or Blessing leads the reader to an understanding of why there are religious wars and, indeed, why people of a religion are attacking and even killing people of the same religion.We read, \\"Most religions profess to be revelations of divine truth. Many times the revelation is alleged to be an exclusive one from God. This assists the faith in acquiring adherents but generally builds barriers against non-adherents\\". This is divisive. The purest form of religion unites humans to God, and humans to humans. In short, Love!\\"The dichotomy is clear. One says, because I believe in God, I hate you. The other view is, because I believe in God, I love you\\". If we believe that God espouses love (and I believe that is the central tenet of all unitive religious thought) then any divisiveness must come from misinterpretation or arrogance.Religion: Bane or Blessing takes the reader on an exploration of the history of early religions, religious doctrines and religious rituals. Dr. Meister methodically and factually tells us why we are what we are. His chapter, Bill of Spiritual Rights, suggests a doctrine based on human dignity--\\"The belief that every human being has a unique and sacred importance. Human dignity is based ultimately on the fact that all persons are God's children. Recognition of our basic importance to God should keep down human brutality, terrorism and war\\".Charles Meister is a scholar, author, World War II battlefield hero and teacher. The wisdom he brings to Religion: Bane or Blessing can improve the lives of all people by bringing peace on earth. In this reviewer's opinion, this is a book to read, and then read again; and discuss and then discuss again!"},{"Title":"Meatmen: An Anthology of Gay Male Comics (Volume 1)","review":"The debut volume of MEATMEN from 1986 is an amazing collection containing a wide variety of styles from no less than 29 different cartoonists!

There is a lot of bad or indifferent drawing as well as bad or indifferent storylines.One could say that an anthology anthologizes the extant and that if gay comics of the past (most from the '70sand '80s) are average then the anthology must perforce be average.

(I read more than a hundred books a year, many of them related to management and leadership.) By the third chapter, however, I concluded that Kaplan and Kaiser are not just dressing up old concepts for a new day. They offer a paradigm shift and research to back it up. Think optimize, not maximize. Think right-sizing. This places the onus on leadership aspirants to develop the elusive skill of versatility, which is partly based in the individual's personality psychology. The authors have researched and validated an approach to measuring this skill and providing individuals with the specific marching orders they need to capture this subtlety for themselves. The book includes their research.I was simulataneously reading a new book, \\"Personality and the Fate of Organizations\\" by Robert Hogan, Ph.D., author of the popular Hogan Personality Inventory. Hogan praises Kaplan and Kaiser's work, which is no small praise given Hogan's 30-year career studying the science of personality in the workplace.The book is also well written, avoiding the dryness of many management books with a broad array of illustrations from literature, history, and other research. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Versatile Leader: Make the Most of Your Strengths Without Overdoing It (J-B US non-Franchise Leadership)","review":"Part leadership guide, part applied research, this engaging book explores leadership through a new lens to reveal a powerful set of insights for leaders at all levels, as well as for coaches and mentors who would help them.As a research tool, this book starts with a novel concept of leadership versatility and explores the implications. Kaplan defines \\"versatility\\" defferently from other meanings of the word. One key implication for this definition is that overdoing a leader's strengths is as much a problem as lacking the strengths. Leaders need to learn how to make the most of their strengths--but without overdoing it.A second level is the book's new leadership model, comprising two complimentary skill sets--forceful and enabling leadership, and strategic and operational leadership. Forceful leaders take charge and make tough calls, for instance; enabling leaders, by comparison, empower others to share the limelight and so on. These dualities will describe what is required of leaders and where they go wrong.As a leadership guide, the book operates at a third level by offering actionable advice about addressing strengths, weaknesses and strengths overdone. Here the book brims with practical tips.Kaplan presents his cases with the candor and conviction of someone who's clearly been there--behind closed doors in coaching sessions--helping leaders to learn.Last but not least, I recommend the book's appendix (\\"Research and development of the Leadership Versatility Index\\") by Rob Kaiser.In sum, Kaplan and Kaiser are at the top of their game.

It's a great piece of work and the only really new and significant add to leadership thinking in a VERY long time. This is one you'll want to keep handy to refer to, and to refer to friends and colleagues. It explores a new view that leadership effectiveness and ineffectiveness is tied to Leadership \\"lopsidedness\\", the tendency of leaders to \\"over-do\\" some things and \\"under-do\\" others. K and K urge \\"volume control\\" and a kind of leadership flex along two crucial dimensions of leadership behavior: Being strategic v. operationally focused and being forceful v. being enabling. Instead of the \\"either/or\\" frame, Kaplan and Kaiser suggest it's a \\"both/and\\" solution with lots of tips on how to be a versatile leader.

Most leaders tend to prefer one style from each of these pairs, but the best leaders use the right amount of each style at the right time. The authors also introduce an innovative approach to using 360-degree survey data and explain why many leaders tend to overuse or underuse some of the leadership styles.

This is a really great book!"},{"Title":"The Versatile Leader: Make the Most of Your Strengths Without Overdoing It (J-B US non-Franchise Leadership)","review":"With Rob Kaiser, Bob Kaplan has written a book in which he explores a business topic that does not receive as much attention as it deserves: the need for a reliable tool by which to measure strengths overused. As one adage suggests, \\"If all you've got in your tool kit is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail.\\" However, that's only part of what proves to be an especially complicated problem. All organizations are involved in some form of leadership development each day, ranging from formal seminars and workshops to on-the-job training of direct reports. Countless strengths become weaknesses when taken to excess: specialization can become narrow-mindedness, confidence can become arrogance, reflection can become indecisiveness, etc. Kaplan notes that gifted leaders with whom he has been associated and of whom he had made (and shared the results of) an assessment were often the last ones to know about their gifts. \\"For years I had taken it for granted that, if they didn't already know they were strong in a given area, they simply welcomed the good news like a refreshing drink on a hot day.\\" Not so. Therefore, \\"much of the work of development is getting the strengths to sink in. Half of leadership is on the strengths side.\\"Note: In this instance, I agree with Tom Rath and Marcus Buckingham that time and effort devoted to human development should focus almost entirely on an individual's strengths.Kaplan's capstone concept in this book is versatility. That is, the ability to structure and balance aptitudes in complementary pairs. This is precisely what Howard Gardner recommends in Five Minds for the Future as does Roger Martin in The Opposable Mind. Kaplan includes in his concept the importance of proportionality. That is, use in the workplace of what is characterized as \\"excessive force\\" in law enforcement can be as much of a problem as, for example, tolerance of inappropriate behavior. Kaplan asserts (and I agree) that excesses as well as insufficiencies should be considered when assessing a leader's performance, and, that development of a leader's \\"versatility\\" should focus on improving balance and use of \\"pair-wise capabilities.\\" The excesses of some leaders (whom Jean Lipman-Blumen describes as \\"toxic\\") and the damage they cause are immeasurable. Such leaders are probably beyond redemption.The book is presented in ten chapters, organized within three Parts: In the first, Kaplan examines what he characterizes as a \\"disconnect between what is generally known about leadership and the way they are being assessed in most organization.\\" He offers suggestions to correct various oversights. In Part II, he shifts his attention to two of the oppositions/dichotomies/polarities/dualities/etc. that are (arguably) the most important to a leader's effectiveness: forceful and enabling leadership, and, strategic and operational leadership. Then in Part III, Kaplan suggests ways to correct overdoing it, underdoing it, and a combination of both, lopsidedness. In Chapters 7-9, he describes the \\"outer/behavioral\\" work of development and the \\"inner/personal\\" work of development. In the last chapter, Kaplan reiterates all of his key points when offering a profile of \\"the multi-versatile leader\\" and suggests how to \\"boost\\" an individual's \\"pair-wise capabilities,\\" notably the dualities of strategic-and-operational leadership and forceful-and-enabling leadership.Kaiser wrote the Appendix in which he reviews the research and development of the Leadership Versatility Index (LVI), \\"the 360-degree measure of versatility that is integral to this book.\\" I especially appreciate his skillful use of two reader-friendly devices, a series of 13 \\"Tables\\" and four \\"Figures\\" that conveniently organize a wealth of key points, notably Tables 2 and 3 (i.e. conceptualizations of the \\"how\\" and \\"what\\" of leadership) and Figure A.2 (i.e. \\"Structural Model of Forceful and Enabling leadership\\"). In the Appendix, Kaiser offers comments that I think should be noted: \\"Self-ratings of versatility [such as the LVI enables] are not related to coworker ratings of overall effectiveness. In other words, the extent to which managers view their own leadership as versatile has almost nothing to do with how their colleagues see their overall effectiveness. This emphasizes the importance of feedback: lopsided leaders don't see the link to ineffectiveness that is so apparent to those around them.\\"Of course, none of the material in this book can do more than provide \\"scaffolding\\" for a leadership development program that each reader must build in collaboration with her or his own associates. The blueprint and construction materials are for them to select but Bob Kaplan and Rob Kaiser can provide valuable assistance when completing that process.Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Gardner's aforementioned Five Minds for the Future, Martin's The Opposable Mind: How Successful Leaders Win Through Integrative Thinking, and Lipman-Blumen's The Allure of Toxic Leaders: Why We Follow Destructive Bosses and Corrupt Politicians--and How We Can Survive as well as Rath's StrengthsFinder 2.0: A New and Upgraded Edition of the Online Test from Gallup's Now, Discover Your Strengths.

With Kaplan's \\"The Versatile Leader,\\" I finally found it! The analysis set out in this book is applicable to any manager seeking to improve his/her effectiveness, regardless of the size, culture, age, or style of the organization. Far superior to other recent books on management, and many management development courses, this book does not advocate a \\"right way\\" to manage. Instead, it teaches individual managers how to assess their own unique traits, and then how to act on the results of that analysis to achieve a much higher level of functioning. Better yet, this book's emphasis on the positive (it's entire premise is putting managers in a position of greater strength) makes it a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"The Versatile Leader: Make the Most of Your Strengths Without Overdoing It (J-B US non-Franchise Leadership)","review":"Kaplan and Kaiser have written an impressive book - a great mix of outstanding conceptual and research based rigour and the pragmatic reality of understanding the behaviour of real leaders as part of their consulting practice. The opposing scales of enabling/forceful and strategic/operational are a neat way of describing a century of leadership research - but what's new is the idea of lopsidedness, of overdoing your strengths - and in particular the way of measuring this through a rating scale which is indeed innovative and different.

Lots of books raise self-awareness but stop there or offer advice which is lacking in practicality or concreteness. This book is both conceptual and tactical and easy to read.

I bought it on a gut hunch that it would be enlightening as to some specific lessons on how a leader might be more effective in his/her behaviors. I bought it in spite of another review that was less than encouraging about its value. (I just upped my rating from four to five stars, and it is without exaggeration.)I read the section on research first and enjoyed this. These authors have solid credentials as former Center for Creative Leadership researchers and organizational practitioners in the field. First, they identify the \\"virtues and vices\\" of a leader's focus--operational vs. strategic-- and their leadership style-- enabling vs. forceful. Second, they share the consequences of overdoing or underdoing selected behaviors. Third, they devote a chapter to helping \\"overdo\\" leaders implement strategies for throttling back on these behaviors, and they have a complementary chapter dedicated to helping \\"underdo\\" leaders rev up the behaviors that would render them more effective.To effect positive behavior change, the authors offer solid suggestions that focus on the outer/behavioral work to be done to improve and the inner/mental/emotional work to be done. For almost ever suggestion given, the authors cite an executive with whom they worked who faced a critical change challenge and succeeded by using the prescribed suggestion.I particularly enjoyed the authors' many sports analogies: baseball (Kofax); tennis (backhand/forehand), golf (using only one club in the bag and \\"Choose a Swing Thought\\", etc.The book seems to be written from an authentic purpose of helping others improve their leadership effectiveness, the soft side of work. The Versatile Leader gets your attention and holds it.The book may be of greater interest to the seasoned manager in terms of the immediate application of the strategies, the openness to the approach, etc. The novice manager might find the book intriguing at first, then six-to-ten-years later revisit it to discover all the gold that's inside and the new behaviors they can add to their leadership repertoire."},{"Title":"The Versatile Leader: Make the Most of Your Strengths Without Overdoing It (J-B US non-Franchise Leadership)","review":"\\"The Versatile Leader\\" is a solid read, filled with great fact-based conclusions on what makes leaders effective.

Should I enable others or should I be forceful with them?\\" Kaplan and Kaiser clearly show that effective leaders do both, and do them in a balanced way that reflects the needs of the organization. For those readers who are skeptical about what may be the next trend in leadership development, the authors provide enough research and data to reassure the most skeptical of \\"quant\\"-biased readers.

Executives and managers who first move into a leadership position are usually adrift in their first few months or even years and they often fail or under-perform while they start to work out what is really going on and why the things that worked so well as they were moving up the hierarchy don't work when they get to the Promised Land. \\"The Versatile Leader\\" puts it all together for them to show how their strengths and weaknesses have to be managed and controlled so that they can succeed.There is a whole literature on the issue of strengths and weaknesses out there right now. It's been made more difficult by the appearance of some entertaining but superficial approaches that are likely to confuse, at best, and, at worst to put many new leaders on just the wrong track. This book puts all of these approaches into the correct perspective so that the reader can rely on a balanced and proven approach that will have real utility at the leadership coal-face.Notably the book also introduces the authors' \\"Versatility Index\\" which allows them to measure their leadership versatility (or be measured) on a proprietary scale, so that the ideas in the book can be calibrated and acted upon. I think that the combination of the strong research base coupled with leadership insights from the field will make this an invaluable handbook for generations of new and more experienced leaders.

But you shouldn't trust the speaker, he's not to be trusted, since he doesn't even know himself. Jason Starr's dandy little noir, \\"Twisted City,\\" is probably the closest thing I've read to a Jim Thompson novel yet. A short time back, I ran across a similarly impressive Thompson-like effort in Andrew Vachss's \\"The Getaway Man.\\" The one distinction there however, was the voice of Eddie, criminal that he is, also something of a sweet victim. You don't see many of those in Thompson land. And it is in that sense that Starr is truer to the master. \\"Twisted City\\" is dark through and through, but leavened with comic (if black) humor and dialogue.Miller, the speaker, is on surface a journalist coming off the loss of his sister. Like so many modern day city types, Miller compartmentalizes his life. But boy, what he sticks away in those hidden compartments (and wallet)! And don't push this seemingly rational man too far. He is capable of messing you up. But pressures are mounting in David's life, all triggered by the loss (theft) of his wallet. Junkies, blackmailers, a partying girlfriend with a past of her own, you hate to see Miller pick up the phone or open the door to find out what new curve ball is coming his way. Suddenly, carefully erected walls start to dissolve, and other realities begin to bleed through . Miller even starts having conversations with his dead sister Barbara. The voice here is remarkable, and reminiscent of various leading Thompson characters (Lou Ford from the \\"The Killer Inside Me\\" comes instantly to mind). One big secret you anticipate right away, but that's not the real surprise. It's the voice - and what it becomes. Kind of like watching a serpent's egg hatch."},{"Title":"Twisted City","review":"I'm a huge noir fan (Hammett, Cain) and am always looking for new noir fiction by contemporary writers. Most of the time, I am disappointed to find that what is being marketed as \\"noir\\" really doesn't get the power and the style of the original form. Not so here. This is not a neo-noir knockoff, but a fantastic, twisted, intricately plotted book in the style of a classical noir work, but with a new and modern spin. It kind of knocked my socks off.You shouldn't read this book (or any noir, really) if you are easily skeeved out. But if you like noir, you'll love this. The author has an original, accessible, extremely engaging style. I was drawn in from the beginning. You might be able to guess some of the themes of the book, or, as a reviewer said below, some of the protagonist's past history. But even if you do, really, that isn't even half the story. The fun is watching the plot unfold and ultimately getting inside - way inside - the narrator's head. I guarantee you won't see plenty of the twists coming, and the ending (even if you suspected it was coming) is written in a way that packs a major, creepy, darkly funny punch.I liked this book so much that I came back here to put all the rest of the author's books in my Amazon cart. If you like dark fiction, mysteries, and old-time noir in particular, check out this book. Starr does the masters proud. Can't wait to read more of him."},{"Title":"Twisted City","review":"The mark of a great writer is to move the reader. The emotion can be positive of negative. This story of a financial writer drawn into the dark underbelly of New York and into schemes that out of his league kept me up at night.Jason Starr shows he is an outstanding writer with this gripping, terrifying ride into an odd and uncomfortable place. He makes you care about the poor guy whose luck goes from bad to worse.I highly recommend this and any other book by Jason Starr."},{"Title":"Twisted City","review":"Jason' Starr's writing is taunt and compelling and he weaves a twisted little plot well enough to keep me reading. The only real let-down for me is that this book seems to \\"stop\\" rather than end. After working his way through all of the twisted turns, Starr brings everything to an abrupt and unsatisfying halt. If the ending was supposed to be a surprise, it wasn't. An average reader will figure out (or at least strongly suspect) David's past history from the get-go. \\"Twisted City\\" is a good noir tale, but ultimately unsatisfying."},{"Title":"Twisted City","review":"What a great book! Jason Starr has mastered the style of Jim Thompson in presenting the increasing paranoia and creeping psychosis of his narrator. The novel is almost impossible to put down as you follow the rush of events built on poor judgment and sociopathic reasoning. The narrator, David Miller, resembles a shell fired from an artillery piece, blasting its way into a hell of its own making.If you like this, don't miss Starr's NOTHING PERSONAL."},{"Title":"Twisted City","review":"This is a great modern noir tale of a life that spirals out of control (in the best possible way). Dark and involving you keep thinking, and often saying out loud, \\"Oh noooo!\\"A great read like all of Starr's work."},{"Title":"Twisted City","review":"I'm a big fan of the neo noir genre and after enjoying \\"The Follower\\", was looking forward to reading this.My issue with this novel was the ending. This book was well written and fast paced (hence the 2 stars) but it lead nowhere. I felt like the author couldn't figure out an ending himself and so just left it as it was. It seemed like it was building up and up to a big bang and then it just fizzled away to nothing. I've read novels before with ambigous endings (King, Ellis) but it did not work here at all. I felt ripped off.If you want some terrific neo noir, I suggest you check out theKiss Me, Judastrilogy by William Christopher Baer."},{"Title":"Twisted City","review":"A simple turn of events -- a guy gets his wallet stolen in a bar -- leads David Miller on a hellride through the darker side of Manhattan that finds him dealing with a maniacal girlfriend, a crack-addicted hooker and the hooker's dead boyfriend. Jason Starr is the modern equivalent of Jim Thompson or Charles Willeford, a master of dark, twisted noir. This one isn't as good as his last, but it's still darn good."},{"Title":"Twisted City","review":"In TWISTED CITY, Starr does what he has done in a few of his other books--paricularly Hard Feelings and Cold Caller--inviting readers into the mind of a seemingly ordinarily protagonist with dark secrets, and making us care about the character's fate because of great writing and storytelling. But what I admire most about Starr as a writer is he never writes the same book twice--he constantly pushes the envelope and comes up with provocative ideas and new ways to tell his crime stories. In Twisted City, there is a new Starr twist, so to speak. Unlike the protagonists of Hard Feelings and Cold Caller, David Miller is not an instigator. In fact if the events of the first chapter didn't happen, Miller probably would have continued to live an average, uneventful life. And the sub plot of Miller's relationship with his dead sister is truly inspired...But go into this book like I did, without knowing many of the plot details, and get ready for an adrenaline-filled, all-night read...This is quite simply the best novel I've read all year."},{"Title":"Twisted City","review":"even as a light read there is nothing original about this book.it seems like this was written in 2 weeks in front of a tv."},{"Title":"Wavelets in Signal and Image Analysis: From Theory to Practice (Computational Imaging and Vision)","review":"This book tells us some application on Wavelet in a brand-new way.But is is not go deep into."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"I love this book!

Easy to get into and hard to put down. Highly Recommend."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"I used to be a great fan of Julie Garwood (she doesn't write historical romances any more) and I consider this book her best. Gabriel was such a caring man and it was lovely to see Johanna getting out of her cocoon with him after being married to a brutal man before. I wish there was a Kindle edition of this novel..."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"Wow!! This is perfection there is no flaw in this story in the characters or the side characters. absolutely fabulous I read and read it over and over. Some scenes I reread immediately just because they are so funny or touching"},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"More than a romance novel, this is a story about growth, courage, determination, change and friendship. All the characters really make the story come alive, and the story has a lot of funny parts."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"The story was great! I was captivated by it, and had to finish it as soon as possible. Julie Garwood did not let me down with this novel. She is such a wonderful writer."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"This was my first Julie Garwood novel and it will definitely not be my last!! I found the 13th century setting fascinating and I immediately loved the characters. And the sex was steamy hot!! As soon as I finished the last page, I immediately started reading the book again. If you like Linda Howard, you will enjoy this Julie Garwood book. (My only complaint is that I get so annoyed with all the typos in Kindle additions. Why are they not proof read??)"},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"This was one of the first romance books I can remember reading when I was younger. It got me hooked on not only Garwood's books, but romance and anything about Highlanders."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"I loved watching Johanna grow more confident, rising above the abuse of her previous marriage; she's shy, but strong, an admirable heroine. I loved the hilarity of her teaching the men proper manners at the dinner table and how she dealt with the judgemental women of the clan, how she ultimately brought the two clans together (the Maclaurins have recently been added to the MacBains and the merger isn't going as well as it should be). I loved her relationships with Auggie (an old eccentric who has discovered the game of golf lol) and Alex (a boy who Gabriel claims as his son), and even the dog Dumphries! I really liked her brother Nicholas as well and wish he'd gotten his own book so we could see how he and a certain character get on (don't want to spoil it). I also liked the twist at the end, even if I saw it coming at the very beginning of the book lol..It was just an all around sweet read, well paced, believable, not just another shallow insta-love romance. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I put this one on my list of very favorite romances. This was my first Garwood, and none of her other books have satisfied me as much as this one, but The Secret and Ransom are both good reads."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"Saving Grace is a sweet love story by Julie Garwood. Enjoyed the story line of \\"the silly game of hitting round stones into holes!\\" Very enjoyable."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"All I can say is WOW!! I'm already a Garwood fan, but if I wasn't this book would have made me one! This is her best I've read, passionate, tender, interesting, and exciting! I wasn't so sure about the battered woman thing, it's kind of depressing and not what you want to concentrate on when you think romance, but Johanna was able to have a frightening past and still be full of spirit. Her initial timidity was well done and realistic, and so is the way Gabriel draws her fire out of her. I didn't think it got any better than Brodick in Ransom, or Connor in the Wedding, but Gabriel is my all time favorite Garwood hero! Her men always struggle w/ being too manly for love, but this time the hero realizes it before the heroine, and not only accepts it, but fights to make it two-sided!! What an awesome guy, can I take him home w/ me? I would have liked to hear more about Nicholas and Clare though. Awesome book, Julie Garwood fans, snatch this one up!!"},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"this is a fun book to read.the book makes you wish you was the girl.i truly have read a lot of romance book.this is one of them i will not forget in a long time.and if i do,i will read it again."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"If I could give this book more than five stars, I would. Saving Grace is my all time favorite Julie Garwood novel, standing next to other greats like The Prize, and Guardian Angel. For more works in the highlands, see The Secret, another wonderful book."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"Both my sister and I love this book very-very much. I love Gabriel and Johanna and how she always rub Gabriel's face with the back of her hand and made him forgot everything. This book makes me laugh like mad and i keep reading it over and over again. Thanks Julie and God Bless You."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"Usually i love Julie Garwood's work, but this book is the last straw. after reading The Bride, The Wedding, Ransom, and many others, i have had enough of the same huge-but-gentle-scottish Laird-warrier-who thinks his new little-english-with a shadow in her past-wife is weak. this is probably a great read if you havent read above mentioned books, but more of the same if you have.MacBain marries Johanna for the her land-which fell to her when her previous husband fell off a cliff... but the body was never found. the marriage is NOT in name only, and johanna learns to love and deal with her highlander through their time together, etc. and so on and so forth.see The Bride, The Wedding, and Ransom for the same thing written better."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"Out of the 12 Garwood books that I read, I definitely have to say that this one is my all-time favorite. And it's for all readers. No matter if you're a feminist and you submissive or if you're a romance freak. It empowers women.Johanna is a wife of a recently-proclaimed-dead English baron. Having been abused by Raulf for the three years that they were married, Johanna is wary of all prospects of a new marriage. However, her foster brother Nicholas insists that she remarry for if she doesn't King John will force her to wed a hated baron. The twist is that Johanna knows something the King doesn't want known.Gabriel is a Highland laird, who hates the English. But he agrees to marry Johanna so that he can get the Scottish land that she owns after her husband's death.Yea, yea, so they fall for each other. But surprise, surprise, her husband isn't really dead.But what really makes this book so unforgettable is the conversation between the characters. And boy, is this book full of it. I laughed the most in this book, the things they say are so hilarious, people on the bus looked at me as if I was crazy. This definitely has the best humor of all her books.Everyone should really really REALLY read it!"},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"The book arrived quickly and as the seller described. I love this author and she is definately worth the read. I am updating my library to contain all of her books in hardcover."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"I am obviously not a fan of Julie Garwood, since the only novel of hers I've liked so far is Castles. I didn't even manage to finish \\"The Bride\\" and had hard time finishing this. I really hated The Bride, but Saving Grace was not a bad book; it just failed to grab my interest. All three books of hers I've read so far have the same type of heroine: weak and naive bordering on stupidity. My main objection about Mrs Garwood stories though, is the slow development. I'm generaly looking for drama or action or at least a mystery to keep the story going. This happily living together for days or weeks, nothing changing in the premises but the couple's growing affection while all is well, is making me tired and bored. But then a lot of people probably like that stuff since Mrs Garwood is one of the most loved writers of historical romance. So no more Garwoods for me from now on, even if Castles was great."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"I HAVE READ ALL JULIE GARWOOD'S BOOKS AND THIS ONE IS MY FAVORITE. IF YOU LIKE WARM LOVABLE ROMANCE YOU WILL LOVE ALL OF HER BOOKS. I WANTED THE BOOK TO JUST KEEP GOING (EVEN AFTER I HAVE READ IT TOO MANY TIMES TO COUNT)"},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"so there was no tears for baron raulf when its assumed he died.lady johanna will get the better of him though with the help of a big beautiful scot.his name is macbain and lady johannas life will never be the same.a second chance at love.run ,run run and get this book"},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"This book touched me in a way no other book has touched me.I can't even begin to tell you the plot of this book. I would have to type the entire book. The only thing I can say about the plot is that she began as a battered wife (meek as a mouse, scared to express her feelings, etc.) then through trust, she became a woman. This book is an excellent read. It covers every aspect of a true romance novel. Johanna and Gabriel are wonderful."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"This was an incredibly touching book. I loved how that teddy bear of a man, Gabriel, showed her tenderness and protected her after she had been abused. He was a wonderful hero! Johanna learned how to be courageous and found that she can trust her husband. I was so touched at how they learned to love each other as they learned about one another. I was so proud of her for making friends with Augghie, who I loved!, and for standing up to those who were less than friendly with her. Her courage and impatience with the two clans (and one heck of a brilliant mind) brought them together, and taught them it didn't matter what plaid they wore, but they were the same people, not segregated and merely existing together. I wanted to give this five stars, but I feel the ending, though wonderful as it was, let me down a bit. I don't know if this is just my warped, vengeful mind, but I would have loved to see Johanna, when she was confronting Raulph (her nasty first husband), rub it in that HE was the one who was barren, and in fact she could carry children! Make him feel less of a man. That's just me though. I also feel like Johanna was just a little TOO courageous for having been a victim for all of her previous marriage. Her boldness just wasn't realistic to me.I do SO agree that there must be a sequel! I would love to read about Nicholas and Clare!"},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"I will recommend this book to anyone. It is truly amazing in every aspect. The characters will touch your heart. I have read 12 (including The Rose Trilogy as one book) of Julie Garwood's books, and I can't stop! My favorites have to be Honor's Splendor and Saving Grace. When her heros are Highlanders, I wish they'd come to life in front of me. This book is a must read!"},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"If I could give this book 10 Stars I would!!I can remember when this book was released, I was going on vacation and MADE myself WAIT to start it. I wanted to savor it one page at a time. I was not dissappointed this story touched me personally because of my own experience with Physical Abuse. I commend Ms. Garwood for tackling an issue that most romances barely touch. I believed in Gabriel, I believed in the strength he brought forth in Johanna. The Love the two of them created was something that little girls dream about and should never STOP reaching for. He was her champion and would allow NO PERSON to dishonor her again. More importantly is that once Johanna was away from those circumstance she wouldn't allow NO ONE to do the same to her. I loved reading about her relationship with his clan and watching it develop. There was a sentence that stood out from this book all these years that I always use to this day.... &quot;Judge me by the Company I keep&quot; when you read this book you will understand what she meant at the time she says it, even now it gives me chills and makes my eyes water. Enjoy this book for what it says about the power of the human spirit, it can be beaten but only broken if you allow it.Happy Reading"},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"Another good story by Julie Garwood. I read this one after Honor's Splendour and I must admit I did prefer HS. Ms. Garwood really knows how to tell a wonderful story, I wish the characters could be a little bit different but all in all I still love them. I would recommend this book, it is very enjoyable."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"Ms. Garwood is one of my all time favorite romance authors. And the story of Joanna and Gabriel would have to be one of my favorites of hers. This is not easy to say, because all of her books are really wonderful. I like Joanna and Gabriel best because I like the way they seem to fit. Joanna has been abused and is going to do everything in her power to see that it never happens to her again. She is a woman who gets things done. She is optimistic and has an open heart. Both characteristics are very important when she finds herself dragged to the highlands (by a loving brother) to marry a Scottish Laird. Gabriel is doing what he can to protect his people, even if it means marrying some English woman. He is strong and of course protective of what belongs to him. I get bored in romance novels where the main characters fight up to the last chapters of the book. These 2 are united in the early part of the novel, and I like to watch their relationship grow and develop as they begin to understand what it means to be married and to trust one another. I first read this novel several years ago, and I pull it out to reread at least once every six months. It never fails to bring a sigh &amp; smile."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"This is my alltime favoriate book by Julie Garwood. Gabriel and Johanna are a very nice couple. The love and respect that he develops for her starts because she so easily excepts his son. She starts to really fall for this loving and gentle man who vows to never let her suffer hurt ever again. I hope Julie Garwood cointinues to write great beeks like this. I own everyone of her novels."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"This book has love, laughter, action, incredible characters and a story line with a message. Gabriel and Joanna are such great characters that by the end of the book you can feel, see and almost touch them. Garwood has a rare gift for giving us characters that have a past, but haven't decided that they don't have a future. Each story she pens has hope and love as it's central message. This tackles a big subject...spousal abuse(by Joanna's first husband, Raulf)and she makes it into a story about new beginnings. Read this book and it will be on your &quot;KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF OR DIE&quot; shelf."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"Who doesn't want to feel accepted in their new home? All Lady Johanna's life, she's been taught that she's worth less than a dog. Gabriel MacBain changes all that. I loved this book. It's a definite page-turner, rich in action, romance, humor and intrigue. The way it's written, it takes the reader into the past to a world long forgotten. The characters come to life as you turn each page. They almost are tangible. The problems they face are realistic and the solutions are amazing. Johanna isn't a one-dimensional character. She's brave, spirited and cautious. Gabriel is gruff, yet caring. The way their personalities clash and meld together is simply beautiful. The supporting characters too are a joy to read. I'd recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"I thought the book was very good but it was alot like &quot;The Bride&quot; another book by Julie Garwood. The plots are very similar. If you loved &quot;The Bride&quot; you'll enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"I got this book when it first debuted on hardback ten years ago, and I must say that I've reread this story dozen of times since. Johanna, the victim of an abusive relationship, is persuaded by her brother, Nicholas, to wed Scottish Laird MacBain in order to protect her from King John. At first, Johanna is timid and frightened by her new situation. She is recovering from a first marriage in which she was repeatedly abused, and taught to be the way she was. However, when she hears her new husband's first name, she knows she will be safe with him.MacBain has come to the aid of the McClaurian clan, after their Laird perished in a fight with the English. After the English leave, MacBain becomes Laird of two clans, and must learn how to combine the two. At this same time, Johanna, his new wife, is a mystery to him. MacBain is a typical Garwood hero; strong, courageous and loving. He is the perfect compliment to Johanna's character.Johanna does not remain timid. She grows under the love and freedom given to her by MacBain. When she finally confronts her first husband with spuke, you want to appauld her for having the courage to do so.I highly recommend SAVING GRACE."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"if one would usually go for fast-paced stories, and i admit that those are really much more interesting, i would have to say that garwood's orchestration of this novel was flawless. it wasnt hurried, it wasnt taken for granted, and it certainly wasnt one dimensional.there are many facets with which to look into the story. johanna's \\"barenness\\", her \\"timidity\\", her desecration of the highland brogue, her amusing effort in getting the maclaurins some manners (the porcelain-trashing scenes were downright funny...oh! and the there's-more-than-one-way-to-enter-a-keep & there's-more-than-one-way-to-skin-a-fish philosophies were so hilarious), her battle with dumfries, and then there's her deadly secret about king john.and that's just johanna's side of the story.with gabriel, its about handling both clans, surviving the indignity of being nicholas' brother-in-law, finding clare's \\"rapist\\", reiving, getting a few gray hairs over johanna's escapade with the wolves, ordering her to rest and knit and sit by the fire on the hall, protecting her from the barons and bishop hallwick, and marvelling every night that johanna is exactly the opposite of what he should require for a wife but one that he is supremely \\"pleased\\" with...and i absolutely loved that part in the end where gabriel helped johanna break the punishment rod...the depth of emotion in that scene was just...intense. even if most people would say that this is just one of the usual historicals by garwood that echo all the others, i believe that this has the gravest human turmoil in all of her works.now what more could you ask for a romance novel??"},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"This was the first JG book I have ever read. The author was recommended by a very good friend of mine in Atlanta, GA. This was one of those books you wish would never end. I loved the chemistry between Lady Johanna and Gabriel,(the Archangel). Many books have the couple fighting and bickering throughout until all is resolved in the end. Not so with this one. It was so outstanding. I wish Julie Garwood would write a book about Nicholas (Lady Johanna's brother) and Clare. I love it when the men are big, brave and ruthless and also possess huge and loving hearts!"},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"Just like anyone else who has read more that one of Julie Garwood's books this story was immediately familiar to me. It runs along the same lines as The Bride and The Wedding just to name a couple. I much preferred those stories to this one. I agree with a previous review that if I read the words you need to rest one more time I was going to throw the book at the wall. Another thing that really bothered me was the amount of nodding going on in the story. It seemed that after every statement the character would nod to get their point across. It really irritated me, people usually don't constantly nod as they are talking. But in the scheme of things I suppose that is a minor complaint. Even though the author's books are a bit formulaic I still enjoy them. The secondary characters were entertaining, adding a lot to the story. This was a pleasant read, but it definitely will not be going on my keeper shelf."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"This book reminded me of Ransom but with a little more drama. It was intriguing, a bit presumptuous (huge Julie Garwood fan) yet sweet and undeniably a weepy romance novel. Oh and don't forget toxic humor that can have you appear to be mentally insane to others while commuting from work. I loved it, in fact I am going to read it again and again just like Ransom. I was literally lost and totally compelled to be lady Johanna. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"This book was more than amazing. Every page was a delight to read and I never wanted it to end. I do hope Ms. Garwood writes a sequel. If not, I'll sorely miss Gabriel and Johanna."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"I have a special place for this book in my bookshelf and in my heart. The main character (an English young lady who has to get married to a Highlander) is strong and extremelly funny, and the story is very sweet. Garwood also manages to mix a bit of history in the plot, which creates an interesting background for the story. But mainly it is a love story between a big, fierce warrior and a small but strong and witty young woman. It may sound cliche, but the book is certainly worth getting past the cliche and letting youself be taken by the story and the characters."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"From the moment I read my first Julie Garwood book, Prince Charming, she has been my favorite author of historical romance. I love her characters, the funny dialog, the romance. Her female leads do tend to be similar, but I just enjoy reading about them in each book. This particular book is one of my favorites. I've read and listened to it time and time again. Just wish Ms.Garwood would write some more Scottish romances."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"Have you ever found yourself reading a certain book over and over again. Not because you didn't understand it, but because it was just that good? That is how I feel about Saving Grace by Julie Garwood. This book has it all. When I first bought it, I read it straight through, never putting it down, except for the occasional potty break.After looking over the elegant cover, with its simplistic style and inviting colors, I opened the book and traveled back to 13th-century England and Scotland. A timid Lady Johanna is relieved to learn that her abusive husband is dead. I found myself wanting to congradulate her. Unfortunately, her freedom is short lived, when the wicked King John wants to marry her to another abusive lord. Her brother makes a decision to save his sister and convinces the powerful highland laird Gabriel MacBain to put aside his natural disgust for all things English and wed her. Of course, he needs to agree sight unseen, and is given an incentive. He gets land that once belong to Scotland. The laird agrees and is of the mind, that he will sacrifice for the good of his people. The only problem is that the beloved brother has to convince Johanna to marry Gabriel. Johanna's first impression of Gabriel, he is a barabarian. Gabriel's first impression of Johanna, OH YES!, She will be mine. LOL, you just know he was mentally on his hands and knees thanking God, that she wasn't a walking hairy zit.The dialog between Johanna and Gabriel was fun and exciting. Getting married proved to be a challenge in itself. Gabriel being the alpha male, is used to things being his way. Johanna, the suppressed female, is tired of being disrespected and mistreated. The bickering back and forth was well written and gave credablitly to the story. There are also moments, that made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside, I was like Awwwwwww. But under all the fun and fuzzy, there were some real serious and thought provoking issues.For so long, Johanna lived in fear. Fear from her first husband and fear from the church, who's confessor taught that women were last in God's love. Now she finds herself, afraid and uncertain as to the ways of life with the clan. Johanna has difficulty adjusting to life within a clan and being the new wife of the laird. The clan women make fun of Johanna behind her back, she has a hard time trusting her new husband, always expecting the shoe to drop or should I say the hand to start flying. She also has to learn to accept that not all men of the church are as sadistic as her previous confessor. But with the friendship of an old man obsessed with golf, a little boy, and a dog, Johanna begins to step out of her shell and grow strong. Her relationship with her new husband grows into love. Unfortunately, her new strength is tested when she rescues a battered woman and all the painful memories come flooding back. Not to mention, her brother returns to reveal news so shocking, that it could very well destroy all that she has come to love.What I appreciate about this story is the fact that there are real issues that could pertain to this day and age. There is physical and psychological abuse, political intrigue, corruption within the church, and so much more. When I say this book has it all, it does. The story is not only enjoyable, but believable and with a ending that leaves you both satisfied and wanting more. If you have never read a Garwood book, you are missing out. Saving Grace had my emotions going back and forth. Laughing, awing, anger, etc... You have to love a book that can accomplish that!"},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"I've given up on Julie Garwood - all of her books seem to read the same. They're not descriptive enough either - too chatty. She's a very verbal writer, with very little action. I felt like I was eavesdropping on a conversation instead of reading a novel! With that said, I must say it was well-written, even if a touch clich&eacute; - the beautiful little heiress with the \\"my man's gonna save me\\" mentality, which gets old real quick. The characters were likable and the storyline flowed well, I just couldn't get past how talkie this book was! I'm selling my Garwoods; any takers?"},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"Julie Garwood is an unbelievable writer. I am in the process of reading ALL of her books and so far I love each and every one of them. Saving Grace was a very good book. Very lovable characters. I encourage everyone to read her books. I do enjoy reading the reviews to keep me on track when a book is in a series. I dislike reading a book out of order."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"One of my favorites. I love to see those big strong,handsome and gruff warriors(in this case Gabriel) fall all over themselves for those little women(Johanna). It was also fun to see Johanna bewitch all the clan's men. Great story with fun,action and mystery."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"Saving Grace is a refreshing change of pace from the \\"typical\\" plot lines for romances set in the Middle Ages. This is a sweet, sweet story --- not too complicated but with enough historical intrigue to make it interesting. However, what I like the best about the book is that both the gruff and wise hero and spunky teenage heroine are smart and clever. They think and use their brains --- which is especially great to see in the female lead. I get so tired of reading romances from this time period where the heroine is very young, stubborn and guileless, yet stunningly brave, sweet and beautiful. Meanwhile, the big, stoic, hunky hero (always much taller than anyone else) spends much of his time rolling his eyes or holding his tongue or gritting his teeth so he won't hurt her tender little feelings, while simultaneously trying to protect her from her own innocence and stupidity.In this story, as the shy and timid \\"ingenue\\" slowly reveals herself, we learn that her demeanor is largely a result of being the victim of a phyically abusive first husband. Once she realizes she is safe, her true character comes through and she is smart, clever, kind and thoughtful. The hunky hero spends much of the story trying to protect her from herself, only to be shown time and time again that she can take care of herself. It is great --- and this couple is wonderful.The main reason I am writing this review, however, is I noticed it is rated \\"YA\\" by Amazon. I am not sure if that is by choice or what the publisher says, but I think the sexual content in this book is more appropriate for those over the age of 18."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"Johanna, a young domestic abuse survivor, is persuaded by her brother Nicholas to marry Laird Gabriel MacBain upon the death of her husband and is haunted by her past as she struggles to develop trust for her new husband and learn the ways of the highlands. She quickly finds out Gabriel is mostly bluster, though he is confused about his own feelings regarding their relationship. I loved these characters. There were a lot of humorous parts in this story, and it was the perfect mix of light and dark. Highly recommended to anyone looking for a good Highland/Historical Romance!"},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"Shortly and simply put, there's something so enchanting and utterly compelling about this novel that I revisit it over and over again. All of the characters came together masterfully and our couple compliments each other absolutely. Perhaps the epitome of everything Garwood?"},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"Actually, this was more like 3-1/2 star rating for me. And I don't necessarily think it was the book, itself, but rather the fact that I have read some many of Garwood's books, that I am somewhat burned out, I guess. The storyline of the book was too familiar. It has it's typical heroine, Johanna, who was beautiful -- the twist to her character was her independent spirit, which was contradictory to the usual quiet and submissive women during that time. Still, there was nothing too new for me. And Gabriel, was the typical heroine -- handsome, macho, brave and protective of his woman.What I liked most about the book were its secondary characters, including Dumfries, the beloved dog. And I liked the recluse, wise old man and reading of his version of golf!If you're a Garwood fan, you'll no doubt appreciate her writing and storytelling ability. But you may also, like me, find nothing particularly new or exciting in this book. But, hey, she remains one of my favorite authors!"},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"Arrogant Highland Laird (is there a better kind????), Gabriel MacBain, meets timid, defiant, headstrong English born Lady Johanna.

Apparently not for this Scottish gal because I sooooOOOooooOOOOoooo loved this story. And no matter how many angles it's told from, it's still delightful and humorous. The dialogue and banter, especially between the Warriors at Supper time is HI-larious and will have the reader bustin' up over and over.But........Where the heck is the Epilogue???

I haven't read this book in about ten years, but I bought it to see if it was as good as I remembered. Let me tell you I was not disappointed. This is a fantastic book and you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"This book was so WONDERFUL! You will NOT regret getting it at the least. BEst book of all times a must have for sure"},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"This is without a doubt historical/romance fiction, LITE It lacks the weight and feel of books by the wonderful Kathleen Givens or exceptionally talented Susanna Kearsley who have written books with similar themes. This isn't a bad read by any means, it is, as I said, light, fun, and yes, romantic with plenty of 'all that' if that is what you are looking for in a book. Johanna and Gabriel have fairly nice chemistry albeit a little forced in feeling. They come together quickly but love doesn't come into play until later in the story. Johanna and Gabriel's histories are tragic but the author does not dwell too heavily on their pain. Supporting characters are fun but lack depth. But like I said, this is not a serious, heart wrenching tale by any means so it shouldn't be taken in any other way. Fun and romantic, 'Saving Grace' is a nice light , weekend read."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"Its simply great.Ms Garwood sends across a powerful message.A man can be gentle and tender and yet not lose his masculinity ,a woman can want not to merge herself as her husbands alter-ego and still not lose her feminity and a couple in love can definitely triumph if both are able to see things from the other's perspective. Please write more."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"This the first Garwood book I read that made me a fan for life!! I haven't been disappointed yet!"},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"This book soars. The heroine is enchanting, the hero irresistible. What really makes it click, however, are the well-drawn supporting characters and hilarious comic scenes. After reading this book, I became a Julie Garwood fan for life."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"Johanna and Gabriel's story is heart warming and touching. I would recommend this book to everyone; Each of Ms. Garwood's books are well written and unique."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"I've just recently gotten this book about 2 weeks ago I think, and I've already read it about 6 times! I love it, the Love story between Johanna and Gabriel is one of the best. Johanna doesn't trust any male except her brother and she's not real excited about marrying Gabriel because of her abusive first marriage, she is afraid he will hit her and abuse her like her first husband did. So Gabriel has to use ALL of is patience and understanding to make Johanna feel safe and eventually learn to trust him that he will never hurt her. Johanna starts out frightened and scared, but once she learns that Gabriel will never hurt her, she gains more confidence to stand up to him, and to DELIBERATELY provoke his temper, which is HILARIOUS! The love story is great, actually the WHOLE book is great! Definately a keepe"},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"I love this book!! The relationship between Johanna and Gabriel starts out one sided and then grew to an equal relationship. I especially loved the part where she aggrevates him on purpose because it is so hilarious!! You will love this book!!"},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"I have read every book by Julie Garwood, and this is myall time favorite! I have read it 5 times, and I laughedeach time! Her characters are always warm and funny butJohanna and Gabriel have a special something that winsyour heart. I now buy all of Julie Garwood's books in hardcover so I can read them over and over."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"This isn't a bad story, but gets off to a slow start. My one big complaint is that Julie Garwood doesn't demonstrate much realism when it comes to writing battered and abused heroines. Johanna's acceptance of Gabriel, especially on their wedding night, seemed extremely unrealistic given her history with husbands. There was no seduction, no attempt to coax tis abused wallflower out of her fears. And she showed little timidity. I expected her to be frankly terrified of men.But once we got the middle of the book and the story became more about Johanna's renegotiations with her clan, and the protection of Clare McKay, then the story finally gelled.Julie Garwood has done better. Her Regency series and westerns do work. She just isn't able to write realistically abused abused heroines."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"I won't bother the reader with a detailed synopsis of the book, since there seem to be enough of those, so I'll go straight to my opinion about 'Saving Grace'.To start with, I would have to say that this is one of the best romances I have read so far, and as an avid reader, I've read a LOT of those. Julie Garwood's best works are her historicals, especially her Highland romances (The Bride, The Secret, etc.), and she surpasses herself here. The characters are beautifully portrayed, the author's style of writing so intricate and whimsical that almost every character (except the villians, of course) endears himself / herself to the reader. I have read reviews which are less than complimentary about the heroine Johanna's behavior, claiming that she is too timid to find sympathy with the reader. While I do not want to comment on them, I would like to point out here that considering the trauma she had undergone for years, her behavior was perfectly justified. If a woman who was married off when she was in her teens had spent years being abused physically and emotionally by her husband, chances are that she would naturally be extremely wary, or even frightened, for many years later till the scars of that abuse had faded. And when she does get her courage back, she manages to hold her own beatifully, and in many cases, with amusing results. Again, it would be very narrow-minded if one were to expect her to become aggressive, given the period in which this story is set.To move on to the hero, Gabriel is one of the best - perhaps THE best - male protagonist I have come across. Not only is he extremely protective and possessive of Johanna, he also turns out to have such an endearing character under all that tough, gruff exterior that it is impossible not to fall in love with him. And as a delightful departure from the regular romance novel, he is the first to acknowledge that he is in love. Most romances follow the trend where the hero admits his love only in the last five pages of the book. Such being the case, it is wonderful to encounter a hero who is honest enough to at least acknowledge to himself that he is in love with the heroine.All in all, we have a lovely heroine, a hero who manages to be both overwhelmingly masculine and just plain adorable at the same time, and a storyline that, while not exactly action packed, is fascinating in its own way, and manages to draw you in and enagage your emotions completely. If you love romances and like historicals, I could recommend no better book. In fact, give it a try even if you don't care much for historicals. The romance in it is more than enough to hold your attention and engage your emotions long after you've finished the book."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"I thought this book was pretty good. Nice story, nice characters. But, I did think that the ending was very weak. Yet, I think most people will like this book. Depending what you read before it. As I thought there where some similarites to the wedding. Which i liked better than this book. so, you may love this book if you haven't read some of the other books first."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"I absolutely LOVED this book. I couldn't put it down, which only means that I was extremely annoyed when I had to do mundane things like feeding cats and cleaning house. The whole time I was doing chores my thoughts were with Johanna and Gabriel.I loved both Garwood's characters and loved how Johanna became self assured toward the end of the book. I hate giving away endings so I won't do so now, suffice it to say that Gabriel was good for her. I also liked her secondary characters of Nicolas and Clare.Aside from The Bride and Ransom, this is the best Garwood I've read to date. I have all her medievals except Shadow Music which I have coming and look foward to reading."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"All I can say is Julie Garwood is THE BEST author of historical romance. This book Saving Grace is a book to be read and re-read again and again. There are no words to describe how wonderful this book is. I highly recommend it to anyone that is into historical romance. Julie gives the characters a personality that you love and they make you happy. You feel good after you read the book and you never seem to get enough of it."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"Enjoyed reading this book. It was fast moving and kept the reader interested."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"Saving Grace is one of the best Garwood's on the historical side. Not only does it delve into the treatment of women at the time (and there's some horrific allusions to wife-beating in this book) but it also goes again into the politics that weigh heavily in the characters lives and the decisions that they make. Garwood keeps up a quick pace and gives her characters just enough character flaws to keep them real. If you read her novels involving the Clans you'll notice that while each strapping Highlander is described in most of the other books, she makes us see that the women who become involved with them see them as we tend to see people we love. It's very refreshing! (My husband loves it when I read this stuff, it puts me in a great frame of mind!) Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"I hate reading a book again when I already know the ending. However, I've made an exception with all Julie's books. I love Johanna and Gabriel. This couple didn't suffer from all of those unrealistic miscommunications that often lead to them believing their unloved. You will also see Johanna evolve as a person (from a victim of abuse to a confident and independent woman). I do wish Julie had made the Epilogue focus on The MacBain's new baby rather than the death of Bishop Hallwick."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"This book touched me so deeply. I loved watching the transformation in Johanna and her love for Gabriel and his clan. Gabriel was another wonderful example of what every woman wants, a champion. Someone to care first and foremost about US!! The story here is so good, I couldn't put it down....I wish it would have went on and on. There is not one second in the book that is boring. I felt so bad for Johanna and what she had gone through because of her awful first husband. But, through Gabriel's patience and love she learned to believe in herself and him!! The other characters in the book were so funny and interesting!! I was laughing out loud over Keith and Lindsay and their constant questions and assumptions!! I believe that Ms. Garwood should give Collum and Leila their own story as well as Nicholas and Clare..I would snatch them up in a heartbeat!! this story is a keeper..you will not waste your time with this book!!!"},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"This book is truly fantastic! This is my 1st Julie Garwood and it surely won't be the last. I loved the twist, the plot and Johanna is a character filled with wisdom, courage and beauty. I highly recommend this book because its something to look forward to! :)"},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"This book has great characters and all around great writing. I loved it!! Humor,love, and almost all emotions are covered in this one. The supporting characters fit well and are interesting also. The story is touching. Definitly a all night read at one time book."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"This is one of JG's best! Right after Ransom. Gabriel was simply perfect - handsome, masculine, sensitive and yes, arrogant, but it worked well for him. It was amusing to me. Johanna was clearly the love of his life, and we knew this well. No silly games involved here. Thank God! As strong as Johanna turned out to be, I thought she came across as kind of ditzy in the beginning of the story, but I overlooked it and loved her anyway. I'm not sure why, but I always hesitate to read a book when the synopsis says the heroine was married before, but I'm so glad I didn't forgo this great book. But why on earth JG chose to make Johanna a 13 year old bride (first marriage) is beyond me. I was a little disturbed by that. The warriors constantly underfoot were magnificant! What a great job JG did with these guys! I love the way she does that!"},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"This is the best of Julie Garwood. Her books always make me smile and laugh, something most romance novels cannot make me do. This story is fun and endearing and heartwarming...definitely would recommend it to friends."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"What a great story. Gabriel is Johanna's protector, boy does she need one and yes a sequel to this book is so needed to follow Johanna's brother and new wife love story! Anyways, I do so love how Gabriel shows his love to Johanna but doesn't say it, and I love how Johanna accepts Gabriel as he is. My favorite part of this book is at the end the speech Johanna gives to her ex-husband. I had to reread several times. You will love this story."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"My favorite Garwood book. No, it wasn't Shakespeare, but I like reading romance novels for fun, and this certainly delivered. The sex was hot, the characters sympathetic, and the storyline intriguing. It was sweet, sappy, and fun reading. (Who reads romance novels expecting Tolstoy, anyways?)I enjoyed seeing Gabriel thawing from a solitary, rather intimidating man to a loving and devoted husband. And I liked seeing Johanna coming out of her shell after years of abuse, and ultimately uniting the bickering clans.So, if you're looking for fun, frivolous entertainment, I highly recommend this one."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"Gabriel was one of the more patient Garwood heroes. Although he didn't understand a lot of the actions of Johanna he still allowed her to blossom into a strong woman. It was nice how vulnerable Gabriel seemed throughout the book. Cute relationship with Gabriel's son, Alex. Johanna's brother, Nicholas, was also a very good character. Very sweet and romantic book."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"This book is in the top 10 of books I have. I loved this story and shows that with the right person they bring out the best in you. If you have not read this book -(Yes I am not a big historical book fan) This is worth your time. I have keep this book because I have reread this about 3 times when I just need a lift.Other Good Books, Secret by Julie Garwood-Anything by Nora Roberts/JD Robb"},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"This was a great story, actually one of the best ones I've read in a long time. The characters and the story were all very strong. I was so proud of the heroine, she is so brave and a great role model for women of her time. I recommend this book to anyone!!"},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"I am so happy to have read SAVING GRACE as my first Julie Garwood novel. It was greatly entertaining and a very sweet story.Johanna is a brave, perky, and thoroughly interesting heroine. Gabriel is gruff, powerful, and a perfect hero. Their love story is wonderful - one of the best in the romance genre.Although I was slightly confused by all the characters and the author's writing style in the first few chapters, I am so glad that I continued reading. This novel has a well woven story that is compelling and humorous in places. Read this - you won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"My favorite Julie Garwood novel, Saving Grace focuses on the theme of spousal abuse in a Medieval historical setting. Johanna, who suffered at the hands of her dead husband Baron Raulf was a physically and psychologically abused child bride. She learns what marriage and love are really meant to be and discovers passion when she remarries Highland Laird Gabriel Macbain in order to escape the threat of imprisonment or worse at the hands of the king of England. Macbain, a former outcast and illegitimate son of a Scottish Laird, has formed his own clan of other outcasts and has taken on the task of uniting his clan with another. He marries Johanna, primarily in order to gain control of the land that she has inherited, but he quickly falls in love with her and vows never to let anyone mistreat her again. With the love of her archangel Gabriel, Johanna begins to overcome her fear and takes back her life. This JG novel has it all, Brilliant leading characters who stay in your thoughts, passion that makes you burn, mystery/plot that keeps moving, tenderness and sensitivity which lift your spirit, healing that touches your soul, wit and humour which will make you laugh out loud. Ms.Garwood has gone far beyond the norm with SG, it makes you think twice about \\"romance\\" writing."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"I was first introduced to Julie Garwood after skimming through an excerpt of MERCY in the Cosmopolitan magazine. I never read a romance novel before, but after reading MERCY I had to read its prequel HEARTBREAKER. From there I devoured all of Garwood's historical titles. I have collected a wide variety of romance novels, and have become deeply enamored with the genre. (Now I am a 4-eyed, because of it - with all those sleepless nights!). I have plenty of favorite romance authors, but Garwood ranks on top!As always, Garwood writes a tale about love, passion, and intrigue. SG takes place in the Highlands of medieval Scotland. The novel is truly captivating - for its memorable story, well-depicted characters, and excellent writing. Out of all the handsome, powerful, arrogant, and gallant heroes that grace the historical romance world, Scottish laird Gabriel MacBain is by far my most favorite warrior. He is a tender and passionate lover. Unlike many heroes, he does not torment himself, or struggle with the fact that he actually loves his wife! He accepts Johanna for who she is; he welcomes her love with open arms; and he protects her with all his might. What-a-man! Lady Johanna is wonderfully crafted as the golden-haired English beauty. Of course, she's clever, strong-willed, loyal, and absolutely devoted to Gabriel. Together, they make one of Garwood's most beloved couples. SAVING GRACE holds a special place in my heart - mostly because it's the first historical romance novel that I ever read.I have read all of Garwood's books except for PRINCE CHARMING, KILLJOY, and A GIRL NAMED SUMMER. Her ability to entertain readers with her endearing characters and wonderful storytelling is pure joy. After reading this book, I highly recommend HONOR'S SPLENDOR, THE LION'S LADY, THE BRIDE, THE SECRET, and RANSOM. All of her books are great and very entertaining, but these four titles encompass her best work. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"I enjoyed reading this book because you could really tell that the couple loved one another here. For once, it was the hero who realized and admitted it first* which was a bonus for me. How he went about trying to make her feel the same way was a refreshing change compared to other heroes who take so long to admit their love, and who hardly show their affection until the last few pages of the story. Gabriel is one of Julie Garwood's best heroes (along with Iain Maitland) simply because he was one of the nicest, who knew how to treat his lady right.One thing I don't understand is why some reviewers are so shocked by the age gap between Johanna and Gabriel? Saving Grace was set during the MEDIEVAL ages after all, and large age gaps weren't so uncommon then. It is NOT impossible for a 16-17 year old girl to fall in love with a thirty something year old man because people were different back then (and vice versa). Their way of thinking, their maturity level, etc. Even Jane Austen had a couple with a similar age gap (Colonel Brandon and Marianne Dashwood fell in love and were married in the ending of Sense and Sensibility, and she was 16-18 while he was 36!)Also, please remember that you can't compare a sixteen year old girl today with a sixteen year old back then; times have changed and the setting of a book should always be taken into account."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"I have bought this book at least three times because i keep lending it out and i never get it back. I love how Julie Garwood brings out the characters personality. Also, when we were going over this time period in my history class it helped a lot. She was very precise."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"I absolutely love this book, Saving Grace, by Julie Garwood. There was just something about this book that just struck a chord in me while I was reading it the first time. I felt like I was a part of McBain's clan myself, the setting was so real for me. I think there are wonderful characters and character development not only in the hero/heroine, but also in all of the secondary characters. I left that book feeling like I really knew and cared about those people! This is a book that I always go back to and it never fails to comfort me! That's probably why I ended up with 3 copies in my personal library! Actually, I loaned my only copy to my sister, who promptly lost it, and I ordered a 2nd off amazon, then picked up the 3rd in a 2nd hand store just for backup! My sister finally found the 1st one, so now I have all 3!The only thing that bothered me about this book is that I felt Julie really needed to right a sequel for Nicholas! His story just screams to be written!!"},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"Was it just me or did this book seem incredibly long? It usually takes me a day or two to read a romance if I'm really into it. This one took days. I'm giving it 3 stars because Garwood can write well, but I am not giving it more because this story was frankly dull in the middle. I have read maybe 60-70 romance books of all genres and this wasn't my first Garwood, however, this one was just too slow. It takes place in 13th century England and Scotland. It's the story of Lady Johanna, married at 16 to a beast, Baron Raulf Williamson, who beats her. Three years later, he is killed on the Continent while on assignment for King John. Johanna, who has some secret information on the King that may threaten her life, is wed to a Scottish laird, the MacBain, at the urging of her brother, Baron Nicholas Sanders, who is concerned for her safety. MacBain has a fierce reputation and while a gruff man, he is a man of honor and can be gentle. Soon Johanna begins to let go of her fears and to love the MacBain who is falling hard for her though he is in denial for a good part of the book. I won't give away the ending which was pretty good, but let's just say the action picked up at p. 352. The problem I had is that the part of the book that deals with their growing relationship while they are at his keep in the Highlands (nearly 300 pages of the book) seemed monotonous to me. It was the same short dialog over and over as they worked out the kinks in their relationship and Johanna recovered her spirit. I thought Garwood could have done it in 100 pages, maybe 200 at most. I guess the publishers want 375+ pages these days (this one is 405 pages in paperback) but when a story is stretched to accommodate that as this one seemed to be, it doesn't make for a fast paced romance. This one needed something in the middle to hold my interest that it didn't have. I did finish it but I will soon forget it. For Garwood fans, this may be just fine, but for me, it was not enough."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"I absolutely adored every part of this book. From the very beginning I could not put it down. Gabriel is my new favorite hero; you can just see how much he cares and loves her throughout the story. And Johanna even though she is young she is a strong and daring. I love these characters and I love this story I would give 10 stars if I could."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"Having heard such high praise about this book, I had sky-high expectations and expected to be blown away by it. Unfortunately, that didn't happen - not in the 1st half of the story, anyway. It took me a long time to like Gabriel - too arrogant and distant - and Johanna - too ditzy and scared. At one point, I was ready to scream if he told her to rest one more time! That was funny at first, like a recurring joke, but it got old pretty fast - probably because she didn't stand up against it soon enough to suit me. Considering what she'd gone through during her 1st marriage, when she'd been a silent victim of spousal abuse, I completely understood her fears when it came to Gabriel, who was this \\"big and bad\\" Highland warrior, and I knew she needed time to get over them so I gave her some slack, but I couldn't wait to see her grow some spine. When she finally did... Wow, it was like I was reading another book! It was funny, touching, action-packed, everything I had expected to find at first, and I could not put the book down. Wonderful save, Ms. Garwood! :)Now, addressing the age issue that had me concerned before I started reading this book... Unless I missed it, neither Gabriel's nor Johanna's age was mentioned in the story. Aside from her brother saying that she had gotten married the 1st time when she was \\"still a child\\", there was not other clue in the book and I only \\"knew\\" she was 16 at the beginning of story because I read the book description. I know this is a minor detail and it shouldn't have bothered me, but it did. I like knowing how old the H/h are, especially if one of them is that young.All in all, this was another very good story by Ms. Garwood, and she's now officially one of my favorite authors."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"Garwood is one of my favorite historical romance authors (her contemporaries aren't as good, but that's another review). Her stories are funny and \\"light\\" (not as emotionally wrenching as other historical romance authors can be), and I always feel good when I finish one. The only books that get 5 stars from me are those that are keepers (rereads). This one fits that definition. The tension/romance between the h/h is just right, with plenty of witty dialogue and romantic love scenes. Well done!"},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"This is my most love book. When I first read this book I fell in love with the story and the characters right way. I love both the heroine and the hero's personality in this story, it was exactly to my taste. Only problem was that I wish it was longer. I never want it to end."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"I absolutely LOVE this book. It's my favorite out of all of Julie's books. I've worn out 2 copies so far and am working on wearing out my 3rd. I'm hoping it will come available to Kindle soon so I don't have to buy anymore copies. :)"},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"I almost didn't read this book as I have disliked almost every historical romances I've read where the heroin is a widower, however I'm immensely grateful that I didn't put this book aside!This is a charming story, the characters are delightful and refreshingly honest, and the story is simple and enjoyable!I have had mixed feelings bout Garwood's Historical romances but this one is defiantly one that is going on the keep shelf!"},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"I have owned this book for the past 10 years. In that time, I've read it a total of 14 times and am soon to embark on my 15th reading of it. \\"Saving Grace\\" is sweet and funny. I never grow tired of the characters' interactions."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"Julie Garwood's style of writing humorous yet emotionally deep romances puts her in an elite group of writers that I would say are \\"sure things\\". Saving Grace is in the same league as all her stories are and I recommend it highly.Johanna is unlike many of Garwood's heroines in that she was married before and was abused by her husband and also by her priest. She is afraid, of nearly everything, which is unlike Garwood's normally self sufficient strong women. You can tolerate this, as the treatment she endured at the hands of her husband was horrific at best.Gabriel is another one of Garwood's \\"gems\\" of a man/warrior. He is as tough as they come, but he loves his Johanna. It's not that he tells her...because he really doesn't until the end.....he SHOWS her. His concern for her well-being is incredible and he is constantly worrying about her and defending her.Slowly Johanna begins to flourish in the safety and security of Gabriel's love. She really \\"comes into her own\\" and finds herself as well as the love of her life.

Saving Grace is my favorite of all her books. A wonderful, beautiful tale about very brave and special people. The characters are unforgettable!! The dialogue and plot are great. Julie Garwood has a wonderful talent at making me laugh. It will make you laugh, cry, and your heart will melt for the lovely story."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"You never know if you are going to be laughing, crying, or both. Wonderfully written, I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a little comedy with their romance."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"This is one of my favorite Julie Garwood books (I can't decide between this and The Secret). At the end when Johanna confront her first husband is some of the most touching and the best dialogue I have read. I have turned to these few pages often. I also would like to see a story about Nicholas and Claire. I have read every Garwood book written. I WANT MORE!"},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"This was the first romance novel I ever read at the age of 13 and seven years and numerous books later it is still my favorite. Every time is like the first I just can't put it down. Johanna is a heroine to be proud of. She overcomes her fears and fights for her love. And MacBain is simply the best! We all dream of being loved like that. Julie thanks for two truly rememberable characters. I luv all your books but Saving Grace is still #1. For all those out there who still haven't read it, you don't know what you're missing. So hurry to your nearest bookstore and see for yourself!"},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"This is my most beloved Garwood book. It's just one of those books you go back to read again and again, even though you already know the ending. You just love the retelling of the story. The main male character, Gabriel, has got to be my favorite of all leading male characters in all the Garwood stories. I highly reccomend it, and hope others find just as much joy as I do in it."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"This is the book that started it all for me. I've love this story, Johanna is an absolute jewel and Gabriel is an amazing character. I loved everything about this story. Ms. Garwood sets up an amazing plot that just continues to pull you in to the story. Every time I read this story I always wish that Ms. Garwood would write a sequel to these characters. >_&lt;"},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"OK so this is a novel published in 1993, and they keep on publishing it because it has got a lot of fans. Millions of readers must love this novel.I found it boring. IMHO, the humour was very silly. The characters only talk and talk, but they say nothing interesting. Certainly, it was not -for me- one of those novels you cannot stop reading. I had to make the effort to end it.If you like highlanders the Garwood's way (this is - very brigadoonish) then you will love this book, because it's more or less the same as 'The Bride', 'Honor's Splendor' or 'The Secret'. A beautiful Englishwoman, a powerful and sexy Scottish warrior... Nothing new or surprising, I'm afraid. Perhaps it was refreshing in 1993, I honestly don't know.I will not read it again."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"I have this in paper back. I have read it so much it is falling apart! I just read it again this week. I love the story line and the heroine is someone you can relate to."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"I read all of these great reviews, so I took a chance, but I was disappointed. I have read several of her books and this was my least favorite."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"THIS IS ONE GREAT READ,THAT YOU HAVE TO TRY IF YOU ARE A JULIE GARWOOD FAN!

The characters were cute as ever, but the story could have been better. I don't think that a 16 year old can really get on with a 30 something guy besides the fact that it is gross. Nor would a 16 year old have the knowledge that the heroine of this story had. Only after looking at the reviews did I decide to write one to give some other opinion besides a 5 star. If you did enjoy this book, I think you will enjoy her other stories more."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"I have read A LOT of historical fiction books... I got this one, trusting the raving reviews on it. I couldn't even finish it. The plot was dreadfully boring. The writing was choppy, and blunt, and it really bugged the heck out of me. It didn't flow. It makes me really not want to read another one of her books if its written like this one. The premise was good... I just wish I wasn't so bored! Gabriel, the male lead, was just downright mean! He wasn't likeable at all to me... and the female lead... she was just too accepting. There are much better books out there... please, don't waste your money on this one! Selling my copy!"},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"I want to make it clear that I am giving the audio version two stars but the book receives 4 stars. I will not go into the story because others have done it and made a good job of it too. However, I had to write this review concerning the audio tape. I have read the book but got the tape because I do a lot of traveling and I wanted to listen to some of JG's books to break the monotony of driving. I was very disappointed because the audio version did not do justice to the book version. The tape missed out on critical scenes that makes it so fun to read (does that rhyme?). Anyway, the listener will not gain any of the humor and poignancy that the book reveals. I'm just saying if you got to have the tape get if from your local library first, they give you three weeks on loan, then listen and make your decision. But my advise is to just buy the book!"},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"This is a typical Garwood book--young, sweet miss gets married to a hulking beast...fall in love, etc. The portrayl of the Scots were so stereotypical from books that I wanted to kill the book (unfortunately it was the library's). I still can't get over the age difference... Still, the depiction of the battered wife was pretty good--which is why i gave a three. Other than that, the characters are pretty unrealistic. a sixteen year old miss going up against two clans? Yeah right!"},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"This was an enjoyable read, but I had two minor problems with it. The characters were simple and predictable. Johanna was too syrupy, sweet and perfect. She recommended that the Scots not rob other Scots, but barter instead. She was good with bow and arrow. When she told stories to children, she had the female be the hero/rescuer. Also, one historical inaccuracy bothered me. She told people to use salve on cuts to avoid infection, yet germs and infections were not discovered until the 1900's. Aside from that, it was worth reading, but not great.Sexual content: mild. Setting: 1200 England. Copyright: 1993. historical romance.For a listing of my reviews of other Julie Garwood books, see my 2 star review of \\"The Secret\\" posted on 6/21/08."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"I've been reading other Julie Garwood books recently and this one is almost like an exact clone of The Secret... Tough man...small, weak woman... Boring!!! I really like Garwood's recent books but ones with the Highlander plots I have to force myself to finish."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"I honestly don't understand the high ratings. Normally I love historical romances, but not this one.I know this is a historical book but I felt that Gabriel's extremely demanding attitude was too much for me. It got really old really quick. The \\"wife\\" and \\"husband\\" title the two constantly used with each other got quite annoying. These two just felt overall cold with maybe a few moments of actual warmth. No chemistry.Another thing. All of the characters were idiots. No one knew what was anyone was saying. Garwood had all of her characters repeat what they said with an explanation and all Gabriel cared about was that Johanna \\"pleased\\" him.Things were dragged out far too long that you can very easily skim pages and still understand what was going on. I just got too bored with it myself and skimmed the last few chapters.Even though Gabriel, apparently, redeems himself it is too little too late for this reader. He is one of the worst male leads (I won't call him a hero) I have ever read.Maybe I'm just too independent for if I was Johanna my knee would have connected with that man's crotch on many occasions.The best part about this book was Gabriel's dog."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"I'm not sure what everyone else is jumping for joy about regarding this book. Yes, the setting is romantic -- it always is. Yes, the dialogue between the two characters can be funny, entertaining, tender and emotive. However, I don't think that either Johanna or Gabriel were well drawn, full characters. Half the time Gabriel's thoughts and speech indicated that he should be smiling or grinning, yet Johanna would turn to look at him and he'd have a &quot;feroucious frown&quot; on his face. Nothing Garwood writes lets us know why these contradictions between his thoughts and demeanor occur. Johanna is even more of a shell. We are never allowed into her head long enough to see if she has a complicated though, and I doubt that she does. Garwood relies compleely on dialogue to move the plot, and it just doesn't. To empathize with these characters, we need to feel like we understand them. Half of what they do is &quot;out of the blue,&quot; a bad, bad sign for us dear readers."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"My first Julie Garwood book was The Wedding and I thoroughly enjoyed it. After that, I seemed to have gotten hooked on JG's medieval novels. Saving Grace is undeniably another one of Jule's best. I have never been disappionted in any of her books. She is truly a talented writer. In this crazy world that we live in we need a break every now and then and Julie unquestionably gives you just that with her novels. Her heroines are witty, and spunky. While the heroes are handsome and caring. Definitely a great read! Applause for Julie, keep 'em coming!"},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"The story line is her best because of her humor. Poor Gabriel didn't stand a chance after he met Johanna. She had him around her thumb very quickly.I see that a sequel is in the making. Great."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"Saving Grace is Garwood's best book because of the humor she injects into the plot. Poor Gabriel doesn't stand a chance when Johanna enters his life. She denies all his boasts about being a &quot;hard mon&quot; and a &quot;good Laird&quot; and brings him around her thumb. I see by the interview in the paperback edition of RANSOM, that Garwood is planning a sequal to this story. Great! I cannot wait."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"I loved this book! You will not be disapointed. I love Julie Garwood and must say that this one was her best. You'll love all the characters. The heroine and the hero are lovable. This is well worth the money and you'll want to read it over agian. I defenitly have!"},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"I have been a huge Jayne Ann Krentz/Castle/Amanda Quick fan but have discovered other authors. BUT I must say that &quot;Saving Grace&quot; is my favorite book. I find that I pull it out often to reread and never tire of it. The relationship between Johanna and Gabriel is pure magic. And the situations both find themselves in, and the way the two find their way to love, is wondrous. I have read other JG books, including &quot;Ransom&quot;, and have enjoyed them. But none, for me, have captured magic of this book. Thank you, Ms. Garwood!"},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"I liked the book &quot;okay&quot; the first time I read it. Then something compelled me to read it again. After the second read, it became my favorite. (It's a good thing I bought a hardcover edition.) The strength of the main characters, Johanna and Gabriel, the depth added to the story from the historical touches, and the cast of interesting supporting characters all contribute to make this a wonderful read.Trust me, you'll laugh, cry, and cheer your way through this one."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"I am a big fan of Julie Garwoods books, and this is the best one along with The Gift. I loved how Johanna showed Gabriel how brave and strong she was. My favorite part was when she was in the tree and killing all the wolves, and when Johanna saw the beaten women and was shoting at the man who had done it. Gabriel was a true husband."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"I'm a big fan of Julie Garwood and read many of her books. But this one is definitely my #1 favorite. I love the way that Johnana overcame her fears and regained confidence with the help of her soul mate. I also like her candid and honest manner in which she took the stubborn warrior's heart. The scene that she talked about her archangel Gabriel in front of her ex-husband brought me tears.... Pick up the book and you never regret it!!!"},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"This was definitely my favorite from Ms. Garwood! I simply fell in love with the characters and didn't want their story to end."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"I love the way the characters relate to each other . The way people reacts to Johanna's beauty is very funny. I almost cried during the part where Johanna was talking to her ex-husband and telling him about her husband and his people."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"I have to admit that this book, like most of Ms. Garwood's books have very similar characters. Her perference of 'huge' and outwardly grumpy hero and small and femine heroine are evident once again in this book. However, this book is still exciting, fun, loving and beautifully written. Through reading the book, you see the transformation of Lady Johanna from a timid, scared girl into a courage, smart young woman. Her suffering at the hands of her ex-husband and ex-priest was extremely sad and painful to read. Gabriel is the biggest teddy bear among all of Ms. Garwood's heros. He was allowed to believe that he is in total control of the marriage all throughout the book which created a lot of funny circumstances. All of the supporting characters, brother, first-in-commands, son.. etc are all well written and had great personalities. I also love the scenes related to how the clan tried to please Johanna and behave themselves. This is a great book... the storey is cohensive and moved along at a good pace. It is always refreshing to read a romance novel that the hero and heroine are not consistently misunderstanding each other and at each other's throat. Their acceptance of their marriage and great sex is also great in the story. If you have never read a Garwood book, this one you should definitely pick up."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"I've spent the past week in a happy Julie Garwood book re-reading daze. I whizzed through eight of her historicals and left Saving Grace for last. For some reason I had convinced myself that Saving Grace was good - but not great - and that the novel wasn't as strong as say, The Secret, Ransom, or Honor's Splendour. I couldn't have been more wrong. The more I read, the more enchanted I became. Saving Grace deals with a very serious issue (domestic abuse) and I think this is why I rushed through it during the first read. However, I now realise that it's a super book with absolutely lovable characters, and a fine addition to the Scottish Laird / English Lady Garwood books.Lady Johanna is simply wonderful; she enters the book as quite shy and scared as she has been beaten many times by her deceased first husband and yet she still manages to hold her own with Laird Gabriel. I liked it that first of all Johanna had difficulty fitting in with her new clan - any woman would be vulnerable and untrusting at first if they had experienced Johanna's past and yet she becomes stronger and braver with each day that passes. Johanna is actually very clever and analytical, as well as being sweet and kind hearted. Gabriel is off the chart as a hero. What is so special about him is that as well as being strong and brave he is also very sensitive to Johanna's feelings and never treats her cruelly - in fact he is very considerate and kind as he tries to earn her trust (without being soppy). Gabriel was stigmatised as being illegitimate when he was younger and had a hard upbringing and I think this is part of the reason why he suits Johanna so well. I especially liked the way that the author told you about how vulnerable Gabriel felt as a boy and how he dreamed about having a lovely wife and home as it showed a softer side to the powerful Laird. Johanna and Gabriel are clearly perfect for each other. There are great secondary characters too. Auggie (an old man obsessed with golf), Alex (a boy Gabriel claims as his son), and Dumphries (a dog Gabriel rescued) all have their own unique personalities and quirks.The plot is great. It gives you some information about the horrible ways that women were restrained and abused in the past without going into too many details. There is plenty of hilarious dialogue between Johanna and Gabriel and Johanna comes out with loads of funny sayings (There's more than one way into a keep!). The ending ties up the loose ends nicely and the reader has no trouble in imagining Johanna and Gabriel living as a happy, passionate married couple for the rest of their lives. Sigh! :-)JoAnne"},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"My sister told me to read this book for the longest time. The reason why I prolong reading this one is cuz I didn't like the synopsis in the back of the book. Call me old fashion but I prefer my heroine a virgin. Since Johanna was once married, she didn't peaked my interest. I also thought I was getting tired of Julie Garwood's style of similar characteristics in her novels but I was wrong. Sure, this one does have a share of similar descriptions (such as heroine has freckles in nose, smells like rose and hero's a big, tall handsome warrior) just like on her other books, but i still love it :-) It's been awhile since I read a Julie Garwood novel, I just realized how much I love her style. The humor, the romance, the secondary characters that adds spice to the story &amp; of course, the unexpected twist. What more can a reader want? Once again, this book trully satisfied me. I was entertained more than I expected. I should have read this one as soon as my sister told me to.I read here in Amazon that some readers don't find Johanna an interesting heroine because of her timidity and weakness. In my opinion, this is what made her different and more appealing. Yes, she WAS timid and I can't say I blame her considering her past marriage. I would find the story too far fetch if Johanna would right away snapped out of her timidity and fear after what had happend to her once before. She lived in fear, she walked on eggshells for far too long to simply be bold &amp; audacious. The readers will also consider that Johanna was in a different environment, married (2nd time) to a stranger who's a big handsome brute, wouldn't u be timid and scared? It took time for her to trust McBain, it took time for her to come out of her shell. Deep down,she is actually fiery, spirited, spunky &amp; a courageous woman. She just needs some encouragement, stability and security to let that flow out. She was married too young the first time (and what a mess that was) and therefore, didn't really know herself until McBain taught her how to find her true identity. In short, I think Johanna's character developed perfectly and realistically. As for their age difference, well, i do agree it's somewhat a big gap but I overlook this flaw merely because they fit in together.I agree with quite a few reviewers comments here however, that this book needs a sequel."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"When I read my first Garwood, I fell completely in love and flew to my book store to buy every book of hers that was in stock. I got to *Saving Grace* about halfway through my pile, and was rather shocked by the begining. You hear of how preists had instructed their students in the 13th century and are shocked. Being a girl myself, I could see why women would feel awful about themselves.And then you get a veiwpoint swich and we are taken to fourteen year old Johanna who is being told that her husband is dead. Poor dear, she can barely contain her joy as the news is being told to her. You later hear that he was a cruel man who beat Johanna, blamed her for the lack of an heir, and flaunted his mistresses in her face. Then there is the local preist who beats the following facts into Johanna's brain: you are a woman, women are slime, you will never amount to anything, blah, blah, blah. So this poor teen is scared out of her mind, and amazingly happy to be free. Knowing that something bad might happen, she smartly files for a divorce, just in case.Two years later, the king demands that she must marry. Although reveling in her spinsterhood, Johanna has no choice. The trusty brother comes to the rescue and whisks Johanna off to the highlands where she is to marry his friend, Gabriel. Johanna is natuarally terified of marriage given her past experiences and defies her strong new husband.When Gabriel introduces her to real passion, though, she is forced to admit to herself that he is not the monster her first husband was and that she is falling in love with him. And she realizes she may trust him and that he will protect her. The fishyness behind Johanna's first husband's death starts to reveal itself, and the precious new love is put to it's first test. Will Johanna and Gabriel survive?One of the reasons I loved this book was that the characters' actions were clearly described so there was no doubt about what was going to happen. Also, there was definatly a hard coating to Gabriel and I think he is Ms. Garwood's BIGGEST male, but he was also very loving and heartstopping. Johanna was wonderful and truly had Gariel wrapped around her little finger. But their's was a rare love and it made the pages sparkle like gold. The topic of female degregation by the church was obviously well researched by Ms. Garwood and it shows. It is also so well written into the book that I actually screamed at it becuase of the unfairness of the issue. I sincerely hope that Ms. Garwood writes a continuation of this story, and I think it will go over extremely well with her fans."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"I first read this story a few years ago and just purchased a new copy because my original is so worn from me constantly reading it. What makes Julie Garwood's characters stand out in this story is the fact that I can see why Gabriel and Johanna fell in love. The reader is taken through every turning point of their relationship, the laughs and the tears. I have lent this book to friends who have never read a romance before, and now they own their own copy. So if you are a fan of 13th century romances or have never read one in your life, I definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"Married to a wealthy and powerful baron at a young age, Lady Johanna lived a rather solitary life, trapped in a loveless marriage with an abusive and oppressive husband. Made to feel worthless, she kept her agony a secret, opting to suffer in silence while praying fervently to God for salvation. Then one day, she thought that her prayers are finally answered when she hears the news that her husband, Baron Raulf, is dead. But it doesn't take long before she is faced with another catastrophe for King John intends to marry her off to another baron, one whom she fears and abhors. When her brother, Nicholas, hears of the king's intentions, he convinces Johanna to marry a Scottish laird whom he holds in high regard, for he knows that Johanna's life is in danger if she stays in England because she holds some knowledge that will incriminate the king.Born illegitimate, Gabriel MacBain carried the taint of his bastardry for a long time. Never once acknowledged by his father, Laird MacLaurin, he learned to fend for himself growing up to be a respected and esteemed warrior. When an English army attacked the Highlands, his late father's clan turned to him and he became Laird over the two clans, the MacBains and the MacLaurins. When Nicholas approaches him offering his sister's hand in marriage, he adamantly says no, but upon realizing that Johanna had a legitimate claim on their land, he reluctantly agrees and secretly vows to stay away from his future wife after they marry.But both are in for a surprise for it doesn't take long before their initial hesitation leads to acceptance of each other. While Gabriel thought that Johanna was too timid for his liking, he realized that this was the effect of her abusive marriage, and immediately felt an overwhelming need to protect her. As for Johanna, she quickly realizes that underneath the gruff exterior lays a tender and kind-hearted man who will respect and keep her safe. And it was good seeing Johanna come out of her shell and learn to stand up for herself. Yes, she does start off quite timid from the start, but this is understandable considering her age and experience with her previous husband. That's why I liked how she managed to tame Gabriel's fearsome dog, earned the respect of his men and befriend the jealous women from the MacLaurin clan. And I especially enjoyed Gabriel's pride in her, and more importantly, the fact that he is the first one to admit his love for her and how much he needs for her to trust and love him.SAVING GRACE is a medieval romance set in 13th century England and Scotland. Featuring great characters, I enjoyed seeing the love that blossomed between the Gabriel and Johanna. Their tenderness toward each other is something to cherish and, in the end, I was happy that Johanna has finally met her own archangel.This is my first Julie Garwood book (indeed, a terrific introduction) and I look forward to reading more of her work."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"This was a very cute story. I really enjoyed reading it. Made me laugh and sigh a lot.Johanna was married at a very young age to a mean English Baron. The Baron died and then the King told her she had to remarry. Johanna did not want to marry again but the King ordered her to. She was going to have to marry another evil English Baron, but then her brother told her of another man that might be acceptable to the King. The only problem is that this man was a Scottish Highlander. Laird MacBain did not really want to marry but he wanted the land that Johanna had inherited.Johanna has a timid nature but tries to overcome it. When she first came to the Highlands the clan thinks that she is a coward and in some ways she is, but she has courage when it counts. She is faced with a lot of problems concerning the clan but she does not bring them the Gabriel, she wants to solve them herself. She has her timidity but is sassy at the same time. She has to over come a lot of fears because of her first husband. At the end she is very well respected by her clan.Gabriel is such a sweetie. Gabriel had a very hard life. He had given up hope of having a family. He has a lot of problems and fears but they do not come to the foreground until Johanna becomes important to him. He wants her to rest all the time because he does not want her to be like his mother who worked all the time and died young. He is scared of losing her. He is a very strong man and respected and feared by many of the other clans. He has a kind heart but is also a bit stubborn. He might not fight honorable but he is a very honorable man. When he says he is going to do something he will do it. He is also very possessive, which I just loved. By the end he is so happy that she is a part of his life, he calls her his Saving Grace.This story had so many things that I liked. I loved the fact that he admitted to himself that she was the love of his life before she did. He was not all about looks. Her appearance had nothing to do with why he loved her. It was her Character, the beauty in her heart and in her soul that he loved. He was a proud man and did not like being questioned but was so proud of her when she stood up to him because it proved that she felt safe. He loves the fact that she is sassy. It is so sweet also because he thinks she is perfect just the way she is. I just loved that because he was such a strong man and you really did not know that he was going to end up being so....romantic in his thinking. Julie Garwood wrote this well. I really was not sure of Gabriel in the beginning because he was not opening up but by the end I loved his character. Julie Garwood did that very well. You could see him changing his thinking and it was great. I love books where you really feel like you get to know the characters and I so got that from this book. This is a very sweet story and I would suggest reading it when you feel the need to...sigh.Chrissy"},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"I'm not a reader of romance novels, but recently one of my good friends, who reads widely in that genre, said that I must sample what she considers to be the cream of the crop in romance. Reluctantly I paged through the several novels she lent me, and Saving Grace turned out to be the only one I could finish. I found it really enjoyable.What drew me in at first was that the hero, Gabriel, and the heroine, Johanna, are not good-looking, empty-minded twits who come together for the sake of the plot. Despite the fact that both are beautiful people, their looks aren't belabored... it's plain to us that it's their characters that hold the key attraction. What begins as a marriage of convenience, blossoms into a relationship of trust, respect, and ultimately love. They bring out the best in each other and each is nourished by the unique strengths of the other.As the hero, Gabriel is great. Sure he's gruff, and likes to grumble and shout, but as the heroine realizes very early on, he's just a big softy; it's an amusing moment in the book when she likens him to his pet dog - growls a lot, but really just wants to be petted and scratched behind the ears. He's honorable and loyal (would defend his wife at the drop of a pin), and despite all his bluster about how a wife should listen to her husband, he swells with admiration each time his wife shows him spirit and gives him sass, and he supports her various clever initiatives in improving clan life (so long as she doesn't place herself in harm's way, of course... he's terribly overprotective). Despite a professed inability to figure out women, and his repeated claims that warriors don't know anything about matters of the heart, from the onset he makes sincere efforts at knowing his wife's thoughts and feelings, even as he's confused by his own. When he learns at the start of the novel that she has been abused in her first marriage, he makes sure to always behave gently, tries his best to always be patient, and - on those occasions when he does tear his hair out in frustration - gives her repeated assurances that for all his barking he has no bite. Also refreshing - when he realizes that what he feels for his wife is deep and abiding love, he doesn't fight the vulnerable feeling, but tries to figure out how to make her feel the same way; he doesn't want to be mushy-hearted on his own.Johanna starts off a bit on the timid side (which, given her age and her first marriage, is understandable), but even from the start she shows pluck. And once she settles in with her new husband and realizes that he's a good man who would sooner kill himself than harm a hair on her head, her confidence continues to grow and she thrives, becoming a commanding and remarkable woman. She has very appealing traits for a heroine - strength of character, great warm-heartedness (particularly for people who are weaker and undefended), and great force of spirit and cleverness; it's no wonder that within a few short months of marriage, her husband is eating out of her hand. Garwood writes her transition in her new home very well, how she breaks out of her old mentality of guardedness and fear and gains the respect and admiration of all the people in her clan.Aside from two very appealing main characters, what makes the novel a good read is that it isn't written melodramatically or in an overwrought fashion. Though some of the writing and the plot twists are a little cliche, I really didn't care. Garwood writes with a great deal of wryness and humor, so that when truly emotional moments do come, the reader feels their power all the more. The light touch in the writing is great, and there are many very unexpected moments and bits of dialogue - another refreshing facet of Saving Grace that readers will appreciate. The hero and heroine actually have intelligent discussions and banter wittily (though they don't always intend to be funny).A satisfying read. I enjoyed the time I spent reading it, and if there's any romance novel I would recommend to someone wanting to get a taste of the romance genre, this would be it."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"I really started out hating this book. A timid, shy, cowardly Johanna is basically forced to marry an extremely arrogant and egotistical Gabriel? And they both stay that way for most of the book! What the?!? When I started I honestly didn't think that I would get past the first 100 pages, but was I wrong!!!In most books the shy heroine turns into a courageous woman in a few pages. Not here. Her's and his transformation is very subtle. That's the point. It sort of catches you by surprise. You can't expect a woman who has been physically abused into submission to become a warrior overnight and you can't expect a man to soften his stance rightaway either, so it takes most of the book. Johanna bungles her way trying to find her place amoung the people with a bit of humor and Gabriel remains steadfast against any changes and violations against his orders. Then all of a sudden things turn one by one. You can see how Johanna is gaining the trust of her people, even though she's an english woman married to a highlander larid. The chemistry is fantastic, but again not in the usual way. There's no complements or declarations of love through most of the book, but its obvious they love eachother. He doesn't hurt/rape her or keep a mistress (ARGH! I hate those kind of books!)I tell you this, you WON'T be able to put the last 100 pages of this book down! The ending is romantic and contains some surprises as well. I agree with the other reviews -sigh- if only a sequel!If you loved The Bride (another 5 stars), you'll love this one. Just STICK IT OUT! The ending is worth it!!!!Oh, and yeah there's plenty of love scenes!"},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"This is one of the best --- if not the best --- books by Julie Garwood that I have ever read.Gabriel MacBain, the hero of this story, was not just another prototype of what I deem to be &quot;the Garwood hero,&quot; though there were a few things in common. He never tried to change his wife, and was honest with her when it came to the important issues. He had no qualms about falling in love with her; he didn't even go through the stage of denial that most of Julie Garwood's characters from other books went through.Johanna, the wife &amp; another protagonist, was empowering. She believed she deserved to be treated well though people tried to bring her down. She was also devoted to her husband without being a doormat.The book was laced with lots of humor. I found myself laughing over it, and rereading certain pages. What made some parts really funny was that they were believable.The plot was also no weakling. One never guesses what is about to happen next, but I'm not going to give too many hints, or I'll spoil the book (like some of the other reviews did for me). Even if you do learn some of the tidbits that would have been better found out when reading the book, it's still a great read! Buy it...soon."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"This is one of the best books Julie Garwood has written. The heroine is strong and intelligent. The hero is kind and proud. He does not treat her like a silly female and then fall in love with her for no real reason. Julie writes about characters we can grow to love and cherish. By the end of the book, I felt Joanna was a friend. Hopefully Julie will write about the young son, just so we can see how the rest of their lives turned out. This book is also empowering because it reminds women of how far we can come in this world and what we can acheive when we believe in ourselves. Joanna suffers from unspeakable abuses, but fights to live. That's a lesson we all need to learn."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"Gabriel and Johanna's love story is wonderful. Gabriel is a hard Scottish Laird who agrees to marry Lady Johanna who is from England. Johanna has already been married once before and her husband was cruel and she is therefore unsure about this joining. Gabriel and Johanna both teach each other the value of love and trust. This is a book that you should not miss. It made me laugh, and cry. Julie Garwood has done it again"},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"I bought this book when I was 18 years old as something to read on the plane when going to visit family. I stayed awake for the whole flight reading and was annoyed when anyone tried to interrupt me, I was so involved with my story! This was the book that started my love of romance. Once I finished this wonderful story I felt sad and lost to be leaving the world of Gabriele and Johanna. This of course prompted me to start buying all of Julie Garwoods other books at an alarming rate. Because of this book, I became an Amazon book buying junkie!This book was a full and wonderful story of hope, fear, love, strength, growth, and passion. I was invested in the the characters and laughed and cried right along side of them. Julie Garwod writes amazing stories and I can say that I have loved most of them, but this book will always hold a special spot for me as my first. Because of how great this book was, I discovered so many other great love stories that were full of heart and fun. And over the years (we'll just say it's been more than 10) I've read this story again and again and still love it as much as I did the first time."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"I love this book, it is my first romance novel ever. I can still remember when I was a teenager finding it in the small campus book store when I was visiting a nearby university. However, I've had issues with obtaining this book in e format. I bought one copy from allromance ebooks and it was not the right book--rather another with the same title by a different author when I downloaded it. So when I opened this book on my kindle and the first page it opened to read \\"The first time she slit a man's throat she felt sick to her stomach\\" I felt sick to my stomach and rushed to find out how to return this book. I couldn't believe it happened again! Before I wrote Amazon I wanted to include what the title was of the book I received, to see if it was the same one. When I went backwards on the device I realized that this was a sneak peak of the author's new book--which for some reason the kindle is set to open on the excerpt, not the title page, or even the page offering to let the reader skip the page.So I felt stupid, especially because I have read the new book the excerpt was from! But learn from my fail!"},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"I was disappointed because from the reviews I read here, I thought it might be similar, if not better than \\"Ransom\\". Well, in my opinion it did not even come close to \\"Ransom\\". I did not connect to any of the characters in the story. Lady Johanna did not have any endearing qualities about her that I found to my liking or that convinced me as to why Gabriel would fall in love with her or have his men and people worship her. To me she seemed like any ordinary woman. I thought the story choppy and did not flow as easily as \\"Ransom\\". If I don't end this review now, it just might end up being another review of \\"Ransom\\"."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"I loved this book! It is one of my favourite Julie Garwood novels, others have already done the plot and I agree that yes she was timid but really who wouldn't be when she had learned terror at the hands of her first husband. I fell in love with Gabriel with the one line \\"I will find his weakness, every man has one\\" Johanna \\"what's yours? Gabriel \\"you\\" how could you not melt with that? secondary characters come into play and they are enjoyable and when the whole clan comes to saver was gold."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"I'm definitely a Julie Garwood fan and this book will always be my favorite. Johanna and Gabriel are my favorite characters of all her books. This is a MUST READ if you love romance. I especially liked the part where Gabriel realized he was in love with Johanna and decided he was going to have to make her fall in love with him in return and the homecoming was sweet. The ending of this book was excellent and very fitting. It couldn't have been written any better than it was. I highly recommend this book. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"A smooth writing stile that combines humor, action, historical fact, treachery, passionate love and the quite everyday moments of life makes this a wonderfully romantic and memorable story.At first Johanna was shy, but as Gabriel tenderly revealed the splendid pleasures they would share, she came to suspect that she was falling in love with her gruff new husband. And it was soon obvious to the entire highlands clan that their laird had surrended his heart completely. But could The King of England and the memory of Johanna's first husband tear them apart?"},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"I have read Saving Grace twice now. Both times made me smile and captured my heart. The loyalty of the people around the central characters and the humor was just great. Reading about people who are so capable of opening their hearts for the sheer generosity of it is inspiring. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves love."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"I love Julie Garwood stories, because every now and again its nice to read about herioines who are not trying to rule the world. Saving Grace is another one of JG's best. Her heroines are petite, funny, and full of spirit. While the heroes are big,handsome and oh so considerate. If you enjoyed this, you will definetly love Honor's Splendor."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"I thought that this book was poorly written. The main character, Johanna, is just not interesting. She is a weak, timid mess. And her displays of &quot;strength&quot; in the book are a joke. The hero, Gabriel, also dull. Also, the constant harping by the author on the hierarchy in heaven and earth was tiresome. This is the first book by Julie Garwood that I have read and will probably be the last. The author just didn't capture my interest. If you feel you must read this book, I would check the library first for it and save my money for a better book by a better author."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"I don't know why most of you are jumping for joy because this books it the best. IT'S THE SAME OLD THING. Julie Garwood always write beautiful women that seems so innocent but actually dumb. I don't like the way she potrays that everyone hots for the leading lady. The guy didn't really fell in love with her! He fell in love with her beauty and body. What if she was ugly? Would he still love her? Gabriel seems so amused and fascinated. By what? By a girl who'se so beautiful and innocent at the same time. Saving Grace is the same old thing. There is no love at all. There is only lust. :( I'm dissapointed at this book and I wish Mrs. Garwood would at least write one love story that the girl isn't that perfect."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"i had read rave reviews for this book and thought that it would be on par with all the other amazing books i have read over the past few years. however i found this book to be poorly written and the characters had very little chemistry. the best parts of the whole book were the humourous ones and there were very few at that. i much rather prefer authors like lisa kleypas or gaelen foley whose stories have sizzling characters, heart-wrenching stories and also a believable by-plot. however i will say that the protectiveness that gabriel feels over johanna is slightly cute."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"I will admit that I have read this book at least 15 times and I enjoyed it every time. I cried with Johanna though all her trails and I laughed with her through all her triumphs. I fell head over heels in love with the McBain,who could resista man who wants you to rest? Not me.. This book get better and better with each page. I hope that every one read this treffic and delightful book."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"This is a delightful addition to Garwood's expanse of five-star romances. It is very interesting to watch how the leading lady (Lady Johanna) develops her own strength and courage and of course that is brought along by the leading man. I am an avid lover of any book that is put in Scotland. The Scots do have a way of making a lady burn and think naughty things, especially with those sexy kilts.This book is a must-read and I know you will enjoy as much as I did. Read it."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"In my opinion, Julie Garwood's &quot;Saving Grace&quot; is her best novel. It is so full of emotion, that it's hard to put it down. I am a big historical romance fan, and this one seemed to have it all. It is definately a keeper."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"This is the best of the best. I have read it too many times to count. The relationships and interactions between all characters were amazing and spellbinding. I loved in the end when Johanna said &quot;My clan's my family and each one of us would die to keep the others safe.&quot;. I recommend this to everyone I know who has been in an unbearable situation and triumph over it."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"This novel was so beautiful...as soon as I turned to the first page, I was enthralled.

This is my favorite by Garwood. I read it over and over again. I have almost every scene and piece of dialoge memorized.

I love it!"},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"This is one of my favorite books by Julie Garwood. A love story so charming and tender it took my breath away. I rejoiced with their triumphs and I cried with their pain. This book belongs on my &quot;hands off&quot; shelf."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"Maybe I've become cynical with age, but these days I tend to read the negative reader comments and evaluate a book by many of them before buying. But I'm so glad I decided to go ahead and buy this despite comments on how Johanna was \\"weak\\" and \\"timid\\" and how Gabriel was \\"cold\\" and \\"downright mean\\".Seriously? Did we read the same book? I liked how Johanna went from timid (as a result of years of physical and mental abuse by her first husband) to being strong enough to stand up to her laird husband. And given the time setting of the book, I totally understand, and rather expect, a bit of high-handed, I-know-what's-best-for-you attitude at first from the male lead. If you're looking for women's lib and male-female equal partnership roles in life/marriage (at least at the beginning) from a story, you're reading about the wrong era here - it's just not historically accurate. I like how Johanna became stronger without getting to be absolutely (and unbelievably) unconventional. And how Gabriel, though worrying as any protective husband would, came to trust her to handle things her way in many cases.My only complaint, and this runs through all Julie Garwood books I have read, is her use of the term \\"sexy\\" when describing love-scenes. Seriously, \\"sexy moan\\" or \\"sexy little mouth\\" does NOT sound pre-20th century (since I'm talking here about many of her historical romances spanning different time frames). It delivers a time-inappropriate jarring in the middle of a nicely flowing story. Please Ms. Garwood, find another word to use instead!"},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"Reviewed at Another Look Book ReviewsI put up both covers of Saving Grace because I have both books. Julie Garwood books are so timeless. The cover may change and age but her stories go on and on regardless of the decade.I have a stack of Julie Garwood books on my shelf. I haven't read them all yet. I try to pace myself because I just love them so much that I don't want to run out of her historicals. Sadly this depletion is the case. I only have a few left that I haven't read. I save them for when I am in a \\"Julie Garwood mood\\". I just finished up a week of excellent contemporary romance books by Jill Shalvis and then I dove right into a sexy erotic cowboy book by Lorelei James. I was due to be whisked way back in time to 1206.The Prologue (love Garwood's Prologues) of Saving Grace starts the reader out with the proper frame of mind. Only a few pages into Saving Grace and it was revealed that a Holy Bishop Hallwick's teachings dictate that women are so low on the \\"God's Love Hierarchy\\" that even a dull-witted ox is placed above women. So going into chapter one, you can guess my frame of mind.Then you are introduced to Johanna. You take pity on the poor thing as she was forced into a marriage barely into her teen years and her not so gentle husband abused her. As you can imagine, Johanna was timid and very fearful. Even with her heartbreaking back ground, you get the sense through her brave actions that she is cunning and if given the chance, she would shine.What I particularly liked about Saving Grace is how I could literally see the growth of the characters. In regards to Johanna, Saving Grace starts out with her struggling just to maintain eye level glances with the Laird MacBain and slowly you read about her growing and becoming more confident. I had a sense of pride towards her on more than a few occasions.The Laird MacBain was taken with Johanna literally on the day he met and married her. (Oh yes, it was a very quick wedding to solidify the match). He handled Johanna with gentle touches and at times he was afraid she would break. It did get annoying to constantly hear him dictate that she needed to rest even when she was just getting out of bed in the morning. His world of wedded expectation for a wife was to get up, not go outside and then sit in front of a fire and sew all day. Poor silly man didn't really know what hit it him when he finally figured out how much he ended up loving Johanna.There was an abundant of humourous moments, a few courageous rescues and with lots and lots of love I found Saving Grace a very enjoyable read that will satisfy me until I reach for my next Julie Garwood.Teasers: wolf fight, barbarians learning manners, plaid merger, Holy redemption"},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"Love Garwood's historicals.There are no surprises here. The English heroine is unbelievably beautiful, the Scottish hero is an unparalleled warrior, and they will successfully overcome a brutish villain en route to living happily ever after. (And because it's Garwood, none of it will be too ugly). But along the way, you will laugh and cry and generally have a good time."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"I won't tire anybody who takes the time to read these few lines with a summary of the book since others have done so before me much better than I ever could.This is a typical Garwood-book: the main characters are complex, interesting and likeable. The secondary characters support the plot perfectly. The plot is straight forward and entertaining, the description of the scenery full of atmosphere. Just the right stuff to curl up on the couch and to be transported right into the book.There were just two points that I would have elaborated differently: at a point towards the end of the book Gabriel told Johanna that Nicolas sent her to him because he was developing more than brotherly feeling for her. I would have enjoyed more insights and details on this than just this very short explanation.Another point was the meeting between Raulph and Johanna, where I surely liked how she defended Gabriel but completely missed the fact that she didn't mention anything about his obvious barrenness. Yes, Johanna explained why she handled the situation in the way she did, which was absolutely reasonable, however, this fact was presented as a serious issue against Johanna and I just think that it deserved some kind of \\"revenge\\".But as always this is just my very humble personal opinion. In any case, this is a very recommendable book."},{"Title":"Saving Grace","review":"I won't bore you by repeating everything everyone else said so I'll just say that I read it in one sitting thought the story and characters were strong although lots of things weren't credible for that period of time but hey it was entertaining and I got it for free.

Saving Grace wasn't bad by any means, it just didn't grab me like some of her other books. I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but I felt like it dragged in many parts until about 3/4 of the way through.

Also contains some good basic information on cavity pressing and striking methods. I have read several of Dr. Yang's books on Qin Na and Taijiquan and they are all worth the price tag. Definately not just for instructors."},{"Title":"Analysis of Shaolin Chin Na: Instructors Manual for All Martial Styles","review":"I believe that medium of a book form has certain limitations when it comes to explaining moving actions such as chin na techniques.

For those not familiar with Chin Na, it is one of the four major fighting categories in Chinese martial arts. The four categories are kicking, striking, wrestling, and seize-controlling. Chin Na can be called the art of seize and control, and it consists of various joint locking techniques, as well as different grabbing, pressing, and striking.Just like joint locks are only a portion of the Hapkido curriculum I teach, Chin Na is only a portion of Chinese arts. With that said, the concepts and techniques can be learned and incorporated into other styles, especially those that are already familiar with locking techniques such as practitioners of Hapkido, Aikido, Jujitsu, and so forth. Therefore, this book can benefit many martial artists, not just those who study Chinese arts. If your style does not include locking type techniques, Chin Na resources, including this book, can assist you in rounding out your program.After a short Foreword and two short Prefaces (original and new one for second edition), there is a general introduction to Chin Na and the basic principles. Next comes a chapter that focuses on fundamental training. A variety of exercises are illustrated and explained that will enable a practitioner to better perform Chin Na techniques.The next few chapters are divided by the type of Chin Na explained in them. They consist of Finger Chin Na; Wrist Chin Na; Elbow Chin Na; Shoulder, Neck and Waist Chin Na, Leg Chin Na; Muscle Grabbing Chin Na; Cavity Press; and then a short chapter on using Chin Na in a fight, and another on the treatment of injuries. The book then concludes with a two-paragraph conclusion and several appendixes.There are numerous techniques in this book (The back cover says over 150), and each one has a description of how to do the technique, with accompanying photographs, the principle behind the technique pointed out, and a description with photos of an escape and counter to the technique. I especially liked that these escapes and counters were included. I felt these added much value to the collection of information, especially as an instructor resource. The pictures are black and white, and sometimes a little difficult to fully discern what is being done. If you are apt at joint locking techniques, you can most likely figure it out. However, if you are a novice, you might have a little trouble with some of them. To remedy this, you could pick up Dr. Yang's DVDs to see the techniques performed. In fact, I'd encourage anyone to complete their Chin Na resource library by including both the books and DVDs Dr. Yang has put out. Using them together make for a much better learning experience.The chapter on using Chin Na in a fight is pretty short. There are two pages of good concepts, and then a small sampling of concepts and techniques illustrated with photographs. Dr. Yang admits this is just a tiny sample, but points out that he included more in his book \\"Comprehensive Applications of Shaolin Chin Na.\\" I have not read that book yet, but it is on my list. Like the applications chapter, the treatment of injuries chapter is also short. You won't be a competent healer from this chapter, but it gives some general information and hopefully peaks your interest to further your study in the healing arts as well as the fighting arts. They go hand in hand.Overall, this is an exceptional manual to help a person learn Chin Na, and I recommend it highly, as I do all of Dr. Yang's cannon of Chin Na resources.Reviewed by Alain Burrese, J.D., author of the Lock On Joint Locking Essentials series."},{"Title":"Analysis of Shaolin Chin Na: Instructors Manual for All Martial Styles","review":"This is THE best book on Chin Na.

No matter which style you practice, joint locks and submission holds can be easily incorporated, and I would argue could make the difference if you are ever involved in a real conflict. Where these skills are often not taught, it may be up to you to seek them out and this is a great introduction. If you're going to start practicing Chin Na, my only advice, and please heed it: be soft and take it easy. I'm serious, this stuff is the real deal and highly effective. If you use too much force you will cause real and lasting injuries. Also highly recommended are Dr. Yang's complementary Chin Na DVDs, for exampleAdvanced Practical Chin Na In Depth: YMAA Seminar Serieswhere you can see the fluid nature of these moves in action."},{"Title":"Analysis of Shaolin Chin Na: Instructors Manual for All Martial Styles","review":"I have taken a few self defense classes and this book contains some familiar moves. It was helpful to have the photos so well done to show each move as it progresses, and the instructions were very well written.

I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for easy to learn, practical instruction on self defense."},{"Title":"Analysis of Shaolin Chin Na: Instructors Manual for All Martial Styles","review":"I'm a big fan of Dr. Yang's books and this one is certainly a great one. I practice Tai Chi and had already read his book \\"Tai Chi Chin Na\\". That's another great book which focuses on the diverse applications of Chin Na in the Yang style's old form. However as the author himself points out there is a great depth of additional knowledge in Chin Na which he could not include in that book, and he therefore recommended picking up his other Chin Na books to deepen the reader's understanding of Chin Na. This book does an excellent job doing just that. Regardless of which style of martial you practice the biomechanical principles remain the same and most, if not all, can easily be adapted for your style. My only issue with YMAA publications is that my personal budget is limited and their books are all a bit pricey, but I can definitely say that this book is worth the price."},{"Title":"Analysis of Shaolin Chin Na: Instructors Manual for All Martial Styles","review":"This is an excellent volume.

The book is a good reference for training activity. It is has scientific treatment of the concepts and techniques. It is comprehensive. But ... Caution .. do not use this book to learn this yourself if you are a novice. It may hurt someone else drastically or fatally OR you may injure yourself. An instructor is always necessary to learn any form of Martical Arts. Chin Na is no exception.I am a good Martial Artist myself and I found this book of immense value."},{"Title":"Analysis of Shaolin Chin Na: Instructors Manual for All Martial Styles","review":"This book is highly informative and I feel the author has done a superb job of trying to translate what is an inherently complex topic into written form. Be prepared to have to experiment for a while with several of the techniques to get the correct feel. I like how the author catagorizes the techniques by finger, wrist. elbow, etc. As a former Aikido practioner, I will tell you, IMHO this book shows the depth and complexity of the Chinese arts. All in all, a great effort!"},{"Title":"Analysis of Shaolin Chin Na: Instructors Manual for All Martial Styles","review":"Only an 8 because I do not know if I've read enough of these to know what a 10 would be. Concise, clearly written, with illustrations that provide sufficient information to follow the text. This probably should not be for beginners or those who've not had some exposure to chin na in class; for others, this will be an excellent out-of-class handbook to continue research/practice. An excellent (9 or 10) video is available."},{"Title":"Analysis of Shaolin Chin Na: Instructors Manual for All Martial Styles","review":"I am a teacher of Yoshinkan Aikido with 30 years of training in various martial arts, including Taichi and now Chin Na.

I am also trying to collect as much of his works as I can.I found this book to be an excellent resource in my Chin Na studies and to help learn the techniques I am learning from the students of Chin Na and on the YMAA DVDs that I own.But, as the title suggests, this is for ALL styles.I am always looking at how martial arts are inter-related and share common techniques and principles.

The photographs and explanations are spot on, and as an all round martial artist I find this book invaluable"},{"Title":"Analysis of Shaolin Chin Na: Instructors Manual for All Martial Styles","review":"good book. Not for beginers. Hard to read. Useful if experienced"},{"Title":"Analysis of Shaolin Chin Na: Instructors Manual for All Martial Styles","review":"As the title of this fantastic tome describes, this material really is applicable to all styles. I primarily study Goju Ryu, an Okinawan form of karate that, while somewhat influenced by Chinese kung fu historically, is much closer to Japanese martial arts then it is to any of the Chinese styles. Regardless, while the terminology is a little different, the principles and techniques herein are directly applicable to my art as well kung fu, aikido, jujitsu, and many others.Chin Na is the art of controlling an opponent, a practical and important skill. It is relevant to striking arts as well as grappling arts. Dr. Yang Jwing-Ming covers joint locking, vein/artery sealing, muscle dividing, and bone displacing in a comprehensive and easy to understand manner. His vast experience really shines throughout this outstanding work. He also offers an excellent series of exercises for strengthening the joints to protect them from damage as you integrate these techniques into your training regimen.Applications include finger, wrist, elbow, shoulder, neck, waist, and leg manipulations, along with muscle grabbing and cavity press (pressure point) techniques. He also discusses how to use Chin Na in a real fight, including defense against knives, kicks, and punches. One of the most unique and important aspects of this book is the section on injury treatment which covers joint, ligament, cartilage, muscle, and tendon injuries, artery, capillary, as well as organ ruptures, sealed breath veins/artery in the neck, and even \\"stagnant\\" chi (ki). This section isn't particularly long but it is very insightful. There is also an appendix on Chinese herbs.Dr. Yang Jwing-Ming is a prolific author as well as one of the world's foremost kung fu experts. Highly skilled in Shaolin White Crane (Bai He), Shaolin Long Fist (Changquan), and Taijiquan and other forms, he has spent more than thirty years teaching his art to others. He has published 35 books and 75 videos on the martial arts. Dr. Yang is currently president of Yang's Oriental Arts Association headquartered in Boston, MA.Lawrence KaneAuthor of Surviving Armed Assaults, The Way of Kata, and Martial Arts Instruction"},{"Title":"Analysis of Shaolin Chin Na: Instructors Manual for All Martial Styles","review":"This book provides a good reference for Chin-Na, the art of seizing and holding. Most of the techniques that appear in this book appear to come from Dr. Yang Jwing-Ming's White Crane background.Chin-Na can be deceptively difficult to understand and implement, since what makes a technique successful is the solid body mechanics behind it, and that only comes after years of practice. Additionally, I believe that books are not a good primary learning method for martial arts, so to get the most from this book, plan on attending a seminar or finding a good local school.Having said that, Dr. Yang's material is the best reference I've seen on the subject."},{"Title":"Analysis of Shaolin Chin Na: Instructors Manual for All Martial Styles","review":"This is a good introductory work with a useful organization scheme since it is done by areas of the body.The methods are simplified, but then it would probably be impossible to do a book on truly complex Chin Na techniques. For that you would probably need a video.Nevetheless, I am a big believer in using the simplest, most effective techniques. The way to use a book like this, is to learn the most applicable, versatile techniques, perhaps no more than a couple of dozen or so (unless Chin Na is a specialty of yours). Remember, in the 1400s even a great Jiu-Jitsu master might only know a few moves--but he could apply them to an amazing variety of situations with great speed and effectiveness.Although Chin Na is one of my specialties, I think the same thing applies to the other grappling arts, Chin Na and Aikido."},{"Title":"Analysis of Shaolin Chin Na: Instructors Manual for All Martial Styles","review":"I hate giving five stars to a book on just one subject, but this one deserves it. It covers the principles of chin-na in great detail first, then goes into about every possable joint technique imaginable. This is mostly stand-up stuff, so it isn't really geared towards MMA, though it could be useful. Rather, this is about controling your opponent in a stand-up situation, and shows techniques applied both offensivley and defensively. In addition, at the end of every technique, an escape or counter is shown. Also covered are training methods for gripping/forearm power, speed in seizing, some footwork, and stretching out the ligaments. But standing submissions aren't the only techniques shown. Most of Dr. Yang's &quot;Leg Chin Na&quot; techniques are takedowns, and a lot of the &quot;Cavity Press&quot; stuff is strikes to pressure points. The author also covers basic first-aid principles of injuries commonly caused by chin-na. The only detraction I have to make was that I wish the chapter on using chin-na in a fight was more extensive. This book was easy to follow, and someone with no experiance with grappling could learn something. I would say it is most useful for someone interested in minimum-damage self defense, like a cop or bouncer, but it's a good reference for any martial artist. A note on the author: Yang, Jwing-Ming is, to me, the best author when it comes to practicle Chinese martial arts. I am a big fan of Dr. Yang's books, but until I read a better one, I will consider this his masterpiece."},{"Title":"Analysis of Shaolin Chin Na: Instructors Manual for All Martial Styles","review":"A very complete follow up to Dr. Yang's first book, &quot;Shaolin Chin Na: The Seizing Art of Kung Fu&quot;, I consider this manual to be complex enough that it will probably be best understood by peole who have studied a grappling/locking art of some sort for at least a year (Kuk Sool, Jujutsu, Shuai Jiao). Like most of Yang's other books, there is so much information here it borders on being exhaustive...and we all know that is not a bad thing!Yang explains the principles of Chin Na, and builds upon this foundation by offering strengthening exercises for joints which often bear the brunt of punishment in this type of training. His treatment of techniques is thourough. Those with the patience to read this manual and practice the locking and siezing techniques contained within will undoubtedly gain further insight to the workings of their (respective) arts. Yang also offers an important chapter (page 168) on correcting injuries sustained in practice, in addition to six special herbal formulas for martial arts training (bruise remedies, dit Da Jau, etc.) at the end of the volume (page 185)."},{"Title":"Analysis of Shaolin Chin Na: Instructors Manual for All Martial Styles","review":"Comprehensive review. However, like this author's other books, hard to read. Best used as a reference for someone with martial arts experience, or when practicing with a partner. To really gain competence in this area, it is necessary to have a teacher. Although his later book, &quot;Comprehensive Chin Na&quot; is more complete, this has the advantage of being organized by areas of the body on which the moves are applied. It also contains counters."},{"Title":"Analysis of Shaolin Chin Na: Instructors Manual for All Martial Styles","review":"I bought this book a couple months ago and I was pretty impressed. Not only does it cover plenty of Chin Na techniques (and even the rarer finger chin na), but also counters for them. Of course these counters are not set and once an understanding of chin na and human anatomy is understood one can employ various different methods for both grappling and countering. Also, he explains alot of the Dim Mak methods and techniques (not in great detail as it is one of the most dangerous aspects of advanced kung fu), but just enough so you know whats out there and how dangerous it is, including the rupturing of the internal organs (or even death) through concentrated chi strikes with fingers. He also shows some cavity grabs.This is not every Chin Na technique imaginable as someone said, In fact the only con of the book is that Ming mostly shows (if not all) White crane Chin Na, which is why there is so much complicated coiling in his pictures and techniques he shows. They are not always very practical and should not even be practiced until one has been taught the funndamentals of SHaolin Chin Na by a qualified instructor. I dont know about the practical applications book (which I saw, and it is alot thicker and has ALOT more than this one), but there are many different more practical styles of Chin Na. Most notable and VERY powerful are the Eagle Claw( which is pretty much all Chin Na) and Tiger Claw. Nevertheless, this is one of the only books like this, and Ming is an amazing kung fu practicioner."},{"Title":"Analysis of Shaolin Chin Na: Instructors Manual for All Martial Styles","review":"Bob SpearPublisher and Chief ReviewerHeartland ReviewsThe author, Dr. Yang, a physicist with a doctorate from Purdue University, one of the tougher engineering schools in the nation, is also considered one of the top trainers and theoreticians of Chinese martial arts in the world. An author of over thirty books, Inside Kung Fu Magazine voted him as one of the ten people who have made the greatest impact on the martial arts in the past 100 years. He brings all his expertise to his latest book on the Chinese grappling and nerve pressure point martial art of Chin Na. This style is the ancestor of Japanese Jujitsu and Aikido, as well as the Korean art of Hapkido.The author's scientific education comes to the forefront of his technique presentations and explanations. This is a book for true aficionados, those who have delved deeply into the arts and yet have more to learn. He is able to bridge the conceptual gap between Eastern allegorical terms and concepts to American English and scientific understanding. The section on striking and pressure points was a true eye opener. His contribution to the Western world's understanding of the Eastern one is fantastic.

It used to be, that enlightening experiences were rarely ever shared, and certainly not spoken of so openly and honestly, let alone published. However, after reading the reviews herein, I was astonished to realize that no one picked up on several facts so candidly expressed by Ms. Segal.First of all, it is obvious to this former meditation instructor that Ms. Segal was born into this life with a strong conscious connection to her soul and the dharma of a seasoned yogi. (Anyone who sits in meditation daily at age 7 chanting their name inwardly as a mantra is indeed a person with much spiritual groundwork already covered.)Second, her fianc&eacute; jilted her at a time when she was most vulnerable. This, during the second six-month-long meditation retreat they both attended in Europe under the auspices of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the first Indian Master to bring Transcendental Meditation to the West. I believe being jilted would undo any good woman; but under these extraordinary circumstances, I can tell you from experience, everything in ones' life is magnified during a retreat of this nature.When in this space one becomes very \\"soft\\". Meaning, hyper-sensitive to even the most mundane things and the subtlest thought-forms. This is why it is most important to seclude oneself from the outside world, entirely released from responsibility and be with those of like intent as much as possible. Maharishi's retreats are specifically designed for huge chunks of karma (accumulated stress) to fall away in order to create \\"emptiness\\"; a space for the light to fill. Oftentimes, the out-picturing of this is not always pleasant, to say the least. Ms. Segal was quite young at the time this happened and I believe, due to her naivet&eacute;, was not prepared for the repercussions which appeared to have left a deep, enduring wound in her psyche.During retreats, there is always this anticipation on behalf of the meditator to have a great illuminating, epiphany: one specific event that shouts \\"enlightenment, at last\\"! More often than not, though, like Ms. Segal, there is a certain amount of disappointment and sense of inadequacy encountered in the wake of this. I used to remind those I was honored to assist that, just because something incredible fails to occur, it does not mean there was not any movement nor ones' goal not met. It all depends on the soul and its own cosmic time-table. None of us can really know the details in this regard; that is, until we put aside all attachment to the outcome of all our endeavors, spiritual or not. In fact, one eventually arrives at the point where there is no difference between the spiritual and the mundane: in short, the spiritualization of matter.With regard to extraordinary experiences, an Indian guru once told me, \\"...it comes to whom it comes to\\" and his comment has proved a great comfort to me and many others to realize there appears to be no rhyme or reason. We may have an inkling, but most likely, the experiences we have take many years to integrate. It is usually in retrospect that one sees the perfection of all experiences and is truly able to \\"see things just as they are\\", as the Buddha taught.After Ms. Segal's \\"bus stop hit\\" (which by the way, took place 6 years after the retreats and during which time she had ceased meditating), she had no idea what happened to her. I also find it so astounding that \\"fear\\" was her constant companion after this and that she did not simply allow herself to go into it, particularly in light of her intensive meditation training. In fact, it took her 12 years to sort this out after lengthy and varied psychotherapy only to find the answers she sought in Buddhist texts. Then found relief, only to realize that what she had been seeking, she'd possessed all along. Once realized, she was truly free and able to experience real joy for the first time in her life.Her account brings to mind Dorothy in \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" where Glenda the Good Witch tells her, \\"...but my dear, you've had the power to go home all along!\\" Life is like that. Each of us has all we ever need, right now, in this moment. All that is required of us is to realize that there is nowhere to go and nothing to gain: We are It.All in all, Ms. Segal's biography is a fascinating and riveting; though a bit contradictory with regard to the value she places on spiritual practice. Quite simply, the tale of a contemporary mystic immersed in the challenges of a modern world. Read up for a glimpse of things to come, because I've a feeling this and many more similar experiences are in store for more of us than ever before in our planet's history....."},{"Title":"Collision with the Infinite: A Life Beyond the Personal Self","review":"Suzanne Segal's extraordinary story of her experience of the instantaneous and total loss of her &quot;self&quot; is simply fascinating, and should be read by anyone blessed or cursed to find themselves wandering the incomprehensible and often bleak terrains of the varieties of spiritual undoing. Her style is beautifully straightforward, lucid, and generous, without affectation. In her matter-of-fact at-homeness with the most extraordinary conditions of consciousness, she is similar to Bernadette Roberts, whose own books on the no-self experience are the best I've ever encountered. This book has distinct weaknesses--Segal's final insistence on the irrelevance of spiritual practices rings a little strange in the light of her own years of intense meditation practice that preceded her catapulting into the land of no-self, and her failure to consider more fully the relationship between her history and the apparently spontaneous dawning of the no-self state strikes me as unsatisfying. And the book's somewhat sketchy epilogue clearly raises more--and fascinating--questions than it answers. The early death of this extraordinary woman is heartbreaking; how marvelous it would have been to see where her further development led her. But as it is, she has left us a precious gift in this memoir, like a note from a previous climber, high up on a frigid mountain, pointing the way ahead."},{"Title":"Collision with the Infinite: A Life Beyond the Personal Self","review":"This memoir offers some insight on how one might interiorly feel about having no sense of personal self or ego. This near legendary state of some advanced contemplative is here given an autobiographical setting. It is important for its hints of psychological insights but even more revealing as an historic document to show how difficult such states are in the context of current spiritual culture. This an extraordinary account of the experience of selflessness points to the heart of spiritual experience that is fully gifted and not an achievement of practice as self-control. The simplicity of the narrative and its reasonable honesty provides an illuminating account of one woman's experience of loss of personal identity and constant sense of Emptiness. Her eventual discovery, after much fear and pain, the emptiness become a calm entrance to unity and peace. Segal's opinions in COLLISION WITH THE INFINITE will also poke holes in the work-ethic of Buddhist practice and other forms of spiritual go-gettering. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Collision with the Infinite: A Life Beyond the Personal Self","review":"I agree with the previous reviewer that this book offers an interesting description of the spiritual experience of having &quot;no-self&quot; but isn't a particularly inspiring read. What was confusing though is that in the introduction we're asked to transcend viewing Suzanne's experiences pathologically, but in the epilogue she herself sees that she has been dissociated due to childhood sexual abuse. Why ask us to suspend a pathological interpretation only to invite us back to that interpretation at the end?"},{"Title":"Collision with the Infinite: A Life Beyond the Personal Self","review":"I woke up at 4 in the morning and I decided that, rather than complain about my unintentional wakefulness, I would embrace it and see what happens. How perfect that I decided to reach for Collision with the Infinite, the story of an American woman who, during the un-enlightening act of stepping on a bus in France, spontaneously realized the goal of mystics throughout the ages -- stepping beyond any notion of an &quot;I,&quot; a &quot;self&quot; to whom things happen. More incredible than her instantaneous realization was the terror and confusion that, for ten years, arose in the mind of this woman along with her lack of awareness of &quot;who&quot; was experiencing this terror. Ms. Segal's search to understand her experience and the evolving awareness that arose kept me wide awake until I had finished her story only 2 hours later. And her story sparked my story. To say that Collision altered *my* sense of self would be simplistic at best. A must read for seekers of all kinds"},{"Title":"Collision with the Infinite: A Life Beyond the Personal Self","review":"I am still high from reading this book yesterday. As a fellow T.M. teacher who was in Livigno, Italy, training to become a teacher just two months before Suzanne, I feel that I can almost remember her question to Maharishi about the pain of her experience. Her comments on the flaws of this large spiritual organization are accurate, but sad to read in print. But how she could have missed the signs of her own enlightenment is beyond me, as we were so carefully taught to recognize the symptoms. Why she failed to check in with Maharishi earlier is also incomprehensible. Still I feel that her book has given me a personal key to the next steps in my own spiritual evolution. Just reading her words, and her final, total clarity around her experience was a wonderful darshan that makes me want to give away copies of her book to everyone I know."},{"Title":"Collision with the Infinite: A Life Beyond the Personal Self","review":"I've wanted to buy this book for quite some time, and today it came in the mail. I read the whole book in less than one day and found it absolutely wonderful. Some reviewers have mentioned that a distinct weakness to the book is Segal's insistence on the irrelevance of spiritual practices. I do not consider this a weakness but in fact part and parcel to Segal's &quot;ideas&quot; of liberation--what we call spiritual practice and what we call non-spiritual things are in fact synonymous to one another within the context of the vastness. This is liberation itself, the idea that the only purpose served by practice is to demonstrate how practice is unecessary. This seems to mirror other &quot;individuals&quot; who state that going to the bathroom, eating, and sleeping are as much a spiritual practice as is meditating or praying. To Segal there is no living apart from the vastness or even necessarily in the vastness--rather, instead of indentifying with these two dualistic states, we rather are the vastness itself, quite different from inside or outside this vastness. There have been times where I have been told that this enlightenment comes by grace and I think &quot;Ah, why can I not have that? Why am I so unworthy?&quot; but then I remember what Segal's first and foremost insistence is: we are all the vastness; we can never NOT be the vastness. In this case, enlightenment is just a delusion itself. Wonderful book, wonderful."},{"Title":"Collision with the Infinite: A Life Beyond the Personal Self","review":"How does &quot;no one&quot; deal with sudden enlightenment in a society that has no context for it and looks at it as a pathological problem to be fixed?Ms. Segal tells her story well. From fear to joy, her story covers a lifetime.This is not a how to manual. It is a traveler's narrative. I found it both an enjoyable and deeply thoughtful book."},{"Title":"Collision with the Infinite: A Life Beyond the Personal Self","review":"Collision With the Infinite is a fascinating addition to the small but growing body of literature dealing with the Western experience of self-realization. Segal's narrative provides a compelling and disturbing account of her sudden, unsolicited and irreversible recognition of the utter emptiness of the Self nature, a realization that, because she lacked any guidance at the time it occurred, left her in the grip of overpowering terror. Even her acceptance and ultimate enjoyment of that condition was unstable and began to slip away as her health failed.Most accounts of enlightenment deal with it from the perspective of the blissful, exalted state it represents. Segal has given us a roadmap of the potential suffering that can arise when such transformations occur outside the traditional student teacher relationship."},{"Title":"Collision with the Infinite: A Life Beyond the Personal Self","review":"Just finished the book. During the reading I kept asking myself why having had such a training with the \\"maharishi\\" when this awakening occurred, why did she not remember the teachings of the maharishi about cosmic consciousness and then into the next two levels? Why did she block that road as a source of help for understanding what was happening to her and turn to psychology.Then in the end to find out about her brain tumor I then wonder was this whole experience merely a symptom of her tumor that was there all along? If not, then why after the tumor was discovered did her experience shift back to the personal? I get what she is saying about the vastness and believe that enlightenment is a real possibility for us today, however there is something about her story and the way it ended that leaves me feeling unsure.I do believe in the description in the vedic texts and zen etc. which seem to mirror her experiences, I just don't Understand how she could fall from that state of consciousness because of a brain tumor"},{"Title":"Collision with the Infinite: A Life Beyond the Personal Self","review":"Segal's spiritual autobiography was both tremendously exciting and disturbing. I haven't been so engaged by a personal spiritual awakening story since I read Franklin Jones' Knee of Listening back in 1976. Within a week I had gone back and read the book again. The happiest part was when she went on retreat and suddenly realized the all-encompasing unity of the universe, and had to fall to her knees at the wonder of it all. I was sad that she did not have the time to integrate her realization fully into her daily life, but I don't fear for her final destiny. I will read it again when I get it back from a friend."},{"Title":"Collision with the Infinite: A Life Beyond the Personal Self","review":"I just read this at the request of a friend who found it powerful, and as a longtime meditator and student of cosmic mysteries, I was immediately intrigued.But by halfway into the book I was so plagued with questions and annoyed by all that was unsaid and unexplained (if her 'personal self' which one could call the ego - was non existent - why hop from man to man, from place to place? Why would you need to? And while having a young child? And allowing that's all fine for the child since she came in fully enlightened? (Implied not stated). The author repeatedly avers that her daughter is happy and well adjusted. That made me question the concept of non self and non ego, that she would need to state that and more than once.I had questions as to her need to distance from her parents, and especially in light of her obvious love for her mother and her mother's trauma surviving the Holocaust? Little is said about her father, except that he was very successful. He obviously had to be the financial source of her ability to float around the world, study anything that caught her interest, with no apparent source of income of her own.The reason I think those aspects are pertinent is because the author herself was dismayed (before her 'bus hit' where she lost her 'self'), at the lack of compassion she saw in the seasoned TM'ers while a student of the Maharishi. Suzanne's behavior seemed highly impulsive and self indulgent, and that would not be compassionate toward her loved ones and her child.The most burning questions that arose for me were:1. If you have NO personal self, and you say the 'observer' that was first there has also left the building, how do you even report on 'the body/mind's fear, not to mention experience it? And if you can experience fear in the body/mind without a personal self, why can't you also experience love or report on it? (with her mother or her child for example). She explained that 'mothering' as a kind of energy stepped in, and life functions went on...yet the most intense experience she reported was fear, and certainly the rootless psychic amnesia she described sounded terrifying.2. If she had contact with source or 'vastness', I was confused why she should be plagued with such personal frailties in her interpersonal relations, and not be imbued with more wisdom and maturity? There is no mention of her personal responsibility in any of that - just her getting up and walking out of a therapy session, or out of a relationship and on to the next. She explained that she just 'went on to the next thing' without introspection (because she couldn't do that having no sense of self), and because it seemed obvious. She could be scathing towards the mental health practitioners who minimized or pathologized her experience, yet where was accountability on her own part (not for the loss of self, but her hurtful behaviors).How could this behavior not have left a lot of psychic damage to others who still had a 'personal self'? I would LOVE to hear from her daughter what life was like for her - as a witness.3. The foreword and epilogue mentions her humility, and the power of her radiance, and how she touched those who came into contact with her. I would have loved more expansion on that since I would never have gathered that from her narrative.What was useful and powerful in this little book however is that it poses the question of what is self, what is the nature of consciousness? And does so in subjective, experiential, and not merely theoretical terms. And that religions and organized belief systems, be they of the spiritual or material sort (TM, therapeutic modalities and all such organized systems) brought to my mind the old adage \\"If you find the Buddha on the road -- kill him'' and also that every map is the wrong one - because one's individual path is yet to be traversed.In sum for me this was a frustrating, limited, self indulgent (excuse the use of term 'self' here! but deeply stimulating exploration of an unusual experience that while it may have been organically caused by brain damage from the tumor, from early abuse, a form of mental illness, or incarnating and having a difficult energetic with this dimension -- in the end it did not matter to me- because the questions posed are powerfully thought provoking."},{"Title":"Collision with the Infinite: A Life Beyond the Personal Self","review":"Segal's story is melodrama, dysfunctional, pretty whiney if you're into that kind of thing. Better sources for pointers on 'no-self' could be Bernadette Roberts and maybe Wei Wu Wei.Segal certainly wasn't ready for what happened to her, apparently due to her pre-existing 'fuzzy' psycho-spiritual assumptions. She continually attempted to make what she was calling no-self into something it isn't. I doubt she ever got a grasp of it because she was trying to make no self into a theraputic salve, for terrified herself, still observing no self.Interestingly, she continually fell back on her own failed programs to diagnose her percieved loss of self, as well as to decide who should diagnose it when that failed. She ended up sleeping with most theraputic mentors that verified her. Her need to go 'out there' for verification indicates a half bake-ling. Her \\"loss of self\\" didn't include losing her sense of other's self, nor the understanding that the loss of self was a discovery of an already so no-self rather than finding a self lost. It would seem that the \\"bliss ninny\\" spirituality she practiced prior to the \\"bus stop\\" experience was an actual hinderance once something not within her preconcieved spiritual 'knowledge' happened to her!Segal's story is also a pretty good expose of the lack of depth to the 'transpersonal' psychology and meditation modalities, at least as far as no-self is concerned, and thier idenitification with the fearful individuated mindset that Segal was trying to address. I mean, I'm sure meditation and psychology helps a lot of people. But what's that got to do with no-self?So don't let the sympathetic Foreword and Afterword diagnose the story for you (as it claims to have done in Suzanne Segal's case) if you're looking for more than a story, since these place the content of the story in a light that the author showed didn't work. The Fore/Aft uses psuedo psycho-spiritual perspective to frame Segal's story of \\"colliding with the infinite.\\" It describes within its own speculations, using transpersonal vocabulary, just that kind of vocabulary/thinking that seemed to have justified Suzanne's suffering, again and again."},{"Title":"Collision with the Infinite: A Life Beyond the Personal Self","review":"Highly recommend this book to those with an interest in advaita/non-duality.her story resonated with some \\"knowing\\" somewhere deep in me, and maybe it will for others, too. And to paraphrase what Susan Segal says: remember that these descriptions, no matter how perfect they may seem, can't even begin to describe the incomprehensable \\"reality\\" that they try to point to. words can never say what \\"it\\" is, only what \\"it\\" is not. There is an inherent futility, it seems, in writing a book about something that cannot be known, undestood, or comprehended in any relation to anything we have previously experienced, no matter how subtle and clever we imagine ourselves. She mentions this paradox near the end, but it's easy to forget(for me anyway). It's also easy to forget, as in other reviewers' questioning of why she didn't do this or understand that sooner than she did, that it \\"happened\\" for her the way it \\"happened\\" and could not have been any other way. I thought it odd she didn't really stress that understanding(or I missed it if she did). So maybe all any book like this can do is resonate with some deep \\"knowing\\" that is beyond the grasp of even our most subtle, sublime imagination. It seems to have been that for me, maybe it will be for others.Since I've found conventional psychotherapy so frustrating, I also appreciated her explanation of how the mental health field cannot really deal with this awakening since it lies outside of any concept of personal experience. It's a paradox that won't go away."},{"Title":"Collision with the Infinite: A Life Beyond the Personal Self","review":"Suzanne Segal was living a secular life in France when she experienced an abrupt shift out of ordinary consciousness and into a state of no-self. Though six years prior to this event she had studied extensively with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, she did not understand what had happened to her until she found her experience described in a Buddhist text well over a decade later.Segal's book is fascinating both as an intimate description of what it feels like to live without identification with a sense of 'I,\\" and also as a compelling example of just how profoundly our beliefs affect our experience and interpretation of that experience. According to the modern psychiatry Segal sought help from for years, she was experiencing a serious personality disorder. But according to long-standing Advaita and Buddhist traditions, she had achieved a state that people struggle towards for lifetimes. Being able to view her experience from both perspectives is enlightening in more ways than one."},{"Title":"Collision with the Infinite: A Life Beyond the Personal Self","review":"The story of the spiritual life and love affairs and the ten year struggle of a modern woman following the sudden loss of her self. How she lived life without a feeling, affective self, is clearly described. It demonstrates the failure of professionals, family, friends and lovers to understand what the no-self is. Segal tells of her discovery and meeting with nondual Masters and teachers and how this nudged her into equanimity and full understanding of nondual reality. Finally, in what is a valuable contribution to nondual literature, and a reason for owning this book, she writes and speaks with unique clarity from the disposition of one who knows, who breathes, the sameness, not the oneness, of reality. The first three-quarters of the book were overly detailed descriptions of events that almost invariably led to her falling in love with one or another guy. While relevant, these descriptions came across of being self-indulgent. I became very good at predicting when she was about to fall in love with someone, and this made part of the book unintentionally humorous. I found myself silently yelling, &quot;Don't go hear that guy speak, Suzanne! You're going to fall in love with him but he won't understand you!&quot; Would she listen to me? No."},{"Title":"Collision with the Infinite: A Life Beyond the Personal Self","review":"\\"To see things for what they are is to see with the eyes of the vastness itself.\\"-Suzanne SegalThe first thing that attracted me to this book was its dramatic cover, which features a statue of the Buddha exploding. It's clear that this visual represents the blowing up or destruction of one's personal sense of \\"I,\\" which is what happened to the book's author, Suzanne Segal, who passed away on April 1, 1997, less than a year after this book came out.Her remarkable and very personal tale of spiritual awakening is unique for two reasons. First, she was NOT seeking enlightenment at the time of her awakening. Secondly, rather than experiencing anything even remotely close to love/bliss, she experienced a level of fear and anxiety for over a decade that oftentimes resembled a living hell and had her question her own sanity.Her honesty and descriptive writing style make this spiritual biography a real page turner. For example here, in her own words, is the description of her awakening, which happened while she was 27 years old, 4 months pregnant, and getting on a bus in Paris in 1982:\\"As I took my place in line, I suddenly felt my ears stop up like they do when the pressure changes inside an airplane as it makes its descent. I felt cut off from the scene before me, as if I were enclosed in a bubble, unable to act in any but the most mechanical manner.I lifted my right foot to step up into the bus and collided head-on with an invisible force that entered my awareness like a silently exploding stick of dynamite, blowing the door of my usual consciousness open and off its hinges, splitting me in two. In the gaping space that appeared, what I had previously called 'me' was forcefully pushed out of its usual location inside me into a new location that was approximately a foot behind and to the left of my head. 'I' was now behind my body looking out at the world without using the body's eyes.\\"She goes on to share how the experience filled her with terror because each time the mind would turn within to find \\"Suzanne,\\" there was nothing there! She writes, \\"I shook my head a few times to rattle my consciousness back into place, but nothing changed.\\" She went home and tried to explain to her husband, Claude, what had happened, but obviously he couldn't understand it and so took her to the first of the many psychiatrists and psychotherapists she would visit over the next 10 years. Most tried their best to \\"cure her\\" from her \\"pathological state,\\" but none were successful. Even her earlier training as TM teacher, under Maharishi Mahesh Yogi no less, did little to relieve her suffering.Finally, at about the 12 year mark, the fear lifted and the \\"awakening\\" seem to settle in. In the spring of 1996 (for approximately 6 months) she began holding satsangs in Northern, CA. Here are some of my favorite excerpts from her teaching (although she did not refer to herself as a teacher, but rather as a \\"describer,\\" as in she was simply describing or sharing her experience):\\"The most common predicament people bring to me is the experience of feeling \\"cut off\\" from the infinite. They find this particularly painful if they have had clear experiences of the vastness which they then feel has \\"gone away.\\" They want to know how they can stay in contact with the infinite at all times.This very question contains two implicit assumptions that pass themselves off as truth--that there is an \\"I\\" that is cut off from the infinite who could \\"apply itself\\" to reconnecting if it had the proper technique, and that the infinite has gone somewhere.These are prime examples of how ideas masquerade as truth. In fact, there is no individual \\"I\\" who can figure out how to find the infinite again. More importantly, where would the infinite go? I mean, we aren't talking about something that can hide under the rug. If you could see things as only and exactly what they are, you would see that the \\"you\\" that is seeing is the vastness itself.\\"\\"A relaxation of being naturally arises if one is not seduced into taking ideas to be truth.\\"\\"There is no experience whose presence is an indication that you are not the vastness. Therefore, there is no need to get rid of anything. The vastness, which is what we really are, never suffers. Therefore, it never asks that anything be eliminated for suffering to cease.\\"And her main suggestion to \\"seekers\\" is:\\"To see things to be just what they are, because that is how the vastness is always seeing things. Thoughts are thoughts. Emotions are emotions. The body is just the body. It's the mind's interpretation of things that ends up creating suffering--the sense that there is a problem, that fear or anger or sadness means there's something wrong with me, that certain emotions or experiences have to be eliminated for me to be OK, that something needs to be practiced or achieved in order to become the infinite. The mind is constantly interpreting in this way, while the vastness just looks around and sees that things are just what they are.\\"Sadly, in the spring of 1997 Suzanne was diagnosed with a brain tumor. This had a devastating effect on not just her physical body, but her mind as well. The fear came back stronger than ever and her connection to The Vastness, as she called it, appeared to once again become obscured.At this point I should mention that when I asked two of my \\"awakened\\" friends who knew Suzanne what their thoughts about her were, they both felt that while Suzanne did give off a radiant luminosity when she was \\"feeling it,\\" the fact that she still experienced fear meant that she had not truly/fully awakened. When I postulated that perhaps this was due to the brain tumor, one of them said that the fear had returned prior to the discovery of the brain tumor. He also added, \\"When I saw Jean Klein, after his stroke, as much as his brain and thought processes had been affected by it, the light of awareness was still shining through him in full force.\\"What to make of this? Well, just remember that as beautifully sounding and as helpful as Suzanne's pointers (or any authors, including this one's) might be, ALL words are concepts, and thus not \\"it.\\" Who you are is beyond words, beyond concepts, even beyond the mind itself. The truth is, you simply are.Namaste,-Michael(you can check out more spiritual book reviews on my website)"},{"Title":"Collision with the Infinite: A Life Beyond the Personal Self","review":"I was very excited when I read the reviews of this book and so I ordered a copy for myself.

After years of practicing TM meditation and dwelling in the unmanifest sat, the tree of existence brings forth its most supreme fruit in Suzanne. So one day at a bus stop in Paris, Suzanne disappears forever as a personal self and simultaneously becomes all Self.But she finds no fixed point or map by which she can pivot herself in this seemingly new and yet ancient formless identity. She becomes uneasy and tremulous navigating in the infinitely alive, non-separated, non-dual and luminous existence that she now witnesses. Failing to understand, embrace and integrate her boundless being she becomes fearful and anxiety ridden. At this point, she unfortunately seeks for shelter in the company of the many false prophets and quacks that preach the gospel known as the modern psychological method. Almost all of whom pathologize her experience and make little of her transformation to this higher modality of consciousness and being. They treat it as a sickness of the mind which they label by various terms such as \\"de-personalization disorder\\", \\"borderline personality disorder\\" and signs of \\"pre-Oedipal wounding\\". One even cautions her not to go into the emptiness as if in it lay the gates to hell and self - annihilation - the point where inner adventurers sail of the edge of the uncharted universe.But what does psychology ever hope to accomplish except transforming the abnormally abnormal into normally abnormal. It simply does not understand the mystical and higher states of consciousness, which extend their umbrella beyond the grain of sand known as the personal self. Nor do they relate to the vast dimensionless spiritual universe in which miracles happen every moment. Psychology knows nothing of atemporal quantum transformation but remains log-linear to life and thought.At this point Buddhism comes to Suzanne's rescue. It teaches her that her experiences of emptiness (Shunyata) and no-self (anatta) is a much sought after and exalted state of consciousness known as enlightenment/satori. She learns that the personal self that she had believed in and which she had formerly taken herself to be - the woman looking back in the mirror - is nothing but a mind generated fiction perpetrated out of the ignorance that arises from self-identification with the skandhas. Laden with this new interpretation of her experience, and integrated understanding, Suzanne becomes well again and flowing with vitality. She describes the ever living presence, the reservoir out of which all beings and phenomena appear and disappear as \\"the vastness\\". And in one humorous section she describes driving through the vast\\"ness is driving through her self to arrive at the point that she is already at. It reminds me of the Great vehicle of Zen in which one effortlessly travels everywhere without traveling anywhere at all.\\"Collision with the Infinite\\" overall is a very enjoyable and rewarding read. Suzanne relates her experiences well in very simple, candid and approachable language. She possesses the outstanding ability to bring across very ineffable spiritual experiences along with the essence of complex philosophic thought systems within he bounds of just a few sentences. She also is very competent in summarizing within a paragraph or two the key features of each chapter of her life as it unfolds against the backdrop of her fundamental experience. Highly recommend this book to all sincere spiritual travelers on psychoplanet."},{"Title":"Collision with the Infinite: A Life Beyond the Personal Self","review":"This book certainly describes some sort of 'self-less state' though the cause of it is highly questionable. It seems to me that Segal's brain was actually not functioning properly for some time, and that her experience of becoming a realized individual who has finally discarded her ego may have been superimposed upon her malfunctioning brain/personality.It also makes you wonder about the effectiveness of whatever philosophy she had been studying for all those years. You would think that she would have 'caught on' to her possible selfless state well before the 10 years or so that it took her to do so, or seem to.As has been mentioned by other reviewers here, the book wants you to not consider her state pathologically, yet that is exactly what Suzanne did near the end of her days. That certainly led me to take all the 'enlightening business' in the middle of the book somewhat skeptically.The biggest tip off was the fact that she had no idea of what was going on, along with her constant state of dissassociation; these don't seem to be indicators of some satisfying recognition of her personal bond with the infinite. It seems more indicative of a detached personality, either from physical or emotional causes.Read the book, it is a very interesting read; but also let the sadness of Suzanne's personal situation be a lesson that there are many out there that will tell you, incorrectly, that wrestling with or defeating the ego is a requirement for enlightenment.I'm not actually reviewing the entertainment level of the book as much as the stance of those that seems to worship the state she was in."},{"Title":"Collision with the Infinite: A Life Beyond the Personal Self","review":"I have read this book time and time again, and the story never fails to inspire me to go beyond my limits of love, acceptance, transcendence and ego.How can one not be inspired by the readings of someone how studied with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi? Susan Segal started the forms of meditation at the young age of seven, by inwardly repeating her name over and over; clearly developed spiritually beyond her years. Her spirituality developed on an up and down spiral for many years, until she was able to solidify her feelings of \\"absolute\\".The book, well written in layman's verse, ties together the [silent] definitions of Eternity, Nothingness and the Infinite. She describes her loss of self as a challenge, only to arrive back on the top, in absolute disappearance and appearance. Ms. Segal spelled out with grace that life is a meeting; for which (in my opinion, I gathered from her writing) space and time are relative and the meeting of the two emerges up into the future of 'colliding' with the entity of who we are.This book, I will admit, ends sadly but still uplifting the message. (No matter how many times we try to get it right, we will one day succeed!)Quote from book:\\"Although it is always present, the mind cannot recognize it because the infinite is not perceived through the mind. The infinite perceives itself.\\" - Susan Segal; Collision with the Infinite\\"In fact, however, the presence of fear means only that fear is present, and nothing more.\\" - Susan Segal; Collision With the Infinite\\"No self, no other, everything is made up of the same substance of vastness\\". - Susan Segal; Collision With the Infinite"},{"Title":"Collision with the Infinite: A Life Beyond the Personal Self","review":"I am amazed out how the Universe will always put the right teacher at the right time in my life.

I tell you what, if you can find one, just one, who knows let me know and the next time we meet I will treat you to the beverage of your choice. Hey, I will even spring for lunch!And there is the pity of this survey. William Cullen Bryant was in this day considered the greatest of American poets, in particular the Romantic Poets. He still is by some, but those ranks are growing thinner and thinner as each year passes.The old copy of his works I have in front of me was published in 1892, some 14 years after his death. The book is in great shape, with tight binding and no missing pages, but my goodness the book has been read and reread. I find small smudge marks on each page and stains here and there (coffee, tea, tobacco juice..who knows), and the pages are well worn. I purchased this old book a number of years ago at a book auction (I will never tell what I paid for it and in particular will never let my wife know), and I must admit that I have added to its wear and tear over the years. I hope I was able to handle it as lovingly as its previous owners.This particular book contains a wonderful collection of Bryant's work, twenty eight poems to be exact which of course include Sella and Thanatopsis. There are also offerings such as The Little People of the Snow, Toa Waterfowl, The Land of Dreams, Abraham Lincoln, The Planting of the Apple-Tree, The Conqueror's Grave and The Yellow Violet. Truth be told, in my little opinion, it does not get much better than this!Bryant's work has always been considered rather thoughtful and philosophic and not generally enjoyed by the average reader. His technical sophistication is without compare and he was of course a strong influence over Whittier. What also is little known, or now ignored, is his tremendous influence over the Hudson River School of Art, my favorite, and was one of the first to actually stand up for the rights of workers. Almost his entire focus was on using nature and the natural world as a metaphor for truth in everything. Bryant had the ability to take the mundane and turn it into a thing of beauty. Take the opening stanza of The Planting of the Apple-Tree:Come, let us plant the apple-tree.Cleave the tough greensward with the spade;Wide let its hollow bed be made;There gently lay the roots, and thereSift the dark mould with kindly care,And press it o'er them tenderly,As, round the sleeping infant's feet,We softly fold the cradle-sheet;So plant we the apple-tree.Or, as was the wont of poets of the time, he could become quite emotional and quite fired up as when he wrote his The Greek Partisan (This is in reference to the Greek war for independence from Turkish rule in the early 1800s):(Second stanza)They go to the slaughterTo strike the sudden blow,And pour on earth, like water,The best blood of the foe;To rush on them from rock and height,And clear the narrow valley,Or fire their camp at dead of night,And fly before they rally,Chains are round our country pressed,And cowards have betrayed her,And we must make her bleeding breast,The grave of the invader.This is pretty intense stuff and it gets even better as the poem progresses.Unless they take a specialized course in college, most people are never exposed to such.

In the first few weeks after getting it, I must have tried 12-13 recipes. Each was fun to make and not too complicated (though there was some &quot;&agrave; la minute&quot; running around) and each was delicious. They even looked like the pictures. The photos are not just mouth-watering, they're very helpful for intermediate steps, as are the Tips. I find this book beautiful, engaging, encouraging and a real treasure.

I decided to give it a thorough shot this time and flipped to the back to find a great list of basic sauces, pastry recipes and techniques. The basics is what this book is about to me. Not only that, but some of the most well known french recipes are in there as well. I adore french cooking and the recipes in this book make them accessible to those not so advanced to attempt Lobster Thermidor on the first go round (yes, it's in there!).I flip through this book and I'm always reinspired by something I passed by the first time. In my experience the recipes are accurate and thought out with enough images and instruction to aid the beginner-intermediate cook.

The result is this book, or to put it more correctly: this tour report.Much can be said about the format: a transcription of a few conversations the boys had during their eventful American tour. At first you may fear to get bored by this format, but strangely enough it's quite the opposite. Because nothing is really interpreted by the author, it gets a very authentic feel to it. The quite remarkable -not always generally accepted- opinions of Chris and Neil are left untouched, and ready to be put into perspective by the reader himself. That in itself proves the courage of the \`boys' to allow such a report to be published. I can imagine that people tend to get a bad opinion -to put it mildly- about the egos of both artists, because what is in this book is not all nice and happy. But if you allow yourself to look behind this curtain of the two personalities, you can only appreciate the dedication they produce for their \`art'. Not many artists are prepared to put their image at risk in favour of authenticity.The black-and-white pictures shot by Pennie Smith are completely in line with the works of the Pet Shop Boys. Sombre settings dictate most of the pictures, but at the same time illustrate the feeling of detachment the \`boys' suffer while travelling through that strange, but fascinating land: America.To conclude: a warning! Although this book is a must-read for everybody who likes (or dislikes) to be referred to as a \`Pet Shop Boys-fan', it might not have the same effect on people who only \`like' what the Pet Shop Boys create. This book is a bit too \`fan-focussed' to be appreciated by a broader audience, to my humble opinion. As some kind of a footnote: I belong to the first category."},{"Title":"\\"Pet Shop Boys\\" Versus America","review":"Chris Heath accompanied British duo Chris Lowe and Neil Tennant on an American music tour and this is a candid account which gives the reader a pretty good idea of how these two guys think.

Most people think of prim moralists when they think of \\"Victorians\\" but after reading Asa Briggs 500 page sociological, economic, political and cultural survey the reader will be left with a far more complex and far richer impression of the Victorians and the complex issues that obsessed and defined them.This book is primarily a socio-political history and in England power has traditionally rested in the hands of the landowners. At the time of the French Revolution very few members of Parliament believed in democracy. To both the conservative(Tory) and liberal(Whig) elements in the English Parliament the English Constitution was thought to be the best because it was government run not by the people but government run by those most qualified to run government . As the nineteenth-century progressed, however, it became impossible to deny a growing and increasingly wealthy middle class its say on election day. Change did happen but it happened very differently in England than in continental Europe. In a time when other European nations were experiencing violent revolutions England remained relatively stable and Briggs attributes this relative calm to a consistently strong English economy --for a time the worlds strongest. Many found the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846 (which opened the way for free trade) to be the most significant legislature of the century. Reformist leaders and movements became popular during times of recession and the 19th century saw reforms in every area of life but reform in England was always a slow and deliberate process and reformist movements faded from the national consciousness during times of recovery. The 1830's saw the deepest recessions so it is not surprising that it was in that decade that the first major constitutional reform was passed extending the right to vote to the middle class. Many conservatives feared the move toward democracy would mean the end of England but in 1867 a second major consitutional reform extended the right to vote to the working classes. Political leaders were more often than not moderates whose main task was to maintain a balance between the various elements of Parliament which included Tories, Whigs, and Radicals. Throughout the period government like everything else was undergoing vast changes. Democracy presented a challenge to English political tradition and Darwin presented a challenge to English belief systems but the triumph of the age was perhaps its allegiance to balance and moderation in all things which was in part due to the Evangelical spirit of the time and in part due to the Utilitarian spirit popularized by legislative and law reformer Jeremy Bentham.Briggs paints a portrait of an England that sees itself as the pinnacle of civilization. The age was defined differently by its optimists and its pessimists but Briggs sets down four main features that defined both the champions and the critics of the era: work, seriousness, respectabilty, self-help.Briggs quotes extensively from the prominent men and women of the day(political and cultural figures) to give us an idea of how the Victorians viewed themselves and their era.The Age of ImprovementChapter 1 :Economy and Society in the 1780'sChapter 2: Politics and Government on the Eve of the French RevolutionChapter 3: The Impact of WarChapter 4:The Politics of TransitionChapter 5: ReformChapter 6: Social CleavageChapter 7:Britain and the World OverseasChapter 8: The Balance of InterestsChapter 9: VictorianismChapter 10: The Leap in the Dark"},{"Title":"Frank Frazetta/bk#2","review":"When I was younger I found this collection,hidden in the back of a small store.

But was it suicide--or murder? This is an important question for the Campbell family: a verdict of suicide will void Angus' life insurance policies, and the financially strapped family needs every penny it can get. In an effort to clear up the matter once and for all, the family calls upon the famous (and in some respects notorious) Dr. Gideon Fell. But no sooner is Fell installed on the premises than there is a second plunge from the tower heights.In addition to his way with a plot, Carr was also noted for his wit, and THE CASE OF THE CONSTANT SUICIDES crackles with laugh-out-loud incidents and dialogue. And fortunately so: this is actually one of his more gimmicky novels in terms of plot, and while Carr is able to hold all his elements together for most of the novel, Dr. Fell's final solution rings false on several levels. Even so, the charm of his characters and the wit of his style make the journey more than worth the effort.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"The Case of the Constant Suicides","review":"Carr has long been known as the king of the locked room mystery, and in this book we get two actual locked-room mysteries.

But thank goodness crime fighter extraordinaire Gideon Fell is on the scene and he finds his way through the maze. This book has Carr's trademark black humour as well, and kept me laughing all the way through.

Alan Campbell, professor, found his sleeping compartment on the train to Glasgow. Campbell was involved with another person of the same name in a dispute currently lining the letters pages of an historical journal. He met his adversary, a woman as it turned out, on the train. Unwillingly they had to share the compartment since there had evidently been a mistake in the booking of the train and no other seats were available. They were both going to the Castle Shira. A distant cousin, Angus Campbell, had been murdered. By accident they took a journalist named Swan with them to the castle, they had believed that he was also someone distantly related to Angus.Angus would not have committed suicide, he had insurance policies with suicide clauses; nevertheless, it seemed that he could not have been murdered, either. Angus had had a common law wife, but she was so filled with the idea that she must be respectable that she had probably filched Angus's diary to prevent others from seeing his private musings and discovering his relationship with her.Not finding the diary impeded the investigation of Dr. Fell and others called to the scene. Amusingly a journalist, a lawyer, and an insurance agent were all present to sort out the details of Angus's death. In the course of their highly interesting stay at the castle, the two Campbell cousins become interested in each other to a great degree. Two other men encounter danger and the death of one ensued and the near death of the other occurred prior to the ultimate unraveling of the mystery.The story is clever and highly satisfying to the reader.

These elements are very often present in Carr mysteries, but are executed with particular excellence in this book, to the extent that they almost offer more pleasure than the central chilling and puzzling mystery, which is almost always far and away the great pleasure of reading Carr. The WW2 homefront context is nicely drawn too and adds quite a bit of tension, with blackout windows and the threat of bomber raids lurking in the background.Carr's most popular (I suppose) detective, the historian Gideon Fell, is in good form in this book, convincingly brilliant and eccentric as well as amusing--though not in the over-the-top way that he (and his doppleganger Sir Henry Merrivale) sometimes descended into. Carr mysteries are usually experienced through the eyes of a less brilliant narrator/ assistant to the detective, clearly so that we as readers would share their awe at the superior insight and deductions of the great man, much as we had to experience Nero Wolfe through Archie's eyes, and Holmes through Watson's. If Holmes, Wolfe, or Fell narrated their own books, what mystery or suspense could there be--we would know all much too quickly! And fortunately in this book Fell's \\"Watson,\\" a Canadian college professor, is lively and intelligent in his own right, and is thrown together with an at least equally lively and intelligent female professor and rival/ love interest. Carr's \\"Watsons\\" were at times ciphers who added nothing to the atmosphere or interest of the books in which they appeared, but that is decidely not the case in this typically, and more than typically, fine mystery."},{"Title":"The Case of the Constant Suicides","review":"\\"The Case of the Constant Suicides\\" (1941) is a fun read and one of the author's more interesting mysteries--three men die and the reader must determine who committed suicide and who was murdered. This book is very much of a howdunit as well as a whodunit. Carr's serial detective, the humungous Dr. Gideon Fell, galumphs into view about a third of the way through, after one man is already mysteriously deceased. Old Angus Campbell meets his end after plunging out of the window of his locked tower bedroom. The door has to be broken down in order for the deceased man's bedroom to be examined. The only unusual object in the tower room is an empty animal carrier, its wire-mesh door tightly shut.Professor of history, Alan Campbell and his second cousin Kathryn Campbell meet on the train taking them to Scotland and immediately dislike each other. Too bad, because they are forced to share a sleeping compartment on the crowded, blacked-out train. They bicker all the way to the Castle of Shira at Inverary where Angus had jumped or was forced from his bedroom window the previous week.Here they meet the insurance agent, the Castle's lawyer, and Angus's brother Colin arguing about whether Angus was murdered or done himself in. Carr's serial detective, Dr. Gideon Fell wheezes and chuffs through the castle like an off-the-track steam engine, dropping mysterious hints as he goes. Colin decides to spend a night in his brother's former bedroom, just to lay rumors of ghostly goings-on, and he too defenestrates himself.When a third man is found hanging in a locked fishing cabin, Dr. Fell sorts out the murder and attempted murder from the suicide, rewards the innocent, and sets a murderer free if only he will sign a fake confession.John Dickson Carr takes a turn to heavy-handed humor in \\"The Case of the Constant Suicides.\\" Most of the roistering is caused by a malt whiskey called 'the Doom of the Campbells.' A pesky American newspaperman is drenched, shot at, and hunted from the castle grounds whenever the Doom is flowing through the inhabitants of the castle. This isn't my favorite Gideon Fell mystery, but it was fun to read--more smiles than frissons of terror."},{"Title":"Dos for Dummies Quick Reference","review":"This book will really help you learn DOS commands.

He doesn't completely cover the basics you need to start with before you start entering commands in the MS-DOS prompt; for example, the command to change the directory is in the regular reference section rather than at the start of the book where you need it. And he just decided to not cover a few commands, like &quot;debug&quot;. So it's not quite for &quot;dummies&quot;, really, and it's not complete either. Lastly, we're referred to yet another book called &quot;DOS for Dummies&quot; rather than him explaining fully? What's up with that?Don't get me wrong - it's still quite useful for people who already know a few basics and want to know more.

What Our Kids Are Trying to Tell Us","review":"Listen Up!&quot;As every missionary knows, you cannot reach a people group anywhere without first understanding their culture, &quot; Jerry Johnston reminds us. In Who's Listening? he sounds a clarion call to galvanize parents of teenagers to try to understand the world that kids of the '90s live in (a very different society from that of previous decades). Johnston implores parents and nurturing adults to listen to the cries for help from what could become a lost generation.Believing firmly that parents must make this effort if their sons and daughters are to survive in today's world, Johnston buttresses his agruments with excerpts from some of the thousands of letters he has received from troubled teenagers who have heard him speak in their school assemblies. (Often heart-wrenching letters like the one that said, &quot;I want to kill myself because no one in my family wants me around and school is not going well for me and no one at school likes me. I'm so confused. Please help me!&quot;)These kids tell him what they desperately wish they could tell their parents about such problems as SUICIDE, THE ACCULT, RAPE, DRUG ABUSE, VIOLENCE, AIDS, ABORTION, SATANISM, HOMOSEXUALITY, and TEEN PREGNANCY.Who's Listening? is a reader-friendly, practical book - a catalyst that outlines the steps that parents can take to help their son or daughter (or the kid next door) to cope with the pressures and temptations of the 1990's youth subculture.HERE IS WHAT OTHERS ARE SAYING ABOUT DR. JERRY JOHNSTON and &quot;WHO'S LISTENING?&quot;:&quot;Jerry Johnston knows firsthand what he's talking about.&quot; Detroit Free Press&quot;Few people of our time are better qualified to minister to the youth of our nation than Jerry Johnston.

WHO'S LISTENING? is a confirmation of his expertise and dedication to reaching teenagers who need help. Here is a genuine wake-up call to parents, lawmakers, teachers, counselors, and all concerned Americans who would save our children.&quot; Dr. James Kennedy, Ph.D., Senior Pastor, Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church&quot;Jerry Johnston has his heart on the pulse of today's teens like few other evangelists. You will be deeply moved and informed by the biblical answers he provides for the 21st century problems our anti-Christian culture forces young people to cope with.&quot; Dr. Tim LaHaye, Author, Minister, Educator&quot;No one speaks to the hears of today's kids like Jerry Johnston, and in this dynamic book they talk back.

WHO'S LISTENING? will be a valuable resource to parents and youth workers.&quot; Dr. Jay Kesler, President, Taylor University"},{"Title":"Who's Listening? What Our Kids Are Trying to Tell Us","review":"This book is a very interesting look in to one mans mind about the social problems plaugeing today's society. I am a christian, and I don't agree with most of the things that Mr. Johnston talks about. I think he has no basis for any argument of most of the subjects covered in his book. I give this book a 2 because it is written from a personal opinion standpoint and not based on strong fact."},{"Title":"Who's Listening? What Our Kids Are Trying to Tell Us","review":"For a decade Jerry Johnston worked with America's teenagers; he spoke to four million of them in some 3,000 schools and written books such as Why Suicide? and Going All the Way: The Real World of Teens and Sex. In this publication, he asks a good question: Who's Listening? What Our Kids Are Trying to Tell Us (Grand Rapids: Zondervan Publishing House, c. 1992).In his supportive foreword, Josh McDowell (like Johnston a veteran of interacting with young people) pinpoints the book's focus by saying: \\"In my years of working with young people, I can honestly say that most of the serious problems associated with teenagers could have been averted with properly expressed parental love. Most of the kids who went over the edge into sexual promiscuity, alcohol and substance abuse, or other aberrant behaviors could have been saved by a loving mom and dad who spent more time listening\\" (p. 9).Johnston himself has listened and \\"learned that kids live in a world completely different from the world their parents lived in as teenagers. I've learned that pressure to use alcohol and other illegal drugs is almost impossible to stand up to--that girls almost he same age as my daughter have experienced group sex--that satanic rituals have attracted the attention of hundreds of young people--and that suicide has become an attractive option for far too many kids\\" (pp. 15-16).Yet, perhaps, even more tragic is the underlying reason for such self-destructive behavior. All too many \\"teenagers feel as if no one cares about them--that no one is listening\\" (p. 16). The \\"no one,\\" basically, refers to their parents! Johnston gets thousands of letters and phone calls from kids who just want to be heard. They've had enough preaching. Parents usually preach well to their kids! What they need is a loving ear.Given that focus, Johnston structures his book in accord with subjects aired in letters he's received, teenagers' concerns about suicide, family problems, violence, homosexuality, alcohol, abortion, drug abuse, satanism, pregnancy, rape, and mental/emotional illness. Finally, he lists \\"twenty prescriptions for effective communication with teenagers.\\"Our kids are killing themselves. In the last forty years, suicide has surged from the fifth to the second cause of teenage death. \\"Ten percent of teenage boys and 18% of teenage girls have attempted suicide\\" (p. 22). Such kids explain that \\"their parents don't care--that they never have time for them; that they never listen\\" (p. 23).Family problems are breaking our kids' hearts. \\"The American family has broken down, and our kids are trying to pick up the pieces\\" (p. 32). They long for happy, healthy homes, but working moms and dads just don't seem to have the time or interest necessary to build the secure fortresses they need. And in the process our kids have grown frightened, sad, lonely, angry, and confused.Then there's violence. Schools are often battlegrounds rather than scholarly havens. TV acerbates the problem: \\"The National Coalition on Television Violence reports that by the age of eighteen, a child will have seen 200,000 violent acts on television, including 40,000 murders\\" (p. 43). Unfortunately, too many adolescent males confuse a pretentious and often aggressive \\"macho\\" with the authentic masculinity they actually crave.Add alcohol to the mix and you compound young peoples' problems. It's the \\"nation's number one drug problem\\" (p. 70). Yet it's cleverly touted-- \\"by age eighteen the average teen has seen 100,000 beer commercials on television. and the message those commercials send is always the same--that alcohol makes life better\\" (p. 71). In fact it makes life worse, and kids get addicted not because they enjoy it so much but because they're bored with life and find alcohol dulls the pain.Kids struggle sexually. Some slip into homosexuality, others get pregnant and have abortions, others develop Sexually Transmitted Diseases. Incest and rape add indignity and pain to the picture. Many kids barely enter puberty before they're sucked into a highly promiscuous adolescent sub-culture where it's expected that one be \\"sexually active.\\" Christians who imagine such behavior is restricted to the non-Christian world need to face the fact that kids in our churches are about as sexually active as their unchurched peers!Such activity is understandable in light of the models we give our kids! Advertisements on MTV and the pages of Rolling Stone appeal to youngsters' sexual hungers. TV sit-coms push the theme that \\"it's time to quit being a virgin\\" (p. 121). Song lyrics blatantly promote casual sex. Against such slick, moneyed promotionalism, the only hope for a youngster's wholesome sexual development is close, caring contact with healthy parents. But unfortunately, the parents are usually absent! So the kids watch TV and go to the Mall to buy whatever promises to augment his or her sexual appeal!While I've mainly illustrated the problems Johnston discusses, the book seeks, chapter by chapter, to advise parents on ways to deal with them. The \\"answers\\" are summed up in a concluding chapter, \\"twenty prescriptions for effective communication with teenagers.\\"Basically Johnston urges parents to be attentive, noticing behaviors as well as words, to listen carefully, to take time just to be with teenagers. \\"If somebody asks me how a teen would spell the world 'love' for his parents, it would be T-I-M-E\\" (p. 153). It's also important to trust kids, to allow them to fail without undue criticism, to praise their efforts and achievements, and to pray with them about their concerns.This book reads easily and contains much information and advice which parents (and teachers and pastors) need to read and heed!"},{"Title":"Schaum's Outline of UML","review":"When I wanted to learn C language, the second book I picked up was this same series on C [the first one being K &amp; R, which I read later to comprehend].This book on UML follows the same tradition of &quot;Teach a concept then give plenty of exercises to practice what you learnt&quot;.

I also found my copy of Life Among the Savages, bought years ago but never read because I thought it would just be cutesy ... Wrong again, and I'm glad I just now read it prior to reading Judy Oppenheimer's book about her.This is a delightful and wickedly funny book and perfectly describes a mother's life in the 1950s if you can suspend total belief for a while. Shirley Jackson writes with such love and forbearance about her daily life with her children and her work-at-home-but-how-is-that-possible husband that it is not too long a stretch to imagine her writing The Lottery and her other books which include a fair amount of domestic descriptions themselves.Most of Shirley Jackson's books, including this one, have never been out of print, and, as is usually the case, there is a reason for that: they are such good books!"},{"Title":"Life Among the Savages","review":"I got my mother this book for her birthday, but she was still lost in the story of a certain boy wizard long after I finished with him so I read this first instead. This book may have been written in the 1950's but the sentiments and trials of motherhood are timeless.The only thing that really brought home to me that this book was written in a different era were the amounts of money. But even that only serves to reinforce for me just how pertinent this book is today, yesterday and for many tomorrows.There is a scene where she ends up raiding her children's piggy bank that keeps me in stitches while reading it and makes me smile whenever I think about it. Whether it's 5 cents or $5, it doesn't matter why you raided your children's piggy bank , it only matters that bread and milk were on the table, the kids got to school (eventually) and that no matter what it takes, you got the job of mothering done.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Life Among the Savages","review":"Having read an excerpt of this one day, I was driven to track down my own copy. Although better known for her darker writings, Jackson's semi-autobiographical telling of her life as a mother &amp; a writer was very funny, &amp; had me laughing out loud many times. Originally written in 1948, it proves that the trials &amp; tribulations &amp; joys of motherhood are timeless."},{"Title":"Life Among the Savages","review":"Shirley Jackson's slightly warped view of being a wife and mother is more than just the story of Every Mom. It offers those of us who came to parenthood in the 80s and 90s a wonderfully irreverant look at the world's very oldest profession -- through a 50-year-old glass. To imagine the classic 1950s mother searching for her bedside ashtray or threatening to lock her daughter's precious dolls out in the cold overnight is music to the habitually self-critical modern-day mother's ears. That we all share Jackson's joy and angst would be enough. But her stories about having children in the 1950s also serve to show us how different and how much the same the experience was for our own mothers back when things were supposed to be so much easier. They weren't and that's a strange but comforting thought."},{"Title":"Life Among the Savages","review":"Jackson, best known for the short story, \\"The Lottery,\\" and the novel, The Haunting of Hill House, also wrote this collection of humorous essays, gathered together from their original appearances in publications such as Mademoiselle, Harper's, Good Housekeeping, and others. Given her famous work, and her reputation for brooding, intensely psychologically work, this is definitely a departure. Completely autobiographical, with a slight amount of exaggeration, this is an extremely funny book--I'm talking laugh out loud funny. It begins as Jackson and her husband move from New York City to the Vermont suburbs (I guess they commuted by train, and neither of them had to be there daily) with their two children. While there, Jackson discovers the \\"joys\\" of country living, rural schooling, and childbirth twice more.Maybe it's just me, but I always put Jackson on the same footing with Dorothy Parker, as someone quite cynical about the world. Reading this collection, one does not get that feeling at all. Jackson shows herself to be quite laissez faire, flowing with the daily vicissitudes of suburban life, even, heaven forbid, a housewife.My favorite section here was about their eldest son's first weeks at school. Laurie returns home with daily stories about Charles, a child who is obviously up to no good. The first day Charles was spanked for being fresh. The second, he hit the teacher. The next, he gets spanked for hitting the teacher again. Then he bounced the seesaw on a head of a little girl. He had to stand in the corner the next day for refusing to quit pounding his feet on the floor. The next day, his blackboard privileges are revoked because he threw chalk. Around the household, doing a \\"Charles\\" became a synonym for doing something bad.When Parent-Teacher week comes up, Jackson and her husband are dying of curiosity to meet Charles' mother. Finally finding the teacher, Jackson enters a conversation with her:\\"Laurie usually adjusts very quickly,\\" I said. \\"I suppose this time it's Charles' influence.\\"\\"Charles?\\"\\"Yes,\\" I said, laughing, \\"you must have your hands full in that kindergarten, with Charles.\\"\\"Charles?\\" she said. \\"We don't have any Charles in the kindergarten.\\"As a kicker, the following line appears in the indica to this volume: \\"The section which was originally published as 'Charles' in Mademoiselle and The Lottery is included here at the request of the author's older son.\\""},{"Title":"Life Among the Savages","review":"This is my first Jackson novel. I gave her a try because a friend of mine loves her and we typically have a similar taste in books.

The stories about Jackson's children and her trials with her old home are charming, but the overall effect is achingly dated.

These days it is pracically a drive by procedure :) I felt the book dragged at times, but all in all this is an enjoyable read and certainly one I would recommend to other moms."},{"Title":"Life Among the Savages","review":"This is Shirley Jackson's hilarious account of her struggles raising an expanding family of children. She is delightfully unsentimental in her account of family life, and any harassed parent will recognise the situations she finds herself in. For instance, what parent hasn't suffered the anguish of trying to eat in a restaurant with young children, how well Shirely Jackson sums of the sheer horror of that situation, among many others. I didn't think there could ever be a book about child-raising as funny as Jean Kerr's 'Please Don't Eat the Daisies' but this one runs it a very close second."},{"Title":"Life Among the Savages","review":"Shirley Jackson had three highly animated children which she, more or less, kept in check. I admired the way she told her trials in an always up-beat slightly humorus but usually exhasperated style. That is a main point that made me want to keep reading. It was not a dark dramatic book ,which it very well could have been. While reading, it really made me want to &quot;keep my chin up&quot;."},{"Title":"Life Among the Savages","review":"Ms. Jackson's domestic fiction is unfairly lumped into the category of housewife humor dominated by Bombeck, Viorst, Kerr and company. While these scribes should be awarded fair due, their prose generates from the perspective of \\"normal woman\\" experiencing \\"everyday life\\" in mid 20th century America. Life Among the Savages and its sequel are the wry observances of an extremely rare mind whose life is anything but mundane.Who else is asked to consider moving to a Vermont barn (Those stalls could be converted to bedrooms, suggests a Realtor) or a dwelling of petrified doughnuts when the NYC lease unexpectedly expires? Who else creates the criteria for an Olympic Event when faced with a live bat and a husband's air rifle? No one but Shirley quotes Shakespeare when facing a delivery room or charts her labor's progress by the newspaper her husband is (currently) hiding behind. No one gives her children the creative freedom to assume alternate identities while simultaneously herding them (with paraphernalia) through department store shopping. No one else is Shirley.Life may be a little off kilter where a woman prefers to rob her children instead of pushing her furnace's power button and a family's restless night (my favorite) results in the baby possessing brandy, the dog asleep on the pillow and a quilt that vanished in perpetuity but it is not routine and neither is this book. Miss Jackson's work, as a whole, has resisted the categorization of literary critics. This book deserves no less. Enjoy the wry, detached tone of the narrator especially when a faint note of hysteria is detected in the narrative. Realize you have incorporated the sayings of her children into your family lexicon and give her the proper credit. But never label her domestic work as anything less than another branch of prose mastered by a gifted writer. If you do, I won't be responsible for the consequences."},{"Title":"Life Among the Savages","review":"This account of Jackson's experience raising children in the 50's is both heart-warming and hilarious.

She was the sole supporter of her family (her husband, Stanley Edgar Hyman, taught one or two classes aty Bennington, cheated on his wife and allowed her to support them while doing all of the domestic work.)Jackson manages to capture the essence and personality of each individual child and by writing their nonsense words with respect and seriousness which laugh over and over because everyone one of us who has been a parent has been there.Because Jackson is like Faulkner, Poe, Miller and Dickens, her words have not been alterred, so cocktails are consummed cigaretttes are lighted and spankings are judiciously administered. Jackson is a combination between Erma Bombeck and Henry James as her other fiction delves into physcological levels of human behavior never before studied in fiction.This book will make anyone laugh but anyone who has dealt with children, lived in a small town or been forced to cope with furnaces that die and cars that won't start, Jackson is able to write with wit and hysteria.Shirley Jackson is the best writer to have ever lived and if you're tentative, \\"Life Among The Savages\\" is an excellent place to start.Get yourself a foothold before you read, \\"The Lottery\\". Had Jackson only written that single 1400 word story she would never ever be forgotten. Then \\"we Have Always Lived in The Castle\\" Then her second comedy autobiography, \\"Raising Demons.\\"\\"Savages\\" may not be Jackson's favorite work, but I've read it dozens of times in the past thirty years and promise you that it deservss two stars for every one I gave it. Here is how Shirley Jackson announces to a mid 1950's reading audience that she is pregnant:\\"A WHAT?\\" said Laurie,\\"What FOR?\\" asked Jannie."},{"Title":"Life Among the Savages","review":"Almost everyone remembers Shirley Jackson's name for her short story \\"The Lottery,\\" a mainstay of American high school syllabi. Those who enjoy horror know her for The Haunting of Hill House. Today she is lesser known as a frequent magazine presence from the 1940s to her death in 1965, offering up humorous domestic scenes from her life in Vermont. Fortunately the first of her memoir-ish books, Life Among the Savages, is around to remind us that she was also a full time mother and housewife whose situation represented the societal norm just as much as it subverted it.If you are looking for Shirley Jackson the writer in these pages, she is a will-o-wisp. You glimpse her once when she is registering at the hospital about to give birth to her 3rd child circa 1948 (asked her occupation, she says \\"writer,\\" the administrator writes \\"housewife\\") and, presumably it was the writer trying to work who absentmindedly told her young daughter to give someone who came to the door a penny, not realizing it was the woman collecting the PTA dues. This book by far belongs to stories about her adventures as a mother and housewife. The kids are front and center. But you do see some of the inspiration for her vision of malfeasance lurking behind upright citizenry and everyday life in the sketches of her New England neighbors, and a teacher who takes her role as morality cop very seriously. And then there is the parade of dysfunctional household help. My favorite episode is the one in which Jackson takes her time setting up the scene of domestic organization almost like one of those old Reader's Digest logic puzzles (there are blue sheets in her son's room and pink in the baby's crib . . . .) and then traces everyone's peregrinations the night that the entire household was fitful with the flu, and awoke the next morning to complete and astonishing disarray.What I come away with most is what a foreign country our culture was in the late \`40s and early \`50s. Jackson is a chain smoker, right through her pregnancies. She and her husband moved from New York to a small town in Vermont without knowing how to drive. They kept the local taxi in business. When they do get a car, it's not a matter of buckling car seats in the back but which squirmy small child may ride up front, before the era of seat belts. Her oldest son certainly wasn't wearing a helmet when he whizzed around a bend on a bike and into a car, sustaining, among other injuries, a concussion. In respect to the genre of domestic comedy, though, Life Among the Savages resembles \\"Modern Family\\" and \\"Malcolm in the Middle\\" far more than the other family comedies of its own generation."},{"Title":"Life Among the Savages","review":".\\"Our house is old, noisy and full. When we moved into it we had two children and about five thousand books; when we finally overflow and move out again we will have perhaps twenty children and easily half a million books . . .\\"This is the beginning of the curiously powerful--and stealth-assault funny--LIFE AMONG THE SAVAGES (1952), memoirs of a Mommy, a Daddy, and a powerhouse-ful of children who give up post-World War II's overcrowded Manhattan housing market for roomier digs in a remote Vermont town. These are certainly life-with-kids family memoirs of the late 1940s and early 1950s, but to leave it at that would miss the point--like saying that Shirley Jackson's short story \\"The Lottery\\" is an anthropological study of a ritualistic New England town, or that THE ADVENTURES OF HUCKLEBERRY FINN is a treatise on rafting the Mississippi River before the Civil War.The author of LIFE AMONG THE SAVAGES is, in fact, Shirley Jackson, and this is the first half of her two comic novels about life with small children. (The latter half being the later, and unfortunately more difficult to find RAISING DEMONS, published in 1957.) I'm not revealing too much to pass on that the hick town just happens to be Bennington, Vermont, the one with the all-female college; and that the harried Papa taught there. And when Mommy climbed into bed late at night \\"with a mystery\\" there's a good chance she was working on one of her own stories and a portable typewriter, a pack of cigarettes and a snifter of brandy climbed into bed with her.In LIFE AMONG THE SAVAGES, even the most please-don't-eat-the-daisies events usually hide a shiv or a shiver somewhere amidst the sitcom. When the financially strapped family scrapes up enough cash for some day help, they interview and hire an escaped felon; later they tangle with a motorcycle mama, the ultimate Effie Klinker of negative IQ, and an over-the-top fundamentalist who frosted her cookies with \\"Repent, Sinner.\\" Not to mention: \\"From the girls' room, small voices rose in song, and I listened happily, thinking how pleasant it was,\\" reminisces la Jackson. \\"[Just later] I was out of bed in one leap and racing down the hall. 'Baby ate a spider, Baby ate a spider,' was what they were singing.\\"Maybe it's just the mixed blessings of heredity--and all those thousands of books--that the marriage of a college professor and a celebrated author would produce a growing family of kids so bright, inquisitive, creative, and, um, let's call it individualistic. \\"I frequently call [daughter Jannie] Anne and her father very often calls her Jean. Her brother calls her Honey, Sis, and Dopey, Sally calls her Nannnie, and she calls herself, variously, Jean, Jane, Anne, Linda, Barbara, Estelle, Josephine, Geraldine, Sarah, Sally, Laura, Margaret, Marilyn, Susan, and--imposingly--Mrs. Ellenoy. The second Mrs. Ellenoy. . . [M]y husband . . . is addressed in all variants of father from Pappy to Da, even--being a man not easily thrown off balance--Mr. Ellenoy.\\" Son Laurie was so incensed by his temporary amnesia following his bicycle's crash with a car that he made the ambulance driver run HOME with the lights and siren on, \\"an extremely proud Jannie sitting beside him and traffic separating on either side.\\"Was life fair to Shirley Jackson? Well, she did produce (and by this book's end) four radiant children, two boys and two girls, all spaced an even three years apart. And she hung her laundry in the basement to dry, just like her neighbors told her to, after the backyard clothes line had flung it indignantly to the ground several times. But the nurses at the hospital were SO cross at her for yelling when she was in deep labor with Sally. And she got blacklisted by the PTA when Jannie said there was a woman at the door who wanted a dollar and Shirley, upstairs painting, assumed it was just another of Jannie's invisible friends . . .Sadly, Shirley Jackson, person and author, later on became too dependent on chocolate, liquor, cigs and even amphetamines and did not live to see her fiftieth birthday. But while she was alive she gave us a treasury of suspense and horror fiction. Equally worth celebrating, I think, are LIFE AMONG THE SAVAGES and RAISING DEMONS. Funny as Hell, and occasionally funny like Hell. My lit-chat group ran into LIFE AMONG THE SAVAGES two years ago and despite initial misgivings based on its genre, unanimously loved it."},{"Title":"Life Among the Savages","review":"I generally hate domestic plots or cutesy toddlers but Shirley Jackson, with her wry sense of humor, helped me to really like this book. Sure, it is outdated but many of the absurd situations and attitudes still apply and it gives you a good middle class view of that period. Recommended!"},{"Title":"Life Among the Savages","review":"Shirley Jackson's wicked humour (don't miss the story of &quot;Charles,&quot; for example) kept me laughing, and it was especially refreshing to step into a (let's face it, far more realistic) world where children could have a score of imaginary playmates (the family of Mrs Ellenoy), a son could be a bit of a discipline problem, the baby could eat a spider ... and no one ran to the self-help aisle or shrink just because kids were kids.I had assumed that this was a biographical work, with the adventures just a bit exagerrated, until I read Shirley's (excellent) biography &quot;Private Demons.&quot; Somehow, the stories were not as funny when I came to know that some of them were fiction, merely based on the children's traits.This tale will never bore, and will give anyone a good dose of laughter. Perhaps those who now have children of the age which Shirley's were then will relax a bit realising that raising children was never a joy ride - but there is no need, today, to make it more difficult than it has to be."},{"Title":"Life Among the Savages","review":"This book entertained me as a kid and as an adult. I'll be sharing it with my kids. The book focuses on the life of a family growing up in the 40's. It is written by the great writer, Shirley Jackson. The comedy rivals Erma Bombeck's and the stories are funny, heartwarming and clever."},{"Title":"Life Among the Savages","review":"At one time, Shirley Jackson was both the scariest and the funniest writer in America. This book may come as a surprise to fans of &quot;The Lottery&quot;, but don't neglect it on that account; it's still vintage Jackson, complete with a rambling old house (this time not haunted). This is hands down the funniest book about raising children ever written; somehow it manages to treat children as surreal and other (the savages of the title) without ever being condescending. The sequal, _Raising Demons_, isn't quite as good, but is still well worth the read."},{"Title":"Life Among the Savages","review":"Shirley Jackson NAILS the atmoshpere of family life... the strange quirks of children that are accepted as normal by parents who are both good natured and over whelmed by the unending demands of parenthood and the mysterious events that happen in every family --- like where did the pink blanket go?"},{"Title":"Life Among the Savages","review":"I grew up reading and rereading this book, as did all the five children in my family. It's one of the very funniest books I know on the subject of families and their foibles. Shirley Jackson is so well known for her more macabre and adult writing that people are usually skeptical when I recommend this for its outstandingly intelligent humor. Once you read this you must also read Raising Demons, which is the sequel, and every bit as good, although much harder to find."},{"Title":"Life Among the Savages","review":"I have read many of Shirley Jackson's mystery novels and loved all of them!But, when my mom suggested that i read this book and said that it was funny, i thought she was being sarcastic, but i laughed from the time i opened the book until i read the last page."},{"Title":"Life Among the Savages","review":"The premise of the book sounded humourous, and the book proved even more so. At many times it was laugh-out-loud funny. The Great Grippe Mystery is hysterical. It's refreshing to read of life where neither adult could drive a car and Mom must borrow from the child's piggy bank for the $1 fee charged by the furnace man to start the furnace, all the while knowing this woman wrote &quot;The Lottery&quot;"},{"Title":"Life Among the Savages","review":"First read this in high school. My sisters and I used to read the chapters back and forth to each other and get hysterical. Shirley Jackson had an unusual family and certainly knew how to present them to the reader. I loved the story of Charles and Jannie's teacher Mrs. Skinner. Have reread it many times since and it continues to hold up well. This is a lot of fun!"},{"Title":"Down in the Garden","review":"Ms. Geddes fills her large, oversized color pages with stunning pictures of a whimsical garden populated by babies. Her tiny models appear as fairies, flowers, insects, birds, and other small animals in the garden. Her imagination will transform the way you see babies . . . and gardens forever. You'll be glad to have experienced her magical touch.The images are enlivened by simple texts of a few words just to help create a mood or a thought.The compositions are quite elaborate. One contains dozens of children dressed up in worm outfits, and then transposed onto an image of them all in tunnels underground in the garden. What an amazing effort this must have taken!One of her presentation techniques is to have a photograph inside a photograph. For example, there is a two page spread of a basket. Then, you can unfold the middle of the basket to reveal its babyish contents! In another place, she plays peek-a-boo with you by hiding one image within the photograph under a flap which you can open. When you do, the photograph's meaning totally changes.As wonderful as her imagination and compositions are, I think her finest gift is to capture the baby's personality while awake.The quality of the reproductions is extremely high, particularly considering that she is working with squirming infants in many cases.Here are my favorites in the book:Moth Orchid Triplets; Monica; Christopher; Aisha, Tayla and Grace; Wet Sparrow; Magnolia Bud; Sarah; Potting Shed; Starring Triplets -- Jim, Flora and Pearl; Window Planter; Strawberry Planter; Canterbury Belles; Ruby; Tea Pot, Watering Can and Milk Jug; Birdhouse; and Jessie.This book would make a wonderful gift for expectant parents. They would suddenly feel their budding love for the developing baby evolve in new ways.After you enjoy this book, consider where else a little magic and a dash of fantasy can create good feelings that will lead to more love and caring. How can you add those elements?Enjoy the perpetual freshness of birth and youth around you!"},{"Title":"Down in the Garden","review":"If you love babies, this book is a must have!

Her prehistoric &quot;cutsie&quot; images, though appealing to a kitsch market, do not allow for a social comment to transcend the visual confines of her exploitive commercial &quot;photography&quot;. In some senses, she could be seen as a radical post-modernist artist, as she abstracts the subject from social normality and removes any dignity from the development of the child, if that was her so calling in contemporary art. Yet it is frightening to be in an age where people will grasp such superficially degrading images. Geddes has made a personal fortune off photographing babies, subjects usually positioned in inhumane circumstances (ie: babies in flowerpots or dipped in custard), which removes human dignity and allows us to question Geddes moral intent."},{"Title":"Hidden Manna","review":"The book is inspiring, encouraging and thought provoking - very nice.

Just in the month of January: The New York Jets defeat the Baltimore Colts in the Super Bowl.

Chalkboards are still black. And sometime in 1969 Martha Alexander publishes her first \\"Blackboard Bear,\\" a paean to imaginary friends.The premise is simple and simply related mostly through illustrations (also by Alexander): Little brother wants to play with big brother and his friends, but, of course, is too little. The final insult: \\"Go play with your teddy bear.\\"Little brother is so hurt and disappointed that he throws teddy bear out the window (Remember in 1969 when we still left windows open?)Now then, let's get serious. Pop into his head--the idea of an imaginary bear wearing a fierce red collar. A bear amenable ONLY to little brother's thoughts and desires. Hold my bear's leash? Not a chance. Pat my bear? No way. Ride my bear? \\"He only wants me to ride him.\\"Pay-backs. Imagination can do that. Is this a mean book? Not in any sense.

Alex saves the world.The reason why I did like this book is because I love books where people go on missions to hunt the villain. Some reasons why I did not like this book is because it didn't seem very realistic. There is no way that Alex's buddies from the CIA found him in Sarov's secret dungeon. But even though it wasn't realistic I would recommend this book to anyone who likes action books."},{"Title":"Skeleton Key","review":"This book is by far better than the first two Alex Rider adventures. It deals with a plot that is far more complex and worldwide than the ones in the first two novels. Joining forces woth the CIA, Alex Rider investigates a former soviet general who both M16 and the CIA think is up to something. Again, Alex discovers another world shaking plot, but this time involving nuclear weapons. Again the suspence, action, and mystery drive this novel, as in the first two books. But this time it makes up enough for the sub-par writing so that I give it 5 stars."},{"Title":"Skeleton Key","review":"Good for junior high students. Fun for adults as well.

Alex is still reluctant to spy on others, but he is finding himself doing another's job. This action adventure brings life to reading because of the author. Anthony Horowitz is a great author that is writing this great series of books. He details actions with selective words. I liked the book so much I bought it. I recommend it for 10 and up.The skeleton Keys surrounds you and captures you while you read it. It details in Alex's relationships with others. Sabina is a friend of Alex's that plays a big part. When Alex finds a mysterious clue at a tennis game, he senses something big. Alex continues on to find a rogue soviet that lost his son.

I am one of the few child Kindle owners, and surprised at the somewhat limited selection. But it's good that they have theese books, at any rate.I am looking at the actual paper-and-ink version sitting in my bookcase.Alex is a very logical, mature charachter. He knows how to get things done in the spy world, a world where everyone is suspect and no one is ever your partner for long. The situations he gets himself into are suspenseful, to say the least.I like how the author seems to demonstrate all the knowledge that he wants his charachter to have. For instance, when Alex was diving, he observed all of the correct diving protocall. If Alex would have headed straight for the surface from his depth, he would have gotten the bends. However, I believe that Alex was diving partnerless? I'm not sure, but I think you are supposed to always dive with a partner. Maybe Alex was going against the rules (again). Not that his going against the rules is bad in most cases. Obviously.&#34;Ryan&#34; has probably already written a review on one of these books, expressing his hatred of them, and I wouldn't blame him. Some parts of the Alex Rider books seemed slightly childish to me, and to him they must seem downright ridiculous.Perfect for the gifted fifth grader or the average sixth or seventh grader. Maybe not so much for the gifted seventh graders (or the average tenth graders as it were)."},{"Title":"Skeleton Key","review":"I keep reading these books because I like that the characters are sneaky and mysterious. My first impression about the character was that Alex was a courageous and strong kid. He completed 3 dangerous missions in the past and survived. I think that is incredible. There was a lot of description and conversations in the book. He even talked to professional spies or killers. The author describes very well by using many figurative languages like similes and metaphors. One day I read for 80 minutes. I'm going to tell you a brief summary of the book. Alex Rider go sent on a mission to find a nuclear weapon that can destroy Russia in 1 blow. When Alex was snooping around for some clues, he saw a killer that he had faced in the past. He got caught but he found the mastermind behind the evil plot. After this brief summary I hope you would read this book. I thought this was one of the best Alex Rider book I have ever read. I don't really like mystery books, but this book changed my mind. This book is a thrilling adventure and I would definently read other books by this author."},{"Title":"Skeleton Key","review":"I am an English teacher reviewing this series for student consumption.

I was sooooo amazed at how anthony horowitz once again, captures so much action in one book! I absolutlely LOVE this series because its so enjoyable to read and also because it never gets boring! I'm a girl and although this book would probably seem more apealing to guys, i would HIGHLY suggest this book and the rest of its series to any girl out there! If you want to read this book i would recomend reading the first two first (stormbreaker, point blank/blanc)"},{"Title":"Skeleton Key","review":"Skeleton Key is about a fourteen-year-old spy named Alex Rider. Alex works for MI6. It is a spy company in London, England. He is really useful to MI6 because he is young and no one would suspect a fourteen-year-old as being a spy. Alex is a very brave and adventurous boy. He is sent on another mission to stop a Russian General, Alexei Sarov. Alex usually works for MI6 in London, but in Skeleton Key he is sent to help the CIA in America. Two CIA agents and and Alex go to Skeleton Key, an island right near Cuba. This is where Sarov lives. All three of them are supposed to look like a family just enjoying themselves on vacation. The CIA is suspicious about Sarov and believes he has a nuclear bomb. Sarov wanted to use this bomb to conquer the world. Read the rest of the book to find out all about the action and adventures that Alex Rider experiences in trying to capture this evil man. This book was great because of all the action that is has. It keeps your attention and is hard to put down. This is the third book in the Alex Rider series and I think that this book was the best!"},{"Title":"Skeleton Key","review":"Alex Rider has worked for MI6 but now the CIA. Alex is to pretend that he is the son of two CIA agents when they go on a mission on an island called Skeleton Key. Alex was told that this would just be a surveillance mission but when the two CIA agents go missing he thinks it is something else. He figures out that General Sarov, a man who lives on the island, has a nuclear bomb and is planning to blow up part of Russia. Can Alex stop him before it's to late.Anthony Horowitz is a great author. He is good at getting you interested in the book at the very start. At the start of Skeleton Key Alex is a ball boy at the Wimbledon Tennis Cup. He is suspicious of a guard because he is always around when the players drink water out of a certain place. Alex figures out the problem and takes the guard out."},{"Title":"Skeleton Key","review":"This book is Part 3 of the 6-part (so far) Alex Rider Adventure Series, starring Alex Rider, and fourteen-year-old James Bond. MI6 (The CIA of England) sends Alex on his third mission. Though this time, it's tougher, because he's dealing with a convincing madman, General Sarov, an ex general of Communist Russia. Sarov has purchased uranium to build a nuclear bomb, which he is using to \\"perge the world and make it healthier and stronger\\". Alex must deal with Sarvov and his assistant; deformed ex-terrorist Conrad, in order to save the world from sure destruction! He is sent in with two CIA agents, Troy and Carver, who are unsure of his abilities. The plot gets more intense and emotional in this one though, because Alex is growing and the missions have a more depressing effect on him. Sarov is a beautiful bad guy (one of Horowitz's masterful creations)and he is so evil but also so emotionally ustable (he has lost everything he cares about) that you can't help feeling sorry for him. This book is the darkest of the three, but also the most action-packed. Get ready for a bumpy ride as the series takes a darker turn."},{"Title":"Skeleton Key","review":"If you like action packed novels, boy, you should definitely pick up this book!Alex Rider is a 14-year-old spy sent on his third mission.

My class read it as a Literature circle book and I chose to review it for everyone to read. When you read \\"Skeleton Key\\" I would suggest being in a very quiet place where you can concentrate because it is very exciting.First of all, this is the third book in a series called \\"The Alex Rider Adventures\\". Reading the third book first can really mess you up with the rest of the series. Read the first one and then go on with the rest of the series. The first book in the series is called \\"Stormbreaker\\". The rest of the books in the series are: \\"Point Blank\\", \\"Skeleton Key\\" and \\"Eagle Strike\\".When you start reading \\"Skeleton Key\\" you might think that everything is just being thrown at you and it is kind of confusing. At the very beginning there is a flashback that will seem weird to you because it's not what you think it is. I made predictions with my Lit. Circle(Literature Circle)group. We found that one prediction had to be the true one- that the driver of the plane was Ian Rider, Alex Riders Uncle. After starting the first book- \\"Stormbreaker\\"- myself, I found out it wasn't his uncle. Which was really a surprise.Now, back to the story. Alex rider is a fourteen-year-old boy who has lost his parents and his uncle. No one in his family is willing and ready to take care of him. His uncle had taken care of him for sometime. Alex's uncle was a spy. Ian Rider was Alex's guardian for a while, so the spy business had been passed down to him. The spy place took care of him and watched him. Alex doesn't want to be a spy and wishes he had never become one. The only problem was, He had no choice and he couldn't back down.In this book there are two missions, the spy place-M16 has assigned him. The first was a fun job because he got front row seats in a tennis tournament. He was assigned to be a ball boy and find out what was going on there. He went there and found out something he never thought would be there. It was very strange and he didn't know who did it. Once he told M16 and the cops they found out who and why the person did this.The second mission is the main part of the story. It is very important. Alex has to go to America on a spy mission for them. America's own two people- Belinda Troy and Glen Carver, go on the mission with Alex to Cayo Esqueleto, which means Skeleton Key. Alex and the two spies go to the Island as a family and stay there for two weeks. Something terrible happens to the spies twice. Alex finds out what's going on and saves the worlds from any harm.I enjoyed this book so much, but I think if you are going to read it you should read \\"Stormbreaker\\" and \\"Point Blank\\" first. It will make \\"Skeleton Key\\" much clearer. I hope you enjoyed reading my review. You should really read \\"The Alex Rider Adventures\\". They are very enjoyable, breath taking, and suspenseful. So, sit back and relax while you read \\"Skeleton Key\\"."},{"Title":"Skeleton Key","review":"Alex is back again, in the third book of his many adventures!

Good job Anthony Horowitz."},{"Title":"Skeleton Key","review":"This was an unbelievable book. It was acted out brilliantly, every last detail thought out by the author. This book avoids the horrible clich&eacute;s of most teen spy books admirably, not having one favor of romance over action. Alex's wry sense of humor and the U.S.-England jokes and insults are amusing as well. The book is easy enough to understand on its own, though you may want to read the first two books to get the whole story. I highly recommend this series."},{"Title":"Skeleton Key","review":"Skeleton key is full of gut busting action like when alex rider a young secret agent blows up a boat of a arms dealer.

Well if you have this book is exactly like that but instead of James Bond, It is a 14 year old boy named Alex.In the beginning Alex is confronted by a person who wants him to go to a tennis tournament to see what's wrong there. Alex finds himself being chased by a Chinese triad. After all that Alex went to an island Skeleton Key but he doesn't need to do any thing but act like the son of two CIA members. At the island Skeleton key many things go wrong...Alex is a very smart boy. He always knows what to do. He is a normal England kid. Alex is a little stubborn because when they asked him if he would take the mission, It took a while for him to say yes.I especially liked the part where Alex was at the tennis tournament. I thought it was a very suspenseful part.This book was okay. I think that the other books in the series are better and were more enjoyable. I think that this book is good for people 12 to 14 because I think that the age group would like the plot of a teenage spy. They could also relate a lot to what is happening to Alex."},{"Title":"Skeleton Key","review":"Skeleton Key is about a boy named Alex Rider who saves the world. I thought this was a really good book. It was filled with many adventures and many life threatening events. Alex has to save the world with only a few small gadgets.This book is a sequel to two previous books in the series. In each of the books Alex saves the world through very exciting and entertaining adventures. Since this was the third book in the series, it was obvious that Alex would once again win over his enemies. Overall, I thought this was a very well written book."},{"Title":"Skeleton Key","review":"Skeleton Key was a very good action or mystery book. Alex Rider a junior secret agent really made it like a young James Bond book. It provided excitement and non-stop action. It was in my opinion the best book out of the first two of this series of Alex Rider novels. This book was a good book and i would recomend it."},{"Title":"Skeleton Key","review":"Alex Rider is a 14-year-old boy turned spy by M16, the British Intelligence Agency and he has already been on two adventures: Stormbreaker and Point Blank. At the beginning of Skeleton Key, Alex is invited to be a ball boy at Wimbledon and meets a ball girl named Sabrina Pleasure. He learns that the Chinese mafia is drugging some of the players so they can bet on the winner and make money. Alex fights and stops them and soon after, Sabrina invites him on a vacation to Cornwall, where he was in his first adventure. While Alex is surfboarding, another agent from the Chinese mafia tries to kill him, Alex jumped off just in time to grab the gun and save himself while killing the agent. Sabrina saved Alex and M16 took him away to go on another mission. On this mission Alex learns that a general named Sarov from the USSR has bought a lot of weapon grade Uranium. He goes to the Island of Skeleton Key with two agents that act as his parents. In his hotel he finds out that the game boy advance that his \\"mother\\" bought for him is actually a Geiger counter that tracks down a nuclear bomb. Alex foils Sarov's plan of destroying Russia to rebuild it the way Sarov wants it to be.Skeleton Key is not my favorite of the Alex Rider books because the book did not have a real evil villain. For example, the villain tried to adopt Alex, which led to his death. What I did like about the book is that it contained some good gadgets like a stun grenade that looks like a Tiger Woods figure, a cell phone with poison darts and another is bubble gum called bubble07. What I like about Alex Rider as a character is that he takes the aspect of a normal British 14 year old and at the same time he is like a young James Bond. He makes it seem like his adventures could really happen because the plots are similar to what is happening when the book was being written. The books' ending was disappointing because I didn't like that the bad guy had a heart and cared about Alex.The author writes in a way that the reader is included in the book as the narrator. For example, when I read this book I felt like the narrator was me, as if my voice was narrating the story. The book uses a lot of descriptive words, which gives the book a strong setting. The dialogue is very \\"James Bondish\\". Alex is able to stay cool in many situations. The book is easy to read because the plot is interesting.In comparing this book to the other Alex Rider books that I have finished reading, this book is my least favorite book because it doesn't have as good as a plot as the other ones and he didn't have as good of gadgets. I would still recommend it to anyone reading the Alex Rider series.Skeleton Key is not the best of the Alex Rider books, but it is a good one. I think the author could have improved it by making a better villain and \\"upgrading\\" The gadgets. This book had a moral about fathers: The only one that's right is your real one."},{"Title":"Skeleton Key","review":"If your looking for a good book to read for English class, I think I found one for you. The book Skeleton Key is a great book that keeps you reading. The beginning is slow but don't stop reading there! Once you get into the book a little more, it gets to be a very exciting book! This is a mystery book with a 14-year-old boy as a spy, which keeps it interesting because you are the same age as the main character. I am the type of student that does not like to read books if I don't have too, but for the assignment I just did I read half of the book then turned in a paper and the project was over. But, I didn't return the book I actually finished the book even though I didn't have to.

Actually, anyone who enjoys a great spy thriller and very little outright graphic violence would absolutely LOVE this series. Not since Harry Potter have I had such fun!\\"Skeleton Key\\" is the third in the series about Alex Rider, a 14-year-old English school boy, who works as a spy for M16, the U.S.'s equivalent of the CIA. Not that he wants to work as a spy--oh no, he does not, but M16 manages to entangle him every time in a new episode in which, bottom line, he saves the world. That's three times now that he has done so.The first time was \\"Stormbreaker,\\" set in the Cornish coast of England, involving a computer scheme unlike any you have heard of. Alex triumphs spectacularly! The second time was \\"Point Blank,\\" set in an elite school for highly privileged and troubled youth. The school is set on Point Blank in Switzerland. Another, no, make that two spectacular endings in this book!Let me say that what Anthony Horowitz creates for Alex to know and do are truly preposterous--if you logically examine the plot, but, I'm telling you also truthfully, that Horowitz's skill at writing is such that the reader believes these things CAN happen. Example: Alex must board a departing yacht and does so on skateboard by ramping up a plank, hurtling through air, just barely grasping the handrail, and pulling himself up and over. Allow me to explain: In book one, Horowitz laid the back story to show that Alex was trained in many areas by his uncle, who was a M16 spy, unbeknownst to Alex.In Book Three, \\"Skeleton Key,\\" Alex's new assignment is working with two agents from the CIA to explore a mansion on the tip of an island, Skeleton Key, owned by a retired Soviet general, who has serious hanky-panky in mind. It involves uranium and an atomic bomb.The yacht-leaping takes place in this story. However, Alex is thwarted several times in this adventure, showing the reader that Alex cannot elude every case of danger.An atomic bomb, world domination, a mad general, and one more put-together Frankenstein assistant. Can a 14-year-old boy handle those? That is absolutely the fun of reading this series--you know he will, but you don't know how!Highly recommended!!This is a series that needs to be read in order for the back story, which builds with each book. To begin:1.Alex Rider: Stormbreaker tie-in novel (Alex Rider Movie)2.Point Blank (Alex Rider Adventures)There are currently eight books in the series. Horowitz plans a total of ten."},{"Title":"Skeleton Key","review":"this is one of the best books i have read in my 11 years i picked this book up and read it with all my free time. it was filled with everything kid likes to read. its was scary, adventure filled and best of all it was action and crazy. i reccomed this book to people who are 11 and older."},{"Title":"Skeleton Key","review":"I thought this book was one of the best. It's not my most favorite book of the Alex Rider books but I still thought it was good. I liked how Horowitz used the CIA instead of the MI6, the MI6 was getting old. If you have read the other books, then I say you should read Skeleton Key along with the others that follow. If you like action and adventure books then I say you read the Alex Rider books (but start from the first book, Stormbreaker). This book is one of the weirder ones but its still good, sometimes weird is good.Review writen by Sadie Francis"},{"Title":"Skeleton Key","review":"This is a great story, again Anthony Horowitz has us on the egde of our seats.The story has a very similair theme to the Young James bond book Hurricane Gold. In Skeleton Key Alex Rider and Hurricane Gold Young James Bond, both teen hereos are on a hot tropical island owned by a villian, both villians want to adopt the young teen heros, despite the youngsters trying to spoil there plans. Both villians let the boys go. However both are fast paced and good reading. Its a shame they have followed the same pathm but if you are into Alex Rider, Jason Steed, Cherub and Young James Bond this is still a great book."},{"Title":"Skeleton Key","review":"Anthony Horowitz has done another fantastic job with the third novel to the alex rider series. Skeleton Key (the sequel to stormbreaker and Point Blanc) is filled with action and suspence. \\"Puzzled, he looked up. And froze. He actually felt the air stop somwhere at the back of his throat... He wanted to scream. But underwater, it isn't possible to scream. He was looking at a great white shark.\\"(pg 154) Along with meeting a great white alex is is nearly shot sevrel times, almost run through a grinder on a convayor belt, and diving of a burning ship. Alex saves the world again, this time from a russian, General Sarrov.I would recomend this book to anyone, because it was awesome! Some people said that it was not as good as the first two and I disagree. I thought it was better!"},{"Title":"Skeleton Key","review":"When I read the Alex Rider book, Stormbreaker, I thought it was really cool with cool gadgets. I thought it was really cool being a spy, and what kinda adventures you have. Then, I read Point Blanc, I thought it was really exciting... Then, I had to wait a loooong time for Skeleton Key, cuz I couldn't buy it, So I had to put on hold in library. Then, I finally got it... I read the end.. :) I freaked out of the fact that Alex had a girlfriend, Then I actually read the book. I realized that Alex is hurt, without a family, and no one to actually spill out. I thought it was completely weird Alex didn't really talk about his friends, his best friends. Then, in this book I realized that he is lonely, and he deserves to have a girlfriend. I wouldn't be suprised if the author wouldn't write the next book. And then again, I wouldn't be suprised if he did write the book, because he put us in a place like that!! In all, I recommend you to read the book, it has alot of depth."},{"Title":"Skeleton Key","review":"Skeleton Key, the sequel to Point Blank (2002) and Stormbreaker (2001), it is even better than both of its predecessors. A perfect combination of suspense, surprise, and humor, this book is likley to entertain all who read it. Alex Rider, a seemingly normal, fourteen-year-old boy (Except that he is a spy working for M16.), goes on a journey to Cayo Esqueleto. Skeleton Key. It is on the coast of Cuba. He is told by M16's Alan Blunt that he is just going on a vacation there because he got into trouble with a gang in China after beating up two of their members at Wimbledon. He highly doubts this, and for good reason. His partners, his disguise mom and dad, give him a Gameboy Advance to play on the plane. When he finds a geiger counter (a nuclear weapon finding tool) in the gameboy, he gets suspicious. When he knows what is going on he goes with them to an underwater cave called Devil's Chimney that is a secret passage to the \\"Golden House\\" (Casa De Oro)where the villan, General Alexei Sarov lives. His \\"parents\\" soon find out that it's not so \\"secret\\" when they find a great white shark and fake staglamites and stalacimites that shred people to nothing and leads to a bone-crunching garbage disposal. Alex follows but narrowly escapes. He is then taken captive by General Sarov and figures out that he is like Vladmir, Sarov's son who died in war at the age of 16, from what Sarov describes. Sarov then wants to adopt Alex. While stuck in a mansion full of guards and a bodyguard named Conrad just waiting to shred him to pieces, not to mention a dangerous, yet caring, madman with a nuclear bomb and a plan to blow up a whole region of the world. An adventure that spreads all over the world, from the streets of England, to the hot beaches of Miami, all the way to the frozen tundra of the northernmost parts of Russia. Read the book to find out the ending to this story, because I don't like to spoil endings."},{"Title":"Skeleton Key","review":"...Skelteon Key is the third sequel in the Alex Rider Adventures.

I will read more of the Alex Rider books as they come out."},{"Title":"Skeleton Key","review":"Anthony Horowitz wrote Skeleton Key, a book in which MI6 asks Alex Rider to find out who is trying to destroy the Wimbledon tennis championships. The Triad gang, a group of Chinese men tries to kill Alex. He is forced to hide on an island called Skeleton Key in the Bay of Pig's. General Sarov lives on this island. He is a crazy Russian General who plans to take over Eastern Europe with a nuclear bomb. Alex stops him using gadgets that MI6 operative Smithers gives him. Sarov's helper, Conrad, hates Alex and tries to kill him several times. The fourteen year old kills a great white shark, fights a triad gang member on a PWC, blows up a yacht, and escapes from a Russian General.This book's genre is an action/adventure. This is the fourth book in the series. To really understand it you would have to read the other three. People that have already read some of the Alex Rider series would enjoy it and people that like this sort of genre would also like it. I finished this book the day I got it. It was really easy to read and fun."},{"Title":"Skeleton Key","review":"These are excellent books! It always keeps you wanting to know more. But that stands out from the rest of the series,Skeleton Key.The action in this book is very suspensful,like pee your pants suspense.Also the main character,Alex,never changes in personality so you dont have to get used to the same makn character all over again(Artemis Fowl!).Even though there is a lack of new characters it can be easily overlooked."},{"Title":"Skeleton Key","review":"Skeleton KeyBy:Anthony HorowitzReviewed by: S. KimPeriod:P.3This adventure series is about a fourteen year-old boy, who happens to be a spy for the british government agency, M16. In this book he prevents a Russian military leader from activating a nuclear bomb, strong enough to infect all of Europe. This military leader is named Sarov, and he wants revenge or so, because he had lost his only son, and wants to make Russia #1 again.I have enjoyed all of the Alex Rider adventures, because I feel suspense and other books don't satisfy me as well as this one.The one thing that I wonder about is that there wasn't a preview of the next book!I still like it, but is this the end? I hope not, because I want to find out what happens to Alex Rider.The one thing I dislike about the book is that I have to wait so long just to read the next book.By the time I read this book I have waited for about two months!That is probably the only thing that I dislike about this book.My favorite part of the book is when Alex fights against Sarov's henchman Conrad, who isn't at all handsome, but can make a deadly nuclear bomb.The suspense I get from reading this book is intense, and it makes me read more and more even I have to go to bed. The part I dislike about this book is when Sarov recaptures Alex, who almost escaped and tried to call for help.That made me dumbfound.Overall, I believe that this is a good action book and whoever enjoys actio should read it."},{"Title":"Skeleton Key","review":"Skeleton KeySkeleton Key is a sequel to the action books \\"Stormbreaker\\" and \\"Point Blank\\". Now Alex (a 14 year old boy) is on another adventure. Here is why you should read it.The action never stops in this book. Toward the beginning Alex was almost hit by a forklift. And toward the middle of the book, Alex is almost crushed to death is a sugar factory. In Skeleton Key there are more twists and turns than the other books in the series. In this one Alex teams up with two CIA agents. There is nothing like that in the others. Also, Skeleton Key is about 75-100 pages longer than \\"Stormbreaker\\" or \\"Point Blank\\". This makes more room for gunmen, killer sharks, special weapons, assassins, and more time to save the world from the Russian general Sarov and his assistant Conrad.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes \\"Stormbreaker\\" and \\"Point Blank\\". And to anyone who likes spy novels."},{"Title":"Skeleton Key","review":"Without reading this book you have not read one of the greatest mysteries ever!

Another Alex Rider adventure.The story's antagonist, General Sarov, has purchased a nuclear bomb as part of an elaborate plan that unfolds throughout the length of the novel. Alex Rider, teenage spy for MI6, is persuaded once again to lend his services to Britain's military intelligence service. He's offered a two-week job at the Wimbledon Tennis Finals but nearly gets killed by one of the most vicious Chinese triads in all of England. Alan Blunt, the director of MI6 Special Operations, offers Alex a chance to \\"get away\\"-to Skeleton Key-and work with the C.I.A. for two weeks. \\"You can look on the whole thing as a vacation,\\" Blunt says. But what starts out as a vacation soon becomes a nightmare taking Alex half wary around the globe to Murmansk, Russia.Skeleton Key is action packed and would make an evening of television or a trip to the movies seem dull by comparison. The good guys survive (or at least most of them do), and the bad guys, well, let's just say the bad guys get what they deserve...Alex Rider. And Alex definitely knows what to do with bad guys."},{"Title":"Skeleton Key","review":"I read the book Skeleton Key by Anthony Horowitz. The book is about a kid name Alex rider who is a spy.

Carter and Troy are killed and Alex stays with Sarov in his house. While Alex is staying with Sarov he find out that Sarov has a nuclear weapon and intends to use it so Russia can once again gain power. Alex has to find a way to stop Sarov.The main character in the book is Alex Rider. Alex is 14 years old. Alex is very brave because the missions he goes on are life threatening. Alex and I are both the same age. We both are active and like to play sports. We are different because i am not a spy.I liked this book a lot. It is very exciting and different from other books. I don't have a favorite part, I enjoyed the whole book. I would definitely recommend this book to a friend."},{"Title":"Skeleton Key","review":"The book I read is about a teenage boy that gets mixed up in the M16.

After this he is tricked into going to Cuba with the CIA disguised as a teen with his mom and dad. This book kept my attention the whole time. I hate to read and I could read this book with no problem and not get bored. If you are into action things then this book would be a good one to pick up because the main character is a teen and there is never a dull moment."},{"Title":"Skeleton Key","review":"very interesting, lots of action, fun filledlots of teenagers like this book because of james bond tendenciesi would recommend storm breaker and point blank by anthony horowitz for other spy action books"},{"Title":"Skeleton Key","review":"The book that I read was called Skeleton Key Anthony Horowitz. This book is about a boy named Alex Rider who is a spy for an agency in England called M16. He has already saved the world twice before his 15th birthday. This time Alex was sent to spy on an old Russian general named Sarov. Enough uranium to create a nuclear bomb that would destroy an entire country was recently purchased by Sarov. Alex went to spy on him and got captured. Sarov's plan was to detonate the bomb by four old submarines that hold 1/5 of the world's uranium supply. This would then cause about triple the amount of damage. After the bomb detonated, Sarov would bring Russia back to the old days when it was a war country and had much power in the world. Alex had to stop this from happening at all costs. Alex defuses the bomb and saves the world for the third time. He then heads off to visit his friend in the South of F France.I recommend this book to almost anyone. The people that would especially love this book would be the people that love adventure and high action books. This book is so thrilling you could literally fall off the edge of your seat by the intensity."},{"Title":"Skeleton Key","review":"I think Skeleton Key is a good book. It was good because it had a lot of action. At every turn there was something unexpected and exciting. They had new characters in this Skeleton Key that helped move the story along. Alex teams up with the CIA instead of just sticking with MI6. The new CIA agents, Carver and Troy, are a good change of pace. They are funny and interesting. Troy is tightwound and very work-oriented. Carver is funny and loose. Joining up with the CIA was a very different turn, for the good. Skeleton Key is a great book and I recommend you read it."},{"Title":"Skeleton Key","review":"Do secret agent books and James Bond interest you? This book has it all! All the secret agent goodies come in this Alex Rider journey. Explosions and gun fires are everywhere in this book. There's also a little mystery in this action-packed book.In the Skeleton Key, Alex Rider is tricked into another mission in Europe. Alex discovers a Chinese gang, the Triads. Alex is sent to an Island near Cuba as danger gets closer. The CIA must know what a Russian general is up to. Alex Rider defeats many enemies with his useful and disguised gadgets.I gave this book 5 stars because it has the most action out of all the books I have read. Also, the plot is somewhat realistic. The first chapter hooked me into the book and made me wonder what was going to happen next. The first action scene really caught my attention with the detail. The author described all the movements of the characters, because it helps visualize scene. The explosion descriptions were good.The protagonist of my book is Alex Rider. Alex was always a good person, even though his parents passed away. After his uncle passed away, he was a hard worker for the MI6, a secret government agency. He does not like talking about his parents or passed tragedies. Alex is friendly and very kind to others. Alex is unique because he is only a teenager, and he already works for the MI6 agency. Alex is clearly a protagonist when he investigates the Chinese gang member at the U.S. Open. The only secondary protagonists could be Alex's fake parents, because they help solve parts of the mysteries throughout the book.In one scene, Alex's \`parents' are being held for investigation. Alex was scared, because he was dealing with real terrorists with real guns. He remembered about his secret cell phone he got before he left for Skeleton Key. The phone had a built in stun gun. Alex stood up and walked behind the terrorist. Alex slammed the top of the phone onto the terrorist's neck. A blue electric line appeared and shocked the terrorist. The terrorist fell to the floor. Alex's \`parents' were surprised of what he did. They ran out of the room as quickly as possible.As I said before, it has it all. The Skeleton Key is packed with mystery, action, and suspense. This book will catch your attention. It has everything in the previous Alex Rider Adventures, and more! You will keep on reading until you know what happens at the end. The Skeleton Key is a perfect book for early teenagers that just love action and adventure. You don't want to miss the fantastic book."},{"Title":"Skeleton Key","review":"You don't have to be a guy to in joy this book, I'm not, but this is one of the best books I have every read!

Having to flee England after inadvertently dissing a Chinese gang called the Triads, thus having him go to the USA in Miami. This is where he meets the CIA, who want to know what a russian general is up to. So they send Alex along with 2 other agents to Cayo Esqueleto, or Skeleton Key.

So hurry and pick this up before the world comes to an end!!! &lt;-(hint hint hint)"},{"Title":"Skeleton Key","review":"As usual, great action and suspense. Better plot that makes more sense. And it makes more sense for them using Alex Rider this time. The ending is somewhat unsatisfying, but I'll tell you this much. Alex might have found romance. Alex kind of seems like he's corrupted in the end, in a way...a mild mild way. And you also learn to hate Alan Blunt if you haven't already. What lesson does it contain? NEVER JOIN CIA OR ANY OTHER SECRET SERVICE! Lolzers. Jk jk. But this book is probably the best of them all!"},{"Title":"Skeleton Key","review":"I read the first two Alex Rider books and enjoyed them very much. However, in my opinion, the quality of these books has decreased as the series progresses. I have not read the fourth or fifth book, but after my disappointing experience with the third I'm not sure I will.The first book is, by far, in my opinion, the best in the series. It was creative, induvidual, and engaging. The second book was a good enough book, but it lacked some of the creativity of the first- for example, 'Dr. Grief' is not the most imaginative name.The third book was most disappointing. It was not particularly engaging, and the plot was typical of other adventure stories. I hope Mr. Horowitz does Alex Rider his alloted justice in the further books of the series."},{"Title":"Skeleton Key","review":"this book can be a andrelanine pumper . the author has astomshingly created heart bombing twists with a tang edge to death. couldent be a better book."},{"Title":"Skeleton Key","review":"Thomas writes:This is an amazing book with lots of action.

A Russian General from a long time ago is planning to plant a nuclear bomb in Russia and kill millions of people. He has a twisted idea of how the world should be. Read this book to find out if Alex can stop the bomb from going off.

I won't go into detail about my topic, but I have to say that this was the only book that I used as my resource. I had other resources, but none of them compare to this book. It is beautifully written and developed. It isn't hard to understand and is very informative. From Jane Austen's birth to how the development of her author-self came about is shown. Also all info you would want to know about all of her major known works are in the book as well. It's seperated into chapters each being dedicated to a single book. In the chapters are interviews w/ well known jane austen historians, there are fun quizzes, in depth look at characters' personality, behavior, etc. .I had a wonderful time doing my term paper, because all the information I needed was in this book. It is really an aset for any jane austen fan to have. The book's fun, but serious manner doesn't put you to sleep, and makes it a great companion to have while reading or rewieving Austen's other books because at the start of every chapter is a summary as to what happens in the story the chapter is discussing. So incase you forget something about the story you have a refference right there w/ you.I really enjoyed this book and recommend it to all that want to learn about not only Austen's books (known &amp; unknown), but also about her life and family. It really is a great read and catch."},{"Title":"The Friendly Jane Austen","review":"I just happened upon this little gem at my local bookstore and after thumbing through the pages for about a minute, I knew I had to have it. The layout of the book is superb as it highlights each of Miss Austen's novels and gives facts, fun lists and quotations in a light-hearted yet interesting manner. There is something for the long-time fan as well as anyone new to the novels. A must-have for any Jane Austen fan and a fantastic resource for any book club reviewing a Jane Austen novel. Well done."},{"Title":"The Friendly Jane Austen","review":"Of all the references I have seen so far, this is the most complete as far as covering all of Jane Austen's personal life, the last 200 years of how other famous people saw her, a clear discussion of each of her novels, and how the many adaptations have had an impact in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. This book is must reading for oldtime fans of Jane and a great and full introduction for first time readers. Who can resist being a fan after reading this fine book? It deserves to be kept handy all the time."},{"Title":"The Friendly Jane Austen","review":"This fine little book is a great encyclopedia of Jane Austen, her life, all her works, impact on other writers, and on other forms of entertainment over the two centuries her works have been amongst us. I find it is frequently used as a resource for discussion. Those new to Jane Austen will get an excellent start in becoming a fan. The writing is lively, well illustrated and easily translated to the 21st century investigator."},{"Title":"The Friendly Jane Austen","review":"This is a book for Janeites of any sort, people who recognize where the &quot;truth universally acknowledged&quot; quote comes from (Pride and Prejudice, for those of you who didn't recognize it). Rather than write a book of essays for critics and scholars as is so often done, Tyler takes a different route and gives us a collection for readers. And, by and large, it works.We're treated to brief biographical sketches and moments, factoids, quizzes, interviews, and quotes. I have to admit that a few pieces seemed to me excessively flippant or tangential. Still, the majority were not only enjoyable but also provided insight into the Austen library and its relevance and influence.So why give it four stars? My only reservation about the book is that the reader must have read all of Austen's books to fully enjoy it. The chapters devoted to each of the books dig deep enough that having not read one or more is a major problem. As for me, the chapters devoted to Persuasion and Sanditon referred to characters and situations I only vaguely remembered. I had to go back and reread before I began to enjoy the supplementary material that Tyler so painstakingly put together.Is this a major problem? Probably not. After all, it's probably safe to assume that most readers are already firm Janeites, and we don't need much of a push to visit or revisit her world for a while. But is this, as the blurb on the back cover claims, a resource for new converts? Is it a good selection for someone who has read a single Austen work, loved it, and wants to learn more? My belief is that it probably isn't. If you're new to Austen, my advice would be to seek out as many of her books as you can, and THEN come back to this one. Otherwise, it's a bit like listening to a group of friends discuss an inside joke. You know it's funny, but you're not quite sure why."},{"Title":"The Friendly Jane Austen","review":"Packed with terrific information, in a format that is accessible to everyone. Well worth adding to a collection of Jane Austen's work. Excellent for an introduction to same."},{"Title":"The Friendly Jane Austen","review":"A beautifully written book with a format which sparks the imagination and stirs you to turn pages to the very end. An inspired Christmas choice for the Janeite on your list, or any avid reader."},{"Title":"The Friendly Jane Austen","review":"&quot;The Friendly Jane Austen&quot; was well-written and, most of all, great fun. I chose not to give it 5 stars because some of the analysis of Austen's work is rather silly (i.e. reading 20th-century mindsets into 18th-19th century literature--claiming Emma has homosexual feelings for Harriet Smith). Also, because Jeremy Northam deserves at least 4 &quot;E&quot;s on the &quot;Elton Vulgarity Scale&quot; for his uncouth comment about Emma! He may be right about her, but was the obscenity really necessary! While I thought some of the sexual analysis was ridiculous, it was interesting to learn that some people actually interpret Austen in this way."},{"Title":"The Friendly Jane Austen","review":"This was a truly fun book. It was written with a sense of fun about Jane Austen. Synopsis of the novels and characters are interspersed with interviews from actors who've had roles in movie adaptations of Jane Austen's novels, famous writers' thoughts on the impact of Jane Austen in their own writings, silly quizzes that will have you nodding your head or guessing out loud and even lists of the most obnoxious characters."},{"Title":"The Friendly Jane Austen","review":"I have been teaching classes about Jane Austen and this book has been very helpful in the past,so I decided to actually purchase it. It gives alot of information on Jane Austen's \\"afterlife\\" as I call it.

I especially love the quizzes. I highly recommend this book to all Jane Austen fans."},{"Title":"The Friendly Jane Austen","review":"This book is more than well-written and packed with information, this book is fun."},{"Title":"The Friendly Jane Austen","review":"This is a book for readers who enjoy good writing peppered with profanity and frank discussion of fictional characters' sexual orientation. A pity that such a well-concieved work, with both entertaining and enlightening aspects, should assault the reader with coarseness and vulgarity. In the words of &quot;another lady,&quot; I read and re-read Jane Austen &quot;seeking to escape the shoddy values and cheap garishness of our own age.&quot; This book was a definite disappointment."},{"Title":"The Friendly Jane Austen","review":"We see a different side of Jane in this captivating book. There is something new to discover on every page. I loved learning what sort of Janeite I am. A quiz will classify you. Tyler is a witty and erudite writer. She kept me turning pages to the end."},{"Title":"The Friendly Jane Austen","review":"This is easily one of the most entertaining books I've read on Jane Austen (and, believe me, I've read lots!). It's a must-have for Janeites everywhere and is loaded with fascinating facts, fun tidbits and even interviews from actresses to authors to scholars who have been involved in Jane Austen work in varied forms. This is the kind of book that you would return to over and over again. This book, along with Daniel Pool's &quot;What Jane Austen Ate and Charles Dickens Knew,&quot; is one of the best ever written on Ms. Austen. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Friendly Jane Austen","review":"I am a newcomer to the joys of Jane Austen (kind of embarrassing because of my age)and I read this after having read Ms. Austen's 6 completed and most widely read novels. I really enjoyed reading this book,it has a little biographical info, trivia and insight into the stories themselves. Although I didn't agree with everything the author expressed, I would turn a page and learn something about something else. And of course, as I was reading it, I kept saying to myself, oh, I need to go back and reread this book and see what this author is talking about. How cannot you not recommend a book that inspires you to reread all of Jane Austen's books! This book could also be useful in a classroom of high school students, what a fun way to introduce Jane Austen to students who think she is boring or hard to read."},{"Title":"The Friendly Jane Austen","review":"The Friendly Jane Austen: A Well-Mannered Introduction to a Lady of Sense & Sensibility is a wonderful resource for the die-hard Austen fan as well as Austen newbies. Ms. Tyler takes each book in turn, gives a synopsis of the plot and places it in historical context and in the context of Austen's life. She then explains those details that might be abstract to those not familiar with Regency culture, such as entailed property, the importance of walking and the attitude toward marriage, making the reader comfortable with the novel. She includes illustrations, interviews, quizzes and delightful bits on the side such as \\"10 Surefire Ways to be Vulgar\\", a table of average income and \\"Sense and Sensibility: A Checklist\\". In addition, she finishes the book lists of movie versions, book spin-offs and sequels and shows Austen's role (her \\"legacy\\") in our century.An Austen fan from way back, I found this a truly delightful book. Ms. Tyler is humorous as well as informative and her enthusiasm for Austen is apparent. This is a must-have for Austen fans, no question about it; the resources provided in The Friendly Jane Austen further the enjoyment of reading Austen's novels. It is also an excellent book for those that have just started reading Austen. With this book by your side, you can't fail to see just how wonderful Jane Austen was, and still is."},{"Title":"The Friendly Jane Austen","review":"The stuff you NEVER learned in that Sophomore Lit class, and should have. This book makes (re)reading Jane Austin all the more more enjoyable. Ms Tyler is a talented writer, witty and engaging. A good read!"},{"Title":"The Friendly Jane Austen","review":"It is astonishing to an Austen fan (or Janeite or Gentle, Ironic or Subversive Jane, as the case may be -- more later) that anyone would find Jane's work boring, but they do. This is a book that not only entertains confirmed fans but might also persuade others of her worth. I agree with another reviewer that this would be a great addition to a high school course. It is a book that can be as easily pored over as dipped into, being composed of a large number of short blurbs, quizzes, anecdotes, interviews, lists and even a recipe. A perfect book for the bathroom.The author is very knowledgeable and yet relates her information in a friendly and accessible way, beginning with descriptions of the various types of Austen fans, and quickly moving on to chapters about Jane's early life and juvenilia, each of the six major works, and Jane's legacy: film adaptations, fan clubs, internet presence, continuations and sequels. The book concludes with a bibliography and index.This is a fun read and there's no way you won't learn something interesting. A must-read for fans and a great supplement for reluctant readers."},{"Title":"The Friendly Jane Austen","review":"Whether you enjoy Austen for the gentle ways of the Regency era or for the sauciness of intelligent, modern heroines like Elizabeth Bennet, you'll love this book. In other words, whether you shop at Crabtree and Evelyn or the MAC counter, whether you're a professor of English or a bodice-ripper novel lover, you'll appreciate Tyler's fun, civilized and witty quote boxes, Austen quizzes, and short essays on the characters and novels of Austen. The book opens with a quiz, &quot;What kind of Jane fan are you?&quot; that sets the tone for the remainder of the volume. Even the lesser known works of Austen, like Sanditon and Lady Susan, get treated here. It's worth consulting for a serious essay on Austen or browsing for fun."},{"Title":"The Friendly Jane Austen","review":"This book is written in a delightful way, one that is evocative of Austen's own style. The biographer clearly likes Jane Austen, something of a rarity in these days of attack biography. It is intelligent and witty, and I heartily recommend it.My review took away one star because the format of the book, which I doubt the author had any control over, is thoroughly disjointed, with odd paragraphs popping up here and there. Beyond that, I have no hesitation in recommending it."},{"Title":"The Friendly Jane Austen","review":"This book is easy, fun, and entertaining. If you just looked at the sample pages provided by Amazon, you'd think it is nothing but a collection of quotations of people's opinions of Jane Austen. Well, there are a lot of opinionated quotations, from people you've heard of and people you haven't heard of. There are also Q&A; interviews with knowledgable JA fans and actors who've played JA roles. There are quizzes.Most of the pieces are short, so it's a good book for readers with limited attention spans. The book also has a magazinelike format: the pages are bordered, and there are insets and decorative separators between chunks of text.I was delighted to learn that two columnists I admire, Miss Manners (Judith Martin) and Edith Lank, who writes about real estate and appears in our local house-and-garden section every Sunday, are big fans. That explains why I like them.There's quite a lot of information in this book in spite of its \\"light\\" look, and it's entertaining, but if you prefer sustained discussion and development, you'll want to choose another book."},{"Title":"The Friendly Jane Austen","review":"Do you love to read books by Jane Austen?

All about the characters in Jane Austen's novels such as Willoughby.There is a quiz where you have to identify who wrote what passage of a letter and another where you have to idenitify who is being descibed by whom. There are about six quizzes with the correct answers in the back.There is a chapter on each book plus one on Jane's early life, her popularity in the 20th century, film adaptions, and sequels.Most books like this are dry and very scholarly criticisms. This book is light-hearted fun, filled with pictures, and little tidbits. You will not be bored reading this. It is the perfect companion for any Jane Austen novel, and a must in everyone admirer's library! If you don't read it how else will you know:What ten things make you vulgar?

It doesn't contain much information about the chateaux in the region (generally repeated in all the other books). What it does have is some really useful photographs that help to give a sense of what the different towns are like, detailed and nuanced recommendations of places to stay and places to eat, and a guide to a few hundred or so vineyards.I strongly recommend this book to anyone at all interested in wine, who also wants information about some of the towns and villages too small to end up in the regular tourist guides."},{"Title":"Rainbow Garden","review":"I dearly loved this book as a child from about the age of 9 years and up, and still enjoy going back to the original to read the descriptions and explanations. In the original book there may be a few words that are less understandable to a school-aged child who does not normally do much reading, but the descriptions are wonderful and realistic. I've found that well-written Christian books for children are rather rare, and St. John's writing is exceptionally good. I found her capable of bringing Christianity to life in a very understandable way, while weaving a beautiful story about real sorts of people/children.I was very disappointed, though, to read the addition revised by Mary Mills in 2002, and now the only one you can buy new. The book has been very abridged. Many of the descriptions that brought the humanness and delightfulness of the characters and their experiences to life, have been cleanly ommited. Also, most lines in the entire book have been re-written to be either simpler, or just less descriptive. I do not believe children today are so incapable of reading, to require the severe revisions done to this book.The original book was a beautiful, joyful book."},{"Title":"Rainbow Garden","review":"This is the story of a little girl who feels lost in the world, as her mother is too busy with her own life to care for her. Her father is dead and now her mother is taking a new job in a different country, requiring lots of travelling, without Elaine. Elaine must go live with a family of six children. Through the time she spends with them, she finds Jesus and learns to love others more than herself. An excellent protrayal of real life situations, not glossed over, but told with propiety. I read this story to my four children ages 3 to 9 and they loved it."},{"Title":"Rainbow Garden","review":"I loved RAINBOW GARDEN as a little girl. As an adult, I still re-read it every couple of years. In my opinion, this beautiful story should be considered a Christian classic. Both well-written and touching, RAINBOW GARDEN is a story about how a lonely little girl finds fulness of joy. Patricia M. St. John paints wonderful pictures of happy childhood and those little incidents that have such great meaning and excitement."},{"Title":"Rainbow Garden","review":"As a child of 8 or so, I read this book to myself. At first read, I thought it a rather strange book. It was only after three more reads later in my life that I finally understood the plot. This book is well worth the money simply because of the beautiful images that made me cry as an 8 year old, but save your dollars until your child is old enough to sort through the images to find the plot."},{"Title":"Rainbow Garden","review":"Be aware... be very aware. All the electronic versions of Patricia St John's works are the revised edition. In 1999, Mary Mills revised the original text. The words have been changed and the story line has been rearranged. As someone who loved the originals in my childhood and continue to read them in my adulthood, I find the revisions distracting and significantly less poignant than the originals. READ THE \\"LOOK INSIDE\\" before buying and make sure that you know exactly what you're buying. And ask the publishers to produce the originals again - they're now out of print even in paperback."},{"Title":"Rainbow Garden","review":"My daughter and I enjoyed this book very much.

Extraneous stories and flowery descriptions are my preference, this book is more on the practical side."},{"Title":"Natural Healing With Qigong: Therapeutic Qigong","review":"This book is informative and it would have been a good book if it were not for the innumerable mistakes of all types and degrees of seriousness, not to mention the writing style. I do not understand how a professional can publish a book in a language other than their own and not have it proofread and edited by a professional LINGUIST. A **professional linguist**, --(an English language native working in the Chinese>English pair)-- would have charged, at most, 7 to 10 cents per word. Is that too much to get a good book out to the public? The help from a husband has certainly been far from enough. The book is written using very short sentences and the style is, in general, linguistically childish. It is also full of unnecessary repetitions. I think an 8 year old can write better than this. I returned the book. Fortunately Amazon allows 7 days to return an ebook for the Kindle."},{"Title":"Natural Healing With Qigong: Therapeutic Qigong","review":"I've been using LianGong (another name for this specific therapeutic Qigong for a while. It consists of 3 sets of 18 exercises each one. Personally, I only practice the first set. It makes me feel well and produces a palpable benefit in my whole body. Its movements are easy to perform and the clear instructions and pictures in the book are more than enough to guide us through these sets. An important point, at least for myself, is to perform the exercises very slowly. The more slowly I practice them, the more deep are the results."},{"Title":"Natural Healing With Qigong: Therapeutic Qigong","review":"One of the strengths of Lian Gong Shr Ba Fa is that it is the sort of exercise system that actually can be learned from the printed page if you are reasonably well coordinated and are good at learning from books. Even without a teacher, you can get major benefits from practice on your own.This book is a clear, well done presentation of the exercises. Anyone interested in learning the system would get a good start from this book. I would only recommend Wen Mei Yu's version over this one because a) WMY's book explicitly announces that it is a Lian Gong with its title on the cover, and B) the layouts, photographs and book design are somewhat more effective and pleasing to my eye, and c) the accompnaying instructional text is a bit clearer and more helpful to the beginner.But if you want to get started, and you see this book on the stands, don't hesitate to get it and get started."},{"Title":"Natural Healing With Qigong: Therapeutic Qigong","review":"Bob SpearPublisher and Chief ReviewerHeartland ReviewThose of us with martial art backgrounds have a fascination for the manipulation of the power of the body's energy field-Chi or Ki.

The videos are all great, the books are all good, except for one MAJOR flaw!! None of them offer breathing instructions!! The most any book or video will tell you is that you breath in when expanding and stretching, and out when relaxing. Except in certain cases, there are exceptions, which they never explain.

Even though it is kind of depressing, it's a real page turner, and there are lots of twists in the story. Sometimes I got really furious at June's dad for being so intollerant of other religions.

The list &quot;mirrors&quot; the list of Messier objects in number , and offers a real challenge to neophyte &quot;deep sky&quot; observers.The list compiled by Sir Patrick covers a wide variety of objects , as well as a range of difficulty that makes observation of all items on the list a problematic. Many of the objects are found in the skies of the Southern Hemisphere , adding some spice to the already great challenge. Included are some very attractive star clusters , really awesome bright nebulae , distant galaxies , and many &quot;planetary&quot; nebulae.Author O'Meara has done an excellent job with this second volume of Deep Sky Companions , better that the first ; many of the objects will probably never be seen by many amateur astronomers unwilling or unable to travel to Australia or South America to see the South Circimpolar Caldwell objects , hence my title to this review!As in the previous volume on the Messier objects , each entry includes a photograph , a sky chart (too small a scale!) , a sketch made by the author at the eyepiece, and an excellent textual description and astrophysical analysis.This book is definitely a &quot;must own&quot; for every serious backyard observer. It is not without a few flaws : i.e. the scale of the charts being next to useless , and the somewhat over optimistic description of what the average observer might be able to see.Still worthy of a strong 4 stars.

In the fashion of his book on Mesier Objects, he has again produced a book that will guide and inform the lover of the night sky armed with a telescope. In chapter one he begins with a story involving an old man and Arcturus which deeply moved me, and later my wife when I read it to her, and which lead naturally into why we observe the night sky so passionately. The bulk of the text, however, is in the second chapter where the author describes each of the 109 Caldwell objects in detail. Each object has a astrophotograph, his eyepeice impression drawing, a finder chart and visual description done in such elegance that everytime I read it I am awed all the more by what I am observing. In addition, Stephan has included interesting historical and astrophysical information about each of the objects. As I observe firsthand these objects with his book on my lap I am amazed at what I can see that I would not have seen without Stephan's guidance. This is a masterpeice for the avid observer!

The author pioneered in presenting a well-researched theory on what was essentially an inherited temperament leading to an unusual level of sensitivity to one's environment. Being sensitive to this degree, one sees the subtleties others miss, feels the depths others fail to experience, and essentially lives a fuller life just by observation, let alone by experience. However, this attunement has the downside of over-stimulation of the senses, resulting in feelings of discomfort or panic and a need to retreat into a far less active environment. When I first read Aron's book, I found myself. Not all of me, since each individual has myriad aspects both biological and experiential in origin, but an understanding of some of my persistent and inescapable (inexplicable) behaviors. Now, I appreciate my sensitivity, realizing that I'm not paranoid because I put 2 + 2 together more quickly than anyone I know. In fact, after Aron's book, I've learned to use and trust this ability to my and others' advantage. I realize too that I need a peaceful, silent retreat from stimulus in order to regain my balance -- realize it and understand it and permit it.So it was with anticipation that I got myself a copy of her new book, hoping for many insights into achieving a harmonious and pleasurable love life. The HSP in Love is not as well-written or as innovative or amazing as was the original volume. I found it difficult at times to focus on the point the author was making during a discussion; however, certain points were enlightening, especially when the author writes about current research into relationships (which apply to everyone, not just HSPs). From time to time there are too many acronyms -- HSPs, non-HSPs, HSS, non-HSS, HSW, HSM, etc. -- in one paragraph, so the writing style became choppy and difficult to follow. The book contains a summary of the theory which though a good review takes up too much of the text, so there isn't enough about the &quot;love&quot;: relationships, romance, sexuality, or platonic relationships as well. That was disappointing. Also, at times I felt like I was reading the first draft of the book, as if the author had no time to produce the book she actually intended -- something tight and organized, filled with revealing info about HSP relationships.There was good information in this book. Don't get me wrong on that. It was worth reading, but I was left wanting more info rather than feeling like I had learned a great deal. Based on the book, my relationships have not improved, but I know a little more about loving relationships and I have more compassion for myself and my behavior/needs within the relationships. The book is worth reading for anyone identifying with being a HSP, but be sure you read The Highly Sensitive Person first so you have an understanding of the theory and get the most enlightenment about yourself before delving into to this later book."},{"Title":"The Highly Sensitive Person in Love: How Your Relationships Can Thrive When the World Overwhelms You","review":"The Highly Sensitive Person in Love is Dr. Elaine N. Aron's \\"sequel\\" to her best-selling book \\"The Highly Sensitive Person.\\"This second book builds on her previous research, this time taking on the topic of Relationships and along with it, possibly one of the most difficult issues facing Highly Sensitive People (HSPs): How to balance a strong need for \\"alone and quiet time\\" with the genuine desire to have an active and fulfilling intimate relationship. In addition to her research, Aron (an HSP) also draws on experiences from her own marriage to a non-HSP.As a starting point, the book includes a \\"Sensitivity Self Test\\" for both the reader and their mate or potential partner. Aron then goes on to explain how HSPs differ from the rest of the world in the way they fall in love, think about love, and their needs within a relationship. There are separate chapters covering the pluses and minuses of different types of relationships: Two HSPs together, and an HSP paired with a non-HSP, as well as the differing needs of highly sensitive men and women. Finally, there are sections on \\"Building Sensitive Partnerships\\" and HSP Sexuality. Except for a few vague and indirect references, \\"The Highly Sensitive Person in Love\\" deals strictly with heterosexual relationships.Whereas I enjoyed this book, and found much useful information within its pages, it didn't seem to offer quite the number of insights provided by \\"The Highly Sensitive Person.\\" This perhaps goes to illustrate that whereas HSPs may have special needs, their relationship dynamics aren't AS different from anyone else's as one might think. Still, the book is well worth a read-- the sections on dating that \\"works\\" for an HSP, handling conflicts in a relationship, communication, and dividing \\"like\\" and \\"dislike\\" tasks in low-stress ways are highly recommended.Aron's writing style gets a little dry and \\"clinical\\" from time to time, but the book is still quite readable. I think it stands alone quite well, but I would still highly recommend also reading Dr. Aron's original book.Overall rating: Recommended (7.2 bookmarks out of a possible 10), not only for the Highly Sensitive Person, but also for a less sensitive person with a Highly Sensitive partner who thoroughly mystifies them!"},{"Title":"The Highly Sensitive Person in Love: How Your Relationships Can Thrive When the World Overwhelms You","review":"After reading the first three reviews, I put off buying this book. I got the impression that it might be just a rehash of Elaine Aron's previous HSP books which I already own.Nothing could be further from the truth! This book is packed with useful information and practical strategies for HSPs to use to build solid, fulfilling relationships. I gleaned many insights and ideas that I plan to use to enhance my relationships with my family and friends as well as with my husband.If you're serious about building a happy, fulfilling life as an HSP, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Highly Sensitive Person in Love: How Your Relationships Can Thrive When the World Overwhelms You","review":"As a psychotherapist, I found this book an invaluable source of practical wisdom. The author has articulated something that often goes unheard in a extraverted, &quot;more is more, and more is better&quot; culture. HSP's have difficulty making a relationship to their healthy creative selves; they have often learned to pathologize their gifts of intuition and introspection, depth and empathy. Separated from self, it should be no surprise that they also often become alienated from their partners, but when they are in sync with themselves, they can be warm, compassionate, spontaneous and profoundly present in love relationships. It is gratifying to find a resource that offers concrete suggestions and a wealth of support to HSP's. They are among the more gifted among us, and they need and deserve to be encouraged."},{"Title":"The Highly Sensitive Person in Love: How Your Relationships Can Thrive When the World Overwhelms You","review":"If you are a highly sensitive person with a non-HSP partner this book is very helpful. First of all, HSPs are often capable of delivering incredibly long explanations of their behavior to select quarters. When called on to explain themselves to a partner, they can speak in epics.If you are in this position, save yourself some time. Someone has already written the epic.I have sensed and/or mentioned -most- of the relationship problems in this book. However, my observations and intuitions were spread out over the course of the entire relationship. I'm sure that many of my observations did not penetrate the mind of my partner as being significant. Thus, they weren't as useful as they should have been.This book lays it out bluntly and clearly, for all to see.This is extremely important for both partners. The book affirms what the HSP already intuited, and it gives the non-HSP a reference. Non-HSPs seem to feel much happier when they are given a reference. They do not dwell in an intuitive world of twenty thousand grays supplemented by prior reading. If you're having trouble in your relationship and you're highly sensitive, give yourself some relief, give your partner a much-deserved break. Get this, read it together. S/he will be relieved, and so will you. Buy it. Save yourself some work."},{"Title":"The Highly Sensitive Person in Love: How Your Relationships Can Thrive When the World Overwhelms You","review":"In reading Aron's books, I feel fully comprehended, which has been a rarity in this life. Her research let me know there are others like me, and I felt deeply heartened by the contents of this book.

I have purchased this book many times for friends."},{"Title":"The Highly Sensitive Person in Love: How Your Relationships Can Thrive When the World Overwhelms You","review":"In my annual Valentine's Day funk over being perpetually unattached, I bought this book.

She talks here about HSP--Highly Sensitive People who are in HSP/HSP relationships or HSP/non-HSP relationships. Very helpful.I first read this and another of her works when I was dating a therapist. She got me into reading Elaine Aron as part of my self discovery quest. Seems obvious that you're not likely to connect well with other people if you don't know yourself well. So I took up the challenge of considering if I was one of these HSP folk. Yep. If you are wondering who you are in relation to others--even your own grand kids, I'd recommend her other introduction book as the first of a pair: The Highly Sensitive Person.I read this Who Am I work with other \\"wiring books\\" about the brain (A General Theory of Love by Lewis and friends; and Why We Love by Helen Fisher). And, of course, heart and soul books (Care of the Soul by Thomas Moore, The Authentic Heart, by John Amodeo)along with poetry. No self discovery tour is quite complete--seems to me--without lots of poetry salted in, read and written.My big take away with this book was to be able to stop judging myself for being different, knowing after this study that from the womb 20% of us are HSP...highly sensitive persons. I understand full well now that when I enter a party I see everything and everybody, all the conversations going on at once...that's just the way I am. It's just how my brain is wired, my brain and heart. I see now why I can only watch one movie a night, for example, and why a double feature sends me spinning. I need to process what's been in front of me (lots of things, says HSP wiring) and can't move on to B until I've exhausted A. Another reason here that I suppose I am and always be one who takes things way too seriously.Also, if you live with someone who is a HSP you need to read this book together so you'll understand why you are both so annoying sometimes.What I got from this was that it's not a good thing or a bad thing but a wiring thing if you are a HSP man or woman. Indeed, if you're not the one in five who are wired this way...wouldn't that be good to know?She's got a new edition out I see--1997--so this work is still being read, studied. Good. So I'd say get this book so you'll understand the HSP/non-HSP interface if nothing else. Would help in the home and in the office no doubt.I'd also say that if you are not in the position to date a therapist, save some couch time, go easy on your wallet and your insurance plan at work and buy this book."},{"Title":"The Highly Sensitive Person in Love: How Your Relationships Can Thrive When the World Overwhelms You","review":"I am a highly sensitive person even though I have spent 20 years trying to be otherwise.

It also helps point out the clear dynamics of sensitive/non-sensitive as well as sensitive/sensitive relationship patterns, and there's a good reminder toward the end that sometimes, people just have problems, and Aron gives some good hints as to which ones to stay away from. She does that in a couple of places. And, while perhaps one doesn't want to hear it, it's still good advice. So, not the be all end all, but some really good info in your quest to understand yourself or one you love."},{"Title":"The Highly Sensitive Person in Love: How Your Relationships Can Thrive When the World Overwhelms You","review":"Really helpful to see my issues on paper in black and white. Finally a good author who is a kindred spirit."},{"Title":"The Highly Sensitive Person in Love: How Your Relationships Can Thrive When the World Overwhelms You","review":"First, let me express my appreciation for Elaine Aron's work in this and her other books. This title contains plenty of useful and practical advice, and is a useful extension of what was contained in Aron's first HSP book.I particularly found some useful insights in what she has to say about high-sensation seeking and its interactions with the high sensitivity trait.My only serious criticism is the way she glosses over any relationships other than the heterosexual. I understand not wanting to &quot;push&quot; male HSPs to identify as gay, when many tend to experience throughout their early lives a good deal of social pressure in that vein.But in focusing almost exclusively on HSPs who are exclusively &quot;straight,&quot; mentioning same-sex orientations only in the context of the &quot;feminine&quot; marker that high sensitivity tends to carry in American culture, I felt a veil of silence was dropped over subjects significant to (I would guess) a great many HSPs.While much of the advice this book contains may be as applicable to gay, lesbian or bisexual HSPs as it is to those who are straight, one could take away an impression that Aron somewhat dismisses relationships that do not conform to widely presumed &quot;norms.&quot;A book that deals openly and in detail with HSMs and issues of gender identity or affinity remains to be written. Aron has helped make such a book possible, and perhaps she or one of her students will someday write such a book."},{"Title":"The Highly Sensitive Person in Love: How Your Relationships Can Thrive When the World Overwhelms You","review":"Sounds good if you're searching for something to help you. It's seems like just a bunch of personalities put together in a somewhat vague way to match whomever the reader is. Can't see anyone getting any help from it, real help.Wonder why it's not mainstream? Perhaps because it's not proven in any way, shape, or form. Look up some of the videos associated with this. Plays the nice silly music in the background, and the people I saw look to be a bit off. Maybe I'm a bit off, don't mean to make fun of people, that's not nice.Stick with DSM-V and the mainstream.

It explains many theories and gets fairly in depth. The book is a nice reference to look back at now and then as Dr. Arons explores alot of situations that come up between two HSP's in love as well as an HSP and a non HSP. The book is not an easy read as much of the language is quite profound. However, it does bring HSP's better in touch with themselves. Also, some of the explanations can cue non HSP's into the world HSP's face everyday. The same people who can cry at the slightest provocation can also deeply appreciate the inner beauties of art and music. Its good that Dr Arons is in touch with herself and recognizes that these people have a prominent role in our society."},{"Title":"The Highly Sensitive Person in Love: How Your Relationships Can Thrive When the World Overwhelms You","review":"The book is well-written but not entirely convincing in its premise that this is the best way to understand this brand of sensitivity. While there is merit in promoting acceptance by OTHERS of this and other personality types, there is an underlying defeatism here that advocates against challenging ONESELF to grow socially and adapt to or overcome the various difficult realities of the world. Personally, I started off pretty shy and sensitive, but over time I gained greater confidence, forthrightness and assertiveness, but without any loss in empathy or creativity or awareness of subtleties. In my case, this was through joining the army reserves, martial arts, theater, public speaking, socializing, contemplating my sensitivities to various things and making the decision that I wasn't going to be limited or shut down by them.Anyone who wants to challenge themselves, grow as a person, and get something done with their lives, ought to be wary of labeling themselves in this way. Though it is useful to try to understand one's tendencies, this understanding is best used for the purpose of self-improvement rather than as an excuse to avoid intimacy and challenge and living.Highly sensitive people may take a bit longer to acclimatize to intimacy, to noise, to difficult situations, and ultimately to mastery of difficulties, but without the recognition that this capability is within reach, the author virtually condemns HSPs to an ongoing and pitiable state of emotional incapacity."},{"Title":"The Highly Sensitive Person in Love: How Your Relationships Can Thrive When the World Overwhelms You","review":"I borrowed this book from a friend during a long bus ride years ago, and even though none of the romance-related advice was immediately relevant to me at the time, the ideas Aron presents were extremely helpful. Aron claims that about 15% of people naturally have more sensitive nervous systems (in her terminology, they are Highly Sensitive Persons, HSPs*), and that this is a biological difference that has a major impact on our social existence. This model has made a lot of sense to me, and it has helped illuminate many of my own reactions and patterns, as well as those of my family and friends.Now that I'm in a serious romantic relationship, the particular contents of this book (as opposed to Aron's first book, The Highly Sensitive Person) seemed more relevant, so I bought a copy from Amazon. It had been several years since I looked at it, and I'm amazed yet again at how insightful the author is. She writes with compassion and wisdom, and she cites studies and research to back up her claims, as well as illustrating them with real stories. I highly recommend this book for any HSP who has moved past believing that the opposite sex has cooties.*Check out [...] for more information about what this means."},{"Title":"The Highly Sensitive Person in Love: How Your Relationships Can Thrive When the World Overwhelms You","review":"This book has validated everything I always knew about myself.

I understand myself better now and I think her work (because I'm planning on reading her other books) will really help me live the way I want to.

A particular nerve is activated in the state of attraction that can, even in non-HSPs, create a hypomania state. In the HSP this is like searing the brain with a toxic mixture of hyper-stimulants through the entire organ. A state that is wonderful for most can be the most ungrounding experience if not fraught with fear and dread. This is one book to guide an HSP into staying peaceful in the realm of love."},{"Title":"The Highly Sensitive Person in Love: How Your Relationships Can Thrive When the World Overwhelms You","review":"This book offered so much insight into my own interpretations of love, relationships (successful ones and not so successful ones) and the spiritual all from the highly sensitive person's unique perspective.

It was amazing how deep the author went to describe how and what a Highly Sensitive Person feels and interprets about all the various realms of love and relationship.

I couldn't put Edison and the Electric Chair down, so it was well after dark by the time I finished.Whether you're a fan of books about history, science, and/or technology; curious about Edison and his role in the invention and promotion of the electric chair; or just like to get involved in a great story, you've got to read this book.Essig does far more than simply explain the contradiction between Edison the man opposed to the death penalty and Edison the expert witness in New York's hearings on adopting the electric chair as a method of execution. He goes much further than merely pointing out the business reasons underlying Edison's advocacy of the chair (reasons explained far less entertainingly in a couple of other books).Essig makes real the fascinating people involved -- like William Kemmler, the first man to die by electrocution, and George Westinghouse, Edison's major rival in bringing electricity to American homes, not to mention Edison himself. He gives you just enough information about how electricity travels to our homes and the difference between AC (alternating current) and DC (direct current) to illuminate the story. And, while providing unflinching details about the science of killing, he also managed to make me laugh at loud with this disturbingly absurd episode in our country's continuing saga of government-sanctioned execution."},{"Title":"Edison and the Electric Chair : A Story of Light and Death","review":"Two inventors and industrial giants grappled in commercial combat over primacy in the emerging electric power industry in the late 19th and early 20th century. They were Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse. The strategic hill of the battle was whether direct current (Edison) or alternating current (Westinghouse) would prevail. Edison made the safer system, but Westinghouse made the more economical system, because alternating current could be transmitted over longer distances with fewer generating stations.While the marketing battle raged, New York had the inspiration to move from execution by hanging to electrocution. Hanging was notoriously fallible (necks did not snap so the victim strangled slowly, or necks snapped too well, decapitating the victim). New York solicited the opinion of the foremost authority on electricity, Edison. Edison, an opponent of the death penalty, demurred at first. But the temptation to dramatically equate his enemy's system of electricity with death proved too strong. Yes, Edison said, electrocution is just the thing, and alternating current is the best method of electrocution.So New York's electrical execution law passed, and the appeal progressed of the first victim of the electric chair. His attorney, W. Bourke Cockran, secretly paid by Westinghouse, argued that electrocution was cruel and unusual under the Constitution, and so could not be imposed. Expert witness and secret Edison shill Harold Brown disagreed. The case went all the way to the United States Supreme Court.This book tells the story of how a convicted murderer, William Kemmler, became a pawn in a battle between electrical titans. But the book is much more. It is a history of the electrical industry when electrical power was new and miraculous, technologically on the cutting edge. The book is also a history and sociology of the death penalty (very interesting), and a biography of Edison. Edison & the Electric Chair is also a window into industrial-strength ruthlessness and a portrait of a time when powerful industries could defy laws, kill people, and get away with it. The book also pauses to inform the reader of such things as how the electric chair kills (it cooks and carbonizes the brain), and of how the first death penalty electrocutions were badly botched (\\"He's alive!\\").This book is readable and illuminating. You might not change your mind about the death penalty after reading it, but your opinion will definitely be more profound."},{"Title":"Edison and the Electric Chair : A Story of Light and Death","review":"I should raise a warning flag to start this review: if you are squeamish, or an animal lover, this book might be a bit too much for you. There are several horrific episodes involving detailed descriptions of botched executions, as well as descriptions of electrocution experiments performed on dogs, calves, and horses. Mr. Essig's intent is not to be sensationalistic. He wants to show us that when Thomas Edison said that death by electrocution would be quick and painless, he was engaging in wishful thinking. (At least to start with. After experiments on animals showed that this form of execution was not an exact science- nobody knew, really, what voltage to use or for how long; nor were they sure of how electricity killed - he may have stooped to being disingenuous. Edison thought alternating current was dangerous, plus he didn't like George Westinghouse. Westinghouse kept infringing on Edison's patents. Edison was pushing alternating current for use with the electric chair, to drive home to the public his belief that alternating current was too dangerous for commercial use.) This book works well on many levels. We see Edison trying to get alternating current used with the electric chair, while Westinghouse tries to fight back, via his lawyers, by showing execution via electrocution was messy and unreliable, and hence was &quot;cruel and unusual punishment.&quot; The book is also good at describing the more general competition between Edison's direct current and Westinghouse's alternating current. It takes some careful reading, but you get to learn the advantages and disadvantages of both systems at that time, and how elbow grease and creativity were used to overcome some of the problems. Also, considering that this is not really a biography, Mr. Essig gives a pretty well-rounded portrait of Edison. He was pretty eccentric - for example, sleeping under a bench or on the floor of a closet at the Menlo Park laboratory - but he wasn't lacking in social skills. He was charming and witty and he was very good at promoting himself and his inventions. Like all interesting people, he was complex: when Edison's daughter told him she was writing a novel, Edison told her &quot;that in the case of a marriage to put in bucketfulls [sic] of misery. This would make it realistic.&quot; However, after Edison's first wife (Mary) died at the age of 29, Edison - the supposed cynic, misogynist, and misogamist - quickly fell under the spell of the 19 year old Mina Miller, and didn't hesitate to marry her. The man who supposedly thought about his work 24 hours a day remarked that while walking through Boston he &quot;got thinking about Mina and came near being run over by a street car.&quot; Regarding Edison's wit and sense of humor, the following is just one of many examples contained in the book: Edison bought his daughter Marion a pet parrot, but the bird never learned to speak. Edison complained that the bird had &quot;the taciturnity of a statue, and the dirt producing capacity of a drove of Buffalo.&quot; One of the many things I learned from this book was that, contrary to popular belief, Edison never called execution by electricity being &quot;Westinghoused.&quot; One of his lawyers came up with the expression for possible use in the public relations war between the two men. To Edison's credit, he rejected using the word as a synonym for electrocution. Other examples of areas this book explores are the work environment at Menlo Park (where the men would go out into the midnight darkness, accompanied by a dog holding a lantern between his teeth, to buy some food and beer to bring back to the workshop); the politics of the time (bribes being paid to either pass a bill to institute execution by electricity rather than hanging, or to kill such a bill); the fallibility of &quot;experts&quot; (who made uneducated guesses on how electrocution caused death, how much current to use, etc.); and the irresponsibility of the newspapers of the time (going from one extreme to the other in admiring or denigrating both Einstein and Westinghouse; calling the electric chair a wonderful and humane invention one moment and an awful example of barbarity the next). If the book has one fault, it is that Mr. Essig uses the battle between Edison and Westinghouse to slip in his personal opposition to capital punishment. I don't feel this falls within the scope of the story, and he should have resisted the urge to use the book as a soapbox. That being said, this is still a very well-written, well-researched, and fascinating book."},{"Title":"Edison and the Electric Chair : A Story of Light and Death","review":"Today we all take electricity for granted. We pay monthly fees to large utility companies, and whenever we buy an electrical appliance we plug it in and it works. But we never think about the fact that as recently as the late 19th century, electricity in homes and businesses was a rarity. And it wasn't the government or large public companies who were rolling it out to communities across the US, but instead entrepreneurs like Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse competing to develop different types of electrical services and rushing to sign up as many customers as possible to their own companies' proprietary standards.Perhaps the biggest rivalry in the electrical field was between Edison, who promoted his direct current system, a relatively low voltage system whose electricity could not be transmitted across a broad area without installing additional generators, and Westinghouse, whose alternating current systems allowed very high voltages to be transmitted across very large distances. No safety standards existed for the budding electric industry, so in an attempt to maintain his early business lead, Edison and his colleagues did what they could to publicize the dangers of allowing high voltage alternating current into people's homes and neighborhoods, and the relative safety of direct current.The story of electricity in itself is a fascinating business story that parallels a lot of what we've seen in the late 20th century with the internet rush and the mad dash to roll out hundreds of ISPs, most of which have fallen by the wayside as saner business models prevail and the industry consolidates. The business ethics at the time leave a lot to be desired, not unlike the business ethics of the late 20th century.But this engaging first-time author, Mark Essig, doesn't stop with the history of the electrical industry. He overlays the story of capital punishment into the picture. Humanists in the 19th century were debating whether the various methods used for capital punishment were humane. The use of electricity was raised as a possible painless alternative to hangings and other &quot;barbaric&quot; methods of killing criminals. Ironically, Edison promoted his rival Westinghouse's alternating current system as the perfect solution to the capital punishment dilemma, by stating that its dangerous system would instantly kill any criminals, not to mention thousands of regular consumers who might accidentally get in its way.This book was a truly terrific mix of history and anecdotes about a very interesting period in history that still impacts us today and that has many parallels in modern day business. And while the book doesn't take sides on the capital punishment debate, it certainly raises a lot of interesting issues and is certain to cause a lot of discussion in that area as well.I strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"Edison and the Electric Chair : A Story of Light and Death","review":"While I am not usually drawn to books about technological history, the combination of narrative power and illuminating research made Edison &amp; the Electric Chair a thoroughly engaging read. It reads like a tightly-drawn novel with compelling -- and sometimes repellent -- characters and plot. I couldn't wait to see how the story would unfold.As someone only marginally familiar with the science and history behind the development of electricity, I found myself fascinated by Essig's cogent explanations both of how electricity works and the myriad dangers and difficulties of implementing direct current as a means of electrification. Essig deftly weaves the complex personalities of the major players (most centrally Edison and Westinghouse) into the escalating debate over direct and alternating current.As the story of the first electrocution unfolds, Essig broadens the discussion to include not only the ethics of capital punishment and the relative humanity of the electric chair, but also larger implications of industrial competition, the rise of electric companies, and the illuminating of America.Bolstered by meticulous yet accessible research, Essig clearly lays out the changing attitudes and approaches to capital punishment. As he explores such volatile issues as the shift from public to private execution by the state, the role of capital punishment in the moral education of the citizenry, and the irony of the state's attempts to make execution humane, Essig always gives the reader room to reach her own conclusions.The greatest strength of this book might lie in its sensitively and lucidly wrought conclusion. Essig bridges the years from the first electrocutions to the present and shows how we are still involved in the same basic debate. While the efficiency and means of execution have changed through the last century, the crux of the debate remains the same: what is the role of the state in creating a machinery for death and should we truly make state executions palatable -- or should we finally recognize the inherent horror of it all? Essig leaves the reader with much to ponder -- and a strong foundation of cultural and scientific history from which to do so."},{"Title":"Edison and the Electric Chair : A Story of Light and Death","review":"An interesting book if you are curious about executions. The book has some interesting details about Edison's personal life, but not to much about Westinghouse. Also, the book says very little about Tesla, who's inventions really enabled Westinghouse to overcome Edison's DC power and make AC power todays standard. Still the book is worth while for Edison fans and those who are interested in the history of execution technology."},{"Title":"Edison and the Electric Chair : A Story of Light and Death","review":"This is an excellent account of the beginnings of electricity and of electrocution. It shows how electricity evolved from a parlor trick to a source of power that gave light to the world. It also shows the process of how it came to be used in execution and the reasons for it. My only complaint was that the author seemed to have certain sentiments that occasionally crept into analysis and seemed to take sides from time to time. However, it doesn't detract very much from the overall experience and I heartily recommend it to any science or history enthusiast to read, albeit with a grain of salt!"},{"Title":"Edison and the Electric Chair : A Story of Light and Death","review":"Great story. The fight over which type of current would be dominant for household use and the depths to which both sides would go to make their claim."},{"Title":"Edison and the Electric Chair : A Story of Light and Death","review":"The book shines a bright light on the way our capitalist society works: Money motivates. It motivates invention. It motivates opinion. It motivates legislation. It motivates the law. It motivates how representatives vote and how judges rule. We see the death penalty seeped in ulterior motive while naive killers, after months of solitude and religious indoctrination, reassure their nervous executers and jump in the seat they think will mercifully take them to their maker. No matter how cynical you may be about how our culture is motivated, the book confirms your most ugly suspicions.We learn that Edison's support of death by electric chair was at least in part motivated to show the public how dangerous his competitor's system was. (Westinghouse used alternate current which is, in fact, more dangerous than Edison's use of direct current, but alternate is more practical.) The law change would have prisoners executed via the chair using Westinghouse equipment.Westinghouse spent a small fortune defending the indigent prisoners saying electrocution was inhumane. The inhumanity of it was of no concern (though it was), it was that death using his current would be bad for business. Meanwhile, Edison hired people to show how wonderfully instant death by alternate current would be. (It often was not.) Because of Edison's fame and backing, legislators put the chair in use having no understanding of it. Gag orders are put in place so that the public would not know of the experimentation going on with the condemned. New York penitentiaries had no idea how to implement the current and the condemned suffered horribly because of their ignorance. (Edison had no idea either. His suggestions resulted in one of the most horrific electrical deaths. He was not, after all, a physician.) Even the idea of moving the condemned to a large prison facility (as apposed to local hangings) was motived by the state's desire to control mob reaction to executions and had little to do with alleviating pain and suffering caused by lynching.The book reminds us that governments and corporations nearly never have the best interest of the working pubic in mind. Control and profit is their primary motive. Avoiding a painful death for the condemned and pubic safety are used as pretenses, but discouragingly never the true motivation for the actions and laws the powerful make.The book is an education on more than just the specifics of this time and this instance. It's a reminder that whenever laws are passed, regulations stalled or even war declared, follow the money. There lies the real motivation."},{"Title":"Edison and the Electric Chair : A Story of Light and Death","review":"One of the most well written, highly informative and just plain interesting books I have ever read.

Orphaned Pepino depends upon his beloved doneky, Violetta, for companionship as well as for income, as they perform odd jobs about the village. His sole legacy from his deceased parents, Violetta functions as both friend and family to the street urchin. Thus when she beocmes incurably ill, his distress is genuine; his desperation knows no bounds.An American soldier, who had befriended him during the war, advised him never to accept NO as an answer. Suddenly he recalls that motto and employs all manner of smiles and wiles as he pleads for a chance to save her life. He will do anything to obtain permission to bring his donkey directly into the crypt of his beloved St. Francis. He has implicit faith that the Saint who loved all animals will work a miraculous cure.Ah, but before the Saint gets a chance to bestow (or withhold) his healing grace, Pepino must overcome serious Temporal obstacles, for the lower entrance to the tomb has been sealed for centuries. This open-ended tale leaves readers free to form their own opinion regarding the outcome of his emotional mission (as in THE LADY OR THE TIGER). We can only hope that Divine intervention will triumph--that a boy's faith will be rewarded. A modest story of trust and devotion which will appeal to the child in readers of all ages. A perfect choice for the Easter season."},{"Title":"THE SMALL MIRACLE","review":"Gallico's tale of a little Italian orphan and his donkey is a simple little fable but told with such conviction that it touches the heart and mind.A wonderful little story with a message of faith for the reader."},{"Title":"THE SMALL MIRACLE","review":"Paul Gallico (mostly known now for The Snow Goose) was known in his own time greatly because of this little wonder of a book. If you ask me, this book is more about love than faith and determination, although all three of those qualities work side by side throughout this story about a little orphaned boy named Pepino who decides to go to any and all means necessary to save the only friend he has in the world, a donkey named Violetta. He tends to her the way any parent would tend for a child, the way any loving sibling would care for an ailing brother or sister, the way any pure-hearted and uncorrupted child would care for another in difficult times. It is also a story about the realities of the world and how even those who make a profession by acknowledging miracles sometimes have to be lovingly shocked into seeing them. It's really a story about the knowledge that if we say we love someone, then we are compelled by that love to make unselfish and ultimate sacrifices for them no matter what obstacles are in our way. It's also about how undeniably powerful seeing someone truly love someone else can be. Although this book has an undeniable Christian context, the lessons learned from this story transcend mere religion. It's about the human heart. David Knight's illustrations are extremely well done, realistic and fantastic at the same time. This is the best version of this wonderful story."},{"Title":"THE SMALL MIRACLE","review":"I disliked the book because it wasn't all that interesting;it kept on dragging on about the boy trying to get help for the donkey.

Eido Shimano took on the mission of going through Nyogen Senzaki's posthumous papers and editing them into this little volume, a fascinating glimpse of Zen Buddhism's early history in America. First we have some kanshi (Chinese poems) by Nyogen Senzaki, most of them commemorating key moments in the Buddhist calendar or memorializing Senzaki's mentor, the famous modern Rinzai Zen monk Shaku Soen (Americanized as Soyen Shaku in this book)--especially poignant among these are some written in a Japanese internment camp during WWII. Then follow some of his dharma talks, Zen sermons to his emerging religious community refreshing in their profound simplicity and intriguing in the way he incorporates Pali formulas and Theravada approaches into an overall basic, stripped-down Zen framework. Throughout all of this Nyogen Senzaki emerges as a dedicated, humble, straightforward and mildly eccentric mentor and fellow spiritual seeker, and it's easy to see how his small Californian Zen community took root and grew under his guidance and encouragement.The second half of the book shifts the focus somewhat, featuring as it does Senzaki's own English translations of Japanese Zen writings. Besides some fine religious poems by the Kamakura-era monk-poet Jakushi.tsu, these mostly consist of Shaku Soen's autobiography, sermons, poems, and letters to his own mentor Imakita Kosen. What comes through in these translations (and Senzaki's lectures in memoriam of Soen that follow) is a concerted effort to give his Zen community a legitimate lineage, a real solid link with the Japanese Zen tradition anchoring its American transmission--though of course the glimpse they afford us of Meiji Buddhism in and of itself is interesting in its own right.Overall, this is a nice book, even if the contents seem a little miscellaneous. American Zen practioners should still find encouragement in Senzaki's sermons and exhortations, and scholars tracing Buddhism's American history should find a valuable source here. And anyone trying to live a spiritual life in this modern age will find inspiration in Senzaki's own efforts in this regard."},{"Title":"Like a Dream, Like a Fantasy--the Zen Writings and Translations of Nyogen Senzaki","review":"Hard to find sought-after book by a master Buddhist and Zen Master.

She begins receiving anonymous notes that her son is actually alive. She goes to the child's secret father, a police detective. Will he help her find the truth? Now Intrigue is publishing \\"Saving His Son\\" by Rita Herron (Intrigue 601), the story of a woman who is told her child died at birth. She begins receiving anonymous notes that her son is actually alive. She goes to the child's secret father, a police detective. Will he help her find the truth?Sound familiar?It's another case of Intrigue deja vu (and from the looks of it, two months from now, we'll be seeing this story again in Adrianne Lee's \\"Undercover Baby\\"). The secret baby hook is one thing. A story based on such a similar premise is harder to accept. Stevens's book was almost perfect, with the exception of about 500 scenes where the characters stand at windows staring out into the night. Herron's can't help but suffer in comparison. The similarity is unfortunate. This is the best book Herron has produced for the Intrigue line.\\"Saving His Son\\" contains none of the flaws of her previous books: the slow pacing and repetitiveness of \\"Send Me a Hero,\\" the awkward prose of \\"Her Eyewitness,\\" or the passive heroine, obvious ending, selfish hero and soap opera weepiness of the dismal \\"Forgotten Lullaby.\\" The storytelling is brisk, packing plenty of plot in 250 pages. The heroine is a woman who is distraught over the loss of her son. She is still strong enough to fight to get him back, unlike the heroine of her last book, who seemed content to sit around and be victimized. She shows strength and cleverness, earning the title of \\"heroine.\\" Unlike so many secret child stories, it was nice to read one where the father doesn't throw a fit about not being told, but acknowledges how he was at fault. That's a real man, and a real hero. There is emotion and angst, but the plot never comes to a complete stop to allow the characters to wallow in it. \\"Saving His Son\\" is the first real page-turner Herron has written.To her credit, Herron is one of the few new Intrigue writers actually bothering to attempt to write the kind of story this series was built on: a mystery. After four books, she finally wrote a good one. Her last book, the awful \\"Forgotten Lullaby,\\" took the approach of all bad mystery writers: she tried to make the ending a \\"surprise\\" by having the characters suspect everyone except the actual villain. Never mind that she spoiled the surprise in the first chapter. This only made the characters look foolish (they're suspecting everyone they know, including friends and family, and yet they never manage to suspect the one person who has complete access to their lives???) and the obvious tactic made it clear to smart readers who would end up being the villain (why else would she being trying so hard to divert attention from this person?). I mention this only because \\"Saving His Son\\" is so superior it's hard to believe the books were written by the same person, though Herron's storytelling style makes it clear they are. The mystery keeps throwing surprises at the reader. There is a large group of suspects, all of whom are kept equally suspicious until late in the book. It's nearly impossible to know who the kidnapper is and the ending is a surprise. That's the sign of a good Intrigue.\\"Saving His Son\\" is a story with likeable characters, strong emotion and good plot twists combined in a highly entertaining read.

I agree it has no place within the chronicles as the viewpoint is that of a third party, however, as a separate book it makes interesting reading when positioned as originally written in the middle of the Illearth War, although the tome was released as an afterthought following the end of the second chronicles. Is this an attempt by Donaldson to sell more books? Or is he genuinely concerned that the reader understands more about the Bloodguard? Read it and make your own decision."},{"Title":"Gilden-Fire","review":"This book is really nothing more than a vignette, a deleted scene from The Illearth War. According to Donaldson's foreward this was part of an initial separate section to the novel. However, he realized (after being told by his publishers to cut the manuscript down) that the story (told from the perspective of Korik the Bloodguard) didn't have a narrational connection to Covenant's world, thereby weakening the perception of the Land's unreality so key to Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever. Therefore along with Tull's story this episode would have comprised the fourth section of the novel.However, all of that said I would definately recomend this to anyone who loved the Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever. You learn more about the Bloodguard in these few pages than in almost the three novels of the first Chronicles--furthermore it is simply insightful and interesting to see things from the perspective of a Bloodguard.Don't bother with this if you've not read The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever. Simliarly you don't need this if you already have Donaldson's collection of short stories Daughter of Regals.However, if neither of the above apply then you should hunt down this book, especially since this volume will fit better with hard back volumes and includes several illustrations not found in the collection (though the one of Revelstone clearly does not mesh with the book description and the one found in the Atlas of the Land)."},{"Title":"Gilden-Fire","review":"You have to read this missing chapter. Somehow it adds even more depth to the Bloodguard...and I didn't think that was possible."},{"Title":"Gilden-Fire","review":"This is the same Illearth War out-take that appears in Donaldson's compilation of short stories entitled, Daughter of Regals and other Tales."},{"Title":"Gilden-Fire","review":"Gilden-Fire is like 2 missing chapters from the Illearth War. In this book, you get insight into how the minds of the bloodguard work, as well as a more expansive tale of lord Shetra and Hyrim. A good book and a quick read."},{"Title":"Gilden-Fire","review":"Gilden Fire is is the result of one of the earlier modern fantasy writers inability to write anything short. Obviously a disease that has proved seriously catching.Because the Illearth War was too long originally and threatened to turn into a black hole, this is a part chopped out of there and deals with Korik the Bloodguard's quest to Seareach, so is not a Thomas Conveant story as far as that goes, directly.Lords, Giants, fighting as a big finale, too.3.5 out of 5"},{"Title":"Softimage |XSI Character Animation f/x and Design","review":"This book really goes well beyond just using XSI to do character animation. The first chapter discusses fundamentals of XSI, doing a rushed but adequate job of it. The next several chapters discuss the &quot;animation process&quot;, including things like the necessity of creating a character profile, storyboarding, style and color selection, etc. This stuff was genuinely useful and interesting, but not really the meat of the book.The really excellent information comes in the later chapters of the book, where he discusses the basics, tricks, and advanced proceedures for character rig setup (specific to XSI). He shows you how to create a rig, and then layer controls all over it. While some controls can be manipulated directly, he shows you how to hook most to sliders in organized property pages. He goes further to show how to created automatic animation (through expressions) such as automatically rolling the foot as the character takes a step, breathing, automatic muscle flexing, etc. He touches *very lightly* on control of clothes and the like. Beyond that, lip syncing and facial expressions are covered in fair detail, all in XSI specific discussions so you know right where to find the tools that you need to accomplish the tasks (you won't, however, get a comprehensive list of lip shapes for English phonetic sounds for example).He shows you how to make animated &quot;clips&quot; for use in the animation mixer, and then how to mix those clips together to achive a fluid animation. Lip syncing in the animation mixer is also included. There is enough detail in the animation mixer discussion that even if you know nothing about the animation mixer, you will be producing solid animations once you finish the book.Things that are *not covered* are features in XSI that are relatively unrelated to character animation, such as texturing and the render tree, simulation, etc. Hair isn't covered either (the book was written for XSI 1.5, not 2.0). Also, while modeling is discussed, the book does not go into great detail about the modeling of your character, as the focus is more on controlling the animation rather than building the character (he does mention several interesting points about why the animation stage is more important than the modeling stage, particularly for a new-comer like me). Finally, advanced features of XSI such as the ability to transfer animated clips betweem unrelated character rigs is barely touch on, and the transfer of envelope weights between characters is not mentioned.Overall, a *very* informative and useful read for those who *don't* have a rock solid knowledge of XSI and who really don't know much about rig setup and the animation mixer. Oh, and the CD has a couple *excellent* skeleton rigs pre-built with slider controls and all."},{"Title":"Softimage |XSI Character Animation f/x and Design","review":"This book shows you everything you need to know about character set up and character animation in XSI.The first part of the book shows you how to develop your character and other things (storyboards,camera staging,lighting ect) you need to know about production and on the second part you learn all the secrets about character animation.The author guides you from a basic rig to an advanced rig with sliders, expressions and other powerfull features of xsi but it's not only that.He encourages you to dive deeper and explore all these cool features the pro's use.The new animation mixer is covered in depth and some advanced ways of facial animation are explained step by step.Even though this book was written for XSI users it's valuable for every serious animator who wants to explore powerfull character animation!"},{"Title":"Softimage |XSI Character Animation f/x and Design","review":"Thankfully, this book covers character animation very comprehensively and also goes into some of the preceeding tasks that often aren't covered. The first few chpters don't bother with the software but cover possibly more important issues such as character design, storyboarding and creating rough animations in various manners, which is much truer to how most animaton studios would work. I feel this is far better than jumping straight in and hitting the &quot;ok, what next stage&quot; since everything is pre planned. Elements such as cinematography are given a nice introuduction too to give the reader more angles to think about to improve their end product. The character set up stages are well thought out with consideration for areas which can cause problems. The ik setups are solid and flexible. The expressions add extra value too. Various controllers are used for facial animation in the later sections, so most areas are covered very well.... I think this one is a worthy addition."},{"Title":"Softimage |XSI Character Animation f/x and Design","review":"Although the just of this book is character animation, the author goes in to detail about lighting, materials and even the basics of XSI. It was a great addition to my library and enabled me to get a quick jump in to skeletal set-up and constraints, not to mention the whole idea of character set-up, cinematography and scene planning. A definite &quot;must have&quot; for anyone that wants to animate with XSI or any other like program."},{"Title":"Softimage |XSI Character Animation f/x and Design","review":"Don't let the &quot;skimpiness&quot; of this book fool you... at every turn, Maraffi shares with us his hard earned experience and observations. It offers both a &quot;holistic&quot; and specific, task oriented approach to the efficient production of character animation. His rigs are crafty, and truly reflect his unique approach to the software - this is where his mastery shines through. I can't wait to sink my teeth deeper into this bad-boy."},{"Title":"Softimage |XSI Character Animation f/x and Design","review":"Considering the almost complete lack of real documentation in XSI (even in the program itself), this book is almost a godsend, even though it's a bit weak in some areas.Overall, it works as a primer for beginners, touching lightly on interface and basics, but has some excellent chapters on technique and workflow.I would recommend this to a beginner (there's really nothing else out there, anyway, but it's still a good book to have) with no problem. It makes a few assumptions about knowledge (in other words, pair this with some other animation and modeling books) but again, it's an excellent way to get started using what is really, in my opinion (and I know Maya users' hackles will rise at this), the most intuitive 3D application I've ever used.Final analysis: give it a whirl, you really can't go wrong. Any documentation is better than no documentation, and you WILL learn something from it (and likely, you'll learn quite a bit)."},{"Title":"Softimage |XSI Character Animation f/x and Design","review":"I, too, was glad that when this book came out, there finally was some kind of documentation. However, it wasn't really the kind of user guide I was looking for. There is an awful lot of pages wasted in this book, on such things as storyboards, drawing charaters, and so forth. Really what I wanted was a technical manual, that guides me through the features of XSI. If I want a book on storyboarding or cinematography, I'll buy one. For this proud price the Softimage book really left me dissapointed. If you are looking for a comprehensive user guide that introduces you to all the features of XSI and guides you through using them, you've come to the wrong place..."},{"Title":"Affairs of the Heart","review":"I actually didn't finish one of the three stories it was so boring! If you are in to injustices and blind ignorance, then maybe &quot;love [does] defy time and space,&quot; but this anthology was not for me.&quot;Mountain Bride&quot; made me angry... there's no strong heroine here - she runs from her home when the townsfolk stub her over a stupid rumor, settles again, and plans to fly again once her &quot;family&quot; in the new town find out about the rumor. It's just plan dumb.I did not finish &quot;Apache Valentine&quot;... enough said.&quot;The Secret Heart&quot; is the best of the three, but obvious where it's going and how it will end.Not much to keep me awake wondering..."},{"Title":"Affairs of the Heart","review":"I really loved &quot;Affairs of the Heart&quot; and bought several copies to give as gifts. I especially like author Candace McCarthy. She never fails to deliver romance, laughter, and sometimes a few tears. These short shorts are supposed to be light and heart warming. I was delighted with them and I believe others who love romance will too. A perfect Valentine gift for someone. After reading my gift, my friend asked if I'd read other stories by the same authors. She loved the mountain setting of Ms McCarthy's story because she has relatives in West Virginia and often spent summers there."},{"Title":"Affairs of the Heart","review":"I borrowed several books from my best friend and Affairs of the Heart was one of them. This was by far the worst anthology I've read. This was the first time I did not finish reading the complete stories. (All three of them) It was as if all three authors rushed to complete the story. Readers are becoming more and more picky. I know I am. I've enjoyed other books by Stobie Piel but I'm sorry to say, this did not meet the usual expectations. I've never heard of Laurel Collins. She is probably a new author and this was her first try."},{"Title":"Affairs of the Heart","review":"This may have been an anthology for Valentine's Day, but I just found it and I can say...this is a 'year-round' romance! You'll love this book. I did."},{"Title":"Affairs of the Heart","review":"3 different takes on the meaning of Valentine's Day and I thoroughly enjoyed each one in this special anthology. These stories run the gamut between laughs and tears but each story portrays a tender romance. Affairs of the Heart is also notable for the length of the shorts because the greater length allows each author space for deeper characterization than the 4 story anthologies. The unique style and voice of these authors is worth a look too."},{"Title":"Affairs of the Heart","review":"Okay, so the varied reviews sparked my interest in reading the stories. I had to find out for myself so I bought the book and read each story with an open mind. Threaded through the stories, I found two similarities. The heroines were weak and the plots were too convenient. The heroine in Mountain Bride was probably the weakest of all the heroines and the fact that she ran away because of a rumor weakened her considerably. Apache Valentine was the least favorite of all three in general. I could not get into the story at all. About half way through, I lost total interest. The Secret Heart was 'cute' although I found the heroine to have very low self esteem and I felt sorry for her. I look for and admire the 'new' heroine in historicals. The strong, independant, I can do anything heroine. And, perhaps, this is why the stories don't work for me. The heroines are disappointing, therefore, the stories are disappointing. I'm beginning to think the 5-star reviews are prompted by the authors themselves. I don't think anyone who has high standards in what they read could give this book 5-stars."},{"Title":"Affairs of the Heart","review":"Sorry, I've read every anthology that I can get my hands on, but, unfortunately, this was my least favorite. Unlike some of the other readers, I will finish every book I start to give the stories half a chance and with each story I read, I was more and more disappointed. The plots were flimsy and s l o w moving."},{"Title":"Affairs of the Heart","review":"Of the three, Collins spins the best story, however, that's not saying much. Predictable plot. No surprises, here. A shame because the character had such possibilities."},{"Title":"Affairs of the Heart","review":"I loved this book! It's one of the few anthologies I have on my keeper shelf and each story is something special. Look for the full-length novels from all three authors."},{"Title":"Affairs of the Heart","review":"I picked up Affairs of the Heart during vacation, expecting a quick read, and instead found four wonderful stories that were more complete reads than usually found in an anthology. The tone of each story is different and equally satisfying. Candace Mc Carthy's brave heroine had me in tears; with her unique characters and lively dialogue (as well as incredible sexual tension), Stobie Piel had me laughing, and Laurel Collins had me doing both with her spinster heroine who can't believe she's the target of an anonymous admirer. This anthology contains three stories each worthy of standing alone, great for any time of year. I highly recommend each author, &amp; am going straight out to look up their other titles!"},{"Title":"Affairs of the Heart","review":"I borrowed several books from my best friend and Affairs of the Heart was one of them.

This free e-book is in the public domain. This is the German language Kindle edition, it has 8004 locations. This edition contains footnotes and a biography.This book is about the Renaissance in Italy, which experienced its pinnacle around 1500. Burckhardt did extensive research in archives before writing this book, he used sources from the times itself. Even though Burckhardt was an art-historian, this book is a book about history, there is little about art in this book. Burckhardt not only writes about states, but also about people, language, clothes, religion and every day life, universities and schools, immorality, poetry and much more. This is a great book, in spite of its age it is still very readable, Burckhardt had a lively way of writing. I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in history, this is not only one of the most important history-books ever written, it is still a nice read.The only negative thing I can say about it is that Burckhardt's idea of a complete break between the Middle Ages and the Renaissance is now obsolete; today it is genarally believed that it was not a complete and sudden break but a slow process, in which some people moved faster towards the modern times than other people.If you liked this book, then you'll probably will also like the works by Johan Huizinga (1872-1945).The contents of this book are 6 'books', each of those has several chapters. The 'books' are:Part One: The State as a Work of ArtPart Two: The Development of the IndividualPart Three: The Revival of AntiquityPart Four: The Discovery of the World and of ManPart Five: Society and FestivalsPart Six: Morality and Religion"},{"Title":"Gaia Holistic Health Series: Migraine: Take Control of Your Health Naturally","review":"I have suffered from fairly frequent migraines for the last few years, and have recently begun looking at more alternetive/holistic methods or curing them than standard \\"Western\\" medicine can offer. This book by Ann Redfearn is extremely helpful because it offers a wide spectrum of alternative methods and really helps the reader to find the original causes of their migraine, rather than merely offering advice on pain-killing.It is split into chapters all addressing a different aspect of the holistic approach that this book takes, such as emotional and dietry causes of and remidies for migraines. Also included are chapters on herbal remedies, relaxation techniques, exercise, massage and colour therapy. These things are simply explained and easy to follow, and some of the smoothy recipies in the dietry section are fantastic! I would recomend this book to anyone who suffers from migraines, occasonally or frequently, as it really helps to take the stress away and gives on practical advice which is also soothing and enjoyable to follow."},{"Title":"Suddenly Sexy","review":"I love this story..It is a great read...Jesse and Katie are great characters...Jesse and Katie were friends since childhood and come together after getting over emotions from their past.

Well written and a must read."},{"Title":"Suddenly Sexy","review":"It was pretty good. We were set up for a control freak, and she just turned out to have mommy issues. Jake seems hot, but... Not my type. I'm from DFW and I just didn't connect well."},{"Title":"Suddenly Sexy","review":"This is my second book by LFL and they just keep getting better! Loved Jesse for so many reasons, he's flawed because of the way his Father brought him up, he was more buddy then parent. But his caring for Katie for all her life was so sweet and showed what a great heart he has! Katie never waivered she just loved Jesse and believed in him. Jesse also finds out he has a son Travis who is 12 but acts more like 30, cute kid, with some teenage issues with fitting in because of the way his Mom has brought him up. I think the main reason Jesse and Travis bond is their similar up bringing. Katie's girlfriends are a riot and can't wait to read their stories!!"},{"Title":"Suddenly Sexy","review":"This book was cute. Not the best I've ever read, but definitely not the worst. The characters were enjoyable, but nothing memorable either. A cute weekend read."},{"Title":"Suddenly Sexy","review":"I read the 'Sexy' books out of order, and this was one last for me. It's a good thing I didn't read this book first, because I wasn't that drawn in by the characters or thieir story. Basically, childhood friends Katherine Bloom and Jesse Chapman discover love when he returns home. Katherine was a fun and lively character, who provided humor and heart throughout the book, but Jesse... he was a cad, a player, a loverboy, etc. I really didn't see him as a fit with Katherine, and his reformed character just wasn't believable. The book was ok, but I'd skip it in favor of the other two in this series; the books stand individually and do not need to be read in order."},{"Title":"Suddenly Sexy","review":"This book was great. I just got done reading it and I want another one, so I will be getting the next book soon. It was funny, warm, sexy and hot. I have never read this author, but I was drawn in fast and deep. Great book."},{"Title":"Suddenly Sexy","review":"I discovered Linda Francis Lee by accident with Looking for Lacey this summmer. I fell in love with Lacey and Bobby Mac and to my surprise they made an appearance in this book. I LOVED this book! Any author that can make me laugh out loud in once paragraph and tear up in the next is on my favorites list. And LFL definitely did that. The chemistry between Jesse and Kate was perfect. Actually the chemistry between each of the characters was excellent--except I wish we could have seen some sort of closure with Jesse's dad but all in all I loved all the characters in this book and can't wait to see what happens with Chloe and Julia."},{"Title":"Suddenly Sexy","review":"Linda Francis Lee has outdone herself in this emotionally-gripping story with love and laughter wrapped into the package. The relationship between Kate and Jesse is very intense. And if that weren't enough, factor in a teenage boy, friends, and family and you have a gripping book that you don't want to put down. A definite MUST read!"},{"Title":"Suddenly Sexy","review":"This book sizzles! HOT, HOT, HOT! I am an avid reader of thriller and horror novels. I also like to dive into a romance book from time to time. I was thrilled to be given the chance to read Suddenly Sexy. This book wasn't like any romance novel I have ever read. This book kept me on the edge...of my seat, the ENTIRE time! To be brutally honest I have never heard of Linda Francis Lee. I will never forget her! She has grabbed my attention and I have to say I am going to head out and find more of her books.The main characters Kate and Jesse are very different. Kate is looked at as a prude, small time girl and is trying her hardest to break the mold. Jesse, the boy next door to Kate growing up is now an amazing stud. A bad boy that all us girls have dreamed of at some point in our life! Kate sure has. She has never forgot Jesse when he moved away so many years ago. She has always cared for him, even loved him. Jesse, a golf pro, comes back to get away from an event he doesn't want to remember. He saved a woman at a golf tournament and hasn't quiet been able to get past the event. We find out more secrets about these two as the story unfolds. The story just keeps getting better as it throws in more detail about these characters and their lives. I have read some amazing books in the last few years but I seriously can't remember the last time I felt so alive, amazed, and well...sexy! This book will melt all the snow off your roof this winter!"},{"Title":"Suddenly Sexy","review":"Jesse Chapman and Katherine \\"Katie\\" Bloom had grown up as neighbors and close friends, despite their age difference. Jesse had helped Katie as she grew up into a lovely lady. He had protected her from bullies and kept her sane when her mother ignored her which was most of the time. In return, Katie loved Jesse for who he was, regardless of his bad boy attitude and ways. Young Katie had been utterly crushed when Jesse left her behind in El Paso, Texas, while he left to become a golf pro.The audience believed Katie was too prim and proper as a news anchor for KTEX TV. So her best friends Julia and Chloe, who happened to be the station's owner and manager, decided to show the public another side of Katie. \\"Getting Real With Kate\\" was done live. The first show was supposed to have a cooking theme with the guest star being a famous chef. Katie was really worried when the chef had not shown up when the two minute air time warning was announced. But when Julia walked in and threw Jesse in as a replacement for the chef, Katie panicked! And after the show, when Julia used guilt to persuade Katie into letting Jesse stay in her guest cottage, Katie came close to a panic attack! How could she possibly survive having Jesse so close to her again? How would she possibly survive when Jesse left her again?Jesse Chapman was on the verge of winning the PGA Championship. The tournament was in less than a month. The magazines and tabloids constantly told of his winnings on the golf course, as well as, with the string of ladies that came and went. Recently, Jesse had saved a woman's life. The media refused to leave Jesse alone. When Jesse felt himself about to fall apart, he returned to El Paso for a vacation. Instead of relaxing, Jesse found himself still wanting Katie as his own. He also found out that he had a twelve-year-old son named Travis!***** A great beginning to the \\"Sexy\\" trilogy. Travis's mother is seldom in the picture. The story focuses on Katie, Jesse, and Travis with terrific results. I would never have guessed that a book with golf in it could possibly be so much fun. The book is full of humor and witty emails exchanged between Katie, Julia, and Chloe. As for Travis, he may only be twelve, but living with his mom has given him more serious experience with how women react to things. So he is twelve, going on thirty. I still chuckle at the memory of Jesse being agog at Travis stating that Katie NEEDED to eat ice cream straight out of the carton, forget the bowl. I fell in love with the character of Travis right then! This novel is another winner by Linda Francis Lee. BRAVA!On a side note, if you put all three covers from the trilogy side-by-side, they make one large picture. Excellent idea! *****(...)"},{"Title":"Suddenly Sexy","review":"When I was looking for a romance novel and stumbled upon this one, I couldn't believe it. Who knew romance novels could be witty and funny too?! Within 2 nights I read the entire thing and couldn't wait to hear more about Kate, Chloe and Julia! This is seriously one of those novels that keeps bringing you back for more!"},{"Title":"Suddenly Sexy","review":"This book is for every girl that carried a flame for the boy next door...Kate Bloom is trying to revamp her image, to connect with the audience that watches the local TV station for which she works. Bad boy and boy-next-door Jesse Chapman couldn't have picked a worse time to come home and turn her life upside down... or perhaps a better.While she juggles with the inevitable disasters that follow her attempts to become someone else, Jesse finds that his little Katie has grown into a sexy woman - and that despite his attempts to protect her from himself, he just can't stay away from her.This is the first of three stories about three childhood friends battling through life together as adults. I really love this idea, as frequently I read a book with really well-written supporting characters, and feel disappointed that we don't find out more about them. It's a relief to know that we'll hear more about this world, as 'Suddenly Sexy' sets the scene so richly that it would be a shame to waste it.The characters are sincerely three dimensional. There's a kind of nobility in Jesse's desire to protect Katie from himself, being a notorious womaniser and all, but there's a depth to his character stemming from traumatic childhood abuse at the hands of his father. This depth adds not just to his character, but to the wider world of the story and the surrounding cast of characters.The fact that he's really pretty hot helps as well :) I hope that my imagination did him justice.Kate is a woman that I really could relate to. She's changed a lot since he last saw her, and she has to work hard to change his outdated perception of her - which is complicated by her adventures at the TV station. But they both need to face the past to erase its capacity to torment them, and their childhood connection, and newfound romance, allows them to help each other to do just that.Although there are times when 'Suddenly Sexy' is laugh-out-loud funny, swooningly sensual and tenderly romantic, it manages to tackle issues of self perception and identity without appearing to. As a result, it's not just entertaining, but satisfying as well.'Suddenly Sexy' has it all - witty dialogue, convincing characters and window-fogging sex scenes. I found it thoroughly enjoyable, and look forward to the next two. Linda Francis Lee joins Shirley Jump in my top-five romance authors, and I don't know if I can hold out until the rest of the books are released!"},{"Title":"Suddenly Sexy","review":"In El Paso, Jesse Chapman and Katie Bloom were close friends as he kept her safe from bullies and an indifferent mother while she simply loved him in spite of his bad boy image. When Jesse left the city to become a golf pro, Katie was devastated.KTEX TV news anchor Kate learns that viewers doubt that a pedantic woman can do this demanding role. The station's owner Julia Boudreaux and its manager Chloe Sinclair decide their friend needs an image rework so they put together a live show, \\"Getting Real with Kate\\". The debut show centers on cooking, but Jesse arrives as a last second replacement chef for the guest who failed to show up. Julia blackmails a panic stricken Kate, who still loves Jessie, into letting him stay in her guest cottage as he hides from the media just before the PGA Championship. Jessie quickly realizes that he never forgot his Katie, but before he can explore his feelings, his high school girlfriend Belinda shows up with twelve years old Travis claiming the boy is his.The opening tale of the \\"Sexy\\" trilogy is a fine tale starring two delightful protagonists who prove you can go home if love is there. The lead couple is a delight while the email exchange between the three TV female friends is amusing. Belinda makes no sense as she rushes off to Vegas to start a career leaving her son that she hid from his father for twelve years behind; Travis is the ace of the tale as an \\"adult\\" preadolescent who understands women better than his former womanizing dad does.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Suddenly Sexy","review":"This is another story where the heroine is in love with a man-ho.The good girl loves a man from her childhood who has too many notches on his bedpost and then finds out he has a child with another woman.

From the opening email between Kate and her friend and boss Julia, you become immersed in the witty, intelligent and sometimes humiliating world of Kate Bloom, News Anchor at KTEX TV West Texas. For many years, Kate has been playing it safe, both in the workplace and in her social life. Timid and reserved from growing up under the frivolous parenting of her mother, she has created a world, which is risk free, responsible and respectable. She has yet to understand who she really is as she desperately clings to playing life safe.The antithesis to safe, responsible and respectable is sexy, dark and gorgeous Jesse Chapman. Despite living next door to Kate, his life couldn't have been more different to hers. Whether it be from grief at losing his mother at age ten, judgement from his elder brother, or from his father's prolific neglect to father him not befriend him, woo and taint him, Jesse leads a carefree life especially when it comes to women. He maintains his control however, and has not let anyone into his heart. Until, that is, he reunites with Kate.Through a surprising twist of circumstance, Kate and Jesse are thrust together to not only work through Kate's career issues, Jesse's future as a pro-golfer but also his new role as a father. Added to this mix is the undeniable attraction that sizzles between the two former friends. From the moment they meet, sparks fly. Kate is tenacious and strong, but terribly weak when it comes to Jesse. From their first instance of contact, the temperature heats up. At some moments he is like a predator stalking his prey, oozing sex and seduction. At others, he withdraws leaving Kate breathless, shaking and confused.Linda Francis Lee has you glued to the words as passion ripped between Kate and Jesse, keeping your pulse racing. There actually weren't many sex scenes but that doesn't mean that you won't be feeling hot and squirmy many times throughout the book.One of the other terrific elements about the book is the friendship between Kate, Julia and Chloe, three friends since childhood. Mostly through their humorous and feisty email conversations, you learn that theirs is a rich, deep friendship where all is shared and trusted.Suddenly Sexy was so well written, that it was incredibly difficult to put down. The humor was well placed, often unexpected, the sizzling sexual tension brilliant, as was the underlying story so well told, of the need of acceptance and love. A complete package so worth the read. I laughed, cried, smouldered and snorted, and simply can't wait to read the Sequel!"},{"Title":"Suddenly Sexy","review":"Having previously enjoyed The Devil in the Junior League, by Lee, I try to keep an eye out for her other novels. Thus, imagine my excitement to find not one, but three! Suddenly Sexy is the first novel in the Sexy Trilogy, followed up by Sinfully Sexy and Simply Sexy. Having read all three prior to writing this review, I'll say two things - (1) this is my favorite book of the three and (2) you'll want to read them in order.Suddenly Sexy is a classic story about good girl and bad boy, with the added element of childhood friendship/almost-romance. However, good girl and bad boy has a modern twist, with each of them having demanding careers, parental issues, and emotional obstacles. Not to mention, bad boy tries to be a let down in a big way towards the end - very shocking!I liked both Jesse and Kate, and the friendship between Kate, Chloe and Julia was a wonderful element, yet Lee did a great job of making sure the friendship did not overshadow the love story. This is an enjoyable read that I would recommend to anyone - light and fun, without being cheesy."},{"Title":"Suddenly Sexy","review":"I picked this book up to take with me on a trip and found it a quick and easy read.

Katherine \\"Kate\\" Bloom is the anchor of KTEX. Known as somewhat of a stuffed shirt, she tries her best to add levity to her remote segments aptly titled \\"Getting Real with Kate.\\"When literally, the boy from next door (who has warmed her heart since childhood) turns up at the station and helps her save a cooking segment with a naked chef who is a no show, she is all thumbs when it comes. Jesse Chapman is the bad boy of golf and he is back in El Paso to shy away from the limelight while gearing up for his next PGA match after being touted as a hero for \\"rescuing\\" a fan. He appears to have lost his edge (you know, in an edgy golfer sort of way).When he is thrust back into Kate's world, staying in the guest house of all places, the two find themselves in \\"too close for comfort\\" proximity. Will she open her heart once again to the father of all heartbreakers? Will he let his guard down enough to let the one woman who can make a difference inside?Interlaced with funny emails that assist in setting the tone and advancing the storyline, the plot trudges along at a quick pace. The characters jump from the page, and you find yourself excited about what future installments in the series have to offer."},{"Title":"Suddenly Sexy","review":"Katie Bloom has loved Jesse Chapman since she was a little girl.

While on this vacation home,he finds himself hit with surprises. One of them being that the \\"little Katie Bloom\\" that he remembers isn't the little girl that he remembers.I loved this book. I have a thing for strong men that have a vulnerable,broken nature to them. I loved that Katie was the one who made Jesse see the man that he's destined to be. I loved that Jesse helped Katie to see that she doesn't have to be anyone but herself. Normally,you have a book about a man validating the woman but with this book,both characters help each other to see who they are.The secondary characters: Julia and Chloe,although having a very small part in this book have books of there own and I'm excited to read about them. I hope their books are as wonderful as this one is."},{"Title":"Suddenly Sexy","review":"You know a book is good when you get so into it in the bathtub that an hour and a half passes without your knowledge. That's what happened to me the day I read this book. And I literally mean, the day.I had read a chapter or two one Saturday and got up Sunday morning and began reading again. I finished it Sunday night in the bathtub.I was sad when I finished the book because I felt like Kate, Chloe and Julia were my friends. I just got the next book \\"Sinfully Sexy\\" and am already halfway through it."},{"Title":"Suddenly Sexy","review":"Ms. Lee has penned a very witty, and fun contemporary romance that combines great characters, laughter, and of course romance.Katherine, \\"Katie\\" Bloom is trying to re-invent herself. Problem is she is not sure how to go from prim and proper, stuffed shirt news anchor, to fun and flighty news anchor. Her friends (it doesn't hurt that they are also co-workers and boss) think that they have the answer with \\"Getting Real With Kate\\" a news segment that is suppose to bring Kate down to her viewers. Well, needless to say Kate is totally ambivalent since her first segment is supposed to include a naked chef (yes, I did say naked) and Kate has enough problems with the kitchen let alone a naked chef to boot. Now said chef is late, and in walks the love of her life (since she was four) looking much too yummy for words. The fact that she has made a cake of herself with Jesse Chapman more then once is just a little too much even for prim Kate. Before she knows it though Jesse has found a place to stay in her guesthouse, and all of the feelings she though she had buried for him have well, lets just say managed to find the light of day...again! What's a girl to do?Jesse Chapman has returned to El Paso, Texas to get out of the limelight and reporters after his historic rescue of a golf fan during one of his matches. Jesse can play golf like no ones business and he has got the PGA coming up so it only makes sense to get his act together and his game back where it all started...at home. But this means seeing Katie again. The one woman that he has always wanted, but felt he could never have...never and now Katie has finally grown up and is more of a temptation then ever before. Will he be able to walk away from her when the time comes?This was a great read. Katie and Jesse are dynamic characters that truly come to life for the reader. Add Chloe, Julia, and Travis and you have a great cast of characters that will stay with the reader long after the final pages have been read. I highly look forward to the rest of the series, and suggest that if you love laughter with your romance that you not overlook Ms. Lee.Official Reviewer for www.romancedesigns.com."},{"Title":"Suddenly Sexy","review":"I loved this book and the wonderful, warm and witty characters.

Loved it and looking forward to the rest!"},{"Title":"Gods from outer space;: Return to the stars, or evidence for the impossible","review":"In this follow up to Chariots of the Gods Daniken looks for evidence of aliens' past visits to earth by examining archaeology. Many cultures from the past show rays projecting from the heads of the people they portray. Large carved rocks are hard to explain. Using technology of the time they would have been very tedious to erect.Throughout the book Daniken asks, \\"How could they do this without help from aliens?\\" or \\"Is this a carving of an alien?\\" Sometimes his analysis of what he finds is way off, as when he describes a carving of a person inside a carved circular decoration and captions it as a person in a \\"spherical spaceship\\" Art historians can have a laugh at Daniken's expense.There is good archaeology here.

In particular the focus is on the UK. Sometimes the book verges on being a marketing promotion for the major European sites rather than any sort of subjective snapshot of the site and the entrepreneur behind it. Also, there is a total failure to acknowledge the other individuals that stand behind each successful entrepreneur. Without a close knit team in charge of all the various features of the web-business the Internet entrepreneur would be a zero. Obviously, the authors of the book missunderstand the real skill of the internet entrepreneur which lies in forming the team and keeping it together and building on its strengths. The idea that one single person can excel in all the functions of a company and be a mythical hero slaying the competition is just fantasy. The focus should also be on the team that realises the entrepreneurs vision. However, having said that the book is worth reading for the wide range of companies on the Internet who are doing many different things and being successful. The areas examined are B2C and B2B and the companies are predominantly European. Now and again in the interviews of the entrepreneurs there are interesting comments made about why the company has been successful on the web. On these occassions it is worth checking out the associated web-site to examine the company more closely."},{"Title":"Heroes.com: The Names and Faces Behind the Dot Com Era","review":"I purchased this book during the dot-com boom and I strongly feel that this book should be on the shelf of any budding entreprenuer or decision-maker. Why?This book is not only about the profile of dot-com visionaries; it is also about the passion of developing a unique business model that is accelerated by new economy tools to reach out to a global market. It is about filling a need.As we enter the wireless age, this book is essential for students to understand the rules of business will not change.

Quite different from similar books on the subject it is the personal story of the life and experiences of the author. Rev. James T. Stout opens up his heart and his life to public scrutiny in order to provide a thorough picture of the thinking patterns and problems of people with bipolar disorder. And yet, as he goes through his various experiences, interlaid within the story itself is the story of how rebuilt his life, the strategies that worked, the techniques that benefited his life, and how he has become more in control of his moods. It is a story of hope and practical guidance for those dealing with bipolar disorder or those who know someone with the disorder. The author masterfully leads the reader through learning to rebuild their life without resorting to jargon or a cold, sterile treatise on the disorder. Intensely personal, highly educational, it is a highly recommended read for anyone wanting to know more about bipolar disorder for whatever their reason."},{"Title":"Bipolar Disorder: Rebuilding Your Life","review":"Stout provides a very rare take on bipolar disorder. It is from the perspective of one who has been there (is there) and has more than survived. As a psychiatrist, I have rarely encountered a 'personal experience' volume with such bredth and balance. Yes, he includes religion... he's a minister! But he identifies scores of important aspects to 'rebuilding your life' with bipolar disorder. He doesn't shun medicine as some organized evil attempt at behavioral control. He doesn't say God will heal you without any work on your part. Basically he details all the areas of your life, which if taken for granted (like sleep) can lead to symptomatic relapse.The title of Chapter 14, \\"Life in a Psychiatric Unit: Sometimes Awful, Sometimes Fun\\" fairly well says it all. (And it describes working in a psych unit too!)Stout has maintained a sense of humor, balance and optimism which would be well adopted by anyone facing a mental health challenge. He has no hidden agendas and never preaches. He tells it like he has experienced it, and as it has worked for him. And he tells it well.Heartily recommended to all."},{"Title":"Bipolar Disorder: Rebuilding Your Life","review":"Precise, Great Advise. A true Bipolar Recovery book. I have never seen a self help book I couldn't put down. A great book for all those who suffer from Bipolar. Especially those who were victims of abuse. Speaks to those in commons language. Doesn't preach. Speaks of the importance of medication. A must own."},{"Title":"Bipolar Disorder: Rebuilding Your Life","review":"This is a very good memoir about the author's struggle with and recovery from bipolar disorder. It reminded me a little of \\"Manic by Midnight\\" in that an important message of the story is how to rebuild your life in the wake of the disorder, particularly in the wake of mania. The quality of writing is pretty good, as the author writes well enough to bring the story vividly to life. Not being too religious myself, I nonetheless didn't mind the juxtaposition of religion with the story, and if anything this contributed to the story. Overall, an interesting read. Avery Z. Conner, author of \\"Fevers of the Mind\\"."},{"Title":"Bipolar Disorder: Rebuilding Your Life","review":"A very close relative of mine has bipolar disorder, so I've read everything I've been able to find on this subject.However, this book is as comprehensive an analysis as I've found. Although the author goes into a bit more detail of his day-to-day life than I wanted, DO NOT skip a single chapter. Every chapter has tools and techniques that are invaluable to understanding and coping with the disorder.The book is especially trailblazing in putting this \\"chemical\\" condition in the context of a dysfunctional upbringing. And in presenting skills for dealing with those, related, problems.The appendices are especially helpful, and succinct."},{"Title":"Bipolar Disorder: Rebuilding Your Life","review":"This is an excellent book about a man who has suffered with bipolar disorder (manic-depression) and has begun to rebuild his life. The author does an excellent job of explaining his story and more importantly, provides tips and strategies to others who have been affected by this terrible condition."},{"Title":"Bipolar Disorder: Rebuilding Your Life","review":"Bipolar is a big part of my life and my families life. Understanding the people who deal with it must be as hard as having it. Reverend Dr. James Stout gives us a \\"diary\\" if you will, of his life and dealing with his abusive family. Not a technical book but a book that will teach you practical techniques for managing moods without losing your mind. Unlike the other books out there on this subject, Rebuilding your life, makes you feel like you are not alone. Someone else has been through this and knows how you feel and is trying to help you.I commend Reverend Dr. James Stout for the courage I know it took to write this book."},{"Title":"Bipolar Disorder: Rebuilding Your Life","review":"After hearing Dr. Stout speak at a NAMI meeting, I rushed right out and purchased the book. Not only does it do an excellent job of explaining the emotions of someone living with this illness, it is riveting. I didn't want to put it down. Several friends have asked to borrow it.One of the things that is difficult to understand for many of us family members of someone living with mental illness, is the utter despair and hopelessness they experience when they are symptomatic. Dr. Stout is able to convey this well.There is a lot of good information for family members as well as ill people themselves. My ill family member and I have both used many ideas from his book.I highly recommend it for a good read and for useful information."},{"Title":"Letters from an American Utopia: The Stetson Family and the Northampton Association, 1843-1847","review":"This remarkable book is based on a collection of 75 letters written by members of one family who were part of a Massachusetts utopian community from 1843 to 1847. The book provides a vivid glimpse of the personal lives of that family, as well as a first-hand view of life in such a community, and its historical context. James and Dolly Stetson of Brooklyn, CT, facing economic difficulty, moved with their children to Northampton, MA, in 1843 to join the Northampton Association of Education and Industry. They shared the community's progressive values, such as the abolition of slavery, religious tolerance, liberal education, and equality between races and sexes. Sojourner Truth was also a member of this community for a while. Most of the letters were written by Dolly and her children to their father, who was often on the road selling the community's product: silk. Three additional chapters provide authoritative accounts of the social, political, economic, and historical context in which this community lived, faltered, and ultimately disbanded. An excellent choice for anyone interested in this dynamic period in American history, and the lives of one very energetic fammily."},{"Title":"In Watermelon Sugar","review":"IN WATERMELON SUGARBy Richard BrautiganReview By Moriah HeathIN WATERMELON SUGAR by Richard Brautigan A.K.A. In an unknown substance, which creates life which life is totally surrounded by that happens to be called watermelon sugar......Brautigan has created a tail of an unnamed character who lives in a small community which is like it's own little world, a very different world from our own, but a world with some of the same scenarios.The book shows the readers many things including the points view of the different relationships between two living things such as, lovers, brothers and even the relationships between animals and humans (well mainly humans and talking tigers).IN WATERMELON SUGAR was created to open our minds and our hearts to new and creative things/ideas pressing how far people are willing to go from real life. Brautigan used his original personality with his wonderful variety ideas to create a book with many different trials and journeys that one person could possibly have to go to though one life, but he also added un-realistic things to keep the reader wanting to read.Brautigan used his techniques and added in stories about the tigers and the humans, their relationships. Example: The tigers ate \\"just call me whatever is in your mind\\" (the main character's) parents one morning as the breakfast table in the characters house. Hey at least they were kind enough to stop chomping the main characters parents just long enough to help him with his arithmetic!IN WATERMELON SUGAR is a one of a kind book showing obstacles in an everyday life and how to get around those obstacles without harming others too much (if you're a tiger and it's an adult human and your hungry well I guess the human will just be out of luck).If you need an entertaining book that is able (if necessary) to be read in only a few days then IN WATERMELON SUGAR By Richard Brautigan is the perfect book for you, it's a semi easy read filled with adventures and a great free story line that allows the book to travel in many different ways and many different points of view.

The defining moment of this book for me comes two-thirds of the way through the novella when the antagonist/deuteragonist inBOIL and his posse of Forgotten Works' drinking ne'er-do-wells display what iDEATH(A good place)is all about. He and his cronies have just showed iDEATH incarnate in a half-pantomime to the society at large and inBOIL says alas, &quot;I am iDEATH.&quot; To which Pauline (She is my favorite. You'll see.) retorts, &quot;You're an ass****.&quot; I laughed and thought that it almost seemed an autobiographical punctuation mark to what Brautigan thought of himself and his career. He was calling himself out. Bathos for his pathos. But that's just conjecture.Regardless of Brautigan we have his works. It's brief and wispy enough to read without much deep contemplation, i.e., in the bathtub or while driving or at the beach baking your body into a cancerous mass. It's unique and intriguing enough that you won't get bored and will read it through. But the end result is questionable. For me it was like staring into the blank blue beyond.

In college I wrote a twenty-page research paper on the subject... and Brautigan's style in this work particularly has continued to fascinate me. So often Brautigan's name is associted with his first success, &quot;Trout Fishing in America.&quot; Critics of his time seemed also to be preoccupied with it, to the detriment of his better work. Brautigan himself seemed at times to flaunt that work as a kind of mantlepiece throughout his life.Folly, I think; In Watermelon Sugar is clearly his best work -- a book as unique as &quot;Trout Fishing,&quot; but with the added touch of a uniquely woven plot, something &quot;Fishing&quot; surely lacks.Myth and Symbolism are handled by Brautigan with the hand of a child at play in a dream. To truly appreciate the book, Brautigan insists that you yourself become like that dreaming child, reaching back toward a place you thought you had forgotten. For instance, does anyone remember associating days of the week with certain colors? What color was Wednsday?In &quot;In Watermelon Sugar,&quot; the sun shines a different color every day, beckoning us back to the hidden realm of things lost but not forgotten -- a place we will never forget..."},{"Title":"In Watermelon Sugar","review":"I read In Watermelon Sugar on recommendation from a good friend who, like me, is a writer. He simply handed me the slim volume and said, &quot;This is good. Read it.&quot; After reading the book, this seems quite an apt introduction. Brautigan deals in exquisite simplicities, spare statements and commands expressing the day-to-day of human life and interaction, and he captures these moments with a striking clarity that leaves no opportunity for disagreement. Yet he frames these details in a world so odd they stand out precisely because of their normalcy. His characters live in a place where everything is made out of watermelon sugar, tigers can talk, and the sun shines a different color every day. Within this odd landscape, Brautigan foregrounds and examines the finer points of human life with a poet's voice and a clever eye. While his words are tender, his wit is sharp and wry, and the combination makes the book a richly textured read, deeply satisfying for anyone with a love of language or life."},{"Title":"In Watermelon Sugar","review":"I'm 15 years old and I read this book because there was a referance to it in another book I was reading(I Know This Much is True--another 5-star book) and it sounded intriguing.Being someone who analyzes things to death, I knew right away that this is the kind of book that you will have your own opinions about and no one's opinions are wrong. For example, I think that iDeath was supposed to symoblize Heaven and the Forgotten Works was Earth(what's been \\"forgotten\\")Anyhoo, the book is a rare work of art and one of the most inspiring works of literature to ever be published."},{"Title":"In Watermelon Sugar","review":"First of all, to the iDON'T reviewer below me, I meant to click YES after your review but accidently clicked NO. Sorry, I thought it was a good review.In Watermelon Sugar will mean different things to different people. It's how Brautigan intended it, in the same way the speaker's name \\"depends on you.\\" Ultimately, there can be no key or legend for decoding the book's message. I find it means something a little different to me each day.But what we can do, and what the book is possibly encouraging us to, is ask ourselves what iDEATH is, what the Forgotten Works are, and why there aren't any tigers anymore, and to share our impressions with one another. To listen to and learn about each other.inBOIL achieves his goal and there is purpose in his death. But the speaker never finishes his statue and there seems no purpose in his life. And what about Margaret? You tell me. Maybe she's the sane one, after all.What Brautigan does with language is also worthy of attention. Many of his expressions are violations of pragmatic conventions, that is to say days don't have colors and lanterns aren't tigers or boys. But why not, really? Because we're conditioned to think things aren't that way? Because this is how language restricts the way we conceptualize the world?Is there a reason iDEATH bears so ominous a name? Maybe, maybe not. You decide. College professors love James Joyce. If you read his stories enough times and peruse all the commentaries written about them, you can truly understand what everything means, what the characters represent, and all the other hidden secrets. That seems to me to be the main reason why Joyce is held in such high esteem. It's also the reason why I don't much appreciate his writing. He knew what he was doing and we're all caught up in a game of solving his riddles. I think it's a lot more interesting when the writer isn't sure what he's doing, when he doesn't have all the answers, even all the questions.I can't say In Watermelon Sugar is a brilliant piece of work. It's novel for sure, engaging, and well worth the read. Its problem is a lot like what makes it special: there's no bottom line. So is it nonsense or genius? I'd say the question simply doesn't apply."},{"Title":"In Watermelon Sugar","review":"I think that this is one of those books that people try to overanalyze, which is a shame. This isn't a book that will change you as a person, there are enough of those out there, this is simply a book that will make you appreciate beauty. You feel how beautiful Ideath is, and by extension, you appreciate how beautiful our world is. That seems to be Brautigan's goal throughout all of his novels, and his poetry- simplicity and beauty. It works."},{"Title":"In Watermelon Sugar","review":"I read this book in a single one night-long binge while in the midst of a nasty relationship breakup. It hit me right between the eyes, and I still can not explain exactly why. Certain themes resonated strongly with my own circumstances at the time; and for whatever reason this book synergized with my state of mine with an emotional intensity I have never equalled since. I was left heartbroken yet exhilarated, emotionally devastated and yet healed. Fearing that, like the insights gained in travels with Lucy (that seem trivial by the light of day), the effect will be unrepeatable, I have not read the book since."},{"Title":"In Watermelon Sugar","review":"I'll start right off by explaining my comparison to Hemingway. This is definitely a book Hemingway would never have written, but the prose style can be said to be similar, in that it is simple, straightforward. That said, nothing else is to be compared to Hemingway.\\"In Watermelon Sugar\\" is a fascinating story which takes place in a no less fascinating environment, where the sun shines a different colour everyday. It's also a place where tigers used to exist, and devour people, even though they were very polite and kind, and just had to eat people because that's what tigers do to survive. It's hard to give you a taste of this novel, but this is my attempt.Brautigan's novel is divided in 3 books, which are themselves divided in very short chapters (often less than a page). All of this makes for a very easy reading, although you will have to struggle with lots of cryptical deicticism, so to speak; much like in the early pages of a science-fiction novel &agrave; la Philip K.

Richard Brautigan is a very special writer."},{"Title":"In Watermelon Sugar","review":"In Watermelon Sugar creates a world so fascinating that I literally couldn't put it down. Brautigan paints a surrealistic picture of a post-apocalyptic world, where strange people do strange things, but still maintains a warmth that is universal. It's incredibly sad to read the book and know that Brautigan took his own life because he felt he would never be appreciated. You'll never want it to end, and you'll want to read all of his books."},{"Title":"In Watermelon Sugar","review":"every time I read it, I'm 18 again. I first read 'In Watermelon Sugar' in years ago when I was 18. It's a short, strange, dreamy story - not the kind of book I would ordinarily give 5 stars to. But 10 years or so ago, I found and bought a copy (I'd lost my original) and I've re-read it several times. Each time I do, I'm back in my old bedroom with its wood floor, abstract floral bedspread, paper umbrella mobile & 12-stringed guitar in the morning with the sun shining through the window. I've never before had a book transport me back to when and where I was when I first read it.

The unnamed narrator lives in iDeath, a commune of sorts, still recovering from the time of the tigers.

Absolutely indispensable"},{"Title":"In Watermelon Sugar","review":"I've read perhaps a thousand books in my life, and this remains my favorite. At first glance it appears as simple as a children's story, but its ideas sprout like watermelon seeds in your mind and grow to intertwining immensity. One is drawn into Watermelon Sugar and reincarnated into its world at each reading. And multiple readings are a certainty. As the characters boil watermelon juice down into its essence and so build their world, Brautigan boils down essences of love, jealousy, curiosity, angst, family, and art to build for the reader a life in distilled complexity. An author simultaneously approachable and bewildering, Brautigan is a must-read, and In Watermelon Sugar is doubtlessly his finest work. Brautigan offers more in one of his two-page chapters than many authors give you in their life's work. If he had written this review it would have taken three short sentences, said more, spoken more clearly, left you with unforgettable images to savor, and given you a laugh or three along the way. For an insightful critical analysis see Terrance Malley's volume on Brautigan in the &quot;Writers for the 70s&quot; series (Warner, 1972)."},{"Title":"In Watermelon Sugar","review":"Oh my. What a marvelous work of art for Mr. Brautigan. They tell us never to judge a book by the cover...but what about the title? That alone should prompt intrique and conjure a very special image, a very personal image. I guess that was what compelled me to read further and what had followed was a wonderful boatride down the magical river each of us has in our literary souls. And I believe that is the essence of a great book. I will not use this space to begin to describe the book or provide a synopsis...that is a delicate morsel for you to taste on your own. I will, however, confess that this magnificent feat of imagery and storytelling is wholesomely unique and true; it is one of those special &quot;books&quot; that escapes classification and floats in the clouds of your own dreamscape. The book made me delve into a world entirely of my own fantasy (where rocking horse people eat marshmellow pies), yet maintained a spectral reality of a grim undertone at times. An extremely invoking book, chock full of sugar-sweet sugar-bitter jellybeans for thought and contemplation. And isn't that really what writing is all about? If you die without having read this little book, I guess you could say your soul was deprived of a little candy and restrained from attaining a fresh sunshine glow of multi-colored watermelon sugar rainbows. We all have the rainbows within us; this book temporarily halts the rain and lets them shimmer..."},{"Title":"In Watermelon Sugar","review":"Since the 40th anniversary of the publication of \\"In Watermelon Sugar\\" is just around the bend, it might be a good time to look back. Seems like we were all reading this little book in the year after the \\"Summer of Love\\", at least out here on the west coast. I remember being handed this little paperback with the words \\"It's real trippy, man\\".This is Brautigan's dreamscape in poetic verse. The child-like prose is pretty close to reading a fairy tale. Brautigan hands the meaning of \\"In Watermelon Sugar\\" over to the reader - it's you who gets to decide the who and what of this story. Wow, trippy, man.So, just what is Watermelon Sugar a metaphor for? Well, on page 38 we find: \\"We take the juice from the watermelons and cook it down until there's nothing left but sugar, and then we work it into the shape of this thing that we have: our lives\\"The first part of this little book is all about tigers eating the author's parents; his arrival at this strange little commune place namediDEATH; and his shacking up with a hippie chick named Pauline. The trout in the river have something to do with Watermelon Sugar but that could also have something to do with leftovers from Brautigan's first book.The second part is about the bad people at iDEATH and how they eliminate themselves so that the author can resume making love to Pauline and get on with the writing of \\"In Watermelon Sugar\\".Yep, we were all guilty of making Richard Brautigan rich so that he could go on writing some pretty mediocre stuff. His fellow writers didn't think much of Brautigan's writing abilities; but the publishers sure loved him for his sales potential.

I recommend it to all of my friends and have five copies to loan out. The story could happen anywhere, but it takes place in a weird commune (iDEATH) surrounded by millions of miles of \\"forgotten things.\\" Life is simple for the most part and the people are nice, with a few exceptions (inBOIL and his gang). The main character is a writer and seems to have no name but still has great presence. He wanders from his shack to iDEATH daily; that is where he takes most of his meals. He is very friendly towards Pauline, who often cooks at iDEATH. He once had a thing for Margaret but now dreads the sound of that one board on the bridge that she cant seem to miss. It is a story that, in some way, all can relate to and four of my five copies are still floating around."},{"Title":"In Watermelon Sugar","review":"I came home late from work and found the book on my counter (it had been brought in with the mail) and I opened it and immediately read it all the way through. It has been 2 days and I still feel enthralled in that world. Brautigan's unique style is a mix of reactionary childlike curiosity, psychedelic hipster lingo, and pure creative deviance. His knack of planting visuals in the reader's mind is astounding. The narrative caused me to feel jealous of the complete ease that the characters had in being true human beings. I am in love with this book."},{"Title":"In Watermelon Sugar","review":"Back in the 1970s, I always liked reading Richard Brautigan's novels and stories. I would hang out my thoughts in the Atlantic winds with a clothes pin. They would wave and whip about, slowing drying into crystals. Sometimes seagulls would carry them away. They would drop the crystals on the beach to be carried home by tourists. \\"How interesting !\\" I would always think, \\"Brautigan comes up with stuff that nobody else bothers with. It's too simple for them. They want sex, violence, and twisted plots. But he sees the sheer poetry of life and captures all the haiku moments so well.\\"I liked ZAP Comix too. It was the era of Mr. Natural. To quote Heinlein \\"I grokked it in all its fullness.\\" Over the course of my life since then, I lost that clothes pin. It vanished. Maybe it just melted into ear wax or was stolen by the same raccoon who steals stuff out of my garbage every week. Now I like Brautigan's simple humor and clear, plain writing. But IN WATERMELON SUGAR is not very funny. In fact, it is weird, depicting, as in a dream, a kind of (maybe) post-apocalyptic world where nothing is as it seems, even metaphors that vanish into thin air. A strange allegory for sad, complicated times. The Forgotten Works and the useless, formless stuff in there is our crazy, materialist life, but a lot of the tale is not really understandable. You have to approach it from what is already within you. It is the least accessible of all Brautigan's books, I think. You have to hang out your thoughts just as you find them---love, revenge, death, and sacrifice in a very modest world where all the tigers are dead and people live in a commune called iDEATH. Maybe you've got a topnotch clothes pin. If you do, you're going to love this book. Otherwise you might wind up scratching your head. We can't really write dreams, but if anyone could, it would have been Brautigan."},{"Title":"In Watermelon Sugar","review":"This is a beautiful book. I really enjoyed every word of it.But it's a little hard to call it a book. It's a Brautigan.It's beautiful poetic verse filled with magical dream-like images and events. Suns that change colors for each day of the week.Lanterns shaped like trout. Statues of vegetables!.People buried in tombs that are filled with light and float under the water with curious trout. bridges lit up withlanterns shaped like shadows and trout. I'm not even sure if I readthese things correctly but I loved it just the same because this booktriggers your imagination and really was a wonderful read.And the part about black sun days being silent was haunting at the end of the book when Margaret died. Her funeral was silent. very very sad and hit me hard. you could feel the silence. his phrases are so powerful. And again when Margaret's room full of forgotten things was closed up forever and no noise was made.I just liked this book very much.

It boggled my mind with the visual imagery that the prose produced. Visiting it again over 30 years later, Bruatigan still manages to amaze as he takes his reader into a world that is so gentle, it is frightening. With soft words and a dulcet tone, the author brings up sharp visions that are almost hypnotic in their hallucinatory magnificence. Long after you read this, words and snatches of phrases will remain with you so that the reader is haunted by the kindest of ghosts. I am surprised that Bruatigan is not better known, especially with the college set, today. His other books (Trout Fishing In America, The Abortion) are a bit more wordy and, while still fascinating, harder to digest, this novel always seemed to me to be the one to capture the \\"tune-in/ tune-out\\" sensibilities of America in the late sixties. In short, this is a book that everyone should read at least once."},{"Title":"In Watermelon Sugar","review":"As an author myself, I think I've re-read maybe 3 fiction books in my life, but this one I've got my eyes open for.

It's been over 20 years since I read this book. I'm going to get it out and read it again. Then I'm going to encourage my kids to read it. Next comes Trout Fishing..."},{"Title":"In Watermelon Sugar","review":"\\"In Watermelon Sugar\\" is the unrecognizeed masterpiece of Brautigan's works - Trout Fishing in America was required reading during the late 60's, but Watermelon is the better of the two. It is a well written narrative, with a truly bizarre subject matter and many moments of humor and human drama. The characters are well thought out and well developed, though not explicitly developed for us in the novel.Perhaps my favorite moment is when the villians of the story confront our protagonists, and proceed to butcher themselves to death. It's a confrontation that fills you with fear, and then whips you right around to laughter, an event that fills you with dread until you realize that, in fact, there was nothing to dread all along.This is one of the best books I've ever read, and I've read many. This is the Brautigan book which seems like it belongs in someone else's ouvre, perhaps Vonnegut or Dick, or even Clarke. It's hard to place.I heartily reccomend this book to anybody who enjoys fantasy, science fiction, or just plain wierd books."},{"Title":"In Watermelon Sugar","review":"I'm not going to say a whole lot, but this is now one of my top 3 favorite books.

I'm not often moved to tear my clothes off and dance in the streets naked, but this time that course of action seemed to be the only logical choice. &quot;In Watermelon Sugar&quot; is a quiet storm, the kind that lifts up your skirt and laughs at yer knickers before you can even notice it."},{"Title":"In Watermelon Sugar","review":"I read this book several years ago, it is the kind of book that you will never forget.The story is quite amushing, there are two Lions that are in the&lt; story and they come up to this man and tell him how sorry they are that they ate his parnets.They live in a place that I never could figure out, seems like it was underwater and sometimes it apperred not to be, if you like a book that makes you use your brain to figure out the story, this is the BOOK for you.I would encourge anyone to read this"},{"Title":"In Watermelon Sugar","review":"Richard Brautigan, I believe, was first and foremost a beautiful spirit with a old and gently loving soul. His novels and poetry are more delicate, darkly humorous, and original in approach than most any other author I've read in the context of a body of work. \\"In Watermelon Sugar\\" is the first of his books I read, and I was taken by it from the get go. The place (Ideath), the characters (esp. Inboil) and story were unlike any I had come across before with the exception of perhaps Ray Bradbury (who's \\"Dandelion Wine\\" is another favorite of my youth). The way in which Brautigan delicately unfolds the lives and how life itself revolves so much around the Watermelon Sugar shows the deep sensitivity and caring Brautigan imbibed his works with, and provides readers an excellent example of what would be found in subsequent Brautigan readings. It is clear to me what has so drawn young readers (20's mostly) to this book and the others. Brautigan was at once sweet, dark, innocent, savvy, humorous, and often quite sad. The twisted mind of Inboil seemed to embody the irrational greed, recklessness and selfishness of far too many whom Brautigan fought to reconcile in his mind to himself.How can mankind produce such beasts? All I want is a girl, my wine, enough to live on, and some peace of mind.Contrary to Mr. Iverson's previous review, Brautigan was no Thoreau and by no means Mark Twain. Only a miniscule number of writers and thinkers have been. Twain was an artist of the highest order, Thoreau a spirit of the highest order. Brautigan was, though, a true writer, and a talented one. This book and his body of work prove that, and make me so wish I could have finished off a bottle with him while we shared our stories one fine starry night."},{"Title":"In Watermelon Sugar","review":"This book is amazing.

Similarly with the word \\"inBOIL\\".So I went to a bookstore, and bought a paper copy. Not only was \\"iDEATH\\" still in there, but in fact it was on the back cover blurb.The bottom line is that Richard Brautigan was massively ahead of his time. The digital revolution has not outstripped him."},{"Title":"In Watermelon Sugar","review":"Wildly creative, inventive, and unusual. This my introduction to Brautigan and I am now searching for the next title. A beautiful novel!"},{"Title":"Vanilla Beans & Brodo: Real Life in the Hills of Tuscany","review":"In the summer of 2002 I booked a trip to Italy that included a stay in Montalcino. It was then that I became aware of the Isabella Dusi's book, Vanilla Beans and Brodo. I purchased the book to gain some insight on our destination, simply hoping for a travelogue of sights and scenes. Instead what I found was a remarkably well written book discussing not only life in a Tuscan Hill Town, but insight into the fabric of this one small place, both in present day and in history. It made me realize that as an American tourist without such information I would merely be a spectator at an event I had no real knowledge of.So we go to Italy and visit Montalcino for an extended period. Thanks to the book, a primer on daily life, we could participate much more. We met the characters in the book, not just as concepts or fabrications, but also rather as actual living people and found them perfectly described down to their personal habits and traits. We had met shopkeepers, chefs, vintners, waiters and even pet owners in the book and coming upon them in real life was like meeting old friends. Is this the true test of a travel book? If so Dusi scores high.Dusi has acute observation skills that she amply put to use in taking the reader beyond the surface, beyond what a visitor on a good day will understand. She does this with a very natural writing style that speaks, rather than reads.I recommend this book highly, not only for those who will visit this small town, but also for anyone who wants the beginnings of understandings on small town Italy. It is written well enough that one does not even need to have a trip planned, for the depth of the story is enjoyment enough, even compelling."},{"Title":"Vanilla Beans & Brodo: Real Life in the Hills of Tuscany","review":"This is an engaging, informative and entertaining read, which enhanced my visit to Montalcino immensely whilst visiting during September 2002.Huddled under an archway, sheltering from the rain in the Travaglio quartiere, I learnt about the local customs, their pride in their ancestry, and the fierce rivalry and loyalty of the separate quarters.Isabella describes the struggles of the Montalcinesi, who have fought against all odds and invasions since the stone walls were erected in 1110 AD and how this traditional community has adapted to modern life in the 21st century, bringing us the delicious Brunello di Montalcino wine.If you are visiting Montalcino, or indeed, Tuscany, I urge you to read this book. If you don't you'll never scratch beneath the surface of this magnificent region and its people.Isabella Dusi clearly feels very lucky to live in Montalcino; a refreshing change from the usual ex-pat travel stories."},{"Title":"Vanilla Beans & Brodo: Real Life in the Hills of Tuscany","review":"This book takes you for an intimate look at the people, food, wine, and history that lives in the Tuscan hills.Coming from an Ukranian-Australian family that thought Italy was nothing but spaghetti and crazy drivers, Vanilla Beans and Brodo opened me up to the long, hard history that has developed Montalcino and Italy to be the deep, engrained culture that it is.A truly romantic and enchanting book that walked me through the old streets of Montalcino, showed me the luscious gardens in backyards, explored the aromas of the Italian kitchen, and brought to life the history of a small, but wholesome town.5 stars for sure. A book I didn't want to put down. Fantastic reading."},{"Title":"Vanilla Beans & Brodo: Real Life in the Hills of Tuscany","review":"Isabella Dusi has not only written a remarkably interesting and readable book, she has woven Italian history, culture, and religion, grape growing and wine making, festas, food, local personalities (who become friends in the reading) and the way of village life into a brilliant fabric called Montalcino. Dusi's selfless, non-judgmental observations plus a writing style that literally &quot;takes you there&quot; excited me and stirred my interest to the point that I have already, in mid-July, made arrangements to go to Montalcino in October. !0 stars in a crown for Dusi."},{"Title":"Vanilla Beans & Brodo: Real Life in the Hills of Tuscany","review":"You've been to Italy,you've 'done 'Tuscany,now read the book.Isabella Dusi has crept into the heart of a mountain village/town,call it what you like, and made a place for herself in the bosom of Montalcino. I have travelled to Italy numerous times over the past twenty years and fallen in love with the people,the lifestyle the food and of course the wine so I can claim to have some little insight into this glorious country.However,Isabella Dusi has captured in her book everything that I have spent 20 years experiencing.Italians are a complex people,they live uncomplicated lifestyles for the most part and it is very difficult to get really close to a community such as Montalcino. What Isabella Has done is just that. To experience that alone is worth the purchase of this book."},{"Title":"Vanilla Beans & Brodo: Real Life in the Hills of Tuscany","review":"I bought this book prior to our honeymoon in Italy. I had high hopes for it, but unfortunately it was very slow paced. I was not able to finish it, so perhaps it picked up later on in the book. The author spent a lot of time describing things in too much detail, and it lacked a little of that something special that makes you wish you lived in Italy."},{"Title":"Vanilla Beans & Brodo: Real Life in the Hills of Tuscany","review":"The second half of this book is better than the first half; it was a very dry start with little action and overly lengthy descriptions of the author walking around the walls of the city of Montalcino. However, once she gets the tedious descriptions behind her (she uses 50 words where 10 would do), the color and personality of the Tuscan people begin to come to light. My only other complaint is the slightly superior attitude she seems to take toward tourists, considering she had to have been one at some point...she is not Italian, but rather an Australian married to a husband of Italian descent. Both moved to Italy as adults and stranieri (strangers/foreigners).Worth the read, but I have no plans to read her second book any time soon."},{"Title":"Vanilla Beans & Brodo: Real Life in the Hills of Tuscany","review":"This is a must read for lovers of books on life in Tuscany and Italy. Isabella Dusi, an Australian with an Italian husband, relocates to Montalcino, a jewel of a Tuscan walled hilltown, and chronicles their daily life there. She provides the reader with interesting and many times amusing anecdotes about the town's various inhabitants. Her wonderful writing style makes the reader feel as if he is right there participating in all of the various aspects of village life.The reader gets a fascinating historical background on the hilltown's trials and tribulations over the centuries. He learns about the Florentine, Siennese, French and Spanish occupations and their repercussions on the inhabitants of the town.Dusi has excellent chapters on the various festas and town events. Her account of the archery competition between the four quartieri has the reader transported back to medieval times. One gets a palpable sense of the century's old rivalry between the quartieri and of the tremendous loyalty and tenacity of each the quartieri's members.Having been to Montalcino before, I was given a fresh perspective and new eyes with which to view this unique place. I feel that I will go back there and really look at things differently--in a familiar and knowing way.Rarely does a foreigner get to experience real life in a place such as Montalcino. Dusi has provided both active and armchair travellers the unique opportunity to do this. Brava!"},{"Title":"Vanilla Beans & Brodo: Real Life in the Hills of Tuscany","review":"This is an interesting book written by a woman who moved from Australia to Montalcino. There is a lot of Montalcino's fascinating history in the book. While she does steroetype Italians a bit, it isn't too obnoxious. Her description of Montalcino's wine industry (particularly about Brunello di Montalcino) is very interesting and made me really regret not buying some of that wine while we were in Italy. I also enjoyed her descriptions of Tuscan foods.My only complaint about the book is that it is a slow read. For me some of it was redundant, and the parts about the ceremonial hunts and archery contests got boring."},{"Title":"Vanilla Beans & Brodo: Real Life in the Hills of Tuscany","review":"\\"Real Life\\" eh? I bought this as a spare-time-filler for a trip to Tuscany (I go there frequently to visit friends) and admittedly did not have great expectations of something written by an australian interior designer... alas, those fears were realised: this book is the equivalent of an over-decorated room, swagged in purple and fusty with fiddly trinkets.Ms Dusi's websites (plugged at the back of the book and worked into theplot in a very obvious way) make it clear that this book is just one bigadvert for her business in Montalcino. It's full of sentimentalised portraits of her 'friends' in the tuscan hill town (always referred to by her as a \\"village\\" - more charming dontcha know) and despite frequent protestations about how she just wants to \\"to tell their story\\" she's really just living off them.We get the usual parade of lovable-oddballs-with-tough-backgrounds that seem to infest almost every example of the moving-to-live-abroad genre. Somewhat unrealistic? Well, yes: everyone shops at tiny, charming shops run by engaging, eccentric characters - whereas in fact most Montalcinese use the big Co-Op supermarket.As I say, it's a general fault with the genre, but what makes this aninsurmountable problem in Vanilla Beans and Brodo is the sheer awfulness of the writing. Ms Dusi simply cannot write passable Lyrical Descriptions of the Countryside, nor Historical Romance, nor Scenes of Dramatic Tension - which is a shame as she regularly attempts them here.I think in particular of one episode where she pounces on some innocent american tourists who are wandering about. Ms Dusi decides that they are not Experiencing Montalcino fully. Off they go through every lane and alleyway of the place until they meet one of her friends who is looking out over the valley. There they are regaled, at length, with his version of the period when the Sienese Republic was transferred to the easily defensible hill town after the fall of Siena. Ms Dusi goes to town and we get page after page after page of the *most* dreadful sub-Catherine Cookson bilge about Mothers, Poverty, War and Heroism. It's toe-curling.It doesn't help that every time anyone does, or says anything slightly unexpected (or even, in some cases, quite obvious) Ms Dusi informs us that \\"my brain reeled\\" or \\"my head whirled\\" - living in a state of perpetual surprised astonishment may be exciting for her, but it makes for rather boring reading for us.I found this to be a deeply dispiriting, incompetent and somewhat dishonest book and I'd advise people to leave it on the shelf. If you want quality writing about living amongst real italians try Tim Park's excellent books but give this badly written rubbish a miss."},{"Title":"Vanilla Beans & Brodo: Real Life in the Hills of Tuscany","review":"The delivery was very fast.

While I agree with another reviewer that her style of writing is a bit of a slow read, it was so helpful and informative in understanding the Italian culture and way of life. I loved the little \\"snapshot\\" picture stories of their hill top way of life,the tradition involved around the actual preparation of the food, and the human interaction involved in the sharing of a meal. We as Americans are so \\"fast food\\" get it done oriented that we forget how enjoyable it is to actually spend time and enjoy each others company over a meal. I felt I really knew each character as she portrayed their story and I was very moved by the history of this city as portrayed by Ms. Dusi."},{"Title":"Vanilla Beans & Brodo: Real Life in the Hills of Tuscany","review":"If you love all things Italian, you'll enjoy reading Isabella Dusi's\\"Vanilla Beans & Brodo\\". You will feel what it's like to live in a hill town in Tuscany. Isabella intersperses her everyday life in Motalcino with a little history of the area. It made me to want to visit the town again and to personally address all of the people in her book that she encounters in her everyday life. The book is a little slow going at first, but does get better as you get into the book."},{"Title":"Vanilla Beans & Brodo: Real Life in the Hills of Tuscany","review":"If this is real life in the hills of Tuscany then this woman is dead from the neck up. Boring boring Boring. I tried, beleive me I tried to read this book. The writing is stilted to say the least. It's all romans and history, told in an even more boring manner than any history book I've ever read (and I've read some as a history major) There is a brief initial sortie into what an amazing super-business woman she was before and a hint at romanitic, free spirited youth, but forget it it's so short-lived in terms of pages. The rest of it, it's terrible. Don't buy this book. There are much better books out there, eg. The Olive Farm by Carol Drinkwater, Peter Mayle's books and even Frances Mayes but don't buy this book unless to give to someone really tedious and, well boring."},{"Title":"Vanilla Beans & Brodo: Real Life in the Hills of Tuscany","review":"I have lived in Italy for the past six years and have read many books on Italian life. This is one of the best as it truly shows how Italians really live, think, and gives such a wonderful description of the historical and political aspects of a hill-top village that I was even tempted to immediately begin reading it again to be sure I did not miss anything.I recently visited Montalcino and came across this book for the first time. I do think a different title would have put it on the best seller's list as it is much better than &quot;Under the Tuscan Sun&quot; or others I have read. Well written in the descriptions of people and places. We are recommending it to our book club! This is a must read before visiting any hill town in Tuscany - but especially beautiful Montalcino. After reading this book, I cannot wait to return."},{"Title":"Vanilla Beans & Brodo: Real Life in the Hills of Tuscany","review":"I've read at least 30 books on Italy and many on life in Tuscany, and this one was CLEARLY the worst!! The writer takes forever to tell a story, and goes into so much detail I'm asleep before she ever gets to the point. I've been to Montalcino, and I still found myself laboring to get through this book. There are MANY better books to read: \\"Too Much Tuscan Sun\\", \\"The Reluctant Tuscan\\", \\"A Thousand Days in Tuscany\\", \\"A Day in Tuscany\\", \\"I, Mona Lisa\\", \\"Extra Virgin\\", \\"Italian Neighbors\\"...."},{"Title":"Vanilla Beans & Brodo: Real Life in the Hills of Tuscany","review":"I am totally in love with everything Italian and with the Italian joy of life. I am planning to take a one-way trip when I retire and hopefully land permanently in some marvelous location such as Montalcino. This book makes us aware not only of the wonders available to us when we visit Italy but to how much we miss by not being prepared for our visits.VB&amp;B is a fascinating book about a region and a primer on how to learn to adapt and enjoy another culture than our own. We so seldom slow down and learn in depth about a place before moving on to something else - this book will teach you how to absorb the atmosphere which most people miss.When you have finished &quot;Vanilla Beans and Brodo&quot;, go on to another great book about learning to live in Italy: &quot;Extra Virgin&quot;."},{"Title":"Vanilla Beans & Brodo: Real Life in the Hills of Tuscany","review":"We found this enchanting book in our apt. when we arrived for a 3 1/2 month stay in a small town 10 K's from Montalcino in Sept., 2002. My husband was completely mesmerized and suggested that I also read it. I was immediately caught up in the life in our neighboring town. When visiting one day, we stopped in at the pharmacy (Salvioni's) and met Maurelia, the pharmacist's wife. She was one of the main persons is the story. After a half an hour conversation, she invited us to view the upcoming Festa del Tordo from their balcony (directly overlooking the parade route) and to meet the author, Isabella Dusi. The entire day only clarified our feelings about the warmth and truly embracing, friendly nature of the Italian people.
