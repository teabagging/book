Sam Shepard has a knack for grabbing you with dark, brooding characters whose primal needs aren't just shown onstage- they drive the plot. Characters aren't simply hungry, they're ravenous. Shepard writes dramas that place us in familiar settings, but there are tribal battles being waged that both repulse and captivate. &quot;Buried Child&quot; was my first introduction to theatre drama and I've never seen drama in the same way. One sign of Shepard's brilliance is the fact that every time I read one of these plays, I find something new. Truly, one of the most remarkable reads that you could ever buy."},{"Title":"Sam Shepard, Seven Plays","review":"American playwrights aren't good at creating a career of playwriting. Why, I can't say. They write dynamically for a given period and then off they go into putting the holy bible on stage or some such epic. They become mystics, like Allen Ginsberg. Shepard wrote plays for a while and then, I think, Hollywood put the zap on him and he was gone. His occasional pieces today are weak imitations of his former self. Money and fame may be responsible. Who knows? Here gathered in a single anthology are the key works, on which his life's reputation rests. \\"True West\\" sets the stage: we have real dramatic conflict, exciting dialog (of the sort last heard in Albee's \\"Zoo Story\\"), and high theatricality. The rest of the anthology is well worth reading, but for my money Shepard wrote a fine short play but his long and longer pieces are less interesting. Shepard has said in interviews that he sees plays as an outlet for ideas. The problem as I see it is that he has none."},{"Title":"Sam Shepard, Seven Plays","review":"The basic text of the most exciting playwright of recent decades.

The words just flow naturally and the characters are *really* wierd but still consistent and round. Though I have not yet read all eight, it seems that most of his plays in here are very tough to perform. I always like plays with very few characters, or at least few actors, and the only play that really fits that is True West. He is obviously used to writing for film, since sometimes he puts things into his plays that are really hard to actually do on stage. Maybe I'm just nitpicking, but I think that some of these plays are pretty hard to produce.Still, it makes for an excellent read and I also found it kind of inspiring, since these are really good plays that I felt flowing into my mind rather than just reading them (yes, I *know* that sounds really cheesy...)"},{"Title":"Sam Shepard, Seven Plays","review":"First of all, brilliant plays, still classics of the American Theater.

Shepard threads tales of cartoonlike characters bound by the direst of circumstances excellently."},{"Title":"Sam Shepard, Seven Plays","review":"11th grade English EssayPhillips Academy, Andover\\"True West\\"The play is about the struggle between modern society and more traditional ways of life. Lee and Austin represent two disconnected brothers with drastically different upbringings who have come to accept different norms. Against the growth of the city and the suburb, their spirit of the Wild West, though diminished, still exists. They steal and fight just like cowboys and highway robbers. Yet, both Lee and Austin are scared and frustrated. Lee doesn't know if he should try to blend into the new ways, and Austin doesn't know if he should go back to the old ways. And this play about two writers writing about the West is in itself a Western story. It has all the excitement and violence of a rider's life.Who else would steal a dozen toasters and TVs? Austin and Lee were lawless and wild, daring enough to do anything. Austin's car is like a horse, and driving out is like going for a raid. \\"Lee enters abruptly into kitchen carrying a stolen TV set.\\" The sentence has such an air of ease as if Lee entered with a Shopping bag. Stealing is no more than a normal part of Lee's life. He lives off of it, like those high-way riders who plunder by-passers in the old days. The wholesale raid of the toasters shows the wilder side of Austin.\\" It was toasters you challenged me to. Only toasters. I ignored other temptation.\\" He says to Lee after the thievery. These words make Austin sound like a warrior who has just beaten his rival in some major battle. The only irony is that the major battle was about stealing a dozen toasters. Austin is bragging about his lawlessness, and that is a very cowboy thing to do. Not only are these brothers such \\"professional\\" thief, they also are more than violent. From Lee \\"ax-chops(ing) at the typewriter using a nine-iron\\" to Austin trying to choke his brother with a telephone cord while their mom is standing on the side. It is hard to get worse than that. It is like a misplaced scene from a Old Western movie. Not only do these pair of thief like to kill each other, they also have that independence and individualism that Western heroic images render so forcefully. On top of living on the desert by himself, Lee also says \\"I don't sleep.\\" , and does not seem to eat breakfast. \\"Do you Eat Breakfast?\\" \\"Look, don't worry about me pal. I can take care of myself.\\" When Austin asks him if he needs any help with money, \\"Lee suddenly lungs at Austin, grabs him violently by the shirt and shakes him with tremendous power.\\" Lee wants money, but he is going to get it by himself, not through his little brother. Lawless, violent, and independent, Lee and Austin are depicted in the play as the \\"True Western Heroes\\" borne at a wrong time. This, however, is only the first layer of the play. It makes the story entertaining, but not meaningful.\\"Yappin' their fool heads off. They don't yap like that on the desert. They howl. These are city coyotes here.\\" The deeper meaning of the play is about the difference between the city \\"coyotes\\" and the country \\"coyotes\\". The country \\"coyote\\", Lee, is older, lives on a desert, use to catch snakes, and uneducated. The city \\"coyote\\", Austin, is younger, writes screen plays, does not remember having ever caught snakes, and has an Ivy League education. The brothers grew up together, but went onto totally different paths of life. But they don't merely represent two disgruntled brothers, but the struggle between the different ways of life. In Austin's eyes, the place where they used to live is \\"built up\\", but in Lee's eyes, the place has been \\"wiped out\\". But the struggle is not that simple. At the same time of feeling deep nostalgia, and refusing to adapt to the new way with help from his brother, because \\"it is too cold up there.\\" , Lee also says the new houses that he saw were \\"like a paradise\\" with \\"Blonde people movin' in and outa' the rooms.\\" Lee is deeply rooted in the old way of life and very unprepared socially and mentally for anything other than roaming around and stealing things. He likes comfort like anyone else, but the life of those living in those houses is like \\"paradise\\". They are far and aloft, and are not in his reach. Lee wants to write something to change his life, and Austin tells him that he can really turn things around and buy a ranch. Lee's excitement was obvious, \\" (laughs) A ranch? I could get a ranch?\\" We can see that it is very clear that even when Lee tries to change, he is only trying to change back to the old ways. Austin at the end of the play suddenly made a deal with Lee asking his brother to bring him to the desert. This shows the conflict at the other end of spectrum. Austin has more money, and has a seemingly good life. But is he really happy? Is his frustration with life any less than Lee's? No. The society that he has so well adapted to is of little comfort to him. He tries for years to get a screenplay to production, but at the whim of an executive, the deal goes to his brother. Austin is frustrated, and though he types betters, suffers as much. Lee asks Austin \\"maybe we're too intelligent..... One of us has even got a Ivy League Diploma. Now that means somethin' don't it?\\" But no, it doesn't mean as much as it seems.The truth is, the old West as it was disappeared long ago. It is no longer filled with rugged mountains, uncharted rivers, cowboy hats, and one does not have the freedom to roam around for thousands of miles with only wild animals as his companion anymore. The untamed natural world went away a hundred years ago with the railroads, and has been changing even more ever since. It is sad to see the past go by for those who grew up as a part of it. Faced with new situations, some of these people try to adapt, some have no chance to adapt, and some don't even want to adapt. And for those who have adapted, they wonder if the decision to change in the first place was valid after all. They wonder if they should go back. That poor Lee had no chance to adapt. He was left out by progresses, and envies dearly the seemingly much more comfortable life that others have. Austin at the same time is in the mainstream of modern life, but he is just as troubled and depressed by commercialism. However, within all these confusions and fightings, all these differences and changes, there is something that has always stayed the same, and that is the true spirit of the West, the \\"True West\\". The motivation for people to go to the West in the first place is also the motivation that made the world more modernized. The struggles that the first settlers of the West faced were no different from the struggles that people now face as they move into new ways of life. That spirit is not limited to time nor place, it is about the fundamental human eagerness for new and for more, and at the same time, the unquenchable ties to the past."},{"Title":"Sam Shepard, Seven Plays","review":"The book arrived on time and in good condition.

Even though they've managed to survive and grow (albiet slowly) over the past 30 years (as opposed to the late Reform Party) and they've also managed to show a consistent strength without resorting to continually renominating the same celebrity candidate (as opposed to the Greens), many political commentators tend to dismiss America's largest third party as &quot;a bunch of Republicans who want to get stoned.&quot; The fact of the matter is that, even as the Libertarians have been ridiculed, many of their ideas have been adopted into the so-called political &quot;mainstream.&quot; Even their most controversial stand -- the legalization of drugs -- has become more and more acceptable with each passing year. And, compared to most other third party candidates, the Libertarians have been able to consitently nominate credible candidates for the office of presidency -- such as Ron Paul in 1988 and especially Ed Clark in 1980. Polling over a million votes, Clark was by far the Libertarians most succesful presidential candidate and his campaign is reponsible for bringing several previously frustrated voters into his party's camp. Clark wrote a New Beginning specifically for the 1980 campaign and, despite being twenty years old, it remains a valuable introduction to the beliefs and philosophy behind the Libertarian Party. Writing in clear, level-headed prose, Clark explains why the Libertarians believe that government has become too intrusive in American life, why the War on Drugs is a waste of taxpayer money that does more harm than good, and -- perhaps most importantly -- demolishes the myth that the Libertarians are a bunch of a anti-government flakes. Instead, Clark details policies that, if radical, also tend to make a lot more sense than the bloated government gridlock perpatrated by the mainstream political establishment over the past few decades. While I don't agree with the entire platform (in specific, the isolationist bent of some Libertarians tends to leave me a bit alienated), its still a well-written polemic that deserves every voter's consideration."},{"Title":"A new beginning","review":"I read this in '80, and voted for Clark. I long ago lost the book, but recently bought it again. His same arguments apply today, but when he made them, they would have been effective and the required adjustments would not have been as severe and sudden as they are going to by necessity be today.Standing back and comparing today with America 50 years ago is informative; Clarks' book came out midway in that run, as an early reaction to what he saw coming.JFK's federal spending in early 60's was $100B, over half of which was for defense at the peak of the Cold War. That was an America with a population that was about half of ours today, maybe more, but let's call it half to be generous.We can inflation adjust JFK's spending by x 7.5, and population adjust by x 2.0 to get to $1500B/yr in federal spending. We are at $3800B/yr in federal debt fueled spending. That is 243% of JFK's fully adjusted number. Is that a fair adjustment? And then some. It assumes, for instance, that the population was half, and yet it was more like 180M. We are at 330M, so that adjustment should only be 1.83. As well, it assumes zero (0) increase in the efficiency of government. IOW, the art of governance has not advanced in 50 years of technology, such that it costs just as much per capita to 'govern' today as it did in JFK's early 60s, still waiting as it was for the 029 punchcard machine to show up.If JFK's defense budget grew by that same generous factor of 15, it would be $780B today. But the GOP was just chastised for increasing the Obama Administrations defense budget request from 70% of JFK's fully adjusted number to 71% of JFK's fully adjusted number. Well of course; we are no longer in the middle of the Cold War, it should be smaller. But ask yourself; if defense is at 71% of JFK's fully adjusted number, then why is total federal spending at 253% of JFK's fully adjusted number? (Remember, in current dollars, it is really at 3800% of JFK's spending. Population: 1.83:1 public spending: 38:1)If there was anything as a positive 'multiplier effect' on public debt fueled public spending, then our current $2.3T/yr 'stimulus' over and above JFK's $1500B/yr 'stimulus' should have American economies on a tear relative to JFK's America. You know, the America that was building the Interstates and going to the Moon and addressing old civil rights wrongs and educating a generation of young Americans who left the best schools in the world with hope and optimism for the future. That America, the one with the $100BH in federal spending, over half of which was for defense at the peak of the Cold War.Go ask a 2012 graduate about hope and optimism for the future with our $3800B/yr in federal spending. With some justice, more than half of them will tell you that their hope lies in expanding government, because we've raised generations of instructed idiots who leave their schooling fully 'socialized.' One thing they should have learned, however, is to count. As in, count the number of cabinet post departments in JFK's administration, and count the number 50 years later. Then, go find the plain to see federal spending numbers I just outlined.50 years is enough time to gauge the efficacy of America's experiment in centrally planned command and control 'the economy' running. It turns out, we are no better at it than the Soviet Union, for exactly the same reason; it doesn't work.Our affliction is obvious, and we are in denial."},{"Title":"A new beginning","review":"Ed Clark (born 1930) ran for Governor of California in 1978 (receiving more than 5% of the votes), and for President as the nominee of the Libertarian Party in the 1980 election.

It was not that it had no value, for it did contain some help insights; but it was the third book I have read by a Navigator and they all sound alike. It is almost as if I am hearing a Navigator's commercial throughout each book. Eims basis premise, however, is sound: The church must rediscover the biblical principle of disciple making. Eims states with utmost clarity that programs and material cannot make up for the human element that is missing from so many churches today- one-on-one discipleship.The book is chock full of practical advice about disciples making, from training objectives to leadership development. Eims tries to answer all the questions, so much so that there is a tendency to get bogged down in detail. One fault of the book is that it seems to be in a 1960's - 1970's time warp. The constant reference to evangelistic organizations that have long since peaked and now are struggling for their lives was distracting. Also, there was no mention of the dynamic of a Spirit filled church that will go a long way in helping disciple people. When people are really excited about the cause of Christ, there is a tendency to study on one's own and take personal responsibility for one's own spiritual growth."},{"Title":"THE LOST ART OF DISCIPLE MAKING","review":"Leroy Eims has hit the nail on the head with this book! My copy of it is about 10 or 11 years old and I still use it! Without a doubt, Eims has mastered one-on-one discipleship in this book. He shares with us the importance of disciple-making and how to do it correctly and systematically. He tells us what to look for in a potential disciple and the four progressive steps in the life of a Bible student: a convert, a disciple, a worker, and a leader. If you want to know the nuts and bolts of personal discipleship, this book is for you! Does anyone have his email or snail mail address? If so, please email it to me! Thanks."},{"Title":"THE LOST ART OF DISCIPLE MAKING","review":"The concept of training Christians to be mature, reproducing Christians is not a new concept. Nor is it a concept that is controversial. Christians know that this is an important issue, taught and modeled not only by Jesus but by his followers throughout the New Testament. The problem lies in application. A healthy, disciple producing church can be hard to come by, and even in individual Christians' lives, the practice of discipleship can be a rare commodity. This book is valuable in that it outlines the biblical view on discipleship, but the book goes further in providing many concrete examples of how discipleship is to be pulled off. An appendix in the back is essentially a guide for discipleship meetings giving thirty important topics and the tools to be able to hold a bible study with each of these topics. A characteristic of the book that I especially appreciated and found helpful was the author's continual emphasis of the role of the Word of God in discipleship. This is the foundation for the theory of discipleship, and it is also the main tool that we use in actually performing discipleship. This book is refreshingly simple, yet challenging. It is challenging because there is amazing potential in doing biblical discipleship in our churches and in our individual lives.The only negative I found in the book was one that I commonly struggle with when reading Christian non-fiction. At times the author appears arrogant, especially in the use of personal experiences. There was more than one story in this book about how some misguided individual was enlightened by the wise example of the author himself. This writing style always bothers me and always comes across as arrogant. Do not let this distract from the main thrust of the book, for the content of the book is valuable."},{"Title":"THE LOST ART OF DISCIPLE MAKING","review":"As someone that has the responsibility of making Disciples I found this book to be very helpful.

One night Hannah was talking to him in his bedroom, and Iris (Hannah&#65533;s sister), walked in, and got the wrong idea. That night he was told to leave the house right away by Hannah&#65533;s an Iris&#65533;s parents.

Iris refuses to forgive her sister. At the end of the book, they figure out who really pushed him.I liked the author&#65533;s writing style because she didn't go on and on, but instead she just explained what needed to be explained. When I first started to read this book, I thought that it was going to be a romance. I decided to keep reading though, and found that it was more of a mystery.

I still do find some of her books to be positively fascinating, but really? She calls this a book? It begins slow and continues to be slow throughout the sequence of events. In comparison to Reiss's more supernatural books, this is a complete bore. It contains an obnoxiously simple and linear plot in which pretty much nothing happens. The entire book continues to basically be a broken record, with no real resolution, twists, anything much. It's unnecessarily melodramatic, and at multiple times I found myself uncontrollably laughing at the absurdity of it all, especially at what were supposed to be the more tense parts. The only well-developed truly round character in the story is Grandad, and he doesn't play much of a role at all until the unsatisfying end. This is not a book worth your time. I love her supernatural ones, but this really was nothing special.Rating: 1.5/5"},{"Title":"The Glass House People","review":"When Hanny comes home after running away 20 years ago, after the death of her sister's fiance.She finds her family ripped apart.

The story was quite a weird one...A young girl named Beth and her single mother, Hannah, and younger brother, Tom, drove to the east coast from California to visit their grandparents' home. It was uncomfortable for Beth and Tom however even more for Hannah because she ran away from her parents' home and never returned for 20 years. Once they arrived, the layout of the house was the same, however the people weren't. Throughout their whole stay, many quarrels between Hannah and her drunken sister, Iris, had erupted about the cause of death of Clifton Becker. It was a blessing for Beth and Tom to ever get out of the house and hang out with some neighbors around.

Cleverly intertwining the historical narratives of FDR and his colleagues and the colorful radio priest Rev. Charles Coughlin (here disguised as the \\"fictional\\" character Father Clarence Wheeler), author Richard Pirodsky tells a compelling story seasoned throughout with surprise \\"appearances\\" by major sports and entertainment figures of the period.Pirodsky's astoundingly detailed knowledge of the political and economic history of 20th-century America, his profound insights into the complex relationships between intellectual ideologies and human nature, and his passion for American popular culture combine to make this historical novel much more than just a \\"genre\\" treatment of a piece of our past. A master of the craft of clean literary expression, Pirodsky uses his brilliant wit and graceful storytelling ability to present fresh, bold opinions that force us to re-examine everything we thought we knew and felt about our history and its impact on our lives today.\\"The Demigod\\" is an important book. It will captivate you, amuse you, disturb you, but ultimately leave you wanting to learn more. The fascinating career of its central character -- Coughlin, the controversial demagogue -- continued well beyond the years covered in Pirodsky's novel. Is there a sequel in the works? We sure hope so."},{"Title":"Witches' Sabbath","review":"Throughout his life Maurice Sachs' greatest talents were self-delusion and betrayal. His charm, looks and ability to write a competent professional prose took him into the highest circles of interwar French culture and the most mundane and improbable circles of the small-town America lecture circuit. His sexuality, enthusiasms and cycles of hero-worship-resentment-rejection of Cocteau, Marc Bloch, Jacques Maritain, among others, made his life a continuous series of rises and falls, frauds and self-destructions, culminating in his collaboration with the Gestapo (he was half-Jewish) and death in Hamburg under mysterious circumstances during the war. In Witches' Sabbath he tells his own story, justifying himself, blaming himself, revealing himself in ways he may not fully understand. Because of his narcissism, you won't learn much about the others, but his work reads like a novel written in the voice of an unreliable narrator, and is endlessly fascinating. There is a little of him in all of us. The superb translation by Richard Howard may make his writing better than it is. It is out-of-print and has largely disappeared from lending libraries. It deserves a new edition."},{"Title":"Witches' Sabbath","review":"Sachs died, age 39, when an SS bullet in 1945 enteredhis neck (or so we're told).

These relate particularly to the arguments of St Augustine from more than fifteen hundred years ago, Pico della Mirandola from more than five hundred years ago, and more recently of 186 scientists in 1975.Geoffrey Cornelius is a consultant astrologer with a background in philosophy and divination and has been active in UK astrological education since the 1970s. The author is a past President of the both Astrological Lodge of the Theosophical Society and the Astrological Lodge of London, as well as a former editor of the quarterly journal \`Astrology'. He co-founded the Company of Astrologers in 1983.I haven't read a lot of these types of books so was a bit worried that the language would be too technical or hard to understand - I was pleasantly surprised to find the language used was very easy to understand and flowed well. The style of writing was very smooth. Obviously you do have to have a good understanding of astrological theory and principles to understand the arguments in \`The Moment of Astrology'.Some of the techniques explored include horary, katarche and an exploration of the use of symbol in the astrological chart. Cornelius also spends a couple of chapters exploring science and symbol - I found these fascinating and would recommend that anybody involved in astrology should read at least these two chapters. A thorough examination of the relationship between astrology and science is given, with exploration of various scientific experiments that have been held over the years (including the New York Suicide Study, the Vernon Clark Experiments, and also a look at Jung in relation to astrology. The Appendix is excellent and well worth reading to get full benefit of some of the arguments presented in this title.This book gave me much more than I expected so I recommend \`The Moment of Astrology' to the reader who has a thorough understanding of astrological principles, who perhaps feels that there is something lacking in their technique, or for those that are looking for a different way to understand this complex subject."},{"Title":"Moment of Astrology","review":"This book is a work of genius, whether or not you believe or completely disbelieve astrology. I personally don't believe in it(yet). In fact, as a serious amateur astronomer, I know a lot about the stars, and have long focused on the science of stellar evolution and cosmology. But that has never eliminated a fascination with the historical richness of the ideas and symbolism of astrology, and I have always had a fondness for the period when astronomers and astrologers were one--literally, as in Kepler and Brahe. In fact, I have always felt that Science was just one way of looking at the world--a good way, but not the only way, and just a full of its own biases as any other perspective. In this book, Cornelius combines what is clearly a profoundly learned and creative grasp of astrology's history with a fluid literary skill that makes complex ideas and comparisons read like poetry. Never content with superficial analysis, he delves into what I (as a relative beginner) would call Deep Esoterica, and makes it fun and illuminating; witness for example his explication of the Greek word, katarche, and its evolution through many centuries of use and misuse by astrologers, just one example of thousands in this book of analyses that are always clearly connected to a strong evaluation of past and current astrology. This is his strongest point...whatever topic he choses is always focused on a higher purpose, a larger argument that keeps these complicated issues buzzing along. Any lesser talent would overwhelm the reader with details and drive them to the simplistic trivia of modern astrology. But the clarity and originality of his ideas keeps us motivated and on target. For non-astrologers, don,t let the few horoscope analyses in the early chapters discourage you from reading on; while these are beyond the beginner, most of the major points he makes are understandable by anyone interested in philosophy and culture, and bring a refreshing insight into the underpinnings of this ancient art/religion/science/divination."},{"Title":"Moment of Astrology","review":"I'm a bit embarrassed to say that I only read this book quite recently on the recommendation of a friend. The book has been around since the mid-90s. In my defense I had gotten interested in horary astrology in the 80s and spent a decade reading everything I could find and doing hundreds and hundreds of charts. In the late 80s I wrote my first book on horary (published in 1991 and now out of print). It was subtitled \\"Horary Astrology: The History and Practice of Astro-Divination.\\" This subtitle is significant because in reading Cornelius' book, I realized that he had read the same sources and come to very similar conclusions as my own. Maybe that's why I like his book so much. By the time Cornelius' published his text, I was feeling saturated with the horary literature and needed a hiatus, so I never got around to reading 'yet another book on horary.' Now, 15 years later, I have read the Moment of Astrology and I'm astounded by how thoughtful and erudite it is.This book is not for everyone. It is highly philosophical and some readers may be put off by that. Nonetheless, it is extremely well written and tackles the thorny philosophical issues that plague astrology. What I love about philosophy is that it forces us to make explicit the beliefs we live by. Cornelius does a superb job in fleshing out the beliefs that underlie the practice of astrology and makes a critical study of whether those beliefs hold up to logical or scientific scrutiny. He ends up contrasting the \\"rational\\" Ptolemaic model of the universe with the divinatory model in which astrology originated. Cornelius feels that all branches of astrology are rooted in divination (and based on my experience as an astrologer and student of divination, I agree with him). He rejects determinism, as most modern astrologers do, but he goes further and challenges the ancient Greek notion that the time of birth in some fundamental way is the key moment that determines the birth chart.While I understand what Cornelius is saying, I'm not sure I agree with his position in dethroning the moment of birth. This is based on my experience both with horary astrology and with numerous birth charts. I view the moment that the querent and astrologer jointly agree to cast a horary chart as the birth moment of their joint enterprise. If the querent is sincere and the astrologer understands the question and will be able to help, then the chart is almost always radical. In addition, I have had repeated experiences with birth charts which simply didn't look right based on my knowledge of the native and my gut feel for the chart. Invariably, when I ask the native to check the birth time or I review historical sources, the initial time given is inaccurate and a new 'more radical' birth time emerges. I wrote an article about this process that was published in the 2010 Winster Solstice issue of the NCGR journal.I'm not ready to give up Ptolemy's doctrine of origins just yet. It feels like throwing the baby out with the bathwater. Perhaps that solution lies in an analogy with quantum physics. Is the electron a wave or a particle? It behaves like both and seems to exist as a probability wave until we try to observe it. Then it constellates in particle form. Maybe the birth moment and birth chart act something like an electron in the quantum world. They may resonate as a kind of probability wave and only constellate in divinatory form when the querent or native asks an astrologer to observe them in the world of human meaning and imagination. It seems to me that the world of astrology is much closer to the realm of quantum physics than the Newtonian world we all act as if we live in.I can't recommend this book highly enough. It is truly one of the best astrology books I have ever read. It is wise, learned, and thought-provoking. It helps us understand that astrology is not science and cannot be proved or disproved by the scientific method. Instead, astrology is a symbolic divinatory system whose truth belongs to another realm of experience, just as the truth of poetry or great music belongs to other than the scientific realm."},{"Title":"Moment of Astrology","review":"This book is highly recommended by Robert Hand in a mini lecture he did at NORWAC and during his lecture to the entire group at The Blast 2007!"},{"Title":"Moment of Astrology","review":"For years I and probably most astrologers thought astrology was objective. Through this book I realized a good astrology reading is made up of the astrologer, the client, and astrology concepts.

The contents are up to date, detailed, cover all aspects of these schools, and are free of the kneejerk conservative agenda that underlie some of the other detailed college guides, e.g. &quot;The Best 100 Colleges&quot;. The approach in this book is somewhat similar to Pope's &quot;40 Colleges That Change Lives&quot;, although the latter is geared more to B students, while this book is geared to A students (to oversimplify!)What comes across clearly in the Greenes' approach is that these schools are the equal of the Ivy League schools in every respect, with perhaps a bit less stress and pressure. In fact, a number of these schools (e.g. Amherst, Middlebury, and Pomona) are actually more selective than at least some of the Ivies. Additionally this book, like Pope's, gets the point across that there are advantages to the more personal learning approach of the liberal arts colleges versus the larger class environments of the Ivy League universities. Students at the top of their class really owe it to themselves to consider these schools in addition to the Ivies. After all, the fact that eight excellent universities decided to formally band together in the 1950s to form an athletic league hardly makes those eight universities &quot;the best&quot; per se. Are Penn and Cornell really &quot;better&quot; than Amherst or Middlebury? Some may think so, but even then it's not because they're in the &quot;Ivy League&quot; (By that measure Stanford, Chicago, and Johns Hopkins wouldn't be top tier either - an assertion that would be ridiculous). In any case, this book is essential reading for any high school achiever interested in going to a top school, i.e. any one of the top 30-40 schools!"},{"Title":"Greenes' Guides to Educational Planning: The Hidden Ivies: Thirty Colleges of Excellence","review":"The Greenes have written numerous college guides. I have read a couple of them. And, based on my firsthand experience they are excellent. They typically address a specific topic. Thus, they avoid or go beyond the bland generalities conveyed by other not so good college guides.In this book, the Greenes focus on what they call the Hidden Ivies, or 30 schools that they consider meet the educational standards of the actual Ivies. These are mainly top-notch small liberal arts colleges often located on the East Coast. Within this list of 30 schools there are not any surprises. These are very well established renowned institutions, which are often nearly as selective as the Ivy League themselves. In other words, the Hidden Ivies are not so hidden. Indeed, try getting in Amherst, Claremont McKenna, Pomona, or Middlebury. If you can, one could argue you may as well apply to Yale, Princeton, and Harvard.The Greenes make a good case that the Hidden Ivies offer a superior education that even the actual Ivies can't match. This superior education is a liberal arts curriculum offered on small residential campuses where the institution is often dedicated solely to undergraduate students. This is in contrast to the more prestigious Ivies where a significant amount of resources is diverted towards graduate programs and research. The Greenes further advance their case by sharing the superior record that some of the smaller Hidden Ivies have in the % of their graduates they send on to complete PhDs.This book is filled with very useful information, including: a) main tips for parents with a child going through the admission process at a Hidden Ivy, b) tips for students, c) tips on what it takes to get in, and d) indication for parents that the actual college choice was a success.Also, the 30 school profiles are very extensive. Each school is described in detail over 6 pages. It is the result of an extensive survey of the faculty, the administration, and the students. You get many direct quotes from students on how they like (or not) various aspects of their respective schools. By reading these school profiles you will get an excellent idea if a specific school is the right fit for you (or your child). And, for the Greenes, the proper school fit between student and college is far more important than the actual name recognition of the college. In other words, a happy and successful student at Emory will have a far better start in his academic and professional life than his counterpart who may feel isolated and over pressured at Princeton. Thus, the proper match is the key.The authors style is very lively and makes this book easy to read. If you are considering one of these schools, this book is a must read."},{"Title":"Greenes' Guides to Educational Planning: The Hidden Ivies: Thirty Colleges of Excellence","review":"People know of the Ivy League schools because they're old and established, have produced numerous notable people, have some tremendous programs, and have received lots of PR. Often they're selected for potential to impart a &quot;credential&quot; or &quot;reputation.&quot; But there are trade-offs. (I read about them in Greene's other eye-opening book on the Elite Colleges.)I'm a parent and I wanted to start a list of potential colleges for my child that didn't have quite the hype, but offered strong academic programs, meaningful relationships with teachers, and perhaps not quite the stress and snobbery. This, and Loren Pope's books, are the best ones I've found to do that. Includes schools you might not have ever considered.Balance these with something like the Fiske guide to give you a real sense of what it feels like to be at these colleges. Slim on West Coast schools, but maybe not too many fit the bill. Good for West Coast students, who often don't consider colleges outside of their state university and college system.High Schools should have this and the Pope and Fiske books on the College Center shelves. Probably they don't, or the students wouldn't know it was worth it to look at. So, kick in the bucks and share among friends."},{"Title":"Greenes' Guides to Educational Planning: The Hidden Ivies: Thirty Colleges of Excellence","review":"There is undoubtedly useful information in The Hidden Ivies. Most of it, however, is contained on the front cover. Other than naming the thirty colleges, \\"Of excellence,\\" the book does little to differentiate between the schools. In fact, the descriptions of six schools that I am considering (all contained in Greene's book) sound practically identical! Overall, this guide is useful for listing thirty colleges named on its cover. If you're looking for more information than that, look somewhere else."},{"Title":"Greenes' Guides to Educational Planning: The Hidden Ivies: Thirty Colleges of Excellence","review":"All parents should read this book before their first child starts the college process. It is a great primer on 30 of the best schools in the nation that don't happen to be \\"Ivies.\\"Some parents feel they don't need this education, because they may have gone to elite colleges themselves decades ago, and they believe they already know the lay of the land. But the world has changed, folks. From 1970 to 2000, the U.S. population has grown by 78 million, with the percentage of the population attaining bachelor degrees more than doubling. The Ivy League schools haven't magically grown big enough to accomodate that kind of increase in students! There are plenty of brilliant, talented kids out there with much to offer, and they're not all going to be at Ivy League schools.So if you were able to somehow attain Ivy undergraduate acceptance \\"back in the day,\\" congratulations, but that doesn't necessarily mean your kid can do so today. (I sometimes wonder if I could get into my own Ivy Alma Mater today!) So you need to know about a few more college alternatives, beyond the Ivies, when your student asks you about them.Like all Greenes Guides, this book is well-researched and offers wise, seasoned perspectives based on its authors' years of extensive consulting experience. It is a \\"must\\" for parents of college-bound students. But as other reviewers have pointed out, these \\"Hidden\\" Ivies aren't so hidden anymore. I look forward to the September, 2009 release of the second edition, which promises reviews on 50 schools. This can help parents educate themselves on even more \\"up and coming\\" hidden gems.-Kris Hintz, www.positionu4college.com"},{"Title":"Greenes' Guides to Educational Planning: The Hidden Ivies: Thirty Colleges of Excellence","review":"The book gives useful information about these colleges, but misleads students into thinking that if they don't gain admission to an Ivy, they should consider one of these schools. None of these schools are \\"hidden,\\" as Greene claims. Grinnell, Oberlin, Pomona, Carleton...are all very prestigious and well known institutions, that only accept top students. Some of the schools Greene mentions are, indeed, more selective than their Ive League peers. Amherst, Williams, and Swarthmore are certainly tougher to get into than Cornell, and they are probably more selective than Penn as well. Despite his misleading title, Greene's underlying assertion remains feasible. It won't matter whether you choose a top liberal arts college or an Ivy League school when it comes to applying for job or to graduate schools."},{"Title":"Greenes' Guides to Educational Planning: The Hidden Ivies: Thirty Colleges of Excellence","review":"I checked this book out at my local library with two other college admissions guides to refesh my memory of what it's like to go through the college application process as a part of my efforts to help my young academically gifted cousin who is beginning this process. I found this book to be thorough and easy to follow for a college bound high school student looking to broaden their options. I can relate to what it was like to be in the world of a pretentious high school senior without real world experience to tell me that the name on your degree doesn't necessarily equate to how much your occupation and earnings after college will fit society's ideal of \\"success\\".I can see how this guide book could serve to reassure the ambitions while calming the anxieties of high school seniors who feel that their fate is based upon whether or not they get into a \\"name\\" school, which usually includes an Ivy League institution.My response to a couple of other readers' reviews is that I can see how questioning the validity of the prestige of Ivy league institutions would seem to be a viable option. Everyone knows that \\"rankings\\" are subjective, and that each college has attributes that are more suitable for some students than others, but that doesn't mean we have to bash those schools for their ability to maintain their success. One of the previous reviewers questioned whether or not Penn or Cornell is really better than Amherst and Middlebury, which is really an unjustified comparison when Amherst and Middlebury are two small liberal arts colleges and Penn and Cornell are not only Ivies, but very large research universities with a multitude of undergraduate and graduate programs (not to mention Cornell's reputation of being a pressure cooker driven intellectual buffet with over-achievers representing not one, but seven undergraduate colleges). Those of us who didn't necessarily gain admissions to an Ivy don't have to take the resentful route of bashing them to stroke our egos. Yes, there are other colleges with top notch academic programs, and let me reiterate that going to an Ivy won't necessarily make you more successful than a graduate of a state university , but let's keep the goal of looking into other schools with highly regarded programs in focus, not down playing another school's prestige as one's own defense mechanism. Ultimately, I would recommend this book to be read in addition to other college guides.When it comes to selecting the institution where you will be spending probably the four most mind expanding years of your life, you can never do too little research."},{"Title":"Greenes' Guides to Educational Planning: The Hidden Ivies: Thirty Colleges of Excellence","review":"I did not find this book particularly useful.

Muddle Earth was published in 1993.Admirers of Mr. Brunner's writings, and I count myself as a member of that large community, will, I believe, be somewhat disappointed in this, his last novel. The story is a tongue in cheek satire concerning an individual returned to life - resurrected - after being \\"frozen\\" for many years. Not an original story concept by any means but ripe with possibilities. Brunner employees this theme as an opportunity to lampoon just about everything - handled with a sharp barb this approach could be enchanting but Brunner uses a cleaver. There are lots of puns, plays on other science fiction authors names (a medical machine is THEODOR Surgeon, another quack in Wrong Ghoulart and on and on) and a mammoth assortment of robots and disguised aliens playing historical persons - and some from Earth fiction - Sherlock Holmes and Watson for example.A interesting book for the dedicated Brunner fans, but casual readers would be better entertained reading his \\"The Sheep Look Up\\" - \\"Shockwave Rider\\" - or \\"Stand on Zanzibar\\"."},{"Title":"Muddle Earth","review":"Brunner's best is pretty spectacular, whether in thoughtful fables likeTraveler in Blackor crumbling futures likeThe Sheep Look Up. This, I regret, is not his best. Humorous SF has been around for years. \\"The Hitch Hiker's Guide\\" was relatively recent when this came out, and Pratchett's Discworld saga was well under way. Perhaps Brunner felt that he needed to write something in that genre to prove himself as a well-rounded writer.It gets off to a promising start. There are potentially humorous misunderstandings just before the start of his centuries-long cryogenic sleep, more just before the end of it, and a steady stream that carry him on a wild ride through the weirdness of that far-future Earth. For some odd reason, he wakes from his hibernation with after-effects that initially flatten his emotions. That's a clue, dear reader: the dullness within him goes well with the dullness that drags him from one laugh-track episode to the next. Every skit in the sequence falls somehow flat, from the in-jokes of the 1990s SF world to the outlandish names assigned to hero Rinpoche Gibbs, the faux Tibetan, and Nixy Anangaranga-Jones. Perhaps naming the poor girl for a traditional Indian sex manual was to have been mitigated by the fact that she's genetically engineered for irresistable beauty, but that plan fell flat as well.It doesn't really end, so much as collide with the back cover of the book, something it could have done long since without losing anything that mattered.

He is in charge of the senior play, and Kyra's tension mounts as she's not sure she will impress him enough to win the lead.In contrast, Sammy is laid back and does his own thing. Kyra feels the stress building each day--the constant pressure to do, act, and be the best. She starts sneaking Xanax from her mother in order to take off the \\"edge\\", and that works for a while. As Kyra becomes more and more addicted, her perception of her relationships is altered. When Sammy finds out what Kyra is doing, will she stop? What exactly is Kyra's role in Sammy's death?I was pulled into KYRA'S STORY from the first page. It is one of three books in the DEGREES OF GUILT series; each book is written from a different person's perspective. After reading the book, a code is included and the reader can go to the website and read that person's trial testimony. Also featured at the website is the final verdict naming who is responsible for what happened to Sammy.Kyra could be any high school senior. Her struggles with perfection will hit home for anyone who is currently experiencing the drama of high school, as well as those who are looking back. My daughter is a senior, and she said, \\"Wow, this author really knows what we're going through!\\" Sammy is the innocent victim, and it will be interesting to see how everything plays out over the course of the next books. Mitchell Wade is the ultimate villain; he's cunning and integrates himself into the lives of the teens in a way that seems commonplace and natural.A subtle faith message is included, as Kyra learns to depend on God rather than the drugs for her strength. KYRA'S STORY has universal appeal, and is highly recommended for both adults and teens. All three books are available now, and readers will want to pick up all of them to get the full picture of the events surrounding Sammy's death.Courtesy of www.BookLoons.com"},{"Title":"Degrees of Guilt: Kyra's Story","review":"What I truly enjoyed about all three books of \\"Degrees of Guilt\\" was the feeling that I was given private passage into the heads of the teenagers in the story. I say story, singular, because it is one story, with three different perspectives. Read all three to find out how Sammy really died. Tyrone, Miranda, and Kyra all have feelings of guilt, that they could have somehow prevented Sammy's death. These books are about how it happened and how each person dealt with their actions leading up to, and after, Sammy's death.I would have guessed that the story would get old before finishing the third book, but each character's personality and the circumstances were so different that it stayed fresh.I highly recommend these books to both young people and their parents."},{"Title":"Degrees of Guilt: Kyra's Story","review":"Wow! That's pretty much all I can say. I have just finished all three books in this series and I am amazed. I want it to keep going. It keeps you right on the edge and you always want to know what is coming next. These books will grip your heart(I cried at least three times) and show you how true and real God's love and forgiveness is. If you are looking for a little bit of Hope, healing, love, encouragement, romance, mystery or anything else, these books will give it to you. They definitely blew my expectations of it out of the water. READ IT!!! and the rest of the series!"},{"Title":"Degrees of Guilt: Kyra's Story","review":"Review by Gigi HoffmanIn Dandi Daley Mackall's Degrees of Guilt: Kyra's Story, seventeen-year-old Kyra James has it made. She's gotten early acceptance to drama school at NYU, is going to get the starring role in the school play, and her new English teacher turns out to be the gorgeous stranger she saw at the local diner. But after awhile, life starts to get overwhelming, especially school, her \\"sure-fire\\" leading role in the play, plus friend and guy stuff. Kyra begins taking prescription pills to cope with all the stress.When the occasional pill turns into a drug habit, it leads to a serious, tragic consequence for Sammy, her twin brother. Kyra must cope with overwhelming guilt and the struggle of losing friends and learning to trust new ones. Most of all, she learns that she can't make it on her own any longer.Talk about a hard-hitting novel that shows the full consequences of something that starts out small. Kyra is as realistic as can be, and Mackall does a great job of bringing the reader into the story. I was totally intertwined with Kyra and stayed up all night to finish reading it. It's not a happily-ever-after book, but it's a great read."},{"Title":"Degrees of Guilt: Kyra's Story","review":"This book is well writen and very highly recomended.This book shows the real life of some teens and what they go through to be cool, or popular.

How did it go down hill so fast? Who was the cause?

This book is Kyra's point of view. This series is interesting because there are three different points of view and you get to see how each person tells the story. This book was absolutely amazing! Everything in this book was so real, I could actually see something like that happening in my town and in my highschool. Everyone can relate to something in the book, maybe even more than one thing. I could not put it down and found myself staying up late just to get further into the book! I can't wait to read the next book, Miranda's story. I would recommend this book to all teen girls out there or anyone else looking for a great read! You won't be disappointed, I know I wasn't!"},{"Title":"Degrees of Guilt: Kyra's Story","review":"i think this book was a very good book. it is a good book for young teens/adults should read before they go out and do something like partying or drinking underage without thinking first.and hopefully they will think before doing things. over all it was a great book and i would read it again. i recomend this book to young adults, and hope that everyone else who reads it too likes it."},{"Title":"Degrees of Guilt: Kyra's Story","review":"Kyra's Story is about a girl named Kyra, and her troubles in life.

These are discussed and explained in the text along with Siqueiros' theories about art and new realism.

(Reviewer's Bookwatch, January 1995). - &quot;I am a citizen artist, not a Bohemian.I don't believe in a world where each artist is a little god, each one with his own philosophy, each one with his own little kitchen to fry his abstract ham and eggs. The only bad painting is the one dominated by the individual ego. Easel paintings whisper to the private few. Murals shout to the public.&quot; These words by Siqueiros embody the militant stance on art taken by one of the most forceful painters of the 20th century. Together with Diego Rivera and Jose Clemente Orozco, this triumvirate was the phalanx that led to the founding of the Mexican mural movement, the most significant advancement in art since the Italian Renaissance. This and much more is the subject of this book by Philip Stein an artist who spent a decade working with Siqueiros. It is a work of painstaking research and personal knowledge that is not only a biography of Siqueiros (l896-1974) but also a political history of the 20th century Mexican revolution and its aftermath. This book is a powerful argument for social commitment in art, a valuable source of education for all artists, yuoung and old. (Norman Goldberg, artist-critic). - This magnificent biography is a comprehensive study digging deeply into the historical roots and tempestuous conflicts that shaped Siqueiros into an agressive leader, including his Indian and Mexican heritage, union struggles, military action, political conflicts and his role in organizing cooperative groups of artists who would put their collective endeavors to the service of humanity. This biography is a remarkable work of art with a beautifully felt poetic prose. It is a wonderful restoration of the life of a complex artist. Documentation has a scholarly completeness, color photographs aid us in grasping some of the magnificence of his painting and mural accomplishments. This a biography of enormous importance and beauty, so rich one will go back to it again and again. (Anthony Toney, artist). Stein's marvellous book is a meticulous and inspiring study of a great artist. But more than that it is a cultural achievement in its own right. Throughout its pages Siqueiros is brought powerfully alive. Stein himself writes with the perception and sensitivity of an artist and presents a fascinating account of the artist's technique and methods. This is definitely not a &quot;coffee table&quot; book; nor is it aimed at the art expert. The style is always readable and accessible to the general reader.

He watches his own father die and this is his inspiration to become a doctor. When he comes back to Coffin Gap, however, things have changed. He soon finds out that there is a lot more to Coffin Gap that he ever imagined. He finds out the truth about who killed his dad, he tries to remain neutral in his treatments between the ranchers and the hydraulic miners, and finds his long ago love. He vainly tries to put in a hospital, fights off a typhoid epidemic, and in the meantime, almost gets ambushed twice. Less Savage, Jr. takes on a big topic for 1949, however, because he bravely deals with biological contamintation issues and the editors who did not like it. Also, however, he finds love, an old love, from when he first left, and comes back to find that she is married. Overall, a great story, but one I wish were longer and more developed in regards to Craig and Nola. There just isn't much there except to wonder. One thing I will say, however, is that now I want to read more Less Savage, Jr. stories. He does a fine job of making the story believable and it had a good flow to the plot."},{"Title":"Georgia Bonesteel's Patchwork Potpourri","review":"Always a treat instruction wise,this one offers totally new ideas.. great color reproductions and an overall theme to follow."},{"Title":"Motown : The Golden Years: The Stars and Music That Shaped a Generation","review":"This is a brand new, year 2001 soft back, 384 page book.

Although I have always liked Motown, the subject is not one I would have requested a book on. Thank you you-know-who for disregarding my list this year. There is so much information here that I'm sure the author, for sanity sake, decided it was best to put it in an encyclopedia-like format. So, \\"M\\" for example, under Superstars, would list Martha and the Vandellas, the Marvelettes, and Smokey Robinson and the Miracles. This is not to suggest that because it's in that format, it'a a cold, reference book. Mr. Dahl presents each artist, songwriter, or musician's bio in a very readable, story-like way. And on some major artists, like the writers Holland-Dozier- Holland, they have their few pages, but in addition are incorporated into others' stories. In my family I'm considered the musical trivia expert, but a page didn't go by that I didn't learn something new and fascinating about an artist or the history of Motown. And there's a large section covering I believe every single person who even walked through the doors of Motown! I'm exaggerating, but it's an amazing list along with their stories of course. I was especially impressed with how Mr. Dahl brought out Berry Gordy's story of imagining the impossible and then bringing it to fruition. Oh yes, I forgot to mention there's a ...-load of great photos."},{"Title":"Motown : The Golden Years: The Stars and Music That Shaped a Generation","review":"Great Book. This is the first book that deal with other Motown singers and songwriters and producers who have been forgotten. They focus on other stars besides The Temptations, Marvin Gaye, Smokey Robinson and The Miracles, The Supremes, The Jackson Five, Stevie Wonder, in this book they introduce you to other great Motown singers, great pictures, rare, never before seen pictures, this is a most for motown fans."},{"Title":"Motown : The Golden Years: The Stars and Music That Shaped a Generation","review":"Bill Dahl is often consulted by other authors to check facts before they publish their works. Now we get the direct line. This book can be read as a reference work or for entertainment, as all the names and dates are seamlessly and accurately included in the real Motown story: Who made the music, from the biggest stars to unsung virtuoso session men; when, where, and, how. A must for any fan of popular music. Oh yeah, lots of great photos, too."},{"Title":"Motown : The Golden Years: The Stars and Music That Shaped a Generation","review":"The previous reviewers are absolutely right about this book. This is a fun and fascinating look back at a golden age of American popular music and the groups, producers and songwriters who made it happen. Much more than a rehash of the Motown story from secondary sources; the author personally interviewed many of the stars and lesser-known lights who helped create the music we love. Good, crisp writing and a generous collection of photographs bring the Motown story to life.

Then little by little my radio dial moved more and more to the right! It was a new kind of music and one by one my friends were getting the message! MOTOWN! New names, new songs, new beat. But behind the scenes at The Motown Factory, there were stories we Suburban White Folks never even thought of. If you couldn't shoot hoops there was little way out of the Ghetto except music and all the things that went with it. Young talented and clueless, these kids knew enough to know this was it. Hit it here and life would be a breeze! Little by little they learned they had to look better, sound better and move better because there were plenty of hungry people with talent ready to step into their shoes so the smart ones gave 120% because they liked this new place! Motown; The Golden years gives us a look at the growing change in our music. This was the new sound to beat and the Beatles and their friends had not yet risen to own the Charts yet! So longtime music writer Bill Dahl has brought the story to us. All the many happy and sad stories that growth and change brought to Motown and how even without knowing all the backdrop, this music was changing our lives, too! Written in a way to keep anyone interested, with facts and stories of all the Motown artists plus a ton of great pictures that took us back to a simpler time and what a time it was. A GREAT read that you can open anywhere and then you could keep on going. If you were there this book brings back the memories or the behind the scenes stories of the Evolution of The Motown Sound and if you weren't there it takes you there. A great read and great pictures! It truly was the Golden Years! A great read and a great gift!!!"},{"Title":"Motown : The Golden Years: The Stars and Music That Shaped a Generation","review":"I bought this books as a gift,so I did not actually read the book.

A very, very thorough presentation of all of the Motown family -- including some writers, producers and behind the scenes people. The photos by Weldon McDougal III are a real treat because many of them are candid photos never seen before. The reader can see that Weldon knew these artists personally and captured them in their natural environment. A very easy read because the individuals are listed alphabetically and we glean information that was not just put out by PR firms!! The Golden Years is a great gift with wonderful photos for displaying on the coffee table. Everyone has personal recollections when they hear a Motown song and this book renews our own memories of the unforgetable music that helped shape many generations!"},{"Title":"For All Time","review":"&quot;For All Time&quot; is a wonderful story that really touches the heart and stirs the emotions while presenting a special look at a unique time in history.

Although the character and tone are no longer new, this is still a thoughtful book. Girzone is often criticized as having an overly simplistic approach, which has always seemed to be the point to his writing. He isn't trying to be theological or intellectual, but to make us consider how Jesus would act in a given situation. Whether or not we agree with the details, the thought process is worthy of consideration, and his books make for a good read on a quiet evening."},{"Title":"Joshua and the Children","review":"Joshua Series: I love them all the Books and the DVD.Jesus here and now walking around helping people."},{"Title":"Joshua and the Children","review":"I read the first Joshua book and thoroughly enjoyed it. I would recommend reading it prior to reading this book. In contrast to the first book, I agree with one of the other readers in that the author was much kinder toward organized religion this time which made it a little easier to swallow. However, Joshua was much more open and obvious with his working of miracles which made the book much less believeable. In the first book most of the characters were left guessing as to who Joshua truly was and his message was expressed in very subtle ways. This time his actions made his identity obvious and the characters either believed immediately or were fools. Overall this was a good book."},{"Title":"Joshua and the Children","review":"Joshua, whom we soon realize is someone very special, returns in this book to a town torn apart by religious intolerance and violence.

Although i have never read a book like this one before it did not impress me too much."},{"Title":"Joshua and the Children","review":"After reading the second installment in the Joshua series, I still continue to be moved and inspired by the character of Joshua. Mr.Girzone's wonderful summations of the teachings of Jesus, coupled with its modern-day setting, create an identification with this character that is sure to wrangle any sheep that haven't found their way, or have previously strayed from the flock...Christian, or otherwise. He breaks it down so that the essence of Christ's universal teachings is what one comes away with...Love, Forgiveness, Peace... I will say, though, that from a literary standpoint, I felt the ending to this story was somewhat forced, or adapted a little too &quot;conveniently&quot; to the correlating Gospel teachings, thereby subtly overshadowing the impact of the events which transpired in the novel. Perhaps the parallel was overtly issued for the sake of those not familiar with the scriptures and teachings of the New Testament. But the point is made, and the characters in the book are ultimately better for it. I would also like to see more of the vernacular mindset of the local townsfolk in the two stories I've read thusfar- (the first being &quot;Joshua: A Parable for Today&quot;- HIGHLY RECOMMENDED). There are occasionally stiff and overly polite personalities that could use a good shaking in their constitutions and speech patterns, once in a while. I'd personally enjoy experiencing more of the intonations and colors of the people about whom Mr.Girzone seems to have so much insight on. But above all...I will say that my understanding and reverence of Jesus and his mission have been amplified to a level for which I must thank you, Mr. Girzone. The personal, Spiritual Renaissance I've undergone can be heavily attributed to the impact your novels have had on me. Again, thank you, and God Bless."},{"Title":"Joshua and the Children","review":"Joshua and the Children concerns the plight in Northern Ireland. Much has been made in recent years of the effect of the violence on the children. In this book Joseph Girzone has Joshua return and gather the children to show them how to live with each other.The plot is transparent and the Gospel parallels a little too fetching. The healing of the assasin's daughter at the end of the story goes beyond Jesus' healing of the guard's ear in the Garden of Gethsemane.And yet Girzone's point is wel taken. In Joshua Girzone made direct challenges to the establsihed churches. he is kinder in this book. Most of the clerics here are attempting in their own ways of assisting their parishioners to live in peace. And by and large they support Joshua's efforts with the children. Even the two bishops are portrayed as sincere men of conscious who take great risks on behalf of peace.This story, then, is a critique of the human inability to forgive and &quot;not take offense&quot;as Joshua says. So while the Gospel parallels are obvious, Joshua and the Children presents a way in which peace could be achieved: through children. Their ability to find commonality and create bonds can bring hope to the world."},{"Title":"Joshua and the Children","review":"This book was fabulous, everyone should have the chance to read it and experience its goodness, its really enchanting."},{"Title":"Joshua and the Children","review":"Many will suggest that Joseph Girzone is a bit too simplistic in his writing. That is probably his one flaw. In \\"Joshua and the Children\\", we find Joshua modeling Jesus's commandment that we all should model the innocence of a child. While the plot is predictable, this does not make it less heat-warming.The main character of the book Joshua, is a modern incarnation of Jesus. In this second book in the series, Joshua arrives in a small town divided by conflict between Catholics and Protestants. Although it is not explicitly mentioned, the use of words like \\"tavern\\" and \\"pub\\" suggest the story is set in Ireland. By making the children of the town put aside their differences and unite, Joshua pacifies the conflict until the radical religious groups plot Joshua's demise. Only when Joshua is no longer around do the radicals and all other members of the community realize the specialness of Joshua's presence.The writing of the book may be targeted at a younger audience, but I believe any Christian can appreciate this book. I look forward to reading other books in the series. I do believe that the first \\"Joshua\\" may be more enjoyable to older readers."},{"Title":"Joshua and the Children","review":"Here is an educational little book set in violence prone North Ireland.

It was the first of several books by Girzone. It was inspirational in several captions but the prayer sequence where Joshua was praying with his arms outstretched seemed to demonstrate the nature in which we all need to stretch towards God. His simple acts of kindness were all that Jesus ever did. A kind word, a moment of rest or a genuine smile is what Jesus offered as a basic part of life -- we forget that. This is the best of the Girzone books in my opinion - it's probably the impact of the children -- but a great book."},{"Title":"Joshua and the Children","review":"What a fabulous book.

Handprints in dried bloodstains, a dented front door hanging by one hinge, a history of abuse by her husband Patrick -- all seem to confirm her suspicions. Then Patrick turns up dead. Zoe's investigation uncovers unsuspected secrets as this lively story progresses.Labovitz definitely has a knack for telling a riveting tale, and for creating characters that are intriguing. We can hope that the author will entertain us with more stories like this. The main character, Zoe, is amusing and resourceful and readers will look forward to hearing more about her adventures."},{"Title":"ORDINARY JUSTICE.","review":"I enjoyed the characters in the book and also the story really kept my interest. The one thing I did not like about the book was the counties that were mentioned are not counties of West Virginia. I am from WV. Charleston and Huntington were mentioned though which is accurage."},{"Title":"ORDINARY JUSTICE.","review":"Ms. Trudy Labovitz is an exciting new writer who has written a winner with her recently published book, Ordinary Justice. Ordinary Justice focuses on some eccentric characters in the West Virginia mountain town of Ordinary. Ms. Labovitz weaves these characters into a tapestry of mystery and intrigue. Zoe Kergulin is a new and powerful woman on the mystery book scene, as is Trudy Labovitz. Ordinary Justice deserves a 5-star salute, and Ms. Labovitz deserves 5 stars for her first published book. We can only hope that Zoe will be back again soon, sleuthing her way through tangled evidence and broken lives."},{"Title":"ORDINARY JUSTICE.","review":"She watched in horror as an abusive spouse murdered her best friend. In turn, she killed the man. However, filled with guilt, and remorse, former Justice Department employee Zoe Kergullis flees DC to the quiet safety of Bickle County, West Virginia, home of her cousin.Zoe meets Susan R, a person who has recently rented a trailer with her spouse. Susan acts like an individual afraid of the world, even going so far as to not providing her last name to Zoe. A few days later Zoe goes to see how Susan is doing only to find lots of blood but no people. An organized search for Susan and her husband Paul begins. Soon, the searchers turn up Paul's murdered corpse. The police believe Susan killed her abusive mate. Zoe decides to do her own investigation, which begins at the famous Ordinary inn, an alleged stop on the nineteenth century Underground RailRoad.ORDINARY JUSTICE is anything but ordinary. The West Virginia cozy provides readers with a genuine feel for the rural area as well as an interesting historical perspective. The story line skillfully and intelligently deals with spousal abuse. Zoe is a warm protagonist who conducts an entertaining inquiry. Fans of regional who-done-its have a new author, Trudy Labovitz, whose in depth characterizations make this novel well worth reading.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Shape Of The Good: Christian Reflections on the Foundation of Ethics","review":"In Greek and Roman Theater, plays would often resolve with God coming down in a machine to rescue the protagonists. This kind of plot device became so infamous, it got its own name: Deus Ex Machine, referring to any resolution to a story which does not pay due regard to the story's internal logic and is so unlikely it challenges suspension of disbelief, allowing the author to end it in the way he or she wanted.In his interesting and well written book, C. Stephen Layman employs God as a way out of several moral dilemmas. Layman rejects the kind of philosophy books out of which you come with the feeling that \\"none of the theories work\\" (p.5). Unfortunately, Layman's Deus Ex Machina is no more satisfying then that of dramatists, authors and playwrights.The best parts of the book are Layman's discussions and criticism of several moral philosophies, from Subjectivism to Utilitarianism, including such Christian outlooks as \\"merely\\" following the Ten Commandments. Throughout, Layman's presentation is lucid, and his criticism sharp and to the point. You may squabble with one argument or another, but the heart of it is solid: When presenting theories that are complete, (such as Utilitarianism, the view that we should seek to maximize utility, or happiness), the results at times clash with what we feel to be morally right. But the alternative theories merely beg the question, by being open ended: they are \\"parasitic\\" on a deeper understanding of good (p.94).Layman's solution to the problem of what is good is, in my opinion, no solution at all. Layman proposes that \\"An act is right if and only if it promotes the Kingdom of God\\" (p. 123). But what exactly does \\"promoting the Kingdom of God\\" entails? Well, it's about having \\"harmonious relations\\" with God, our fellow humans, and the world at large. What are \\"harmonious relations?\\" They're not so easy to define. Ultimately, in Layman's formulation, an act \\"promotes the Kingdom of God\\" if it is right, and is right if it promotes the Kingdom of God. For example, in Layman's view, donating a kidney to a stranger may not always \\"promote the Kingdom of God\\" and thus may be the wrong thing to do! (pp. 162-165)Actually, I sympathize with Layman's position. I think morality is an emergent phenomenon (pp. 144-145). That is, it evolved with Human beings, and has a biological base to it. Since human morality, like everything human, has evolved to function in Africa rather than to be taught at Notre Dame University, all attempts to make a systematic mapping of morality will inevitably have exceptions.What I disagree with is Layman's claim that \\"the institution of morality is justified only if it pays (in the long run) for the individuals who participate in it\\" (p. 153). \\"If being moral does not pay for individuals\\" Layman explains \\"morality is ... nothing more than a mechanism for keeping social order... a kind of propaganda for the collective\\" (p. 169). God is thus the ultimate, all-knowing, necessary policeman, rewarding all good and punishing any evil.Why should we give up morality and accept it as merely selfishness? If we reckon that morality is rational from the community's point of view, can't we selflessly endorse it? In practice, selfish theism does not create superior morality (see Isaac Asimov's devastating critique of the so-called \\"Reagan Doctrine\\"), Why surrender to it as an ideal?In the final chapter, Layman makes a repeat performance - he first criticizes most arguments for natural, inalienable rights, than promotes a concept of human rights based on Christianity. Since morality is the duty to 'promote the Kingdom of God', people have the rights associated with that duty, like the rights of life, freedom from necessity, and freedom from assault. People have these rights because: \\"one's capacity to participate in the Kingdom of God in its earthly stage is plainly tied to one's degree of physical well-being\\" (p. 187, italics in the original)But why should people have the right to promote the Kingdom of God in its \\"earthly stage\\" but not the right to promote the Kingdom of God in, say, France? Killing people does not prevent people from the pursuit of the Kingdom of God as such; it merely forces them to do so in another life. Similarly, the Kingdom of God is a poor basis for other rights. If people can pursue the Kingdom of God in prison - and presumably they can, or else Layman's discussions on how to improve prisons make no sense (pp. 208-209) - why should people have the right to Liberty? Similarly, where are the rights for privacy and freedom of Speech in this model?Furthermore, Layman's criteria lay an intolerable burden on human beings. \\"It can[not] be avoided that [sustenance] rights are positive... we do not have the right to hoard surplus wealth or to squander it on extravagant, needless luxuries\\" (p. 201). But this implies more than \\"that most American Christians have a duty to give some of their income\\" to charity. How can you go to the movies or own a TV when people are starving? How can you go on vacation when the money could help starving children in Africa? Unless you define \\"non-extravagant luxuries\\" so broadly as to include virtually everything, the entire way of life of almost all people in the West is immoral under Layman's criteria.There are no easy answers to these kinds of questions, but that is exactly the point; Ethics is not like Mathematics, the logical extension of a few axiomatic principles. Rather, like Science and Religion and the Law, it is a human abstraction for a variety of practices, ideas and methods. The study of ethics can tell help us illuminate moral questions and clarify difficult questions, but it cannot find some illusive 'essence' of goodness, because there is none. In the end, that is the futility of the quest for theistic morality."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Knots & Ropework","review":"Once I had opened this book I was unable to put it down. The illustrations are among the best I have ever seen on this subject, being clear, with correct lighting and delightful colours.The ordered pictures allow one to construct the knots mostly correct first time. In just one or two cases I felt that the final picture was missing (e.g. the Lighterman's Hitch).It was interesting to find that since I read the Ashley Book of Knots some thirty-five years ago, new knots have been invented, which Geoffrey Budworth includes in his book, e.g.the Albright Special Bend, the Cow Hitch Variant, Clinging Clara, the Icicle Hitch (a truly amazing knot) and others.The only criticism I can make is that the background information is, for an Encyclopaedia, rather limited.I shall certainly explore the other works of this acomplished author."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Knots & Ropework","review":"This book contains a very useful collection of knots and ropework. While it doesn't have nearly the amount of knots covered in the Ashley Encyclopedia the 200 presented in this book are practical and up to date. The color photos are excellent and very easy to follow. Geoffrey Budworth also covers rope care, types of rope and some history. The book is a large sized hardcover which makes it easy to have open and lying flat while following the instructions. If you're interested in knot tying you can't go wrong with this book."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Knots & Ropework","review":"I'm new at the fascinating skill of knotting. The only other knotting book I've read is Day's Art of Knotting &amp; Splicing. That book and this one complement each other very well, the former written from a seafarer's perspective, reads like a manual for a sailor. The latter has the advantages of a modern book, colored photos of knots, and descriptions of recently-invented knots. It is my best guess that the title of this book was chosen by the publisher as a marketing ploy, -- not by the author. An &quot;Ultimate Encyclopedia&quot; of knots would have to be many volumes to cover all known knots from all the known cultures, all their history, and all the modern mathematical analysis. (Somebody should publish such a book!)Though not &quot;Ultimate&quot;, I do like this book, especially for the new knots that the Day and Ashley books do not cover."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Knots & Ropework","review":"I purchased this book as a reference for knots, particularly household knots and climbing knots. It fulfills this need and quite a bit more. There are color illustrations that walk you through each knot step by step, a well put together index, and an introduction that discusses the history of knots as well as material types.In addition to being an excellent source of knot information, it is also a wonderful \\"coffee table book\\". For the $32.50 list price, they have put together an extremely well made book. The color photos, the binding, and the paper quality are great. When I leave this book out, my guests constantly pick it up and start asking questions. What a great conversation piece.Buy this book, you won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Knots & Ropework","review":"If it weren't for the good selection of alternative knots and bends that you'd ordinarily need several books to find, I would only give this book one or two stars.He often neglects to state the limitations and general properties of the knot at hand. Also, the photographs are poor instuction with the hands of the tier getting in the way, and the ends of the rope left out of the picture. The author should have stuck with drawings using neat and clean arrows to instruct. Some of the instructions teach the hard way to tie several of the knots.Also, the author seems to be preoccupied with bulky and unnecessarily complex knots that are impractical. Perhaps the author is pandering to a certain breed of mountaineer who doesn't feel safe with their knot-tying unless they use half of the coil of rope in their knot.If you are a reader, I suggest you test each knot with both slippery and regular, wet and dry, and small and large line. Jerk them, and wiggle them, and make sure they're safe and won't jam. The author leaves you unaware."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Knots & Ropework","review":"I've look at a half dozen other knot books over the years, and this is the best one I've seen. Very clear photos of the tying procedures, along with the use of differently colored ropes when more than two ropes are being used, and nice, glossy paper so the photos look great, make this a very visually appealing knot book to just browse, or to seriously learn from. Also the author includes some interesting history when that is known. For example, the prusik knot, now used in mountain climbing, was originally invented by a Dr. Prusik, an Austrian music professor, before World War I for tying broken musical strings together.The book covers 200 different knots. There are knots for every practical need, as well as mainly aesthetic ones such as the \\"lucky knot\\" or four-leaf clover knot, which could be used for a keychain bob.For a knot enthusiast, Budworth has an interesting bio. He's appeared on TV and radio, was president of the International Knot Guild, which he founded, and is a consultant on forensic matters relating to knots in Great Britain. Overall, an attractive and well done book on an obscure but interesting craft and specialty."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Knots & Ropework","review":"Whilst being a superbly laid out reference for a select few knots, it does not, unfortunately live up to it's title. Recommended for novices, clubs and schools etc it is not for the serious knotter like myself who eagerly lifted it off the shelf only to find yet another rehash of a few items... Nonetheless well produced and illustrated, very good for it's class. well Done. Peter."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Knots & Ropework","review":"Just as there is no perfect knot, there is no perfect knot book. All have deficiencies of one sort or another. One common deficiency seems to be misleading or just plain wrong directions for tying a knot. Another deficiency is a failure to tell the reader when to use a particular, or more important, when not to use it. All the books suffer these deficiencies to one degree or another.Another deficiency is too many knots! But how could this be a deficiency, one might ask. Isn't more better? The answer is that the beginner needs to know the most useful knots that have the widest application. If the book contains knots that don't have wide application but doesn't tell the reader which ones are widely used and which ones aren't, how is the reader to know which ones to learn? Therefore, for a beginner, careful selection by the author is essential.Budworth, The Complete Book of KnotsOf all the books, this is my pick as the best for a beginner.What I like about this book is that it contains large, clear line drawings, and for the most part, the layout is pleasing to the eye. Drawings are superior, in my opinion, to photographs. One drawback of drawings is that the cordage you're trying to knot never lies as smoothly and gracefully as the one in the drawings. (This tends to be true of photographs, too, however.) But if you view the drawings more as a blueprint, then you get a conceptual understanding of how the knot is to be tied, and drawings allow a clearer conceptual understanding than photographs in most cases.Another plus to this book is that most of the knots Budworth picked for inclusion are useful and often \\"best of breed\\" knots. On pages 6 and 7, there is a \\"directory of knots\\" that shows the best or most popular use of each knot. In addition, for each knot, there is a summary called \\"applications,\\" and occasionally a warning when not to use a knot.A minus is that some of the drawings are wrong or misleading. For example, in the drawing for the double bowline (figure 8 on page 37), the arrow to show how the working end is rove (threaded) through the loops would have the working end going from the top of the loops to the bottom when it should be the reverse. After some frustration and referring to other sources, I was able to tie the knot. (Google is your friend.)A bigger minus is the terseness of the descriptions. In a number of instances, the author assumes you should be able to figure out the process from fewer drawings than I think necessary. I would like it if each and every step in tying the knots were shown. With some effort, I was able to figure out each knot that I tried to tie even though some drawings included several steps in one drawing. But why make the reader work? A book for beginners should make it easy.When I was starting with this book, I thought that it would be helpful if the author included pictures of the finished knot. After about a week, I realized that he did! But they are murky pictures that are either in a small space at the top of the page, above the name of the knot, or serve as a background for the entire page. There is no excuse for such bad pictures, which mar an otherwise excellent layout. Instead of putting some trivia about the history of the knot in a circle on each page, a clear monochromatic photo in the circle would serve the reader better.The book does not include decorative knots (Budworth having written a separate book on decorative knots).Because of the terseness of the descriptions, the lack of clear photographs of the finished knots, and the occasional errors, I downgraded this book from five stars to four.Pawson, Handbook of Knots (expanded edition)This book contains very clear color photographs, and the layout is quite pleasing to the eye. The problem with photographs is that it can be hard sometimes to discern when one cord is on top of another or below, and sometimes the hand can be hiding some important information. Compounding this is the fact that the book is small in format, and when you have four or five photographs on one page, each photograph ends up being small (say, 1.5\\" by 2.5\\"), too small sometimes.Although the book is soft-cover, the binding is stitched, and the book can be opened flat without breaking the binding. I found that it would stay open without much difficulty.Pawson, like Budworth, is a founding member of the International Guild of Knot Tyers. But his choice of knots puzzles me. For example, he has a number of stopper knots but does not include Ashley's stopper knot, which many consider the most important stopper knot. He also does not include any grip-and-hold knot (such as the midshipman's hitch, taut-line hitch, or the Tarbuck knot). This is peculiar in that a grip-and-hold knot can be quite useful. I almost had the feeling that Pawson had decided that he would avoid (when he could) duplicating what Budworth had done. Quite gentlemanly, but not what I want in a book for beginners.On the plus side, Pawson includes a number of lashings, plaits and sennits, and splices, which Budworth does not.For what it's worth, I was unable to tie the Turquoise Turtle knot following Pawson's description until I watched a video on the internet.Based on the fact that this book uses photographs instead of drawings (particularly in a small format book), the sometimes odd choice of knots, and lack of warnings about certain knot uses, I downgraded this book from five stars to three.The Morrow Guide to KnotsThis book contains very clear color photographs, and the pictures are larger than in the Pawson book which is helpful. But layout is off-putting. There are typically several pictures on a page, but the picture on the top of the page is not the starting picture; it's the one on the bottom of the page to the left.Like the Pawson book, the book is soft-cover, the binding is stitched, and the book can be opened flat without breaking the binding. I found that it would stay open without much difficulty.I found the choice of knots to be satisfactory in that most of the basic knots are covered. A plus is that several ways of tying a knot is shown for several of the knots. That is always helpful. Another plus is that it covers decorative knots, such as plaits and sennits.This book's depiction of the climber's method of tying the bowline knot took me an hour to figure out because two steps were (inexcusably) combined into one picture without an explanation.A minus is that the book is outdated. This comment would have come as a surprise to me before I started studying knots inasmuch as many knots are hundreds, if not thousands, of years old. But a number of improvements in knots have been made in the last twenty years, and these improved knots can't be found in a book published in 1981. Moreover, for the Tarbuck knot, the book states that the knot is used by climbers, but climbers have avoided this knot for decades because it tends to damage the kernmantel type of rope used in climbing.Another minus is the paucity of information about the use and misuse of knots.Based on the fact that this book uses photographs instead of drawings (particularly in a small format book), the odd layout, the lack of warnings about knot uses, and the dated nature of the information, I downgraded this book from five stars to three.Budworth, The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Knots & RopeworkThis book contains very clear color photographs, and the layout is quite pleasing to the eye.Of all the books that use photographs to depict the tying of knots, this is my pick as the best. Although the pictures are small, it's much more step-by-step than the others. In particular, it doesn't suffer from the terseness of Budworth's The Complete Book of Knots, and it shows a large picture of the finished knot. (It also correctly depicts the double bowline.)An important plus of this book, given its claim to encyclopedic coverage, is the inclusion of decorative knots. There are far more knots in this book than any beginner would need, and there is a paucity of information about the use and misuse of knots.My copy has an update date of 2002, making it the most recent edition of all my knot books.This book coupled with Budworth's The Complete Book of Knots would make a complete library for any beginner. But this book is too much, in my opinion, for the ordinary reader who just wants to learn a few useful knots.The fact that this book uses photographs would normally make me downgrade it, but number of step-by-step pictures for each knot offset that. Based on the fact that this book is intended as an encyclopedia and it fulfills that function very well, I give this book five stars. If this book were intended for a beginner, however, I would downgrade it to four stars because of the sheer number of knots, the lack of guidance to beginners as to which ones to learn, and the lack of warnings about knot uses (and misuses). The number of ste-by-step pictures keeps it from going to three stars.The Ashley Book of KnotsAs an encyclopedic work, The Ashley Book of Knots is not suitable for beginners. For knot aficionados, it's a must-have.Based on the fact that this book is intended as an encyclopedia and it is in fact the standard reference work for knots, I give it five stars. If this book were intended for a beginner, however, I would downgrade it to three stars because of the sheer number of knots and the fact that it was published in 1944, which means that it does not satisfactorily address modern synthetic ropes.ConclusionFor the beginner, that is, for the reader who simply wants to learn a few of the most useful knots, my pick is Budworth, The Complete Book of Knots. For an encyclopedia of knots, my pick is Budworth, The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Knots & Ropework. For the knot hobbyist or public library, The Ashley Book of Knots is a must-have."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Knots & Ropework","review":"What a fascinating reference book! Anyone who has ever advanced in the Boy Scouts or other camping program has learned some basic knots and hitches. This book takes any residual interest you have and sets you off on a much larger and more sophisticated journey.The book begins with a wonderful introduction to rope and the history of ropework. There is more to this subject than you might expect. Most people will find that learning some basic knots can be very practical as well as a fun past time. Next is a chapter on basic knots, bends, and hitches and tells you what you will need to tie these twenty basic knots. The rest of the book provides wonderfully photographed and written instructions on more than two hundred knots. They are grouped into bends, hitches, knots, bindings, and loops. A final chapter shows you how to use what you have learned to make mats, plaits, rings, clings, and other things. There is also a glossary and an index. There is another page of vendors and other organizations that can help you with your new hobby.The book also supplies a legend with each knot that indicates where it can be most useful.

Mainly it is step by step, high-gloss, full-color pictures of all the steps with colored ropes and nice images of the knots in use or in nice stills. Some knots have two steps, some take up a page or more so the detail and every step is there, I'd estimate 97% of the time. I learn to tie so many knots from this, my first, knot book. It is a handy reference, not too thick and not too large. It is not pocket-size but I have the hardback and it is a great book I would highly recommend, whether you are just starting, tie alot, or need a book around for reference occasionally. It mentions many knots I never knew existed and I was glad to be able to see and learn. Granted I have never seen Ashley's Book of Knots, and don't have it yet, but I have this one and it does the job and I have moved on to Marlinspike and decorative work, to add to my knot-tying skill set, yet this one I always have in my ditty bag along with two others right now. This is the basic one I use and I have two of decorative/projects. So I would say if you think a picture is worth a thousand words, and you need to know knots ranging from a reef knot to various bowlines to an alpine butterfly to farmer's loops and Bimini twists to a one's you may or may not use or thought to use but might because you would never know them without a book like this, this is a great book to own and well worth it."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Knots & Ropework","review":"I was visiting a friend and he showed me his father's day gift, this book.

It provides mental exercise. That's right, I actually feel smarter having read this book. Even more amazingly, I acquired it by happenstance. Titillated yet? Okay then, read on.The used book store I was browsing in had two books on knot-tying--the one I had been seeking, which is the classic \\"The Marlinspike Sailor,\\" and this one. While the former tome is practically canonical among mariners, the strengths of this book won me over. It is more general in tone, beginning with a brief history of rope, a short section on the various types of rope and some other preparatory information. Of course, the meat of the text is the author's meticulous instructions for the creation of 200-plus knots, capable of handling every sort of task, with color illustrations for each. The photography deserves special note; it is the finest blend of art and function I have ever seen in a book, period.All too many modern humans rely on such marvels as bungie cords, velcro, and of course, duct tape, and in so doing, we have impoverished ourselves of basic life skills. Contrast this present state of misfortune with that of our ancestors, people who could, as a general rule, properly coil a length of rope or tie a clove hitch without even thinking about it.

It is not surprising that almost half a million copies were sold in its first 20 years. As the title suggests, this book helps bring prayer to life.The book is divided into six weeks of daily individual studies, with an option of extending the study by another three weeks. Each week ends with a group meeting. Questions are provided within the book that encourage group members to share and assess the past week's adventure.Each day contains a powerful lesson, time for \\"reflecting and recording\\", and an assignment to carry you through the day.

Her poems link classical Arab characters with current day capitalistic trends (\\"Zuleika meets the Marlboro man across a delayed green\\"), and are punctuated, in the book's first half, with sometimes hilarious, sometimes poignant Hijab Scenes, where the author encounters everyday prejudice but moves beyond self-pity and anger to humor and celebration. The result is charming and ultimately empowering. The first third of the book tells the plight of the immigrant- the Arab Muslim in particular- and uses the metaphor of landing on the moon. The second third is an ode to women and womanhood, and made me lift my head a little higher when I left the bookstore (this book under my arm.) The last third is a beautiful dialogue on political currents and events, and the poem in which Matisse characters come to life is jaw-dropping. The poetry collection offers something rare and brilliant as a stone: an intellectual journey from which one emerges with voyager dust."},{"Title":"E-mails from Scheherazad (Contemporary Poetry Series)","review":"&quot;E-mails from Scheherazad,&quot; by Mohja Kahf, is an excellent addition to the multiethnic body of U.S. poetry. A short bio at the end of the book notes that Kahf was born in Damascus, Syria, came to the U.S. as a child with her family, and has attained the rank of associate professor at the University of Arkansas.Kahf's poems cover a number of themes: the immigrant experience in America, cultural difference, women's issues, war, violence, and poetry itself. There are several poems that deal with the issue of the veil traditionally worn by Muslim women. A good representative poem is &quot;My Grandmother Washes Her Feet in the Sink of the Bathroom at Sears,&quot; a striking story of cross-cultural tension.Kahf's language is passionate, sometimes witty, and always clear and accessible. Her poems are richly spiced with many cultural references: to Wal-Mart, Robert Frost, Lt. Uhura, the &quot;Rubayat&quot; of Omar Khayyam, MTV, etc. She is particularly searing when reflecting on living in a post-9/11 world. Her compassionate but critical eye captures both the joy and tragedy of life. Highly recommended for college classes, book circles, or individual reading."},{"Title":"E-mails from Scheherazad (Contemporary Poetry Series)","review":"This is a beautiful, moving, witty poetry collection which I recommend to all readers, and to women readers in particular.

I recommend it for purchase."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"This book is a great example for teens and adults. It shows the importance of knowing the \\"why\\" of being Catholic. The book also shows that not everyone has the complete answer on the spot, not everyone is a born apologist. The main character is awaken to his faith by the untimely death of his father, which says a lot for finding meaning in suffering. On the protestant side, one begins to understand that protestants are sincere in their motives, but misguided. They are serious about the bible, but as the book shows, sola scriptura simply doesn't work. The main character also shows the average Catholic that there is a big difference in knowing our faith as a child and coming to know our faith as an adult. I believe any Catholic will be able to indentify with this book on some level. I read this book in two days it was so good, and now my daughter is ready to read it. I can't wait until the next one!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"If you are Catholic or even someone who wants to understand the biblical basis for Catholic beliefs, this book is well worth the relatively small cost. Of course, this is not \\"great fiction,\\" but then neither are Stephen King's books \\"great fiction.\\" It is good fiction, meaning it is an entertaining read while doing an admirable job of explaining the biblical basis for some (not all) Catholic beliefs and doctrines in a fairly ordered and systematic way. I'm somewhat versed in Catholic apologetics, but I learned some explanations that I had not come across before. I also found some explanations where Kennedy left out some points that would have made his explanations even stronger; however, he may have done that on purpose. The protagonist, Michael, is not an accomplished apologist, so Kennedy may have wanted to keep Michael's explanations looking realistic for a young person who was just learning the intricacies of his faith. Finally, while some reviewers complained about the aspects of the novel that involved farming, I found them to be fascinating. It was a real education in the way non-mechanized farming is carried out. If you are new to Catholic apologetics, this is a great place to start."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"A wonderful story with a lesson of faith and the joy of simplicity in life. Young Michael, through the tragic death of his father, is sent to live for a summer with his Fundamentalist uncle. While learning the value of the simple life of subsistence farming he learns not to underestimate the people of this simple life while also learning to make his faith his own and to defend it in and out of season. Through study and prayer, Michael learns his faith and learns to share it in an environment often hostile and challenging. But with his prayers and those of his mother, he perseveres to be a worthy spokesman for his faith able to rightly divide the word of God (even being limited to the King James Bible alone).This is a must read for every young Catholic to search their faith and make it their own faith. It is a coming-of-age novel wrapped in a philosophical discourse of simple pleasure and family entwined with Catholic apologetics. A little slow at times, perhaps. But overall, a good reward of understanding and joy at Michael's success as we identify more and more with his persevering and humble attitude. A fantastic story for young adults in particular but also for anyone interested in living their faith."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"I thought he book taught me much more information about Catholism than I already knew. I learned how others felt about my religion and I also learned ways in which i could defend it. I liked the book that thought every Catholic should read it to find out different facts about Catholism you mind not learn in school. I think this book is a good read for non-catholics also who are interested in their religion and how it compares to their religion. It also taught me about the fundamentalists point of view and the way they live their lives."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"This book accomplishes what it sets out to do. It fulfills all the stipulations of an apologetics novel. However, the manner in which it does so follows in step more along the lines of a textbook than it does a literary instrument. Contrary to this insight, I found the book to be an overall good experience; something that religious study does not always turn out to be. The book, as all things do, carried with it its pros and cons. On the negative side, it is strikingly unbelievable in the sense that Michael, having little deep interpretation of the bible prior to that summer, could interpret the plethora of pages that make up our Catholic Bible. Aside from this point, the book brought very good insight to the false allegations, (made with little understanding), of the Fundamentalists. Mr. De Porres was able to bring forth good arguments on a range of topics; from the worship of Mary, to the institution of Papal authority. All in all, I believe that this book has been a positive tool in my religious life, and I may be consulting it in the future."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"Michael O'Shea is surviving a bittersweet summer; the untimely death of his father has sent him spiraling into a grief that only prayer seems to quell, and at the behest of his maternal uncle his family is urged to leave the familiarity and comfort of their Philadelphia home to heal in rural Kentucky. There the only comfort is found in the welcoming smiles and hospitality of strangers, as Michael learns his mother's brother's family are staunch &quot;Bible-believing&quot; folk who choose to live as &quot;plain&quot; people. Socializing among the Amish of that region, Michael's extended family's existence is founded upon a lack of material wants and needs and an abundance of faith.Gradually Michael and his family come to relax and enjoy the company of their relatives. Creature comforts fade into memory, for playing a game of baseball and tucking into homemade ice cream on the front porch appears to yield more enjoyment than a night in front of the television. However, Michael senses something amiss, particularly every time his uncle brings up issues of faith and challenges the boy to validate his own beliefs. As if dealing with the death of his father was not enough to bear, Michael soon realizes his uncle's ulterior motive for bringing his family to Kentucky -- to persuade Michael's mother of the error she made in converting to Catholicism by first converting her children to his beliefs. Michael, a lukewarm student of his own Catholic faith, is suddenly shocked to hear people dismiss the Catholic Church as &quot;pagan&quot; and &quot;unChristian.&quot;Explanations outside of actual Bible quotes (KJV version, mind you) fall upon deaf ears, and Michael is self-propelled into a crash course in apologetics, with only the Bible and the prayers of his mother to sustain him. As Michael prepares to successfully defend the Faith against the local nay-sayers, many of whom know much of the Bible by heart, his confidence grows, and it is his knowledge of the faith through God's Word which helps establish an atmosphere of tolerance which some in this tight-knit community are more willing to embrace than others.Like the works of Bud MacFarlane, Jr., Kennedy's &quot;Philadelphia Catholic&quot; is a teaching novel, an apologetics tool in the guise of an engaging coming-of-age story. Kennedy's eye for detail is evident in his descriptions of Amish country and portrayals of life among the &quot;plain&quot; people, and Michael's dialogue and evangelization is well woven into Kennedy's prose. Kennedy delivers the facts of the faith without making it sound as if the &quot;Philadelphia Catholic&quot; is regurgitating lines from a textbook; the reader should not feel as if he/she is being lectured, and considering the tense climactic scene where Michael faces his challengers as a witness standing trial, Kennedy should be commended for a plausible conclusion to the story. With &quot;Philadelphia Catholic&quot; Kennedy leaves us to decide the validity of the Catholic faith, and through Michael O'Shea he offers convincing arguments bracketed by a touching story."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"I want to mention a charming and compelling book I read over the weekend. It's hot off the presses! It's a novel about a young Catholic man (age 17) who spends the summer working on his uncle's horse-powered farm in KY. His uncle is a fundamentalist minister who tries to convert him away from the &quot;Roman&quot; church, which he believes is unbiblical at best, and at worst, evil. Young Michael doesn't know his Faith very well, but he studies Catholic apologetics and then very charitably and humbly, is able to counter his uncle's Bible-alone arguments and defend the Faith. This is not only a good read, it would be perfect for teens or adults. It presents the reasoning on both sides very effectively and realistically. Because the defenses are in the context of an interesting novel, I found myself more able to follow the line of reasoning. It also shows how prayer is crucial in evangelism. Great for either Catholics or non-Catholics. Five stars!"},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James' Court was a very good book for those looking for explanation for their beliefs in the Catholic teachings. This book explains various controversies between the Catholic and various others Christian Sects, such as; The Catholic Inquisition, The acceptance of Mary as the mother of Christ, her \\"perpetual virginity\\" and the Heavenly Queen, The baptism of infants, the infallibility of the pope, praying to statues, and most of all, why we believe in the bible. This book lays explanation for all of these within a well thought out and entertaining story.The plot of this story is that a young boy, about the age of 15, Michael comes from Philadelphia with his family to live with his uncle's family in Tennessee. During the summer stay Mike's uncle Les feels it his duty, as the leader of a small Christian fundamentalist church, to convert mike and his family to their way of worshiping God. Over time Mike is put through various tests where he is forced to explain the Catholic Faith. Over time and many debates Nike wins some people over to the Catholic view on God, including Les' own son Elijah."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"This is a great book and I'm glad I read it. The characters really come alive and the story is well constructed. The plot slowly but steadily comes together and climaxes with a surprise ending.The apologetics content was very educational. Michael O'Shea, the teenage protagonist, does a wonderful job of defending his Catholic faith (although given his tender age, he is no Karl Keating or Tim Staples, of course!). It may seem that his apologetics ability comes out of nowhere, but the reader must be alert to the fact that he is motivated to study by the love he has for his father, who was a devout Catholic before dieing heroically in a fire--but most importantly, the reader must be alert to the fact that in all the scenes where Michael holds his own while defending Catholicism, his mother was elsewhere praying the rosary for him! His dreams are prophetic, and thus one can see the Holy Spirit working in his life through the intercession of his mother and perhaps even his father. The point is, God is using Michael to bring his Protestant relatives closer to the truth of Christ. Michael conducts himself very charitably while sharing and defending his faith, even when attacked harshly by the fundamentalists.This book is a must read for high school students and for everyone who has ever had their Catholic faith come under attack."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James Court is an easy tutorial in beginning apologetics (teaching, explaining and defending the Faith). Being in fiction form makes it easily accessible to a wide range of readers and whets the appetite for more in depth study of the Catholic Faith or at the very least - gives words to explain Catholic beliefs to those who are not usually comfortable in discussing their faith."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"Overall, I would say &quot;A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court&quot; was a good read with a few minor flaws. The story centers around a catholic boy named Michael who goes to Kentucky for the summer because his father died. Their he is faced with the pressure of the Fundamentalist Christians trying to convert him to their religion. First of all, Michael is faced defending his Catholic roots many time. One of the problems I found with this is that it seems a little far fetched that he would be able to come up with some of the arguments he has in the short time he is given. On a good note though, his arguments gave me further insight into the Catholic religion, enlightening me on many aspects of it that I never knew before. Next, I found that it was a little too unrealistic that his prophetic dreams actually would come true. After that, I would also say that I think that the book makes the Fundamentalists look to much like bad guys, and it seems that often they go a little too far in an attempt to convert Michael. Even Michael's own Uncle is constantly pressuring him. I felt as if he should just let him be, especially since he just lost his father. Lastly, an aspect that I really enjoyed was the effect that Michael's defending of his religion had on some of the Fundamentalists. In conclusion I really enjoyed &quot;A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court&quot; and found myself coming back again and again to see how Michael would defend his religion, being that I am a Catholic to. If you are looking for a book that successfully and accurately delves deep into the Catholic faith, then you will be sorry if you pass up this wonderful story."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"The book &quot;A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court&quot; is marvelous, a splendid gift for setting forth the truths of our Catholic faith clearly and precisely.

OK, maybe I'm being a bit harsh . . . but I did have to FORCE myself to keep reading. Eventually it stopped bothering me so much. (Or maybe he got better as he went along.)Anyway, I found the Catholic apologetics most fascinating.

While living in Kentucky, Michael learns many things about the Fundamentalist Christians, as well as his own religion, Catholicism.

Down in Kentucky Michael is forced to defend his religion against his Uncle Les and church elders such as, Luther, George, and Jimmy.

Michael O'shea and his family move to Kentucky to live with his uncle after his father dies. Michael learns a lot more about his religion than he already knew and he also learned a little bit about his uncle's religion. Michael is forced to defend his faith to his uncle's church members and elders. This book is mainly about the arguing of Catholics and fundamentalists. Catholics believe that the bible is from tradition and fundamentalists believe that the bible is the final say in what they do. I also thought that the book was really unrealistic. What kind of teenager would spend a whole summer studying his catholic faith? I know the way that I am going to do work in the summer is if I am in summer school or I have to do work for the future school year. I also would not expect a 14 year old kid to be reciting bible passages in the middle of his sentences to back up his thoughts.

I think the novel did a good job in explaining why Catholics believe what they do. I learned some things about why Catholics have the beliefs they do. One problem I found with the book was that the beginning was very dull and boring, and did not draw my attention. It started to become a little more interesting with the Bible discussions, but it was still boring overall. I found it hard to relate to them living on a farm. Overall, I think it is a gook book to read if you want to find more about the Catholic faith, but not if you want a book that you cannot put down."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court did a very good job informing the reader about the Biblical justification of some very important Catholic Traditions. However, while reading this book, aside from the informative parts, I felt as though I were reading a fairytale. To start, the whole concept that after the death of his father, Michael's mother would just pull all the children out of school to go to Kentucky seems unrealistic, especially because it is near the end of the school year. Once in Kentucky, everything seemed to work out just about perfect for Michael. When there, he managed to learn a plethora of information about the Bible and his faith, in a very short amount of time, and always, he knew it just when he needed it. Also, at the Bible Discussions, despite never having any of the books there that helped him originally, he remembered perfectly every argument the books brought up, and every book, chapter, line and verse from the Bible he sited in order to back his arguments. The response of the Fundamentalists to his proof also was somewhat too perfect for Michael. The Fundamentalists such as Luther, Jimmy, and Les appeared to have more of an amazed response to Michael's arguments, rather then to have any really strong dissentions. Had he encountered a few more problems, and a few more issues or strong objections by the Fundamentalists, it would have been more genuine. Michael just always had the answers, right when he needed them, and they were perfect, leaving almost no ground on which the Fundamentalists could stand. I think that they [the Fundamentalists] would have been much more outraged, and not quite so passive of his contentions, especially Les. Overall, I did feel the book provided some good information about Catholic Faith and Tradition, however the actual story seemed too clich&eacute; and perfect to grab the interest of this reader."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James Court states the beliefs of Roman Catholic Christians and Fundamentalist Christians through the arguments of Michael, a highschool student from Philadelphia, and his uncle, a fundamentalist minister. The plot was good in how it incorporates the facts of the two beliefs, but unrealistic in how Michael learned in a few weeks more than the Fundamentalists learned from the Bible in thier whole lives. Overall, the book helps you learn more about the Roman Catholic faith."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"My review on this novel would be one with great acknowledgement. This is because the novel contains a general view: both on the Fundamentalist's faith, and that of the Catholic's faith. With this in mind one can form a logical explanation to succumb past disinclination of one's faith. The novel seemed to inspire me, and my outlook on my faith in Catholicism. This novel seems to captivate the reader by relating information most similar to his/her present time, which in turn made the situation more interesting. So as to tie things up, my review on this novel would be by saying that it is a brilliantly composed narrative from which I highly recommend young people, of our time, to read in order to develop a fuller background check on their faith and tradition in an attempt to let them be aware of questions which should arise in their future."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James Court was assigned as a class reading assignment. At first I was skeptical about the book. As I began to read more it became more interesting and I began to enjoy the book. The story teaches the reader about the different aspects of the catholic faith. It shows the differences that are present between the fundamentalist Christians and the Catholics. The book shows how the fundamentalists practice Christianity and gives a non-fundamentalist a good picture of their faith. There were a few parts of the story that seemed unrealistic, that Michael could defend the catholic faith to Les and his Bible friends. Michael being a young man with out a huge knowledge of his faith, being able to capture all of the strong points in such a short period and defending it against people who spent most of there lives studying the bible seemed somewhat unrealistic to me. Besides that I enjoyed the book very much and would recommend it to anybody who is interested in the two practices."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"I felt A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court was a pretty good book, but it lacked an entertaining plot and some aspects of the book were unusual. It was a good book in that the book explained and supported the Catholic faith strongly. It showed me some things in the Bible that I did not know were there. Although it explained most of the aspects of the Catholic faith in depth, the presentation of these ideas was in a boring manner. It was just plain talk and no excitement. Also there we some things in the book I could not believe were true. I thought about how Michael's whole summer revolved around the Bible and work. There was no play, fun, or friends, just dedication to the Bible. I found that hard to believe because many teens want to have fun along with having a faith. Michael just had a faith it seemed. Also, I thought it was hard to believe how Michael started down in Kentucky not knowing alot about the Bible, and by the end of three months, he knew more than his uncle who had been studying the Bible for years. Although it had these minor technicalities, I thought the book was very informative, and helped me understand my faith a little better."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"After reading &quot;A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court&quot;, it was a lot better of a book than I thought it would be before I bought it. It was exciting to read in a way, because the story line was very realistic. It seemed almost like the author was telling it about himself. A negative aspect I had in reading this was that it seemed almost impossible for Michael, the &quot;Philadelphia Catholic&quot; to read and comprehend all of the information of the Bible, and be able to explain it in such a short amount of time. This did not seem to be a major fault in the book, and most would probably overlook it anyway. This book gave me an outlook on other peoples view of the Bible and their lifestyles. This was a great book, and I recommend reading it if it is for a class, or just on your own time."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"&quot;A Philadelphia Catholic in King Jame's Court&quot; was book about a young boy named Micheal who spends the summer in Kentucky with his Uncle Les who is a Fundamentalist.

As Micheal learns more and more from his uncle he begins to bring up issues about the Catholic faith during the Bible study groups that he attends with his uncle. He trys to denfend the Catholic fatih against those who are against what Micheal believes. I felt that book was good but is seem confusing without the help of other people reading it, however i would recomend it for someone who would like to learn more about Catholics and fundamentalist ways and beliefs. After I read the book I realized all the stuff i Had never known before but it was good and whoever feels like reading it should."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"Well, This Book Is A Great Story About How Catholics Differ From Fundamentalists. First You Have Michael, A Phila Native, Who Becomes A Bible Wiz, You Could Say, And A Great Speaker For The Catholic Faith. Its Like As If He Just Gets Inspired (As He Does) To Preach Against His Uncle's Teahings. Sure Catholics Believe In Different Ideas, Events, Or How To Do Things Than Fundamentalists, But The Big Picture Is That He Takes Charge Of His Faith And No Matter What His Uncle Says He Still Stands Firm With The Catholic Teachings. When I Say That &quot;No Matter What His Uncle Says&quot; Im Not Saying That He Blows Everything Off, All I'm Saying Is That He Takes In The Info But May Have A Different View, Or Whatever Towards It. So Basically It's A Great Book To Read And I'd Advise Everyone That Reads This Book To Take In The Differences Between Michael's Views And What His Uncle, Luther, George, Or Whoever Might Say About the Same Topic, And Just See How The Differ."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"I enjoyed this book very much, to my suprise.

I thought that it was a very good reading experience for me. As i got deeper and deeper into the book, it just started getting better and better.

It's a story about a young Philadelphia Catholic (obviously), who finds himself forced to defend his faith against Kentucky Fundamentalists, including his Uncle. The author presents very good apologetic arguments, which are welcome to this reader. I've had to deal with the anti-Catholic barbs of some Protestants before, and this book responds well to the classic arguments. The story was interesting, and I eagerly read ahead, wondering how Michael refute the next attack. I have only a few complaints (hence the 4 stars). First off, it is unrealistic that a boy as naive and ignorant as Michael could suddenly parry any argument with Bibilical quotes after such a short period of time. Secondly, Michaels' strange prophetic dreams seem alittle too far-fecthed. Finally, the Fundamentalists are just too type-cast for my taste. For example, they act like &quot;ignorant, self-righteous Bible Belt Christians&quot; a little too much (they're the &quot;bad guys&quot; of the story). Besides these faults, a Philly Catholic is actually a good book, and if you're at all interested in the Catholic Faith, you'll be sorry if you pass it up."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court was a good story about a young boy given the task of defending the Catholic faith to Kentucky Fundamentalists. It was a good story that gave insight into the history and beliefs of the Catholic faith. There were only two things that struck me as odd. The first being the lack of knowledge Michael had about the Bible at the beginning of the book and how well he knew it at the end. It struck me as strange that a teenager could quote the Bible in only a period of three months. The second was the fact that Michael was able to defend the faith under the heat and questioning of the fundamentalists. I felt that many teens would fail at accomplishing this. I did think the book offered great insights into the Catholic faith. Whether you are Catholic or non-Catholic, this book would be an enjoyable read. I would encourage young adolescents questioning their faith to read this book, it sets a positive example of just how helpful faith can be in your life."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"As a student at a Catholic high school in Philadelphia,I could relate to Michael (the main character) in some ways. I have also been challenged many times by protestants on the basis of my religion, and some of the arguments that Michael made were comparible to my arguments. I didn't always look to the Bible, but I know some passages and could back up my arguments. Michael is inspirational to me in that he learned his religion well enough to defend it time after time during such a difficult period in his life."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"The book was interesting if you do not know anything about Catholic apologetics. You can learn alot about the faith from this book. It is a good examlpe of what Fundamentalists believ and of how apologists defend the faith. There were some unrealistic things about thbook such as that Mike went from not knowing a lot to knowing evrything and defending his faith in about 4 weeks. Overall it was a good book and i suggest that you read it if you want to know more about or are interested in becoming an apologist."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"Overall this was a pretty good book with a good story line, yet I found many faults. I couldn't seem to understand that Michael could learn so much about his faith and the Bible, in so little time. I think many parts of this book were greatly exaggerated. I also looked at the book in other ways too. I understood my religion more and now I have a clear understanding of the difference between Biblical Fundamentalists and Catholics. I see the flaws in Fundamentalism and now I know good arguments to prove Fundamentalists wrong."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"A PHILLY CATHOLIC IN KING JAMES COURT was an excellent book abou the catholic faith. It taught me that Mary was important and that the bread we eat at church is really Jesus. It also taught me how the amish culture in Kentucky was like. The part I didn't like though was that Michael learned the whole Catholic faith in just a couple of weeks. When it actually takes years of study to learn all those tihngs. Other than it was agood book and educational."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"I felt this book was very interesting and it gave me a lot more knowledge about Catholicism.

For the most part it was a very good book and gave many important facts."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"A Philadelphia Catholic In King James's Court was an exceptional book, which consisted of Protestant and Catholic conflicts within the Bible. The quality of the book was compromised when the author's ideas and beliefs were introduced into the book. For example, the author talks about how he likes the city and the country but hates the suburbs, which I feel resents me and my lifestyle, on page 20. The story was quite simple and a little uninteresting because the timing of the story was a little unrealistic and slow in the sense that the author tried to fit everything in during the one summer Mike was at the farm. Mike's character didn't fit any type of teenager that I know and I couldn't relate to the story through Mike in any other sense other than the Catholic sense. The story was full of religious concepts and conflicts, but didn't have much relation to a teenager's problems, my troubles and confusions. A Philadelphia Catholic In King James's Court was a complete story with a plot that could flare an interest in people who have encountered Apologetics in their life, but did not flare my interests. I consider the story to be a good basis on Catholic beliefs and a good understanding of the conflicts between religions. This was a good book in the aspect of religion and a good book for the faithful Catholic or Protestant, but not for many other types of people."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"I felt a Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court was a pretty good book, but it lacked an entertaining plot and some aspects of the book were unusual.

I saw how different groups view the bible, and the contradictions that become present in the Fundamentalist interpretation of the bible. I found it hard to stop reading. At some points I found myself laughing at the arguments being made by Luther and Pastor Brown. I realized that there really are people in the world who act like this. Mr. Kennedy wrote a great book that taught me a few things, and inspired me to read more about the Catholic faith. I really enjoyed the book."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"Although this book was not very exciting in my opinion, it gave me some new insights on Fundamentalist and Catholic views of the Bible. There is some background information in the story about the Bible and its meaning. It explains passages from certain sections in the Bible and gives some understanding to the time when it was written. I also learned about Fundamentalists and their view of Biblical interpretation. If you decide to purchase this book, I recommend that you pay close attention to how the Fundamentalists sometimes contradict themselves, and also how Michael (the main character) approaches the scripture. This book is great if you are interested in learning about the Catholic or Protestant religions, or want to know what certain sections of the Bible mean."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"Yo The book A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court was a nice book, I enjoyed readin it very much. The book had a deeper meaning then what was on the surface. The story is about a boy named Mike. Mike's dad dies in a fire in the beginning of the story, because of this his mom and siblings move to Kentucky with his cousins. Mike very much likes Kentucky and the farm at which they are staying at, yet his uncle Les pressures him very much to become part of the Fundelmentalist church. Mike wants to stay Catholic because that is what his laid father was. The book explains mikes problems exposure, opinion and experiences. The book was very insightful to a catholic who was learning about his faith like I am. This is not only a good read it would be perfect for teens or adults. It presents the reasoning on both sides very effectively and realistically. Because the defenses are in the context of an interesting novel, I found myself more able to follow the line of reasoning. thank u for ur time"},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"This book was a very good story, considering it was written within the bounds of a comparison of the Protestant and Catholic interpretations of the Bible. Kennedy takes ideas from both sides of the &quot;conflict&quot; that many people face in their lives, and molds them into a wonderful tale of a young man and the struggle with his uncle's faith. From the death of his father to the &quot;questioning&quot; and mocking of himself and his faith, he takes on the challenges that are presented to him and prevails, while at the same time creating a will to change in his cousin, Eli. I feel that anyone having unanswered questions with their faith should read this."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"In the novel Philadelphis Catholic and King James's court, a teenage boy travels from his home town of Philadelphia to his uncles roral area of Kentucky. I felt that the book showed its reader, Catholic and Non-Catholic alike a different view upone what Catholics believe. Not only can you learn from the book but you can also get a different account towards other views of the Bible. I felt it was a good read for all those people who are interested in understanding the many differences between the many Christian Denominations. It not only shows the average person an easy way to learn about faith, but it also throws in an interesting plot line to move everything alone. I would say that the book could carry its plot with the story very well, but there were some points in the novel where the plot may have conversed with true fact and caused a unrealistic effect. Over all it was a good read for a person with an elastic understanding towards the different views of Christian denominations."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court was a Catholic vs. Fundamentalist Christians story. Michael, the main character who went from Philadelphia to Kentucky, defended Catholic views and procedures. He tried to explain new ideas to the Fundamentalist, but they where not open to these ideas. I personally felt it became better towards the end of the novel. At first it was slow-moving and hard to keep track of all the characters. The description became hackneyed, along with the plot. Also, reading about the farm life was hard to relate to. After the heated bible discussions began, the story was easier to read. Overall, this book was better than I had expected."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"This book really showed me that although Christians share the same basic beliefs, the denominations are very different from each other. In this book, Michael, a teen from Philadelphia, takes on his uncle's town of Bible-wielding maniacs in Kentucky.

When I first began to read it I anticipated that it would be rather dumb. It turns out that i was correct. I could not become interested.

Summing up my review I think it never should have been written."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"This novel shows the struggle of a young boy troubled by his own faith, with problems within his own family from his father's death, to his uncle's fighting against his faith. It shows his struggle to find out what Catholicism is, the flaws of it, and which religion he should follow. It shows the heresies against Catholicism, along with its strengths. It has a sheer lacking in the amount of entertainment in the book, yet it can either strengthen or weaken your faith. It is tends to be utterly dull at times. Not a good book."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"When I first was presented this book in class, I figured it would be a corny \\"love everyone\\" book (like the typical religion textbook). I was pleasantly surprised at its ability to keep me awake (most of the time); however, it's only the first step towards apologetic novels that can be truly effective. The beginning portion is rather boring and full of unnecessary drivel. The portion in which he absorbs the Biblical knowledge later used in arguments seemed as if de Porres wrote that at the last minute for two reasons. Firstly, he hardly refers to any of the information that Michael cites in his speeches, despite saying in subtext that he did so. Secondly, how could anyone absorb all that Biblical interpretation in such a short time, let alone use it effectively? This stemmed out into other smaller contradictions which made it hard to read between the lines at times. Beyond that, de Porres made readable what many could not: religion. For that, I commend Mr. de Porres. His accurate portrayal of Philly and believable characters made it a painless read. I can only hope that textbook writers catch up to Mr. de Porres."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"This book is about a boy named Michael and his trials and tribulations with his understanding of his own religion and his uncle's. Michael lives in Philadelphia but moves to the south to live with his uncle, les, after the tragic death of his father. Les is a fundamentalist preacher who highly condems the \\"Roman\\" Catholic faith. Michael spends most of his stay on his uncle's farm defending Catholicism. Les intent is to change Michael's outlook on his faith and bring him into his own church. However, Michael's views on Catholism are changed for the better, and his faith only grows stronger.This book taught me a lot about my own Catholic faith. It explained to me many passages in the Bible i have'nt quite understood. It also helped me understand parts of the customs and Tradition that is practiced in the Church. It is true that this book is a little unrealistic with Michael's quick learning of passages from the Bible and other religious books. However, We must remember that this book is fiction and is not a true story. Martin Deporres Kennedy did a great job writing this book, and it is a good read if you want to learn something about Catholicism."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King Jame's Court, starts out a tragic turn of events. Michael and his family lose their father in a fire. His family is now going to move to they country, and out of the city with his uncle and his family on their farm. The story really gets going as Michael adjusts to his new lifestyle. His uncle, Les, is a very religious man. Having once been a Catholic, he converted to Fundamentalist because of differences in beliefs. Michael too, started to question his religion. Yet, he realized that Catholics had a different way of viewing the bible, mass, and Traditions. Michael spoke at Les's church in discussions explaining and proving Catholicism to the Fundamentalists. In this book, you will see many controdictions and inconsistencies in Les's religion.This book is great for finding out for what you believe and what your religion means to you. It points out many problematic areas of the church and clears them out. Martin De Porres Kennedy wrote this book well, and I think that it does its job; in explaining Catholicism. I never thought this book would be one that I'd enjoy, but it turned out to be a very good read and an informational book."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"This book is overall well written, however the beginning was very boring. It began to get good towards the middle when Michael starts to attend his uncle's Bible studies to enlighten the Fundamentalist Christians on the Catholic view of the Bible and its many beliefs. I learned a lot from this book on how the Fundamentalists interprate the Bible and about how they differ from the Catholics. During the sessions that Michael has with his uncle, Les, and others from his uncle's church, I was astonished about how much of the Bible has subtle hints of how things can be interprated and how the author used all of these Bible passages to help the reader understand what he/she was reading. This understanding that the author brings to the book is very well thought out. I would reccommend this book to anyone interested in the Christian faith, whether it be Catholicism or Fundamentalist Christianity. Even if you aren't either of these religions it is a great book to see how high the Fundamentalists hold the Bible in their faith, as well as the Catholics. Although this book is very long and a tedius read (for me at least), I feel that it is a book worth reading if you are a part of any sect of Christianity due to its great attention to detail and well thought out plot that both revolve around the simple basis of religion in a young boy's life."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"A Philadelphia in King James Court is a good book to read to learn more about the catholic faith, but if you were interested in reading a pleasure book you wouldn't be satisfied. Personally I didn't like the book, it was a very well written and formatted book but it was also very boring. I like books with suspense and this was more of a strait forward book explaining the differences between the Catholic Church and the fundamentalist. The Catholic being Michael and his father who had died, and the Fundamentalist being Les Michaels Uncle. Michael O'Shea is a 17 year old boy who is living a normal life when unexpectedly his father died in a fire. Michael had to move down south with his Uncle, where he learns about their religions and about his own religion also. This is where we learn about the way of a fundamentalist compared to our Catholic religion. Even though I did not like the book I learned a lot about it in Mr. Puntel's class the book itself was very boring but when you take it into a classroom or a study you can learn a lot about your faith and about the faith of the people around you."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"This book is good and bad in some parts. It makes sense what Michael is explaining but if you think about it, it doesn't make any sense. Michael moved from Philadelphia to Georgia/Alabama/SOUTH because his dad died in a heroic effort to save someone. First of all, why would he leave there, and second why would he go to the south instead of with relatives or back to their house in Philly. The arguments Michael presents make sense, and he destroys what the fundamentalists say so much that they throw him out of the south. How does Michael learn all of this, does it pop in to his head one morning and he decides to start bashing on the people he is living with and go against his mothers brothers religion. If I was his mom I would slap him and leave the south because there is no reason for him to go against it. Michael meets Les, who is the leader of the local church and he has a sermon about go-between people. He says they are wrong and then when the sermon is over he decides to question the person who he is living with on his morals and religion. Les cannot explain the final answer to his sermon because he doesn't know the answer to it. The same thing happens when they go to mass at a catholic church down south. The pastor gives a sermon and Michael has no clue what he is talking about, so he asks the pastor what he meant and he failed to answer him also. Then Michael realizes somehow that the fundamentalists are wrong about everything so he starts arguing with local fundamentalist leaders. In the end Michael is kicked out of the south for arguing with the head fundamentalist guy and I guess he goes back to live inPhilly with his friends. This book is good on the issues but there are key things missing to the plot."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"After reading A Philadelphia Catholic in King James Court by Martin DePorres Kennedy, it got me to thinking more about the religion I practice, Catholicism. As the book starts out, Michael, having just tragically losing his father, is thrown into a world; it would seem he is not ready for. As he gets to know his Uncle Les's fundamentalist view of the bible, he begins to realize not everything they practice does follow the bible. He begins to see arguments arise and he himself is challenged on the ways of the bible. The most significant change seemed to be his debate with Pastor Brown. Though Michael had seemed cornered he slipped out of harms way once again. In my opinion, this book gives an excellent overview of the issues that people have disagreed on and also why there was a split within the church. Overall, the book may have seemed boring to some, but the depth of knowledge it provided made me get a deeper understanding of what we really practice at mass."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"as i first started reading this book i couldent stand it. it was boring and pointless. i didnt know why i was reading it but after a few chapters it got better. i found out i was reading this book because it explains some things about the catholic church, like why catholics have a pope and why catholics honor mary. this is a good book to read for anyone who is thiking of becoming a catholic or for catholics who do not agree with certain church teachings. eventually this book became a book i actually wanted to read instead of just reading it because it explained things about the cathoolic church. it had a good plot. i would give this book 3 stars because it was not too boring and it was very education."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James' Court is a very interesting novel that teaches the reader about the Catholic and Fundamentalists religions. This is a great novel and the reader will be intrigued with important discussions in this book. The book first starts out with Michael O'Shea, the main character, who is enjoying his life in a small urban section in Philadelphia. Michael is a 17 year-old boy with his whole life in front of him. However, things change for the O'Shea's when Mick, Michael's father, tragically dies in a fire. After Mick's funeral, Pam, Michael's mother, decides to move the family to her brother's farm in Kentucky. While in Kentucky, Pam's brother, Uncle Les, decides to give Michael the spiritual guidance he needs since his father died. Uncle Les eventually hopes to convert Michael into a \\"born again\\" Christian or fundamentalist. However, Michael learns that he is in a new environment and he is going to need to defend his religion. The greater half of this book is the arguing between Michael and the local fundamentalists. Michael learns to use the Bible and the Catholic Tradition to defend his faith. Overall, I enjoyed this book. I learned a great deal about the Catholic faith. However, the greatest enigma about this book was how Michael was able to gain so much knowledge about the Bible in such a little time. Yet, this book allowed me to understand the Catholic Church's teachings and authority. I recommend this book to anyone who questions or is struggling with the Catholic faith."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"Overall this was a pretty good book with a good story line, yet I found many faults.

It presented a clear explanation of both (in my view), not only Catholicism but also fundamentalism and it's fundamental weakness. I've read a great deal of catholic apologetics, so very little of the content was new to me and Kennedy clearly seems to be writing for a teen audience (to which I now longer belong). None the less, I was very entertained with it and very impressed. Impressed to the point that I am now actively seeking out Catholic fiction authors to see what else can be found in this sub-genre.Kennedy's youthful protagonist is given suffeciently compelling struggles throughout the book that I found it easy to care about his dilemmas and I appreciated, as a reader, the manner in which the struggles became greater in a manner that showed the growth of the hero as he faced them. I highly recommend this book for any teen (or adult) who is doubting the validity of his/her faith, catholic or not.I hope to find and enjoy more fiction from Martin de Porres Kennedy in the future."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"One of the things that was certainly lacking in my \\"Catholic\\" high school curriculum back in the 70s was apologetics. In fact, I didn't even know what apologetics was until my mid 30s! Unsure and ignorant of my Catholic faith I spent a lot of years sort of drifting in the wind blown by the infamous \\"Spirit of Vatican II\\" with no substance, no form, no conviction and no clue!As I started to train my own children in their Catholic Faith I looked for sources that would not only tell them what the Catholic Church teaches, but also go into a rich explanation of the \\"why.\\"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Courtis the kind of book that would have served me well back in my high school days. This novel is engaging, thought provoking and even humorous in places. The story is so compelling that the reader can become totally engrossed in it. But more importantly, it teaches the Catholic faith in a way that captures the imagination and heart of the reader.Michael O'Shea is a high school senior, beginning to think about his plans for college when his fireman father is tragically killed in a house fire saving a drug dealer. His mother Tammi, is so shaken by her husband's death that she agrees to take her children out of school early and live on her brother Les's farm for the summer so that she can have time to sort through her husband's papers and have some quiet time to grieve.Les lives deep in the bible belt. Catholics in that area are in the minority. Although Les had great admiration for his late brother-in-law, he thinks that Tammi made a mistake converting to Catholicism, and he has made it his mission to use the time he has with his sister's family to recovert them back to Protestantism, starting with his oldest nephew Michael.In many ways, Michael is like a lot of post Vatican II Catholics. He doesn't really understand what the church teaches or why, but he did have the example of his parent's deep faith. As uncle talks to him about questions he has on Catholicism, Michael starts reading the books his father had and learning to understand Sacred Scripture and how the bible is essential to explaining and understanding what the Catholic church teaches.Young Michael is confronted many times in the books on different issues, like devotion to Mary and the papacy. The climax at the end of the book is when Michael must face a well-known Protestant apologist in front of an entirely Protestant congregation.Michael does not become a top notch apologist over night. He has a lot of stumbles and insecurity, but perseverance and study become his allies.One of the parts of the book that really meant a lot to me, was that Tammy O'Shea is never by her son's side during these confrontations, but she is always at home praying her rosary for his safety and guidance. The power of a mother's prayer.AA Philadelphia Catholic to King James's Court: Discussion/Study Guideis also available. I used that somewhat in preparing my son for confirmation.I first read this book myself four years ago and learned a lot from it. I gleaned even more the second time around a few years later. This would definitely be a good book for any Catholic adult of my vintage who wants something enjoyable and not too technical or dry for re-learning some of the basics of the Catholic Faith."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"This book is a great book and an easy read. Martin de Porres Kennedy tells a great story of a young Catholic boy, who doesn't really know about his faith, who is confronted by his Fundamentalist Uncle and friends about the Catholic faith. You will see how the average Catholic views that Fundamentalists really know the Bible, but when one understands and knows the Catholic faith, they see that the Fundamentalist really doesn't know, understand, or really follow the Bible."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"The other reviewers do a good job of summarizing the plot of this novel, so I will not go into those details. My one compliment to this book is that the truths of the Catholic faith are presented honestly as the young man struggles to defend his beliefs against many common misconceptions and accusations.As a story itself, however, the novel is trite and irritating. I really wanted to connect to this young man who lost his father, but the characters of the young man, his dead father, his mother and siblings were too idyllically drawn to be real. While I know many good Catholics and happy families, I could not relate to the O'Sheas of this book as they seemed so cloyingly perfect. I couldn't finish this book and I wouldn't even consider handing it to one of my teenagers. Perhaps those who live in a Catholic \\"bubble\\" might find this novel interesting. I, for one, would rather study the catechism with my children to deepen our faith and then, when reading time comes, encourage my children to crack open novels with well-developed, complex and compelling characters, settings and plots. This novel is not one of those."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"I found A Philadelphia Catholic to be a beautiful Fable with true and persuasive content. The descriptions of Philadelphia communities were right on the money. The impressions of the Catholic faith Michael runs into are the same I ran into when I first left home for other states. The answers, and reasons for catholic belief do well to describe the beauty of our faith. I think this would be a fantastic book for teenagers and young adults of all faiths. Because the underling message of being charitable and loving to everyone of every faith makes this a truly uplifting tale. I think the time frame represented in the book seems short for the amount of growth, study and learing that takes place. The characters however are all realistic, and likeable while at the same time many are easy to disagree with. Overall the story is well done and inspirational. I wish the author would do more books."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"I found a Philadelphia Catholic in King James' Court to be a very insightful book. This book talks about the struggles a boy undergoes when he is confronted by his uncle who just so happens to be a Biblical Fundamentalist. His uncle tries to show the boy that being a Biblical Fundamentalist is the proper way to worship and that he should join him as a Fundamentalist at his church. This book is a great book to read if you are trying to find your faith as a Catholic."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"This was a great book that taught us a lot about the Protestant and Catholic faiths. I am a Catholic and this book still taught me a lot about Catholicism. Even though it was a good book the plot was still hard to believe. The book is about a boy from Philadelphia and his father dies in a fire. The boy moves to Kentucky for the summer with the rest of his family. In Kentucky his cousins and everyone else are all Fundamentalists and they would all love to see him and his family convert to Fundamentalism. The boy, Michael, ends up getting into a few arguments with some Fundamentalists that have studied the bible for many years. The part of the plot that I find hard to believe is how a 17 year old boy can study and learn all about the bible in a few weeks, but Michael has some great arguments defending the Catholic faith and I suggest that you read this book."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"First I have to say is that what I got out of this book is not what I expected. Having been envolved in Religious debates, I can relate to nervousness that Michael experienced. Being a Catholic and having questions about my own faith, I found that this book has given me the ability to look into the Bible and find the answers to my questions."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"This is an excellent book about a young man who defends his Catholic faith to a group of Bible christians who are trying to &quot;save&quot; him from Catholicism. His defenses come from the bible alone and are true to the teachings of the Catholic Church. I would recommend this book to life-long Catholics, converts, former Catholics, and Christians of any denomination who would like to learn more about the Catholic Church and how the Church's teachings can be supported in the scriptures."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"While the writing is not great literature, any reader who perseveres will be treated to beautiful, simple yet profound reflections on Christianity from potentially dueling perspectives. While the apologetic nature of the novel is in itself impressive, the author's approach, showing each character as flawed but well-meaning, reminds us all to discuss matters of conviction with humility and charity."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"Though the long and odd title may make you think this book will be weird and juvenile, this novel is well thought out and very accurate. Not only does it portray the true beliefs of both fundamentalists and Catholics it shows how they differ and how a true and devout catholic can defend their beliefs when put on the spot. This is an excellent read and should be on every true Catholic or christian bookshelf."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"The Book a Philadelphia Catholic in King James Court was a good Novel. The Book had a good story and premise. Based in Kentucky it talked a lot about the Aimish and farm life. The only thing that was remotely bad about the book was some unrealistic events. Overal it was a good book. The book looked and was boring at first but as the plot and storyline started to develop it got a lot better. If any one was wondering about or having doubts of the Roman Catholic faith, I definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"This book was interesting. It was interesting to see how Michael defended his own Catholic faith against the fundamentalists. I have to be honest and say that if this book had been an optional reading assignment I would have opted not to. On the other hand I am glad in a way that it was not optional because at the end of the story I had learned some things and been given some new ideas that I had not had before. I read this book with more of an understanding of the protestant side being a Presbyterian (even though I have become familiar with the Catholic practice in Mr. Puntel's class at LaSalle College High School). Some of the things mentioned by Michael in this story were foreign at first but through class discussions I was able to get a better understand and learn some new things about the Catholic Faith that I had not yet picked up in my textbook. I would say that if you are looking for a thriller to read that this is not exactly the type of book you want to read but if you are looking to learn something new about both Catholic and Protestant Christianity this book would be an excellent start."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James' Court is about a boy named Michael, who after his father dies goes to live with family in Kentucky for the summer. There he struggled to keep his identity as a Catholic from all of the ensuing remarks of the Bible Fundamentalists. Looking through an entertainment perspective this book was rather bland and boring, but through information obtained from this book it was a very helpful text for all Catholics especially for those trying to find their identity."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"I felt that &quot;A Philadelphia Catholic in King James' Court&quot; was a well written book with a couple minor flaws. This book was about a young teenager, named Michael, who moved to Kentucky to live with his uncle for the summer. While there he learned many things. He learned that he didn't know everything about his own religion and he also studied a totally different religion. I felt that this book taught me many things. The book taught me about the beliefs of Fundamentalists. The book even taught me things I didn't know about my own religion. A Philadelphia Catholic depicts the differences between the two religions. The Fundamentalists believe that the Bible must be taken word for word; while the Catholics believe in the Bible, they also base some of their religion on traditions. This book also had a couple flaws. I felt that the book was unrealistic. A teenager wouldn't spend his/her summer reading and studying about their religion as well as another religion. Another flaw was that even if a teenager studied about these religions he wouldn't become an expert so quickly. I found that rather than enjoying the book, I learned from the book.. It seemed that the book was more like a text than it was a story. Overall the book was good but the flaws prevented me from giving the book five stars."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"I felt A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court was a pretty good book, but it lacked an entertaining plot and some aspects of the book were hard to believe. It was a good book in that it explained and supported the Catholic faith strongly. It showed me some things in the Bible that I did not know were there. Although it explained the Catholic faith in depth to me, the presentation of these ideas was in a boring fashion. It was just plain talk and no excitement. Also, there were some things in the book that I found hard to believe were true. I thought about how Michael's whole summer revolved around the Bible and work. There was no play, fun, or friends in his life, just dedication to the Bible. I found that hard to believe because many teens wnat to have fun along with having a faith. Michael just had faith it seemed. Also, I thought it was hard to believe how Michael started down in Kentucky not knowing alot about the Bible, and by the end of the summer, he knew more than his uncle who had been studying the Bible for years. Although it had these minor flaws, I thought the book was very informative, and helped me understand my own faith a little better."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"I thought A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court was a great story about Michael, a young teenager, who has recently lost his father and is struggling to understand his faith, Christianity. After his father's death, Michael and his family travel to Kentucky where Michael's uncle, Les, a farmer and Fundamentalist preacher lives with his family. In Kentucky, Michael is constantly confronted with questions about his religion. The book becomes a little unrealistic at this point in depicting how Michael answers these questions. Using limited materials, a Bible and old books of his father, Michael prepares answers to these questions in a very short period of time. Michael defends the Catholic Church in areas ranging from the Inquisition to why Catholics honor Mary, the Mother of God. Les and his Fundamentalist friends hope tohat the questions draw Michael away from the Church and convert him into a Protestant. Les' plan backfires and Michael and the reader end up learning more about his faith in Catholic doctrine and Tradition. Although the book may be unrealistic in some areas, it really explains the Catholic faith in a unique way. I think this book strengthened my Catholic faith, and is a must for anyone who wants to learn or understand more about the Catholic faith."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James' Court is an interesting book for the whole family. While reading the book, I found out alot about the Fundamentalists, and why Catholics believe the things they do. The only problem about the book is that there is no way that a boy Mike's age could learn about and defend the Catholic faith so well in such a short period of time. This problem will probably not take away the enjoyment of reading the book."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"Although unrealistic at times, this book still got accross the Catholic aproach of some major misunderstood topics. The book also presented how and why fundamentalists contradict the Catholic view of these topics. After facing a devastating situation early in the book, Michael overcomes it and defends the Catholic faith against fundamentalists and their interpretation using good apologetic arguments mainly from the Bible. Overall, I thought this book was very interesting although it had many unrealistic parts. This is a good book for people who want to know about the Catholic faith. It shows different aspects of Catholiscism in a well written fictional story."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's was ok. it was very descriptive and shows how faith is so important in your life. i only give it three stars because in some parts it isn't too realistic. i pretty much enjoyed it. and if you read it some parts will stick out i your head and you will remember them very cleary. for example i took an open book test without the book and i got a 90(they were pretty hard questions too) so it is a pretty good book over all."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"I thought that, A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court was a very good book. It was very well written and had a good plot. It is the first ever apologetic novel, and it has done a good job in clearing the way for others. In this book, there were many good discussions on the differences between Catholics and Protestants. My favorite parts in the book were whenever, Michael was in the Bible study sessions, and these chapters were very exciting. In the book, there were many good characters that really helped to make this book a lot more interesting for the reader. I especially liked that Michael succeeded in bible study and convinced hid cousin Eli, through his teachings and discussions of the Catholic Church. I thought that the story was well written, and I would love to read a sequel."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court does an excellent job at defending and clarifying many aspects of the Roman Catholic faith. Michael O'Shea, the book's main character, is an inspiring young Catholic that finds himself dueling fundamentalists, such as his uncle Les, on matters of his faith. Michael delivers several Bible interpretations in the book that helped me understand my own religion even better. His interpretations were not only well represented but also made a lot of sense.Through the course of the story, Michael O'Shea takes on his calling to apologetics by attending and participating in many of his uncle's Bible studies. The fundamentalists from Uncle Les's church are brutal in their attempts to reveal to Michael what they claim to be the only true interpretation of the Bible. Michael begins to see that the only way to counter these attacks on his faith is to read and understand the Bible. Michael shows his uncle Les and the rest of the fundamentalists that the Catholic faith does not contradict the Bible. He even shows them that their own faith is an inconsistency to the Bible.Michael's interpretations gave me the confidence and knowledge to defend my own faith. They also helped me to understand aspects of my faith such as papal authority and the veneration of Mary. This book is a great defense for the Catholic faith and will help any Catholic to understand and fully appreciate their faith."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"When our class was assigned this book to read, like everyone else I thought it would be another boring book that we were being forced to read. But much to my surprise, I learned a lot about the Bible and the Catholic religion. I personally did not enjoy this book. Although it is well written, it is not for those who enjoy action and suspense. The main character is Michael O'shea. He is a 17 year old boy living a normal life in Philadelphia until his father dies in a fire. After his father's death he moves down south to live with his uncle Les who is a Fundamentalist. While Michael is living with his uncle he learns the differences between Catholics and Fundamentalists. For instance he learns why the Catholic Bibles have more books than the Fundamentalist Bibles and why Catholics have a Pope.This book would not be satisfying to a reader just reading a book for enjoyment. I would not recomend this book to any non-Catholic readers. All in all I think that this book is for school discussion only."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"I thought the book was very good and educational, with many humorous, exciting, and sad parts to keep the reader interested. It took you on a ride through the farmlands of Kentucky and showed the many differences in thought between Fundamentalists and Catholics. The book showed me how a person should defend their faith even in the face of great intransigence. The book also shows how some people are ignorant in the fact that they will say your wrong but not understand much about your beliefs. It is a wonderful book to read for Catholics and others regardless of age."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court is a very well writen book that teaches people some of the reasoning behind the Christian faith. This book had a somewhat unrealistic storyline but was able to get across the reasoning of the Christian faith extremely well. Michael's learning and strenghting of his faith was magnificantly displayed. The unrealistic way this happened did not greatly affect my enjoying of the book. My two concerns were that the Protestants are potraited in a way that makes there faith look disorganized and contradictory. Secondly Michael was able to have all of answers he needed to the Protestant's questioning without any effort and was able to learn many unknown truths of the Christian faith in a short period of time. This book is a great way for non Christians to understand the Christian faith and can help answer some questions for Christians."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James Court is an interesting book. Although all of it may not have been true, it gave me an overview of fundamentalist churches. Overall the book was pretty good, even though the beginning was very bland. Symbolism throughout this book was abundant, especially in the beginning. What I really liked about this book came in the last few chapters. These parts were the biblical discussions. At this point, I could not stop reading and enjoyed every minute. They were heated debates with great views being shot back and forth. I really learned a lot from the topics discussed. This ranged from the Catholic veneration of Mary to the Pope's infallible status, I like it all. In most debates, things were looking down for Michael and things were going the way Les had planned. My favorite part of the book was the very last chapter. This was the best debate of the book in my opinion. Here, everything was at stake, Pastor Brown was trying to humiliate Michael. He even succeeded, until Mike fought back. Pastor Brown was the figure in Mike's dreams and that's where Mike defeated him. Les' plan actually backfired on him; he believed that he could convert Mike through these bible discussions. When Mike debated and brought up those points, he did something he had not intended. He had converted Eli."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"A Philadelphia Catholic In King Jame's Court was a pretty good book. IF someone told me what it was about i would never have thought i would like it, but it turned out not to be too bad. It had a lot of good information about the Catholic faith for people who aren't sure why we belieave the things we do like the papacy and our great respect and worship to Mary, the mother of Jesus. The reason why it was just pretty good is because there was nothing exciting that made me want to keep reading. It was overall a good book, but it didnt have anything exciting for me."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"The book A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court was a book that had some things I liked and some things I didn't like. The things I like in the story outweighed the things that I did not like. For example, I liked the intense Bible discussions between the fundamentalist; Les, Luther, Jimmy, etc; and Michael, the lone catholic. Another thing I like was the fact that I learned so many new things about Catholics while I was reading the story. Some things I didn't like were the lack of reaction from the fundamentalist during the Bible discussions. Also, I didn't like how they ended the last chapter of the book; I don't think a pastor of a church would just kick someone out of their church for making a good point about something. The author makes that up in my mind when he writes the epilogue. In the end I think this was an above average book, t would give it four out of five stars."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court","review":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James' Court was a very well written book with a new and interesting storyline (It is the first ever apologetics novel). The book starts out with Michael O' Shea, (the main character) moving from Phladephia to Kentucky with his family to live with his uncle Les and cousins after his father dies in a tragic fire. While he is there, Michael learns new information about his faith and also about the local residents relgion (Fundamentalists). Michael is in a new place and is forced to verify and defend his religon because the people in his new surroundings are all a different religon. The better part of this book is spent through the bickering of the Catholic and Fundamentalist faiths. The fundamentalist believe in taking the bible completly literally, while the cathoilcs believe in taking the bible metaphorically. I dont completly understand why a young man of 17 would dedicate his entire summer to religon instead of having fun like most other boys his age. Michael is studying lines from the bible his entire summer just in order to back up his defence of his relgion. He is treated like a lepor in there society solely on the premise of his religion. This is completly unfair and outrageous. This book intrigued me at many points to persue farther into the meaning of some of the lines. On the other hand, the plot was a little dull at points and made me wonder why i continued to read it.

The book is about a teenager named Michael who, after his father dies moves to Kentucky with the rest of his family, to live with his Uncle for the summer.

This book explains some of the reasons behind the Catholic faith. It also explains the some of the reasons behind the Catholic faith. It portrays the differences between Catholicism and the Fundamentalist. The fundamentalist believes that the bible is the final authority. Catholicism teaches that the Bible comes from Tradition, so the Tradition from the Pope and the Cardinals is the final authority. There were some things I didn't like about the book. It was a bit unrealistic. No teenager would spend a summer studying about religion unless he was in summer school. When he was arguing with the fundamentalist he sites passages and lines from books that he read. Even experts can't remember what passage or what line to remember, so a teenager would have a lot of trouble remembering. Over all I think was a good book, but not good enough to get a five out of five."},{"Title":"Admiral of the ocean sea: A life of Christopher Columbus (Franklin Library of Pulitzer Prize classics)","review":"This was one of the most enjoyable biographies I've read. The most distinguishing thing about this book of course is the fact that Morison recreated the voyages before his writing the book. This recreation lends credibility to his writing. But more than that, it makes much of the book, particularly those parts at sea, seem as if the reader is experiencing the voyages through the person of Columbus. Not only the particulars of what he saw, but the smells of land breezes, the feel of the trade winds, the motion of the boat. Morison's obvious love of the sea and of sailing work very much in his favor. Another strength is the historical perspective carefully provided by Morison. Knowing what was going on with Catholic Spain during Columbus' life (the defeat of the Moors, the expulsion of the Jews, political intrigue and conflict involving France, England, Portugal, and others) helps to explain the motivations of Columbus and his contemporaries. I was a bit wary of a 60-year old book, Pulitzer or no Pulitzer, in light of the more recent reconsiderations of Columbus. Some people would have us believe that the voyage of 1492 was some sort of original sin inflicted upon the paradise that was the western hemisphere. But in his preface, Morison makes it clear that he is concerned with Columbus, the &quot;man of action&quot;, and is leaving analyses of his motivations to others. And at any rate, Morison's sensibilities are very much in tune with those of the year 2000. He makes few apologies for Columbus and takes him to task where warranted, particularly for his treatment of the natives. One chapter, &quot;Hell in Hispaniola&quot;, is almost exclusively devoted to this area. One word of warning: If your knowledge of sailing isn't good, then you may want to bone up on some of the rudiments before starting this book. Morison provides an explanation of some of the terminology, but not enough for someone who knows as little about sailing as I did coming in. But please don't be put off by that - this book is a real pleasure."},{"Title":"Admiral of the ocean sea: A life of Christopher Columbus (Franklin Library of Pulitzer Prize classics)","review":"Samuel Eliot Morison's Admiral of the Ocean Sea: A Life of Christopher Columbus won the Pulitzer Prize in 1942, and does not seem the least dated 55 years later. What sets Morison's biography apart from most is that Morison himself is a sailor, and he draws on his own knowledge of ships, currents, and men to bring Columbus to life. Morison (and, through him, his reader) is constantly amazed at how good Columbus was at dead reckoning in unknown waters, and what a superb handler of ships and men he was. However, this is not a hagiography, and Morison does not shy away from Columbus' lapses in judgment (to the end, he convinced himself that he had reached the Indies) and mistakes. Six years ago, of course, was the 500th anniversary of Columbus' initial voyage, and I remember a deluge of articles and books -- mostly attacking dead white European males -- being published to note the event. I suspect that Morison's biography was roundly attacked at that time. I would be interested to dig up those books and articles to see what they say. For me, however, regardless of the current fashions or trends of scholarship, Morison's biography remains a marvelous tale, stunningly told. I recommend this book highly!"},{"Title":"Admiral of the ocean sea: A life of Christopher Columbus (Franklin Library of Pulitzer Prize classics)","review":"I knew a fair amount about the first voyage of Columbus from the perspective of the political and the historical but very little about the voyage itself or the man Columbus. The Admiral of the Ocean Sea is an excellent source for information on all of the voyages themselves as well as the general information from a historical point of view.Morison does an excellent job of describing the man Columbus. While many people in our own century will have a very difficult time seeing him as a man of morals due to the manner in which treated non-European people, Morison shows us a picture of a man consumed with the understanding of morality in his day. The lengths that Columbus went to attain piety are rarely taught or written of today and I found the sections dealing with these very informative.I also found the description of the sailing vessels and of the conditions of the sailors to be quite interesting. The majority of the material dealing with sailing itself (a good part of the book) I lacked sufficient understanding to really enjoy. I know little of navigation and little of astronomy so celestial observations are bit beyond me. However I was able to understand in general terms the result (ie Columbus was off a lot or a little)While I had learned a great deal about the dealing of later explorers with the Indians I knew little of the first explorers relations with them. Naturally what I learned about the Spaniards did not surprise me. What did surprise me was how many times traveling along the various coasts the Spaniards met with hostile locals. True most of the Indians were friendly to their own detriment but some did indeed show a little fight.Also &#65533;The Admiral of the Ocean Sea&#65533; does a really good job of placing the events of the discovery of America into their proper context. The Spanish inquisition was in full swing. The Crusades were a part of recent history and the intermingling of European royal blood for political purposes was at its height.I would recommend this book to anyone interested in a balanced biography of Columbus. Afterall it won the Pulitzer for a reason."},{"Title":"Admiral of the ocean sea: A life of Christopher Columbus (Franklin Library of Pulitzer Prize classics)","review":"Morison wrote this fine book in honor of the 450'th anniversary of Columbus' discovery of America. I think Morison would be surprised at how people's perceptions of the event have changed in the decades since.First off, let me say that the book is well worth reading. Morison was a man of the sea himself and he sailed in the same waters as Columbus. We see in the book how Columbus was a master seaman as well as being a great salesman, but on the other hand he was a poor geographer and even worse politician. The Portuguese were right in turning down his proposal for the Enterprise of the Indies, their geographers knew that Columbus was way off the mark regarding the distance from Europe to East Asia. In any event, they were making good progress down Africa and they felt it was just a matter of time until they found the bottom of the continent and the entrance to the Indian Ocean.I would now like to address the change in fortune for Columbus's reputation.(1) People now like to say that he didn't \\"discover\\" America. One reason is because there were already people (the American Indians) there, but that is simply world-games. Of course he \\"discovered\\" it, no one in Europe or Asia knew about it, and the Indians didn't know about Europe or Asia either. Secondly, the fact that Columbus wasn't necessarily the first to cross the Atlantic doesn't change anything. The Vikings who reached North America simply viewed it as another Arctic land and had no idea of the geographical relationship of this new continent to the rest of the world. In any event, they didn't exploit their discovery in the long run, only Columbus's voyage led to that. It is also speculated that Portuguese fisherman were crossing the Atlantic before Columbus, after all, they discovered the Azores already in the 1420's (already one-third of the way across the Atlantic) but we don't know if they sighted the continent, and even if they did, they, like the Vikings didn't do anything to exploit their knowledge.(2) People say that he is responsible for the destruction of the Indian society that existed on Hispaniola. It certainly wasn't his original intention to do this. He wanted to convert the natives to Christianity, so killing them off wouldn't help this mission. Morison himself points out that Columbus did contribute to this tragedy, but even if Columbus had been more careful, I think the Indians would have had the same fate. The settlers that came in the wake of the discovery brought new plants and animals in addition to previously unknown diseases and all these things would have grievously damaged the Indians agricultural system and society. Add to this the Spaniard's missionary religion which no doubt was attractive to at least some of the native population and we see that things could just not remain the same.(3) Some people claim the pre-Columbian New World was some sort of paradise that the Europeans ruined. This is also knows as the myth of the \\"noble savage\\". Unfortunatley it is just a myth because human nature is the same all over the world. Greed, cruelty, avarice and the such are not just European or Western traits. The Carib tribes who inhabited the Caribbean Sea (and gave it its name) were very warlike and fought other, more peaceful tribes. Similarly, the Mexica (also knows as the Aztec) the Hernan Cortes conquered in the wake of Columbus was hated by its Indian neighbors for supressing them and taking prisoners for the human sacrificial system. Thus, we should be more realistic in evaluating the pre-Columbian societies and remove the \\"politically correct\\" rose-colored glasses.(3) While it is true that slaves from Africa were brought over to Hispaniola, it must be remembered that the European slave traders who brought them over to the New World did not land in West Africa and grab natives \\"off the streets\\". They bought them from local African chiefs who captured prisoners in their local wars and then sold them to the Europeans. Thus, regarding the cruelty of the slavery system, there is plenty of blame to go around and not just to the white men involved.All-in-all, this is a very enjoyable book to read about a man, who perhaps more than any other single person, brought about the most massive revolution in human history."},{"Title":"Admiral of the ocean sea: A life of Christopher Columbus (Franklin Library of Pulitzer Prize classics)","review":"I have had this book on my shelf for quite a while, and finally got around to reading it after watching a documentary on Columbus on the Discivery Channel. I got inspired to overcome my intellectual laziness, and how pleased I am I did! This book really deserves its reputation as a timeless classic, and the author, a giant of maritime history, did such a fine job that I now want to read his well known biography of John Paul Jones. The text is gripping and the author's insights abound. This is a fine book."},{"Title":"Admiral of the ocean sea: A life of Christopher Columbus (Franklin Library of Pulitzer Prize classics)","review":"I bought the Spanish version of the book more than twenty years ago and read it several times. I have often used it for information on articles about the discovery of America and Venezuela. I am now writing for an English-language Venezuelan newspaper and, since the original book was written in English, it will be even more useful for me in the original language. The most important merit of the book, apart from Morison's clear, concise writing style, is the fact that he followed Columbus' routes to determine the exactness of the information provided by the Admiral's log, specially during the third trip, when he discovered Venezuela -or what is now called so. Actually, that was the real date of discovery of the continent. Up to then, Columbus had discovered Caribbean islands. It was only after he left the Venezuelan Continental mainland that he began to realize that he &quot;could have found a new continent&quot; as Morison points out in his book. I am putting an order for the English version of the book."},{"Title":"Admiral of the ocean sea: A life of Christopher Columbus (Franklin Library of Pulitzer Prize classics)","review":"This book is the definitive work on Columbus. Morison is famous for making the same journey that Columbus made with largely the same equipment in order to prepare for writing this book. His experience shines through in the detail thatMorison lavishes on his subject.As is the case with any great biography, Morison has become enamored with his subject, highlighting his strengths and successes while downplaying his weaknesses and failures, but you know that going into any biography and can adjust your interpretation accordingly.The story here is told very well, keeping the reader engaged and turning pages. Additionally, the book dispells many of the myths and common misconceptions about Columbus and really fills in a complete picure of the man.Well worth reading for any fan of history or biography."},{"Title":"Admiral of the ocean sea: A life of Christopher Columbus (Franklin Library of Pulitzer Prize classics)","review":"This remains the definitive biography of Columbus. Morison was one of the greatest historians ever to practice the craft--his scholarship still holds up today. He was also a master of the written word, unlike most professional historians today.Morison enumerates the reasons why he admires Columbus, but he also catalogs the man's misdeeds--for example, Morison uses the word &quot;genocide&quot; to describe Columbus's treatment of the Indians as governor of Hispaniola. Morison gives his readers the facts they need to form their own opinion of Columbus. (I do not share Morison's admiration for the man.)I must correct the astonishingly ignorant remarks of the reviewer who identified himself as &quot;A reader from New York City&quot; and entitled his review &quot;So much ignorance my God...&quot;Here goes:1) The reviewer asserted that Morison was not, in fact, an admiral. Actually, Morison did receive the title. FDR made Morison an honorary admiral when he commissioned the scholar to write the naval history of the US role in WWII. (Morison produced a 12-volume epic. It's still in print.)2) The reviewer regurgitates a number of questions about Columbus's origins that he apparently drew from another book by a revisionist historian (Kirkpatrick Sale?). The questions the reviewer repeats are good ones, but they are questions that remain open because the evidence to answer them conclusively probably does not exist. If the reviewer were a trained historian, he might understand that."},{"Title":"Admiral of the ocean sea: A life of Christopher Columbus (Franklin Library of Pulitzer Prize classics)","review":"\\"Admiral of the Ocean Sea\\", Samuel Morison's 1942 Pulitzer Prize winning biography of Christopher Columbus, is still considered by many to be the best there is. Morison spent 2 years on a sailboat re-tracing Columbus' voyages bringing a first hand immediacy and perspective that gives it unusual authority on all technical aspects of sailing and navigation. In addition Morison was a Harvard history professor whose research of the written record is impeccable. Even before Columbus died in the early 16th century, there have been countless controversies and debates about many aspects of his life and voyages. Into this maelstrom of legend, myth and folklore - like the discover he writes about - Morison brings order, calm and reliable passage for one of the most fascinating and mythological figures of World History."},{"Title":"Admiral of the ocean sea: A life of Christopher Columbus (Franklin Library of Pulitzer Prize classics)","review":"Morison's pulitzer prize winning work is an engaging, balanced, well written look at the life of the great explorer. The emphasis of the book is on Columbus, the mariner.(Morrison, a Harvard professor with a sailing background, actually retraced Columbus journeys in his own sailing craft). I was interested in finding a fair and objective historical biography of Columbus (without all the negative, politically correct, anti-European propoganda that permeates the thinking of modern leftist academics).In my opinion, this book provides it. I would highly recommend this work for students of history, who want to gain a better appreciation of the nature and significance of Columbus Voyages."},{"Title":"Admiral of the ocean sea: A life of Christopher Columbus (Franklin Library of Pulitzer Prize classics)","review":"Admiral of the Ocean Sea is a terrific effort by an outstanding naval historian. Morison's knowledge of the sea and his personal travels to the lands explored by Columbus add much to the interest generated by this book. Particularly interesting was the review of Columbus' role in history: Forgotton, sanctified, vilified, admired. A must read for anyone interested in one of the great explorers of all time"},{"Title":"Admiral of the ocean sea: A life of Christopher Columbus (Franklin Library of Pulitzer Prize classics)","review":"My quick summary of Morison's Columbus...Politician -- uselessAdministrator -- dismalNavigator and Seaman -- heroicI tried to tackle this book in chunks, which made it much longer to read. But it gave me the time to really read it.Morison set out to resail the Columbus voyages in 2 boats very similar in draft (if not tonnage) to what Columbus used. He pinpointed the bays, harbors, and landfalls as described in Columbus's journals (and the letters and journals of others who sailed with COlumbus), and as a result, the book is entirely credible on the sailing portions of the book. Morison's admiration for Columbus's feats of navigation seems boundless.There is quite a lot of sailing terminology to absorb throughout the book, and it takes time. Morison has included excellent maps for each Voyage, as well as coastline maps that illustrate very well what Columbus accomplished.The book makes clear that, while Columbus was a plain genius on the sea, in port was entirely another story. His attempts at administering New World colonies were disastrous (for natives and Spaniards, alike), and his efforts to win favor at Court first in Portugal and then in Spain were lame. Morison likens Columbus to the Biblical David trying to please Saul and always falling further into disfavor (p. 516).The beginning of the book (about Columbus's origins and early years) addresses controversies about the man that I didn't even know existed. Morison essentially pooh-poohs rumors about Columbus's origins, effectively pins his family down in Genoa for several generations, and explains how Columbus became an ocean-going man and chart-maker. The book is convincing that Columbus is who he is.Morison's style can be grating. At times, it was like having the M*A*S*H character Charles Emerson Winchester III read aloud some tedious part of his own diary. Bleah. You get the impression that Morison is one of those snobbish, ivory-tower academic elitists until you remember that this guy MADE THESE OCEAN CROSSINGS, which is not a wimpy undertaking. And then you read his perspective on America's coming war with the Axis powers (this book was done in 1939 and 1940), and it puts him in a more favorable light. For example, p. 493 has this (discussing the native Taino population of Hispaniola):\\"The fate of this gentle and almost defenseless people offers a terrible example to Americans who fancy they will be allowed to live in peace by people overseas who covet what they have.\\" [My note: if you are one of the people whose wealth is going to get \\"spread around\\" by new American policies, then this goes double for you.]And this gem, when discussing Columbus's mishandling of the rebellion of some of his own men:\\"The only way to handle tough fellows is to be a little tougher than they are.\\"This biography honors Columbus as a man of action, a heroic mariner, and an expert seaman. That is enough for me."},{"Title":"Admiral of the ocean sea: A life of Christopher Columbus (Franklin Library of Pulitzer Prize classics)","review":"This is a remarkable book about a remarkable man. Morison, the author, was a sailor as well as an outstanding historian and retraced as much as he could all of Columbus' movements even when he was on foot in Europe. These three qualities: salt-water sailor, outstanding historian and personal retracing blend together to give a perspective that is multi-dimensional and truly unique. Many times during the narrative Morison stops and states what another historian has said usually about some predicament Columbus found himself in at sea. Morison will then explain the context of the situation and compare it to what he experienced when he was in the same place in his voyage. Then he will say why what the other historian said is mistaken or taken out of context or is someway explained. Then he will say that the difference is that the former historian wrote without first hand knowledge of the sea, the ships and times.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Admiral of the ocean sea: A life of Christopher Columbus (Franklin Library of Pulitzer Prize classics)","review":"Well researched and written tome on Christopher Columbus. It is thorough to the point of excessive and gets to be slow a points but the information included is well presented. The obvious pro Columbus bias is present, but the reader understands this in advance and can adjust as necessary. The research done included the actual sailing of similar ships along the most possible route Columbus took. Another negative during this time is the nautical jargon used by the author which is hard to understand. Morison writes with the understanding that any reader interested in Columbus will identify with the technical verbiage, but he does attempt to simplify the terms without being condescending. Despite these minor bumps in the road, this book is well worth the time to understand Columbus and the rediscovery of America."},{"Title":"Admiral of the ocean sea: A life of Christopher Columbus (Franklin Library of Pulitzer Prize classics)","review":"How wrong I was about this book! When I initially paged through it, I thought it would be dry, boring and humorless. Instead, it was utterly fascinating, all 670 pages of my edition. Not to mention all the wonderful charts and maps. Down to the very last paragraph. Perhaps I could have wished for a tad less sailing data, as I am no mariner, and understood very little, but Morison himself actually sailed the four voyages that Columbus took (one in conjunction with Harvard University) and his obvious love of sailing shows on every page. Published in 1942, it won the Pultizer Prize for biography in 1943, deservedly so. And yet - while Columbus was without question one of the world's greatest navigators, all of his exploration was for gold, spices, a way to the Orient of Marco Polo, in other words, wealth, and not for the sheer joy of discovery. And the Spaniards' treatment of the Edenic Indians, for which Columbus was responsible, and certainly did his own share, was heartwrenching.

During chris's journey he says the turtles were so numerious that he feared running aground them while sailing. You could hear their shells clacking against each other. WowTurns out tho that Chis was a very cruel individual. Exterminating and enslaving the indigenous peoples. He also sold them into slavery to pay for his journeys. In fact his very first thoughts when he encountered these people was how good slaves they would make. Later he made the Indians pay him a tribute in gold (of which there was hardly any) or be killed. The crews of all the voyages did a lot of raping and stealing. They'd walk right into their huts and take whatever they wanted! But when three Indians took an item of clothing of one of the crew, one had his ears sliced off and the other two were beheaded. They were barbarians. No morals whatsoever. Nothing like putting your best foot forward.Chris btw was an extremely religious man. A devote Catholic. His favorite hangouts were monasteries. He even wore monks trappings while in between journeys.

Greedy Columbus himself was killing natives at the wholesale. After all, in his first journal the word &quot;gold&quot; is repeated countless times. Columbus was first the businessman, and then a superb mariner.Such abuses are polished by Morison, making the book unreliable source.Still, author uses good narration to explain life of Columbus, and sets in invironment. If you know nothing about Columbus, you may buy the book for its easy reading. If you are looking for fair and detailed bio, look further (John Boyd Thacher, &quot;Cristopher Columbus&quot;, 1903, is still the best source).Worthwile to note: this book comes also in 2 volume version, which, beside of more pictures, includes an extra chapter on origin of syphilis (Morison in general minimizes massive raping of women)."},{"Title":"Admiral of the ocean sea: A life of Christopher Columbus (Franklin Library of Pulitzer Prize classics)","review":"Morison inserts much of his own biases and opinions as to what might have happened where no first hand evidence is present. He tries to fill in the factual blanks with conjecture. The style is more one of writing for high school or undergraduate students, rather than investigative history, which is what this book is about. A big defect is the paucity of maps and illustrations to clarify the routes,geographical references, ships, and equipment. I would rate this as a poor second to Morison's treatment of John Paul Jones."},{"Title":"Admiral of the ocean sea: A life of Christopher Columbus (Franklin Library of Pulitzer Prize classics)","review":"While Morison does admit to the genocide of the Indians lead by Columbus and his henchmen, it idolizes him for the duration of the book. A brief admittance of guilt, for Morison, is a surefire way of allowing a much more bias, idealistic portrayal of a man with \\"questionable\\" character traits. Bartolome De Las Casas, a European minister who lived in the same time as Colombus, gives a much more realistcally bleek look at the Spanish invasion of the Americas. Because Morison's focus shifts so rapidly from the bad to the good, it loses major points for realism. The book reads more like a 3rd grade textbook; Morison would have us believe Santa Claus and the toothfairy exists along side a saintly Christopher Columbus."},{"Title":"Admiral of the ocean sea: A life of Christopher Columbus (Franklin Library of Pulitzer Prize classics)","review":"We have all heard it before: &quot;Don't believe everything you read.&quot;First of all, Mr. Morison is no Admiral!

In fact, his nearly absurd allegations only serve to perpetuate the myth that Columbus was Genoese when the man didn't even speak Italian for Christ sake!Because there is no evidence to support his fantastic allegations Mr. Morison decided that the most important thing to deal in this sci-fi book is for people to hear/read him speak/write. Anybody can be a great speaker when he is only limited by his own fantasies. Why doesn't &quot;The Admiral&quot; explain why his Columbus did not know a word of Italian? Why did the author decided to omit the fact that although his sailor left from Palos, Spain for the first voyage he returned to Lisbon and spent a week with king John before meeting with Ferdinand and Isabella?

I have been looking for a good African cookbook, but have not had much success. Therefore, it was a real treat to find this one.The author is from West Africa and I would venture to say that the recipes are focused on the cooking of her region. Although she does include some indentifiable dishes from other parts of Africa, it is not a comprehensive \\"all-Africa\\" cookbook, but I think that this is its strength, as it gives an in-depth view of one region.I was able to find what I needed for the recipes at the local supermarket - the most exotic ingredients were coconut milk and fresh ginger. The first recipe I tried was Lagba Lagba Chicken, a kind of sweet and sour lemon chicken cooked in coconut milk with lots of fresh ginger and bell peppers. It was just terrific, so fresh-tasting and different.I also tried Maama Lahun's Chicken in Kponwoh Plasas, a chicken stew flavored with mushrooms, tomatoes, and ginger, and chockful of vegetables - lima beans, okra, asparagus, and spinach. Like the Lagba Lagba Chicken, this dish was very easy to put together and the resulting dish unbelievably fresh and delicious.All of the recipes emphasize the use of fresh vegetables and although some deep-fried items are included, this is naturally healthy cooking. As the author urges people to experiment on their own, this is also very flexible cooking. I cut the hot peppers out of the Lagba Lagba Chicken so that my young sons would eat it, and everyone was happy. I substituted turnip greens for spinach in the Chicken in Kponwoh Plasas and the result was fine. The presentations and some of the garnishes suggested (such as spiced nuts or beans) seem original to this American cook.I learned some surprising things - for example, that mushrooms are used in West African cooking. The author's stories are heartfelt, finely told, and interesting, and add to the experience. I am really enjoying this book and am looking forward to the next dinner that comes out of it."},{"Title":"College Yiddish: An introduction to the Yiddish language and to Jewish life and culture","review":"As a self-taught student of the Yiddish language, I've sought out many Yiddish language text books. Uriel Weinreich's &quot;College Yiddish&quot; is by far the definitive book on the subject. All other first-year books pale in comparison. Each lesson is presented and structured in an extremely logical and coherent manner. The scope of &quot;College Yiddish&quot; covers the language so extensively that before you know it, you're able to read Yiddish books and newspapers without much effort. If you are a student of other foreign languages, you will be amazed at just how well this book was written. You'll wish that Uriel Weinreich had written books covering other languages as well.The Yiddish texts at the beginning of each chapter are intelligently written--not &quot;dumbed-down&quot; as most language books do. &quot;College Yiddish&quot; doesn't just cover grammar and vocabulary, it also includes the history of the language, Jewish culture in Europe, anti-Semitism, folklore, Zionism, creation of Israel, etc, all presented in a very appealing way.While studying from &quot;College Yiddish&quot;, I also recommend that you purchase Uriel Weinreich's &quot;Modern English-Yiddish Yiddish-English Dictionary&quot;. After your completion of &quot;College Yiddish&quot;, you should continue your studies with &quot;Yidish af Yidish&quot; by David Goldberg and &quot;Yiddish II: An Intermediate and Advanced Textbook&quot; by Mordkhe Schaechter, both of which continue from where &quot;College Yiddish&quot; left off.

The book consists of 30 graded lessons, each based on a text which covers some aspect of Jewish life, culture and history, and especially of the Jewish communities of central and eastern Europe for whom Yiddish was a bond.

Macdonald provides interesting characters, deft plotting, a fascinating picture of 19th cent Scotland, and useful moral reflection. If he was not of the very first rank of writers, he was not very far below it. There some respects in which I find Macdonald to be superior to other Victorian writers, for expample, his understanding of the responsibilities of rank, and his refusal to sentimentalize his women characters.Unfortunately, Phillips did not get the point. The original novel, to judge from the excellence of the half Phillips left us, was much more than a \\"Christian romance\\", it was a Christian work of art. Phillip's condescending assumption that Christians cannot read and respond to Christian literature as art, not just as tract, is unsufferable. Does he wish to spoon feed the Bible to us as well?

In his new book The Precautionary Principle: A Critical Appraisal of Environmental Risk Assessment, he makes a powerful case that many environmentalists have misapplied the plain language of the precautionary principle, a concept he argues was intended originally to be a general notion recommending that policymakers choose rules to produce net reductions in environmental and public-health risks. Instead, environmentalists have turned the precautionary principle into a regulatory nightmare, transforming precaution into something quite different.Goklany takes a novel tack, arguing that the attraction the precautionary principle holds for many in the general public is that its plain language indicates only a \\"look before you leap\\" sensibility that strikes people as intuitively reasonable. Read properly, the precautionary principle compels regulators to look, but then to let people leap when the evidence indicates that a technology will yield net benefits. In Goklany's interpretation, the precautionary principle insists that both the risks of adopting a new technology and the risks of technological stagnation be examined in regulatory decision making. According to him, genuine precaution is impossible without conducting some sort of risk-risk assessment. By pushing this view, he rejects many European environmentalists' claim that risk analysis is ineffective as a barometer of the environmental costs of economic activities.\\"-From \\"The Independent Review,\\" Fall 2002"},{"Title":"The Precautionary Principle: A Critical Appraisal","review":"Goklany's \\"Precautionary Principle\\" is a thoughtful examination of this political paradigm. In its basic form, the precautionary principle states that harmful actions should be prevented or halted, even if evidence of harm is incomplete. Although this ideal seems reasonable on its surface, it has resulted in a number of undesirable consequences that beg for a better solution. These negative consequences are so common and so expensive as to suggest that the principle itself is lacking or applied wrongly. I like to call it, \\"unprincipled precaution,\\" rather than precautionary principle, because its mindless application has been so destructive.Goklany rightly goes to the core of the problem: devotees of this \\"principle\\" typically see only Type 1 Errors and are blind to Type 2 Errors. Type 1 Errors are errors of commission. Type 2 Errors are errors of omission.This book covers many examples of regulatory actions taken under the rubric of the precautionary principle to avoid Type 1 Errors which led to Type 2 errors with equal or greater negative consequences.Goklany avoids preaching, but it is hard to escape the conclusion that many of the devotees of the precautionary principle are zealots with an ax to grind. Otherwise it is hard to understand their unwillingness to consider the effects Type 2 Errors that accompany they regulatory actions they seek.Instead of trashing the precautionary principle, Goklany proposes a more balanced approach to risk, in which both Type 1 and Type 2 Errors are considered and their effects are balanced in any given case. The application of his approach is discussed for several contemporary examples that give the book its substance.Any discussion of risk assessment and the precautionary principle shooed consider the merits of Goklany's arguments."},{"Title":"The Precautionary Principle: A Critical Appraisal","review":"Goklany's \\"Precautionary Principle\\" is a thoughtful examination of this political paradigm.

I like to call it, \\"unprincipled precaution,\\" rather than precautionary principle, because its mindless application has been so destructive.Goklany rightly goes to the core of the problem: devotees of this \\"principle\\" typically see only Type 1 Errors and are blind to Type 2 Errors. Type 1 Errors are errors of commission. Type 2 Errors are errors of omission.This book covers many examples of regulatory actions taken under the rubric of the precautionary principle to avoid Type 1 Errors which led to Type 2 errors with equal or greater negative consequences.Goklany avoids preaching, but it is hard to escape the conclusion that many of the devotees of the precautionary principle are zealots with an ax to grind. Otherwise it is hard to understand their unwillingness to consider the effects Type 2 Errors that accompany they regulatory actions they seek.Instead of trashing the precautionary principle, Goklany proposes a more balanced approach to risk, in which both Type 1 and Type 2 Errors are considered and their effects are balanced in any given case. The application of his approach is discussed for several contemporary examples that give the book its substance.Any discussion of risk assessment and the precautionary principle should consider the merits of Goklany's arguments."},{"Title":"The Precautionary Principle: A Critical Appraisal","review":"Environmental risk assessment has long been a part of international agreements and business controls: this provides a critical appraisal of the assessment process, showing that the current uses of the precautionary principle &quot;First, do no harm&quot; is flawed and ignores problems. Goklany creates a new framework for solving such problems and thus provides new food for thought."},{"Title":"The Precautionary Principle: A Critical Appraisal","review":"While it proports to be an unbiased analysis of precaution, before one reads this book, they need to know the books political perspective. The book is published by the Cato Institute which has a long history of anti-regulatory, anti-environmental positions. This book is no exception. Lake many other Cato Institute publications, the author takes selective pieces of information out of context to provide a less than true reality of the so-called abuse of precaution. To date, we have many very good examples of the health and economic impacts of not taking precaution based on early warnings - lead, asbestos, tobacco. I suggest readers chose an excellent European Union report called Late Lessons from Early Warnings which provides 14 case studies written by experts about how early warnings of damage were not headed. Goklany's case studies - which are noted for being examples of precaution taken too far are far from that. There is general consensus in the scientific community that climate change is happening and possibly resulting in impacts to health and ecosystems. We still do not know the potential range of impacts from genetic engineering - though there is no evidence that restrictions on genetic engineering have caused damage. Goklany presents precaution as a choice between often too bad options - either we have genetic engineering or people starve in the third world, while neglecting that any risk can be addressed through various options, for example integrated pest managment. For an examination of the anti-regulatory position on preventive, precautionary policies, this book is a good choice. For an objective view on environmental risks, it is not"},{"Title":"Dagger and the Cross, The","review":"Frankly, I don't understand how any of Judith Tarr's books can ever go out of print. I own everything of hers that I've been able to find, and I read them all on at least a yearly basis, sometimes even more frequently. The Dagger and The Cross continues the story of Aidan and Morgiana, who met in Alamut. Aidan is a prince from the West, and a Crusader; Morgiana is a Muslim, and a former Assassin. One of Ms. Tarr's most marvelous gifts is the ability to weave basic human conflicts into the fabric of history and fantasy, creating an incredible tapestry of wonder and truth. Aidan and Morgiana's problem, the difficulty of reconciling their enormously different belief systems and moral codes, despite their love for one another, lies at the heart of all relationships. This is historical fantasy par excellence; a book not to be missed."},{"Title":"Dagger and the Cross, The","review":"Judith Tarr transports the reader back to the time of the Crusader States, in a riveting tale of love, betrayal, and magic. Towering characterizations of historical figures such as the Muslim general Saladin, King Baldwin III, his sister Sybilla, her feckless husband Guy de Lusignan, all in a slightly alternate universe wherein the Jinni are real, with terrible power, and offset by Tolkien-like Elves on the side of the Crusaders. The interwoven history is real, and Ms Tarr will have the reader believing in the fantasy as well, before this novel is half read."},{"Title":"Dagger and the Cross, The","review":"I bought this book and Alamut when was in high school and lost them years ago.

The character is very much like the Writer in background, and if you missed Doolittle?s books you are in for a suprise. They really predate the Lehane, Burke Hiasson, Harlan Coben and Crais books, Very funny, ironic, Trageic but ultimately uplifting.The story centres on Bethany being hired to check up on the past of a US Senator, due to be enrolled as Secretary of State. The Repubulicans hire Tough Guy Tom Bethany to check out any skeleton?s in the Professors Closet, and the adventure gets vary hairy, and sureall. The climax is very disturbing, and not for the faint of heart.One of the best books I?ve read in a long time, cozy, but very shocking, as it lulls you into a false sense of security. Catches you on Page one, and then the squeeze is on. Thankfully back in print."},{"Title":"Body Scissors: A Tom Bethany Mystery","review":"Doolittle raps out hit after hit in the hard-boiled mystery category.

The professor's personal life is quite unremarkable except for the fact his wife is independently wealthy and his daughter was tragically murdered two years before. Emily Kellicott, age 26 and estranged from her family, was found strangled to death in a snowbank outside the low rent massage parlor in which she worked.Bethany proves to be a very appealing protagonist. A former Olympic class wrestler, Bethany is tough to be sure. A cynic's cynic, he chooses to live his life under the radar. But when it comes to investigating, he is as relentlessly thorough as can be. When his preliminary undercover work almost gets him murdered, Mr. Bethany realizes he has stumbled onto something big.This is a fantastic page turner of a book. The mystery of Emily's murder is a compelling one and Tom Bethany is one of the most interesting fictional crimesolvers to come down the literary pike in quite some time.Read Body Scissors. You will find it to be well written and very satisfying. An enthusiastic 5 stars."},{"Title":"Body Scissors: A Tom Bethany Mystery","review":"First time ever reviewing for Amazon, although I've bought plenty. Why bother?

Culicover's book came out by the end of the GB fashion when most people were attracted by Chomsky's new ideas of the minimalist program (MP). However, this book is not out of date at all, since Culicover illustrated the GB theory in a very critical way providing with quite a number of problems which cannot be solved at ease within the GB framework. All those problems are interesting issues that generative syntax has to manage. Though the author gave some suggestions, the issues remained open both to the GB framework and the MP followers. After reading this book, you may realize that the GB model is not as good as most people believe and that the burden of the MP will be heavier when it has to take over what left insolvable in the GB."},{"Title":"Principles and Parameters: An Introduction to Syntactic Theory (Oxford Textbooks in Linguistics)","review":"I have used this book, along with other similar sources, for writing a parametric grammar of Persian.The book is coherently organized into ten chapters: 1.Foundations Methods,Arguments,2.Government and Case, 3.Binding Theory,4.A-Movement,5.X'-Theory,6.A'-Movement,7.Barriers,8.LF Representation,9.Binding and Logical Form.10.Head Movement and Minimalism.Beginning with the second chapter the author picks up a syntactic problem and critically examines the solutions offered by linguists. For instance,in chapter four he concentrates on the analysis of the passive and its properties, namely, the movement of the underlying object into the surface subject position of the sentense in terms of a lexical analysis, a movement hypothesis and a chain relationship.Moreover, at the end of each chapter there are ample exercises from varius languages ( except Persian, of course) for readers / students to ponder over. Crucially,readers/students can familiarize themselves with current linguistic as well as syntactic issues and their proposed solutions. Nevertheless, the book suffers from a couple of drawbacks concerning the ultimate plausible solution for each problem and , more significantly, the definition of principles and parameters as a theoretical foundation / approach selected by the author,as the title suggests.I consider the latter a critical issue because there seems to be a fair degree of concensus among researchers concerning the principles which describe univerasl properties of grammatical operations or structures.However, differences of opinions arise regarding the parameters and the components of the language in which they have to be found. According to Chomsy, parameters are associated with the principles of Universal Grammar.Other linguists attribute them to the inflectional system of the language, the fuctional categories or lexical categories in general.From this book one cannot understand the author's position on the theory of parametrisation."},{"Title":"ASVAB for Dummies","review":"I just bought this book 5 days ago.

The book is pretty simple, it doesn't go into deep depth of each subject, but it covers the basics. The majority of the questions on the asvab weren't even close to the sample questions in the book, but what the book allowed me to do was sharpen my skills, and helped me to begin thinking more critically, and learning how to make better predicted guesses on the asvab. All of my line scores increased, and my General line score increased by 20 points. This book is excellent for someone looking to increase there line scores in weaker areas, (for me I increased my mechanical line score by 14 points).

Right off the bat, they tell you to guess on answers b/c there is no penalty...WRONG! That's how it worked for the paper/pencil version, however, the computer version is an adaptive test meaning if you guess and get it wrong, you get an easier question next which is worth less points, meaning your maximum possible score just went DOWN. You have to try your best on each and every question, but the successive question(s) and your possible points you can earn depends on it!So, aside from the entire premise of the book being totally wrong and misleading, the information a future recruit needs to know is all jumbled and disconnected without adequate explanations or lessons. I guess it's supposed to make it \\"easier\\", but the book is basically written entirely in some cutesy way with random symbols and bubbles of info everywhere...it's distracting and disorganized, not \\"fun\\" or \\"easy\\". The important information the reader needs to know to succeed on the test is often glossed over with no information on how to practice or improve, but random \\"tips\\" are scattered throughout that don't really provide anything useful to the reader.There are pages and pages of charts for MOS's (military occupational specialty)...like a soon-to-be recruit knows how to read that! That information is not even on the test and their recruiter is there to help them with that. There is absolutely zero reason for that detailed and confusing chart to be in this book. Even if a recruit figured out how to decipher the charts, they wouldn't (and have no reason to) know what any of it means."},{"Title":"ASVAB for Dummies","review":"Thanks to this book I was able to get a score of 96 on the ASVAB. I'm not sure how much of that score it due to this book but I know it sure helped a lot.I purchased this book at a local book store (to bad they went out of business) and used it to mainly touch up on my math skills that I haven't used for years.If you're looking to increase you're word knowledge and reading comprehension this book will help you some but you will be better off just finding some books YOU find interesting and reading them and looking up any words you don't know.This book will mainly help familiarize you with the test (you will most likely be taking the CAT-ASVAB so take the tests on the cd) and anything you have difficulty with just keep going over until you are comfortable. For me I did a whole bunch of mathematical reasoning problems. Your recruiter will be happy to give you a little extra time to study if you ask them.Good luck and don't stress over it."},{"Title":"ASVAB for Dummies","review":"The information and the tips were very hepfull.The test parts and the answers give an almost test scenario.Thank you very much."},{"Title":"ASVAB for Dummies","review":"My husband said this book was excellent, its really helping him study for the ASVAB, he hasnt taken it yet so we dont know what his score will be but he studies everyday using this book."},{"Title":"ASVAB for Dummies","review":"This ASVAB Book is very detailed and really goes into everything you would like to know for the test."},{"Title":"ASVAB for Dummies","review":"This book was recommended by a Navy recruited when attending our high school.

The material that the ASVAB covers is often dry and boring (honestly), but this book makes it an easy read that doesn't put you to sleep.I used this book as a study aide 1 week before the test, and got a very high score. I'm not saying that using this book will guarantee you a High Score but I'm confident that it will help boost your score.The fact is; the test material isn't hard but taking the test on things you haven't thought about for a while can be tricky. This book does three things for you:1. Makes the material a bit more interesting2. Jogs your memory3. Familiarizes you with the style and timing of the test sections.The 3rd one is the most important.As if you couldn't guess, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"ASVAB for Dummies","review":"I am sorely disappointed by this book.I don't know what the other reviewer was doing when he actually read through this book but I found countless, and I mean a SUBSTANTIAL number, of incorrect answers in this books prep tests. The amount of factual errors, typos and flat out incorrect information contained in this book makes me wonder if it really was written by a \\"Dummie\\". On top of this everything contained inside the book is stuff you would have learned in the first year of high school if you paid any attention what so ever to your classes.To top this off and prove how serious I am about informing you guys/gals not to even contemplate putting your money forth to purchase this book -- I made an account on Amazon.com solely so I could express my distress at this poorly written piece of literature."},{"Title":"ASVAB for Dummies","review":"Yes, I know there are errors in the book. Yes, it could use additional editing. Just be aware of those things; I think the benefits are still there. It provides a great quick review. I have been out of school a few years, so the review of material was beneficial. When I took the practice test in the recruiter's office I got a 77. Not too shabby, but you do have to think, this score means a great deal for career choices. I studied for a couple weeks and when I took the actual ASVAB I got a 99."},{"Title":"ASVAB for Dummies","review":"I just took the ASVAB last week. I scored an AFQT percentile score of 90. I'm currently going Air Force and the scores were:M 73 did not study for it at all, hardly gave any effort and still scored 73A 91 my recruiter said that this part is always easyG 88 The book helps a great dealE 81 The book helps a great deal too except the electronics sub testSo here are my recommendations concerning those going Air Force. Study this book if you need high scores in the AFQT, general, and electronics. I would supplement this book with the online tests on [...] and a specific book concerning electronics. Hardly any of the electronics material from the book was on the test, so you may have to buy a Electronics for Dummies. Take all 3 of the full tests on [...]. That's it! You will need nothing else except 7-8 hours sleep, a hardy breakfast, some coffee, and self confidence. Remember, you are being scored on how well you do against your competition. Most of the tests were only 16 questions and you will have ample time to answer. Just stay calm and be confident. Make sure to have a small snack, like an oatmeal bar, and use the restroom before going to take the test. It is a freakin' cake walk!Oh, and one more thing some of the military people there are rude. You think they would have some decent manners."},{"Title":"ASVAB for Dummies","review":"If you read a &quot;Dummies&quot; book before then you know the format. The first part of the book is divided into lessons, then there are three sample tests in the back.I thought the lessons were good, but not great compared to some of the other ASVAB books out there. The book did a great job of telling you upcoming changes to the ASVAB as advertised.What really turned me off from this book was when I was doing the sample tests and there were a couple answers that were clearly wrong. For instance, the question for General Science was what Chromosomes does a female have. The answers in the back said &quot;XY&quot; while it should have been &quot;XX&quot;. This was just one of a few I found.While the style remains the same as most dummies books, I cant recommend this to anyone based on the errors in the sample tests. If you dont plan on doing sample tests then this book might be for you."},{"Title":"ASVAB for Dummies","review":"This book was extremely helpful in more ways then one. First off let me start out by saying I scored a 41 on the pretest, but ended up with a 70 on the real deal because of this book. It will help you out with not just what's on the test, but also helpful hints along the way. Test advice. What scores you will need for certain jobs. It also comes with a cd because 9/10 you will take the comp version of the test. It also has a page on what to do for test day itself to also help smooth things out. Really worth the money and amazon got it to me fast. Remember don't put off something this important. I went into the Army as a Cav scout, but getting such a good score opened up a whole world or other jobs for me. Good luck on your test and buy this book!"},{"Title":"ASVAB for Dummies","review":"I bought this book after visiting the author's extensive military web site on About.comASVAB for Dummies is Great! It's not just a collection of practice tests (although there are three complete practice tests included). The authors go into great detail with tips and techniques about improving your scores in any of the ASVAB areas, and even tell you which scores relate to which military jobs, so that you can concentrate on improving the test areas that are important to the military job you're interested in.Included is a complete list of military enlisted jobs, and the ASVAB scores required to qualify for those jobs.Just like any book in the &quot;Dummies&quot; series, it's written in a fun, humorous style that keeps your interest.I'm taking the ASVAB test in two weeks, and I feel much more prepared."},{"Title":"ASVAB for Dummies","review":"This book was wonderful. My son needed it to improve his ASVAB score and it worked really well for us. He did score higher, a lot higher than his orginal score and we were both please with the results.

You will reap the benefits if you read and study the book."},{"Title":"ASVAB for Dummies","review":"This helped me get my math skills up, it was the only thing I was slacking in on the ASVAB. I went from a 27 to a 49. I highly recommend this if you need help on the math because it sure as hell helped me and I'm sure if you put in at least 30 mins a night studying from this book, you will be able to get a good score on the ASVAB. Don't try and memorize anything you see in the book unless it's some sort of vocabulary because none of it was on the ASVAB, just review how you'd solve a certain problem because they're quite similar to the ones on the actual ASVAB."},{"Title":"ASVAB for Dummies","review":"I studied my butt off with the help of this book.

An important part of that is the ASVAB as it determines what jobs you will qualify for in the military. I have a 4 year college degree but I found this book to be a very helpful study guide. Especially the math portion as I have not had to solve for x in 8 years! This book was also helpful in brushing up on vocabulary words and science information. When the day came to take my ASVAB I scored a 95 on my AFQT and 131 with my combination line score. I greatly credit this book for my success on the test but like anything it is what you put into studying. I studied several hours a day for two to three weeks prior to my test. Good luck!"},{"Title":"ASVAB for Dummies","review":"Our youngest son took an initial ASVAB test to go into the Army. Since it had been 20+ years since I had taken the test, I figured the book couldn't hurt. After going through the book, he raised his initial score by over 30 points. What many going into service don't understand is that the higher the ASVAB Score, the more opportunities you get, the larger bonuses you can get, the better choices you can make for your own future. Made a believer out of me and would recommend this for anyone preparing to take the ASVAB to go into the military."},{"Title":"ASVAB for Dummies","review":"I studied for the ASVAB for two week straight using the ASVAB for Dummies book. Since I was enlisting in the Air Force, and I wanted to get into RF Systems or Cyber Transport support, I needed a hella high score in science, math, and electronics. I read every section, but I focused on the math, science, and electronics sections. I felt that the practice tests were harder than the questions on the actual ASVAB at MEPS. This was cool, because I felt like I could answer most of the ASVAB questions okay. The ASVAB I took at MEPS was on a computer, so it was easier than doing the ASVAB on paper. Some of my friends didn't study for the ASVAB, so they were feeling kinda depressed after the test. After the ASVAB, I was exhausted, because it took me four hours.

This book helped me to get a great score on my ASVAB (AFQT 99, M 99, A 99, G 99, E 94). Granted, I have always been exceptionally good at standardized testing, but there was so much I didn't know before taking this test that the book taught me. The Auto and Shop and Electronics sections were especially helpful. There were many similarly themed questions from the book questions on the ASVAB I took. Even the General Science section was helpful (there was a question about Titan, the moon of Jupiter, the answer to which I would have gotten wrong without the book) and I used to be a chemistry major!I read the entirety of the sections of the book the whole week before taking my test and took one of the practice tests, so it is ideal for cramming. I wish I had time to take all 3 tests. I feel like I would have done even better. Some of the other reviewers said these tests were online, but, honestly, I process information much more effectively on paper than on a computer screen, so I didn't mind dropping the $14 for peace of mind. Ironically, my ASVAB was computerized, but this book still made retaining the information I learned much easier. Ultimately, this book will help you out immensely if you work hard with it.

Vocab was the least of my concerns until I saw the words in the practice exams in THIS book as opposed to the ARCO one, and luckily, I saw some of the same words on the actual ASVAB.

I was talked to by staff sgt riley. I took the test and scored a 70 he told me to get this book study it for a while, come back and retake the test. I did and now i got a 92!! I was very excited!

I desided to join the Coast Guard and wanted to make sure I would get a good score on the ASVAB so I picked up the ASVAB for Dummies. I took the ASVAB test in high school and dont exactly remember my score, but i do remember it being low thirties. I studied this book from front to back at least twice through and three times through on the sections that I was weak on. Yes, the test in the book have plenty of errors, but if you can recognize the errors then you should be smart enough to pass the ASVAB. If you dont notice the errors in the book then you are probably not ready for the ASVAB and should probably find another book. At 26 years old I took the ASVAB and scored a 92. Side story though I passed the book onto my friend that was scoring about a 30 on his ASVAB so I thought the book might help and his score actually went down. Good luck to anyone that does attempt the ASVAB and if you do decide to go military good luck and thanks for you service. When in doubt C out."},{"Title":"ASVAB for Dummies","review":"I bought this book n a whim hoping it would raise my chance to pass the the ASVAB.

You need to already have good math skills because the math, science, electronics, and physics portions of this book are FILLED with basic, arithmetic errors (elementary school level addition and subtraction and middle school level factoring). Don't expect to learn anything from this book. If you need to brush up on math for the ASVAB, I would suggest a different publisher."},{"Title":"ASVAB for Dummies","review":"The cutesy little jokes and wisecracks can't hide the fact that there are many errors in the tests and in the review sections.

I read it in only a couple minutes. It is bittersweet and touching, not a &#34;happy ending&#34; story, but worthwhile reading."},{"Title":"Rab and his friends,","review":"Twain, Mrs. Clemens and John Brown were dear friends. Twain speaks of him constantly in his autobiography. I bought this story - it is much too brief to call it a book - on his recommendation. The story of Allie's surgery is amazing. Her courage, as depicted, at undergoing such an ordeal is awe-inspiring. His description of the wild young men of his youth is generously and wisely written. The whole tale may take you only twenty minutes to read, but Allie and John Brown will make an impreession, for sure."},{"Title":"Rab and his friends,","review":"Book delivered in high quality, received within a few days of placing the order. Excellent service."},{"Title":"Staying Alive: Real Poems for Unreal Times","review":"First, despite the strange title and the morose cover art, please buy this book. It has been a long time since I've had so many strangers ask me what I was reading with such concern in their voices -- the last time was when I was reading How We Die. Perhaps the publishers should have considered some modifications when releasing the book in the US. This is a very good anthology of contemporary (early 20th century to the right-now present) poetry. I have been delighted to discover many poems that have struck me as memorable from poetry readings and programs such as Poetry Daily and The Writer's Almanac under one cover. And I like the way the poems are grouped by theme, then paired by image within the thematic groups. This is sustained over 450-odd pages, which makes the book a very rich meal indeed. I'm assuming, from the essay at the end \\"The Sound of Poetry\\" and the following Glossary of poetical terms, that this is intended to supplant some Norton Anthology like thing in the first year college curriculum. The glossary, incidentally, is fun to read as a sort of second essay, since it refers back to the contents of the book for its authority."},{"Title":"Staying Alive: Real Poems for Unreal Times","review":"Of course I'm prejudiced toward this book, since it includes some of my favorite poems: Billy Collins' &quot;Forgetfulness,&quot; &quot;The Dead,&quot; and &quot;Undressing Emily Dickinson&quot; for starters. The collection moves on to introduce work that is now on the must -read -to -friends list: &quot;Lady of Miracles&quot; by Nina Cassian, &quot;Muse&quot; by Jo Shapcott and&quot;In My Country&quot; by Jackie Kay. 500 poems to chose from, each section generously edited for reading pleasure so the book itself has its own rhythm. A great gift for graduation, Mother's Day, a romantic moment, or for your father who introduced you to reading in the first place."},{"Title":"Staying Alive: Real Poems for Unreal Times","review":"&quot;Staying Alive&quot; offers a wonderful anthology of moving poems that inspire. It is a perfect introduction for those not familiar with contemporary poetry, not willing to invest in dozens of author centered books to find some jewels, yet still wanting to hear fresh vibrancy in our language. Many of the poems are real beauties, and I think Neil Astley has done a wonderful job as editor. It is divided into thematic sections, and has breif commentaries on many of the poems, and a useful glossary as well. It may not be for poetry scholars, but it is not intended for them. It is intended for the common masses, and for us I have seen none its equal. It has shown me that there is much value in modern poetry, and it has given me already many inner smiles. It would make a perfect gift for the poetically inclined in your family- I know I will send one soon."},{"Title":"Staying Alive: Real Poems for Unreal Times","review":"I'd consider myself a pretty avid poetry enthusiast: read poetry journals, grew up with poetry, have several beloved poets whose work I know in its entirety. I've never found a better poetry collection than this one. Neil Astley includes the poets you know from English class and want to see (Frost, Auden, Ginsberg) and then hundreds of others that even serious readers of poetry might not know.The sections are great: \\"My People\\" and \\"In and Out of Love\\" are two that I turn to the most frequently and am always enlightened, edified, and delighted by. There are 500 great poems in this book. It has been a comfort to me. I can't recommend it highly enough."},{"Title":"Staying Alive: Real Poems for Unreal Times","review":"These may not be the particular poems another anthology would include, because the aim of this book is not to be a Poetry 101 primer, but to collect the types of poems that punch you in the gut. Pick one at random and it will hit a nerve. One of the single best anthologies I have ever purchased, it's a keeper."},{"Title":"Staying Alive: Real Poems for Unreal Times","review":"It's a collection of poems. It's a GREAT collection of poems. Probably one of the best. It can be likened to the Chicken Soup for the Soul series, but I think packs more punch. It touches every aspect of life and no one is exempt. A must read!"},{"Title":"Staying Alive: Real Poems for Unreal Times","review":"So many anthologies seem to have something stilted, or overly academic, or author-centric about them. This one shares only a sense of urgency in its topics and the poems themselves. A gorgeous collection; I've loved what I've read. The epigraph by Kafka is powerful and describes the book perfectly: \\"One should only read books which bite and sting one. If the book we are reading does not wake us up with a blow to the head, what is the point in reading? A book must be the axe which smashes the frozen sea within us.\\""},{"Title":"Staying Alive: Real Poems for Unreal Times","review":"It truly hits right where you never wanted anything to hit. The poems make you think about exactly why you live and what makes you keep going. It doesn't settle for anything less than making you really think deeply about yourself. I gave it five stars because this book is truly one that everyone should buy... or at least read."},{"Title":"Staying Alive: Real Poems for Unreal Times","review":"I don't usually like poems or anthologies however, Staying Alive was one of the best books I've read. Whenever i'm sad or desperate I read poems. When I was reading this book I would have some challenging times. When I have challenging times, I usually just stick my head in a book. This is one of the books I'd just stick my head into. Staying alive shows the point of poetry. It's an easy book to read for teens and up. Usually poem and anthology books are really hard to read and take a long time to read but it's so good you just go through it so fast. I picked a 5/5, it's an amazing book for anyone who is not having the best time."},{"Title":"Staying Alive: Real Poems for Unreal Times","review":"I purchased this anthology a year ago for my own pleasure and read it cover-to-cover with much enjoyment. If you like contemporary poetry, this is the place to find one of the best assortments of chiefly American and British work. There are also some excellent translations of Pablo Neruda and contemporary European poets. The editor, Neil Astley,has organized the collection around themes. He's found poems that speak to each other in interesting ways. For example, Louise Gluck's \\"Mirror Image\\" is followed by Sylvia Plath's \\"Mirror.\\" You will find yourself tuning into the conversation among the poems. I liked the book so much I'm using it this fall in a course I'm teaching."},{"Title":"Staying Alive: Real Poems for Unreal Times","review":"Although there are good poems in here, and good authors, Astley is intent on dumbing down poetry - this book aims for the lowest common denominator possible, and then digs deeper. Astley's commentary and rants are opinionated and condescending. Poetry is far more alive and interesting than than this anthology suggests."},{"Title":"Atlas of Communism","review":"A dramatic new perspective on the global legacy of Communism.Authoritative text by a team of eminent international historians.Illustrated with 48 specially commissioned full-color maps and over 200 photographs.Includes eye-catching special features, such as eye-witness accounts, pen-portraits of the leading personalities and examples of art and literature."},{"Title":"John Keble A Biography","review":"One of the great mysteries and oversights of history is why an adequate modern biography of John Keble remains unwritten. It seems a tragedy to me (since I studied Keble for 3 years for my Ph.D. in Religious Studies) that the best biography of Keble is still the first one, written in 1869 by J.T. Coleridge, 3 years after Keble's death. The most recent biography of Keble is Georgina Battiscombe's \\"John Keble: A Study in Limitations\\" (1963). But what kind of biographer subtitles the biography of her subject: \\"A Study in Limitations\\"?! That all men have limitations is self-evident. The irony is that the nearly unanimous consensus of Keble's peers and contemporaries was that he was a modern-day saint. It is astounding that the most recent biography of a man of Keble's stature is now almost 50 years old. What's even more baffling and disappointing is that no one has bothered to edit Keble's letters.Lock's biography was originally printed in 1893 and was the second biography of Keble to be published. It's a shorter work than Coleridge's (238 pages in the original edition compared to Coleridge's 568) and therefore less thorough. On the other hand, as the warden of Keble College, Lock had access to much of Keble's unpublished correspondence and was able to speak with personal friends of Keble. His work is therefore original, even though it's not as close to the source as Coleridge's.While Lock's biography is not as complete as Coleridge's, his is still a good and useful biography of Keble. Lock frames Keble's life in terms of the major events of his life (whereas Coleridge offers a more continuous and undifferentiated biography). These key events include:\\"Preparation for the Work of Life\\", 1792-1832\\"The Professor of Poetry\\"\\"The Christian Year\\"\\"The Struggle, 1833-1841\\"\\"The Struggle, 1841-1845\\"\\"Lyra Innocentium\\"\\"Recovery\\", 1846-1860\\"The End\\", 1860-1866\\"The Preacher\\"\\"The Spiritual Adviser\\"\\"Characteristics and Influence\\"Lock clearly defines his topics concerning Keble's life, and his organization makes his biography a good one for getting an overall feel for the life and ministry of Keble. He is especially helpful in clearly presenting Keble's loving and remarkable ministry as a priest, spiritual advisor, and pastor. He also pays special attention to Keble's greatest legacy, his 1827 volume of poetry titled \\"The Christian Year,\\" which had an incredible influence on the Church of England in the 19th century. One of Lock's appendices lists the poems of \\"The Christian Year\\" and the dates of their composition, which is especially helpful to students of \\"The Christian Year.\\"Overall, Lock's is a good biography of a major and compelling 19th century figure, and I'm grateful that it has now been republished."},{"Title":"You're Late Again, Lord!

It won't solve your problems for you but will help you how to figure out how to solve them for yourself, with divine guidance.

Do you pout, complain and throw yourself a pity party? Maybe you try plan after plan only to see each one fail?Karon proposes the idea of waiting &quot;purposely&quot;. During our wait it is not God's desire for us to suffer needlessly, but to draw closer to Him. Karon humoruously shares her personal experiences as she learns how to wait purposely.

A MUST HAVE!!!"},{"Title":"Great and Terrible Quest","review":"Why this book has never been re-printed, I'll never know.Lovett has written a flawless tale of adventure soaked in mystery, but without resorting to the magic and wizardy that normally leaves a person unable to identify with the characters.The story is about a young boy named Trad, his (evil) taskmaster of a guardian, and the burning desire to find out where he truly belongs. It begins when he finds an old, wounded soldier while out one afternoon. Badly injured and without memory, Trad joins him in a quest to find out who they both really are. Who the soldier turns out to be and how, ultimately, he is connected to Trad makes for a story that is both deep and original, avoiding all of the jaded plots of its genre.A very serious story for the age group it deals with, it proves that a good childrens book can hold its own without having to be sophpomoric. Mature themes (duty, honor, friendship) are presented in a digestable format that give the book far more meaning and substance than its candy-coated counterparts.If you have a maturing child at home, or are a child at heart, pick the book up. While difficult to find, if you can get a copy for under $20, its well worth the money."},{"Title":"The Seasons of Rome: A Journal","review":"The author prefaces his diary of day-to-day life in Rome with the comment that some of his journalist friends wished that they lived in Rome. It struck me that his object then was to show that Rome was really just a dull, hodunk kind of town, not really worth pining for, and that the romantic perceptions of the tourist were all in their heads. (which is probably true)So perhaps for this it is useful for those of us tourists who thought it would be nice to live in Rome. This book seems to say we are just as well off staying in whatever dull place we already inhabit.The selections from the reviews overstate his writing. The writing most often reminded me of the musings of a columnist in some small town paper (it's definitely journalistic prose). His ability to express complexities seems limited. Lots of exclamation points in the first half of the book! (He tends to be bemused by certain aspects of life in Rome, but often resorts to expressing this bemusement with exclamation points.) At worst it struck me as pedestrian and irritatingly banal (but perhaps this is because he chose to write of the banal aspects of life in Rome).The book is generally very topical, that is, current as of the late '90s. Some recurring content are reports on the pope's health and the days of Mussolini. The latter I found interesting, the former I did not. He also discusses the Etruscans here and there in a way that is insightful and knowledgeable.On the whole, the book has a nice, low-key, meandering style, which I found readable and pleasant enough to finish. However, I don't think the author put a great deal of effort or thought into its content and design--it just follows the calendar year, like a diary.I compare Hoffman's travel writing to that of Mathew Spender's Within Tuscany, which is lighter, richer, with more content, and which shows a remarkable facility with English that Hoffman's prose lacks."},{"Title":"The Seasons of Rome: A Journal","review":"As usual, before a trip to other country, I searched for a book that would give me a feel for the cities I visit, rather than a tour guide. This book excelled in this task and made my visit to Rome even fuller and more enjoyable. If you are looking for a book about Rome, its people, their habbits and a little glimpse into their rich history, this book is a rare find. The pace is calm, the subjects are simple, but the experience is great."},{"Title":"The Seasons of Rome: A Journal","review":"This is old-school journalism at its best. Hofmann takes the year as it comes, and, journal style, writes a few sketches every month. Having lived in Rome for thirty years, he knows a lot about it, and he draws on his wealth of information, memory, impressions, and connections to give vivid pictures of the holidays that roll around or reflections prompted by chance events. His range is delightful -- from the pope to Vespa-riding robbers, from diplomats to gypsies, from horse shows to opera, from the mafia to the gattare [stray cat feeders]. If he needs statistics, he knows how to get them and unobtrusively adds them. He is not coy about using addresses, so I read with a map. I knew little about Rome when I began this book, but by the end I felt I knew where things were, what the flavor of the city is. It's not a travel guide, it's deep background for a visit."},{"Title":"The Seasons of Rome: A Journal","review":"Paul Hofmann writes about his hometown the way any native would, with equal parts admiration and frustration. Sure, he describes the great trattorie, touches on the sordid histories of Rome's luxury hotels, and is continually mesmerized by the city's ancient ruins. But, anecdotes about such topics as the irregularity of the postman's visits, motorino pollution, municipal strikes, and lousy restaurant service, make the book come alive. Thank god this isn't another tired, old, tourist piece about how great it is to live abroad (&quot;A Year in Provence,&quot; anyone?) Hofmann's grouping of chapters by month is also innovative and helpful to travelers who want to know what goes on in the city the REST of the year. The book tends to be a bit dull in some places, owing probably to the fact that Hofmann wrote this book in his 70s or 80s. He knows little about hip, modern Rome. Nevertheless, his &quot;diary&quot; makes for a good read and a good history lesson."},{"Title":"The Seasons of Rome: A Journal","review":"The word \\"journal\\" is part of this book's title, and it doesn't pretend to be anything else. After all, Paul Hoffman is a journalist. I've had the great good fortune to visit the Eternal City a few times, and reading Seasons is like taking another stroll along back streets and famous venues. It brought back happy memories and also reminders that Rome is a huge, noisy metropolis that is difficult to traverse. Hoffman also highlights that fact that Rome is populated by, well, Romans, as well as millions of other Italians, and conveys a sense of what it is like to live an ordinary life in an extraordinary place. The city described by this author is modern and genuine, and Hoffman's essays are devoid of the self-congratulatory tone of many other travel writers. This book is real."},{"Title":"Debbie My Life Debbie Reynolds (large print)","review":"I have to start by saying that I cannot possibly give an impartial review of this book.Having loved Debbie Reynolds ever since seeing her on the big screen in \\"Singin' In the Rain;\\" obsessively following her like papparazzi; and finally meeting her in person and having her sign my hard copy of this book....well what can I say??I LOVE HER!But, back to the book.It's an honest portrayal of her life from her viewpoint. That says a lot, since her viewpoint was from the inside of the last great Hollywood Studio. It's also a testament to how far women have come in the US. If Debbie Reynolds had been born in 1970, she'd never have trusted those men who stole her money and forced her into bankruptcy. Then again, the suffering made her strong self.I wish she would write a sequel."},{"Title":"Tale of Mrs. William Heelis - Beatrix Potter","review":"Anyone who wants to know a little bit more about Beatrix Potter, the person, will be pleased with this book. Through real-life annecdotes John Heelis conveys what should be obvious but isn't - Beatrix Potter was not a perfect human being, she had tiny flaws just like the rest of us. Sometimes she got cranky, occasionally she was absent-minded with her head in the clouds but mostly she was wonderful - although quite strong willed and opinionated.Those who are fascinated by Beatrix Potter will find the little book a great addition to their library. However, be forewarned - those who are buying this book for a voyeristic look into the intimate details of Beatrix Potter's married life will be sorely disappointed. This very private woman's private life remains private."},{"Title":"Tale of Mrs. William Heelis - Beatrix Potter","review":"This is more a Heelis family history than a bio of Beatrix Potter. There are occasional mentions of Ms. Potter (or as she preferred to be called, Mrs. Heelis) but it does give you a relative's view of the well-known author. I enjoy family histories so I found it to be an interesting little book but if you're looking for a straight biography this may disappoint."},{"Title":"Tale of Mrs. William Heelis - Beatrix Potter","review":"I wanted to read more about Beatrix Potter.

Barbie shares scripture and relevant teaching that has had an impact on her life and now through reading this book has impacted my life also."},{"Title":"The diary of a madman","review":"Nikolai Gogol had an extraordinarily important influence on Russian literature. A contemporary and friend of Pushkin, he left his mark in several areas, as playwright, novelist and short-story writer. Every Russian writer to come after him acknowledges and reveres Gogol, from Dostoevsky to Bulgakov and on. This collection is a great introduction to Gogol. All of his most famous stories are included. &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot; shows us the disintegrating psyche of a minor civil servant during the era of the repressive rule of Nicholas I. Gogol had problems with Nicholas' censors (who were as vigilant as Stalin's) and he didn't exactly ingratiate himself with this depiction of bureaucratic malaise. The second short-story in the volume, &quot;The Nose,&quot; again pokes fun at officialdom, but also takes us on a proto-magical-realism ride through mid-eighteenth century St. Petersburg (As an aside, you can currently take St. Petersburg tours of Gogol's fictional landscape, just as you can Dostoevsky's, [and Bulgakov's Moscow]). The third entry in the collection, &quot;The Overcoat,&quot; deals again with an inconsequential bureaucrat (guess what Gogol's background was?) , whose entire existence is wrapped around a new overcoat. Suffice it to say that the story does not end happily for poor Akaky Akakievich. This is in some ways Gogol's signature piece. The story basically involves us in a humorous, at times capricious narrative, but the humor is infused with a great deal of pathos, to the point where we can almost call these tragicomedies.The longest story in the collection, &quot;How Ivan Ivanovich quarreled with Ivan Nikiforovich,&quot; is a case-in-point. On the surface, it is a humorous account of two provincial boobs engaged in protracted enmity as a result of an inconsequential incident. However, at heart, Gogol is saying a great deal about Russian society, and the human condition, at the same time, and the picture is neither pretty nor funny. This is his most successful short story in many respects, imbued with wisdom and local color. Gogol is the most human and humane of Russian authors, but that does not mean that he is anywhere near the greatest, as a result. It would be left to the giants, Tolstoy and Dostoevsky, to truly establish Russia as a birthplace of great writers. But it is to this warmth of spirit that the Russian people and its literati have responded to so fervently for so many years. Gogol, of course, is well represented as a novelist for Dead Souls (or Chichikov's Journeys). He also attempted a Russian epic (Taras Bulba). For most modern readers, however, the stories are the most accessible and the most universally revered as regards his literary output. Give this volume a chance, and if you like the stories, turn your attention to Dead Souls, which is indeed worth reading."},{"Title":"The diary of a madman","review":"I only became familiar with Gogol through references in the work of Philip Roth. After all, great writers should give their due to their predecessors. Five of Gogol's most celebrated short stories are included in this collection. While I can only classify myself as a fan of three of these stories, this collection is still worth purchasing.\\"The Diary of a Madman\\" harkens Kafka-esque images of man versus isolation and the bureaucracy in the story of one man's sometimes humorous spiral into madness. Scorned in love and work, the main character retreats into an alternate reality. \\"The Nose\\", the story of a runaway body part, possesses elements of Kafka's \\"Metamorphisis\\". A fiction that borders on absurdity can still be frightening. It brings to mind that the superficial image one presents in society is too important. \\"The Overcoat\\", having themes of superficiality and prized possessions, is a peculiar tale. Taunted by his co-workers for the condition of his overcoat, the main character makes many sacrifices to replace his coat. To a point, the new overcoat becomes more of an obsession than it should.While \\"The Carriage\\" and \\"Taras Bulba\\" are also included in the set, I do not believe they carry the same feeling as the other stories. To a degree, \\"Taras Bubla\\" almost seemed out of place in the set. The collection of short stories is enjoyable and highly recommended to lovers of literature. It brings the thought to mind of what other works of literature were hidden from American eyes by communism."},{"Title":"The diary of a madman","review":"The short stories in this collection were very like those of Kafka, with the disorienting magical realism and the undercurrent of despair, although Gogol is the more blackly humourous of the two writers. Andrew MacAndrew's translation is a bit peculiar, however; for the Diary of a Madman, he mysteriously altered the structure of the vignettes (there is one less section than in other versions) and removed the name of the narrator. There are also a few irregularities in his version of The Nose. Work by other translators may be more reliable."},{"Title":"The diary of a madman","review":"This compilation of stories is an absolutely phenomenal introduction to Gogol and his writing. He is often presented as the Russian Mark Twain and with his dry humor and commentary on, mostly, Petersburg lifestyle, the analogy is not far off. Many other Russian writers took inspiration from Gogol and his wildly interesting stories and he is still influencing writers and readers to this day.\\"The Diary of a Madman\\" is the first story that we are presented that watches the gradual disintegration of a man's mind, swallowed by the obsession with station, rank, custom, and other rudimentary desires in life that are hollow and vacant. \\"The Nose\\" is next and offers a hilarious reprieve from the slightly dark ending to the first story. The story follows a man who wakes up one day without his nose as it seems to have wanted to simply take a vacation and gallivant across the city. Cyclical in nature, the story concludes redundantly (very much like Twain) and focuses on the obsession that the man has with his face and his station that his face provides. Literally, his main hangup is that he can't flirt! Following the theme of obsession is \\"The Overcoat\\" where a simple-minded worker goes to great lengths to obtain a new coat.Gogol takes a step away from the short story to the novella in Taras Bulba which is more of an epic than a lighthearted story about a hero and his sons. It gives the reader a sense that Gogol didn't just stick with the short story genre and explored many realms of literature (he was also a playwright and a teacher).A simply great introductory collection that will undoubtedly open the doors for many readers of Russian literature."},{"Title":"The diary of a madman","review":"Beware of translated works that don't mention the name of the translator.That should have been my first clue. I'm not sure who did the translating of this collection, but he obviously does not have a thorough knowledge/appreciation of Russian humour and literature. I can say this because I'm from Russia and after reading the original version of Diary of a Madman (I didn't bother further with the others) and comparing it to this one, I was disappointed by how lengthy and confusing the passages were. The language was tripping over itself, rather than flowing with the Gogolian humour and absurdity. It was boring and difficult to follow and had none of the finesse that, for instance, Pevear and Volokhonsky's version was able to capture. Most surprising is that entire sentences were missing from certain passages. It seems that whenever there was a phrase the translator couldn't make sense of or see how it fit into the scheme of things, he just omitted it entirely!!! This is really offensive to the writer and unfair to the readers.For goodness sake, he didn't even get the name of the dog right!! It's \\"Medji,\\" not \\"Meggy\\"---just because this sound doesn't exist quite the same in the English language, doesn't mean you can rename the dog! (Unless it isn't read \\"Meggy\\" like \\"Peggy\\" but most English readers will read it this way anyway)But the dog isn't the most important part. It's really the fact that the translator did not do Gogol justice. He did not treat this work with the dignity and reverence it deserves and as a result, has put out a shoddy interpretation of a classic tale.I gave two stars because I did notice some attempts to capture the complexity of dry wit, as is often the style of satirical Russian authors. It is indeed very difficult to do this with English. Whoever this translator was, they made a solid effort; unfortunately, he just couldn't carry it. And the publisher should be more selective with the quality of work it puts its stamp on."},{"Title":"The diary of a madman","review":"I translated the title story and two others in this collection for my students because none of the existing translations did Gogol justice--they ignored his sound play and sometimes simply altered or even eliminated things that didn't make sense. Gogol's stories are weird and hilarious--I tried to preserve the elements of language that make them brilliant."},{"Title":"The diary of a madman","review":"i last read this play back in 1970 after seeing an amazing performance of it by english actor - peter prouse back in south africa. his depiction of the character was without comparison, as i have yet to witness an actor achieve what he did on stage - where many of the dinner guests pushed their food away from them and fled the scene; so powerful was his performance. i have always wanted to produce and act in my own interpretation of this work and may well do so now that i've finally found the book - again on amazon.com"},{"Title":"The diary of a madman","review":"I have read 3 translations of this story and I like them all for different reasons. The story is very readable and has interesting interpretations on several levels. All the friends I recommended the story to loved it."},{"Title":"The diary of a madman","review":"i must confess that I have always been more than a little disturbed by the cover of this book. The stories featured in this book by Gogol deal with the desperate lives of the St Petersburg bureaucrats, Gogol was one and these are his people! The best story is &quot;The Diary of a Madman&quot; and this deals with the adventures of one of these low grade civil servants who finds his plans and dreams continually frustrated. As a way out he gradually becomes convinced that he is destined for &quot;bigger and better things&quot; (I will not reveal more here, but will leave this to those who will discover just what this is by reading the story). In his delusion, Gogol uses the technique of dislocation to describe the further adventures of his hapless hero and rarely is it used with greater comic effect. Tolstoy was a master of this literary device,particularly when he wanted to satirize something of which he disapproved, but Gogol perfected it. If one wants to see the beginnings of a rich tradition of humor in Russian literature, one cannot do any better than this book. I still dislike the cover and believe that the editors of Penguin may be turning away more business than they generate by the rather off-putting artwork."},{"Title":"The diary of a madman","review":"If you are looking for a book with a twist and humor this is the one.

Highly recommended if you are a fan of classic literature and / or short stories."},{"Title":"The diary of a madman","review":"Gogol has the uncanny ability to write deep, beautiful and simultaneously hilarious stories. \\"Diary of a Madman and Other Stories\\" is a great example of Gogol's style of writing to anyone interested in a premier in Gogol's literary style.Caution: don't read this book at night when everyone is asleep; you'll wake them up as you laugh outloud!"},{"Title":"The diary of a madman","review":"The only time I've ever laughed so much when reading a book was when reading WAITING FOR GODOT. Gogol is absolutely brilliant. So brilliant, in fact, that I finished this book in one sitting- only taking breaks to answer the unrelenting telephone (apparently I'd forgotten that I have an answering machine to take messages when I'm busy reading a masterpiece!). I often found myself laughing aloud when reading these stories and the only fault I found was that the book is simply too short. It absolutely must be 500 pages so that I can spend several more hours reading and laughing. 5 STARS."},{"Title":"The diary of a madman","review":"The book was shipped to me very quickly and is in good condition; however, I would have liked to have known what other stories were included in the book ahead of time."},{"Title":"The diary of a madman","review":"This collection of short stories is a work of art. Each story is a masterpiece and this is one of wery few books I can read again and again and again. Occsasionally I pick it up and open it at random and start to read, and every time I laugh so hard it hurts... well maybe not quite so hard every time but almost always. These stories are a delightful read, the most famous being &quot;The Overcoat&quot;, whose protagonist reminds me of Woody Allen. The best story is &quot;The Nose&quot; in which we meet a miserable barber who one day discovers a human nose in his breakfast! We also meet the owner of the nose who wakes up one morning to find it missing.Another good story is the title story which is the diary of a low-life pencil sharpener who falls in love with his boss's daughter. As we read on he starts to halucinate and the diary includes ever more bizarre entries and dates:&quot;No date. The day didn't have one. I walked incognito down Nevsky Avenue. His Imperial Majesty drove past. Every single person doffed his hat, and I followed suit. However, I didn't let out that I was the King of Spain. I considered it improper to reveal my true identity right there in the middle of the crowd, because, according to etiquette, I ought first to be presented at court.&quot;I am sure that I am missing something wery important because I concentrate mostly on the humorous side of Gogol, but I have to admit, few writers have made smile for many days after reading them."},{"Title":"The diary of a madman","review":"Gogol is out of this world.. Every story in this collection defies description. The phrase 'couldn't put it down' gets thrown around alot, but my reading of this honestly interrupted a major school project that i put off for a while. The Overcoat is my one of my favorite stories ever, and everything else was first rate. If you have a half an hour to kill, pick up this book, please."},{"Title":"The diary of a madman","review":"Gogol's stories are a delight. I read this book on the train on the way to and from work, and I often laughed out loud, much to the chagrin of my fellow passengers, who must have thought I was crazy. No one laughs on the train.\\"The Nose\\" is my favorite story in the collection. It's absurd and silly. Especially when the nose masquerades as a prominent government official, riding about town in a carriage and dressed in a cape. Incidentally, the nose has very good manners.My copy of this book also contained the story \\"Taras Bulbas,\\" which isn't funny at all, but rather a romantic epic of Cossacks in the 14th century somewhat similar to Tolstoy's Cossack stories. Gogol's description of the time and place is fantastic awash in detail as it is. Description of battle is hair-raising and exciting. But Gogol romanticizes freely, and wants us to believe that these brutal, violent men embody the Russian Soul. (Note the capitalization.) Whatever. That, combined with a liberal dash of anti-Semitism, laces the work with enough flaw to consider this a 2nd-rate Gogol story.It's a great book and a quick read. One of the better books I have read lately."},{"Title":"The diary of a madman","review":"I actually read another collection of Gogol stories but I have read &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot;, &quot;The Nose&quot;, and &quot;The Overcoat&quot;. The book is worth buying for Diary of a Madman or the Nose alone. These are both great stories that really show the uniqueness and talent of Gogol which seems even more amazing when thinking he was writing in the 19th Century. The Overcoat is a good story but the other two are classics and unbelieveable works of fantasy and social commentary that still seems relevant today."},{"Title":"The diary of a madman","review":"Modern American readers will probably find a lot of distance between themselves and Gogol, who writes with an observational comedy about the world he sees around him. But since the themes are timeless, his work will be pleasing, and often very funny, to most discerning readers."},{"Title":"The diary of a madman","review":"A strange story of a mans internal dialogue and his day job, with the infatuation of a lovely women and talking dogs. This book translated by MacAndrew includes other stories beyond 'Diary of a Madman.' I confess here I only bought the book for this story and that is all I read, based on Nabakov's reference. The writing by Golgol interesting, yet confusing at times and most certainly; odd, as the story is. Quite mundane in the beginning, while the finale is quite a shocker. A worthwhile read, but nothing to hop off your seat over."},{"Title":"The diary of a madman","review":"I am not as enamored of these Russian short stories as some of the other reviewers are. The last story about Bulba depicted Jews in a very demeaning way, and you can see the stereotypes of the Eastern European Jew written into a very interesting story.Gogol was one of the great Russian writers, but the inclusion of this shows him to be an anti-Semite. Otherwise the stories are interesting and humorous of the Tsarist times. The story of the Russian bureaucrat pretending to be Fernando VIII of Spain starts out this book and is by far the best. The others are silly stories, and the last one about Bulba shows the Polish occupation of the Ukraine in medieval times. The first and last stories are by far the best, if you can stomach the anti-Semite tone in the latter story.Overall, an interesting and slightly humorous read. This book gives you a picture of Russia in the times of the Tsar."},{"Title":"Return to Raby: A New England Novel","review":"For all of us who have grown up in small towns, we know that the closed door policy of the old time citizens is the way that 'deals are made.' For newcomer, Nelson Palmer, a man in search of his family history, he learned the hard way that the 'only way is the right way' on how to restore pride and inspiration to a town. Reading Jack Polidoro's new novel, \\"Return To Raby\\" will captivate you and have you reading page after page until the very last word. It is a story that could and probably did happen someplace along the way in many New England villages. Having loved Jack's two previous works, Rapid Descent: Disaster in Boston Harbor, and Project Samuel-The Quest for the Cennential Nobel Prize, I know that much of what he weaves into his fictitious stories are what he knows and who he is. So the town of Harvest, New Hampshire intrigued me as I kept wondering, who are these real people and what really occurred to have this author tell his tale.

With his opposition to the town fathers, other residents gain the confidence to state their opposition as well. As a mysterious benefactor begins to effect change in the community, the townspeople begin to accept and expect change in attitudes.As the story builds to its conclusion, more information is unearthed about the true beginnings of the town.I would recommend this novel to anyone looking to curl up by the fire with a good book.

The book, illustrated by reproductions of woodcuts from Andreas Vesalius' De humani corporis fabrica of 1543, follows first year med-students' literally-hands-on introduction to human anatomy. The students are not portrayed with any psychological detail; they are only lightly sketched, little more than names at the dissection tables. The focus is on the cut and opened and dismembered body, not on those who study it. In a sense, the book reports the author's vicarious experience, by observing the students and the cadavers throughout the progression of their dissection, of being a med-student himself.

As Prof. Aston implies in the preface, present day programmable scientific calculators (including but not restricted to TI and HP families, I add) are in many way as powerful as expensive software packages for the analysis of electrical circuits; in fact, two chapters of the book are devoted to PSpice and Mathcad. These calculators are for all practical purposes portable computers with excellent software packages included.The book includes many examples ilustrating fairly well the use of the TI86 in the analysis and design of circuits, complemented with end of chapter exercises. It emphasizes programming writing, which has both its advantages and drawbacks.The first chapters consider DC and AC analysis of simple circuits, parallel series combinations, voltage and current divisions, elementary bandpass filters, not forgetting of course the use of complex numbers. Here, the examples introduce very well the use of the calculators in getting numerical and graphical results; in addition, the programming of particular topologies is welcome.The loop and node methods in chapter 4 emphasize the AC mode, with the resistive dc mode as a special case. Some network properties are considered in chapter 5. My feeling is that these chapters do not exploit well the capabilities of the calculator. Even if not as powerful as the TI-92, the TI-86 allows more powerful treatment of these methods than what provided. The presentation given by the author follows the classical one presented in textbooks, namely, write down the equations, work the algebra to put them in matrix form and then use the calculator to solve this matrix equation. This procedure becomes cumbersome for large circuits; solving the matrix equation is the same for a 2x2 or a 20x20, as far as the calculator allows it. The big problem is to write down the equations and put them in matrix form, and this is where the calculator can be better applied. Programming of particular topologies such as bridged- T or delta-wye configurations is useful for people using these topologies very often. The author has missed however an opportunity to introduce students to the secrets of &quot;circuit simulators&quot;, and to understand better what Spice does.Chapter 7 deals with power, chapter 10 with transformers, mutual inductance and some passive filters structures; and chapter 11 works with circuits containing operational amplifiers as well as active filters. In all the chapters the use of the calculators is well illustrated through examples and programs for design and analyss of particular structures are given. The plots of frequency responses are well introduced for the examples.Transient analysis of first order circuits is done in chapter 8 with emphasis in graphical results and the use of differential equations solver from the calculator. If you are interested in seeing how powerful can a calculator be for answering questions that students usually make about the usefullness and practical considerations regarding Fourier Series, chapter 9 provides a good introduction using the square wave in particular. Here again, the calculator can be further exploited.Even if you find useful chapters 7 on PSpice and 12 on Mathcad, I cannot by wonder if they belong really to this book. I would better suggest them as appendices.It seems that the book was intended as a textbook. However, I would not recommend it for a first try in learning circuits , although it constitutes a good companion for textbooks or else a reference book refreshing some concepts for those who had already been exposed to theory and prefer to concentrate on the tools."},{"Title":"Electrical Circuit Analysis Using the TI-85 or TI-86","review":"I have nearly the same opinion about this book as you Mr. Palomera. I also think that although it's almost 400 pages, you can find (maybe) more infos on sites like ticalc. But these sites are really huges and it's not surprising that it bigger than this book.

You can say \\"the reason your sex is bad is because you've lost your feminine role\\" and hell, that could be 100% correct, but a big chunk of this book ignores where the nerve endings are located. In the 40 years since this was published, I think someone went ahead and talked to some women, maybe even did some science-y stuff and decided 80+% of women weren't just orgasming wrong. But its good that this is still out there, to make people feel ashamed of the way their body works.

Many women are unhappy in their marrages without understanding their own motivation in making themselves unhappy. The book is written in chapters, each addressing the source of their disklikes, resentments, and dissatisfaction. The book also recommends ways for the women to help themselves realize that they can correct the problems with the result of being content in their relationship.The book is excellent for men who are married, especially when the cannot understand why their wife is not content with some aspect of the marrage. By thir understanding they can help the wife adjust her thinking by recognizing the, sometimes imaginary problems thus increasing their own happyness.Unfortunately, some women will not read the book when it is recommended, especially by the spouse, and like my own case, wind-up divorced with great financial to the spouses and children."},{"Title":"Hokusai","review":"There are two or three different collections of Hokusai's works in print this Fall (2003), and of them this is the best.

So I do not claim to be the authority to compare this book with other ones.But i felt this book has fantastic explanation on the topic it claims to cover ( Detection and Estimation theory - D&E; ). Detection theory starts only in the fifth chapter and the first four chapters clearly build the fundamentals in probability and linear algebra among others that are relevant for D&E.; As the author introduces you the necessary concepts, he clearly tells you in what context those will be used in the topics that follow later. In my opinion the motivation to introduce a concept is very essential.D&E; concepts are explained very well too and has quite a lot of examples that explained well and they feature at the right time and right place"},{"Title":"SIGNAL DETECTION & ESTIMATION","review":"This book is amazing, it goes from explaining the very basic concepts for probability and signal detection to the very deep details. The examples and the problems are excellent as well"},{"Title":"Marx's Concept Of Man","review":"\\"Marx's Concept of Man\\" is essentially a pamphlet establishing the humanist, philosophical side of Marx as against the orthodox, Soviet view of Marx as tyrannical and economistic, and against the degree to which this view has seeped into academic literature in the West also. Famous Freudian Marxist Erich Fromm uses the \\"Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts\\" as well as \\"The German Ideology\\" to stress the importance of humanist concepts such as alienation, freedom, and creativity for Marx, and in so doing explains what these and similar terms mean in Marx' work. Fromm has clearly paid careful attention to Marx' philosophy, and this part of the book is quite good as a simple overview.The second half of the book covers the English translation of the aforementioned \\"Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts\\" by Tom Bottomore, as well as excerpts from various other works by and about Marx meaning to show his humanism, his good nature, and his sensitivity to culture. Of special interest are the excerpts from the memoirs of those who knew Marx, like his daughter Eleanor as well as Paul Lafargue. These works are often quoted, but rarely does one find a larger part in English, not even in McLellan's biography.Fromm goes a bit overboard here and there in stressing Marx' 'spiritual' nature. Although nothing Fromm writes is of itself incorrect, it may unwittingly reinforce the old canard of Marxism 'really' being a religion, and Marx a millennarian prophet, and so on. Fromm obviously rejects this old refrain, but should have made that clearer. In other aspects this collection is an interesting primer on Marx as thinker on human action and human nature, and sheds good light on this side of Marxist thought for those not familiar with it."},{"Title":"Marx's Concept Of Man","review":"Marx? Communism? Please!That's the gut reaction of most of us. Why is this? Why is the man who's ideas stimulated nearly half the world to revolution automatically rejected without even being seriously looked at by most of us the U.S. today? What's that you say? \\"History shows us that communism is an impossible system that leads to the greatest tyranny.\\"The fact is Marx is much more than communism. His most famous work is not called Communism but Capital. (The manifesto was a small pamphlet next to the thousands of pages of the planned four volumes of Capital). He is strongest in his analysis of the very history and machinery of this economic system. In fact, it is in his critique of capitalism (not his proposition of communism) that he is most original.Today, we see yet another crisis in global capitalism. Almost all of us who seek understanding of this crisis do so using the very same conceptual tools of the capitalist doctrine itself. But what if there are incorrect assumptions that the governments, universities and media networks of the world continuously overlook?Marx's Concept of Man serves as an introduction to such an analysis. It is a compilation of various manuscripts of the early Marx and is quite digestible--especially after Fromm's preface. Erich Fromm--a significant 20th century philosopher in his own right--introduces us to some of the most timeless aspects of Marx's concept of man in a way that makes his thought significant to this day."},{"Title":"Marx's Concept Of Man","review":"This book is an excellent book for anyone wishing to gain a readable understanding of Marxist thought. The first 92 pages are especially insightful. A must buy for anyone interested in Marxism."},{"Title":"Marx's Concept Of Man","review":"Erich Fromm, displays a different profile of Karl Marx. According to Fromm, Marx is very different than the one told by the Russian Communists. Fromm tries to show the humanist ideas of Marx and he describes Marx's philosophy as a synthesis of humanism and naturalism. There are also good descriptions of what socialism means: \\"Socialism, for Marx, is a society which permits the actualization of man's essence, by overcoming his alienation.\\".Fromm describes the Marxist socialism as the heirs of propethic Messianism.This book is really interesting because Fromm tries to explain the humanistic values in socialism.Indeed, all the communist propaganda has claimed that their way is the real Marxist system; however Fromm claims that their system was just a crude communism which neglected human beings and humanistic values."},{"Title":"Marx's Concept Of Man","review":"Fromm's analysis of Marx is incredible, finally someone truly understands Marx's writing. This is an excellent edition for someone looking for a side of Marx not often discussed."},{"Title":"Marx's Concept Of Man","review":"This is a book that should, but given the existing political culture, won't be made required reading in schools and universities.Eric Fromm was a humanist writer who lived from 1900 to 1980, and exerted a strong influence on Baby Boomers with his popular books. This book about Humanistic Marxism shook the intellectual world when it was first published in 1961. It rattled the conventional wisdom at the time it was first published. The West had, as Fromm readily admits, a glaring misconception of what Marxism meant. They could hardly be blamed for this misunderstanding. The only example the West had to look towards to see Marxism in action was to observe the Soviet Union. The Eastern Block shares responsibility in misconstruing the meaning of Marx. Its monumental government apparatuses, unwieldy bureaucracies, its virulent oppression of human rights, all these characteristics were definitely NOT how Marx envisioned a communistic society.Fromm goes into great detail on the humanistic philosophy of Marxism. If Hobbes' Leviathan emerged to protect man from a state of nature, the true goal of society according to Marx is to provide the conditions by which man may reestablish his relationship with nature, with others, with society at large, and with himself. The impediment to this reestablishment is alienation, a common concept of Marx, which drives a wedge between man and the other elements to his life and to himself. As Fromm repeatedly reminds the reader, alienation does not simply exist in Western societies; it is equally prevalent in those countries under a so-called \\"Communist\\" form of government. Fromm states that the governments of Lenin, Stalin and Khrushchev were simple totalitarian states.There is a decided spiritual aspect to Marx, in that the goal of a person's life is self-realization. This self-realization, however, is one which allows a person to achieve their own personal goals, based on that person's abilities, talents and labor.Fromm was addressing a world in the middle of the Cold War, and published in an America just emerging from the crushing conformity of the 1950's. It has continued relevance today, where the societal pressures are hidden and the urge to conform reemerging.This is a short book and can be read in two or three sittings. It is a well worth read."},{"Title":"Marx's Concept Of Man","review":"...someone dusted off Marx and took a good psychological look at the wealth in his writings! One needn't be a Marxist (I am not) to appreciate this fine book. My one concern is that Fromm is to Marx as Kaufmann is to Nietzsche: both men either ignore or euphemize the weaknesses in the visionaries they write about (e.g., Kaufmann's remark that Nietzsche's hateful, cynical, and demeaning remarks about women &quot;do him little credit&quot;). Nevertheless, this book provides a good compensation for the Western tendency to demonize a man very much misunderstood by those who turned his writings to political purposes."},{"Title":"Good Luck Arizona Man","review":"This book is one of the funniest ever! Years ago, when I drove my latency-aged children across country, we had the book in the car, and to avoid sibling conflict on the long road trip, I had my daughter read it aloud.

Really, whoever you are, you MUST read it."},{"Title":"Good Luck Arizona Man","review":"I read this book as a child, and recently succeeded in finding it again (having forgotten the title.) Good Luck Arizona Man is the story of a white boy raised by Apaches, trying to discover the secrets of his own past and heritage while keeping his Apache identity. He goes on a search for the lost gold of the Apaches, which is tied up with his own mystery. Unfortunately, the mountains are filled with bizarre and dangerous white men also searching for the gold: and the Apache chief has sent men to ensure that the prophesy (he who finds the gold must die) comes trueThe book is humorous and whimsical, with many surprising plot twists. I doubt that the portrait of Apache life and customs is very accurate, but the white men are equally ridiculous. In any case, the characters (and their names--Head Toter, Tied-Up, Miss Utter Delight, Fantail and Poop, Old Wickiup, Missing Toe) are hilarious and unforgettable."},{"Title":"Good Luck Arizona Man","review":"My father read this book to me when I was fairly young. He slipped it in between Watership Down and The Lord of the Rings, and so naturally when I grew of age, I expected it to be a classic know all over the globe. I have found that this is not the case and I am rather disappointed with the world. Sometimes there are fiction books that outdo the fantasy series in fantasy, or the ancient myths in myth. This is a myth which we can understand, because we half-belong to culture of the book. There is something about this tale that makes it sound as if it is spun right at the fireside where ole Wicky-up sits up straight, half asleep."},{"Title":"Good Luck Arizona Man","review":"I too read this book as a pre-teen some 30 years ago. I read and enjoyed many young adventure books (Zilpha Keatley Snyder's novels, The Three Investigators series), but this is the only one that I read over and over and over. There are passages that would make me laugh out loud every time!

This hymnal introduced me to the great and hard hitting song \\"He Was Not Willing That Any Should Perish\\", which is hard to find and absent from most hymnals.On the quirky side -- this hymnal also introduced me to the Charles Wesley classic \\"And Can It Be\\". The full version has five verses with an ABABCC rhyme scheme and uses the last two lines of the first verse as the chorus. In this hymnal, they only do three verses; that's okay because it's common for hymnals to not include all the verses. However, they dropped the CC lyrics, meaning that the chorus for all three verses are the last two lines of the first verse repeated twice. That makes me shake my head.Is that a reason to forget this hymnal? No. It has a great set of songs."},{"Title":"Inspiring Hymns","review":"I value this book highly.

He demonstrated nature's ability to provide mankind with new foods in almost endless variety, and he developed a method for helping nature to create new plants more quickly.He recognized time as a gift of the Creator which is to be used to the fullest extent; and he lived a happpy life of seventy-seven years because he continually tried to be useful....\\"I recommend this book to all from the ages of around eight years on up."},{"Title":"Dragon Fire","review":"I just could not read it; it was too violent and ugly.

The author seems to shove her opinion down your throat that all the cares in the world would be solved if people were to stay stoned as much as possible.

Supported by an amazing bibliography this down to earth scientifically prepared work leaves the reader with a holistic understanding of why marijuana/cannabis/hemp has played so big a part of our civilization, going back thousands of years, and why currently, throughout the world, marijuana has become a very effictive and safe medicinal herb for the relief of symptons and for the healing of most modern day stress related diseases. Bello has prepared a concise understanding of the way marijuana safely balances the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS),leading to physical, psychological and in some cases spiritual benefits without any of the dangerous side effects commonly associated with so many of today's legal, profit oriented medicines."},{"Title":"The Benefits of Marijuana : Physical, Psychological & Spiritual","review":"In a most positive and scientific approach,the author, with a Master's degree in Holist health and Eastern Studies presents a solid understanding of how marijuana effects the human body, mind, and spirit. Overflowing with details from beginning to end,this is quite a serious piece of work that should be read by anyone interested in the effects of marijuana,and holistic health. The book was written in the early 90s before the many studies that have evolved over the past ten years have actually proven the effectiveness of this plant in treating so many different ailments. Cancer, asthma, anxiety, depression, glaucoma, high blood pressure,coronary diseases,attention deficit disorders (ADD),alzheimers,and severe nausau are but a few of the many ailments that have proven to respond to safe marijuana therapy just as it was suggested by the author before these studies were undertaken."},{"Title":"The Benefits of Marijuana : Physical, Psychological & Spiritual","review":"I've read all three editions of Ms. Bello's book and have to say that the Final Edition was worth waiting for - particularly the information on post tramatic syndrome.

I recently gave a copy of the book to my daughter's doctor, as I do with every doctor my family sees; and at the birth of my last granddaughter, we were surprised and delighted when he shared his enthusiasm about both the book and the medicine during her labor. To my knowledge not one doctor who has taken the time to read 'Benefits of Marijuana' has disagreed with any of Ms. Bello's findings. No one wants to admit that marijuana has been unfairly maligned for mostly fictional reasons, but the fact is that the worst side effect of the use of this plant is the law.

This book is a frivolous castle in the air. It presents all of the benefits, including some Ms Bello made up herself, and doesn't show you any of the downsides. In my experience, and in the experience of many of my friends, there are dangers as well as benefits regarding this plant. Marijuana is not some thing you can casually pick up and allow to fill your life; it can very easily take over your whole livelihood. In order to become a conscientious and responsible pot-smoker, you need to set limits for yourself, know when and when not to smoke, take up plenty of interests besides drugs, balance being \\"high\\" with being \\"normal\\", and above all, take the plant seriously! According to this book, smoking pot is like drinking water: 100% harmless, you can do it anytime you want and as much as you want, and without it, you're toast. ...This book automatically makes marijuana less safe than it would be otherwise!

As worth the effort as any book you will ever read, it is a vast work to get completely lost in."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I have read this book twice. Everyone should read this book multiple times. There is simply SO much there that you cannot helpt but read it multiple times. It is one of the most beautiful books I have ever read.Bascially, the story is that of the Buendia family and their eventual fall. The Buendia line starts with the incestuous marriage of cousins Jose Arcadio Buendia and Ursula Iguran. They move and create the town of Macondo after they try to find the sea but come across nothing. There they raise thier sons Arcadio and Aureliano and their daughter Amaranta. Melquiades and his gypsies come, bringing miracles of science with them. Jose Arcadio Buendia becomes completely enamoured and sets out to live entirely by science, eventually revoking God because he could not take a dauggaotype (picture) of Him. Ursula, on the other hand, keep the family together and retains order. Both are obsessed with a Buendia legacy.One Hundred Years of Solitude is just about that: solitude. Each character discovers it in their own way. Some wished for it , some had been looking for it their whole lives, and some were forced into it. But each character is left alone with their memories until time is irrelevant and everything is occuring at the same time.There is bibical allusions, mythological allusions, and allusions to novels that Gabriel Garcia Marquez must have loved. Faulkner was certainly a huge influance on Garcia Marquez.This honestly may be my favorite book of all time. Read it!"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This book chronicles the evolution of the Buendias, a Spanish family. As the book goes on, we're exposed to Marquez's own sense of magical realism as he describes both the significant and trivial events in the lives of the Buendias.At times, this book seems to be going in every direction at the same time. It is difficult to remember the different characters and their relationships to one another. However, the beauty of this book lies in its language and its explanations for human action. Marquez attempts to paint hundreds of little pictures that ultimately sum together to describe all humans to some extent.His characters unrealistically engage in a type of symbolism to show different aspects of their inner workings. For example, Amaranta Ursula keeps her husband, Gaston, on a leash. This is Marquez trying to show us a side of Amaranta's personality and soul without coming right out and telling us. The book is full of examples such as these. If you are enchanted by clever symbolism done up in a magical realism form, you will enjoy this book.Ultimately, the ending really ties everything together SO perfectly. My mind was desperate for clarity by the end, and Marquez more than impressed me. The theme of this book is the human relationship to time. Marquez sums this book up best when he concludes, \\"Melquiades (who I believe is supposed to be Marquez) had not put events in the order of man's conventional time, but had concentrated a century of daily episodes in such a way that they coexisted in one instant.\\" - overall, an awesomely poignant work."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This book is for people who have an imagination and enjoy giving it a good workout. If you are looking for history, or an easy narrative to follow take a pass on this one. But, if you can find humor in pathos and have the ability to follow complex story lines you will be amply rewarded."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This is one of the best pieces of literature ever written. In my opinion, Marquez's work is right up the alley of D. Foster Wallace and Gustave Flaubert. In One Hundred Years of Solitude, Gabriel Garcia Marquez tells the story of the Buendia family -- a family who has struggled the sometimes mundane and unjust world they live in for many generations. The descriptions are lurid and gruesome -- the suicide details, battles with insomnia, etc. -- a story told without reservations. However, One Hundred Years of Solitude is also a poignant and touching novel about the memorable Buendia family. This is a true and profound piece of literature written by a brilliant writer. This gem should be read more than once."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"with many reviews that were already written for this classic, i prefer to just commend the wonderful writing style of gabriel garcia marquez. just like what it is touted to be, it is a book that will remind you of your grandparents, with all their stories and superstitions. only one word would sum up everything in this book, and, i think, that is: stunning."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I have not read a book as good as One Hundred Years of Solitude in a long while. It's hard to say what, exactly, pulled me in so much. One could make the argument that there are too many characters for the reader to really get inside the head of any one of them, or that none are &quot;three-dimensional,&quot; whatever that means. But I don't think that is at all the case. The accusations of &quot;two-dimensionality&quot; are based on the fact that many of these characters have one action which defines their entire lives, which they follow and live with for the rest of same. I, personally, find that sort of depiction to be extremely true to human nature, as I also find the irrationality of many of these actions to be. At the end of the book, I felt like I understood some of the characters better than the author, and that others I didn't understand at all. I think that this is the reaction most people have, and that it was Marquez's intention that it should be so. (A note: my personal favourites were Colonel Aureliano Buendia and Renata Remedios. You will have yours.)I also found the much-touted &quot;magical realism&quot; to be captivating. It's not the presence of mysticism that is so wonderful; in fact, generally I don't much care for overt &quot;spirituality&quot; in books. The thing is, Marquez has made it so the mystical elements seem perfectly logical and natural, and require no suspension of disbelief. And that, perhaps, is his most defining element; I've seen it in Autumn of the Patriarch as well. Anyway, read this book today and marvel at the irrational enigmatic creatures that are human beings."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Given the lavish praise for _100 Years of Solitude_, I am gravely disappointed and frustrated. At the risk of being burned in effigy (or in the very least pilloried as a philistine), wading through Marquez was a real test of my patience and literary fortitude.The story was a difficult read, which I don't mind, so long as there is a reward for my efforts. I found no such relief here. Stylisitically it was an abomination: paragraphs that run one, two, two and a half pages long?! This was worse than Faulkner, as at least with him there is conflict (and resolution) in his writing. In _100 Years of Solitude_, the initial investment of 100 pages is that the following 300 pages are more or less a rehash of the first quarter of the book. The characters have almost identical names, and make many of the same decisions and actions as their namesakes. Beyond being repetitive, I found it mindnumbingly dull. Adding to the sense of drugery I experienced, was the geologic pace of the book.To be fair to the legions of fans of Marquez, I \\"get\\" magical realism - in fact, I enjoyed elements of it here. I also understand his point that history is \\"cyclical\\" (although I don't happen to agree with him on this), and that this explains not only the similarities in name but also in behaviour by his characters. A strong case could be made for Jung's \\"collective memory\\" in the book, given the actions (and in several cases, literal \\"hereditary memory\\") of the many Arcadios and Aurielianos ; heck, I can even see how one could argue that Marquez is showing the existential crisis of the individual - that, in spite of our best efforts, we are all alone, daily wrestling with our solitude. And perhaps it is precisely because of these clues that this is so beloved by so many. All that aside, I didn't enjoy the book at all and had to force myself to return to it again and again in order to finish. With his book, at least, I am puzzled at the high regard with which it is held."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"In this book many characters are parallel, mimicking thefutility of war and the cycle of meaningless brought onby wars. The characterization lacked depth but the writ-ing ha a beautiful quality of magical realism like inother books by Marquez. Again, Marquez's focus on pedo-philia was disconcerting.How can I like a writer so much yet dislike his book?The answer is that beautiful writing is not enough tocreate a good book. Their needs to be excellence inform and content. Marquez is excellent in form but heis very low in content. I found this book more confus-ing than any other book that I completed. If it hadnot been written by Marquez, I would not have finishedit."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Its true I had a hard time putting this book down, it was well written and fascinating, but dont read it if you are already depressed. I think it is one of the saddest most hopeless books I ever read--Eternal cycles of despair, being dragged down into the mud despite heroic struggles to escape, and to know it is a commentary on real world issues just makes it worse. I read it for a book club, but I could quite happily have gone my whole life without it."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This book has been extoled over and over to me throughout the years. I tried it about 5 yrs ago and quit after 30 or so pages, but this time when my book group chose it, I was determined to try it again. After all I'm 5 years older. I read it slowly, tried not to analyze it too deeply and become immersed in the flow of the culture. About l00 pages into it, I thought this is really creative and interesting. Fifty pages later, I was bored with its redundancy of characters, names and magical events. It picked up again in the last 50 pages, but it NEVER did for me what so many of the previous readers exclaimed about. I was disappointed. This is one book that didn't live up to its hype."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This is just a warning to those of you who think you may have found a new, great author to read: forget it. I completely disagree that this is one of the best books of all time; the book was boring, and its characters were difficult to keep straight due to the author's annoying decision to name them all similarly."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I really wanted to like this. The style of writing is interesting, and somewhat poetic, which is why this even rates two stars. The story just seems to ramble on and on, and didn't keep my attention. It was painful to keep going, and I still haven't finished it... (I normally read through books to the end in a relatively short amount of time.) The writing style, while interesting and poetic, slips key bits of information into the story to the point where it's almost hidden, rather than doing what most writers do and building up to important parts of the storyline. Several times I found myself rereading a sentence or paragraph to verify that I had read it correctly -- that significant parts of the story had just been slipped in to otherwise rambling text. It's not that things need to be pointed out to me, but I found this method of storytelling very anti-climactic. Additionally, the characters were so highly flawed, with so little (or in some cases no) redeeming qualities, I didn't find myself connecting with any of them. I really wanted to like this book, but I just couldn't get into it."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This book is experience. I can understand that the book may be disappointing to a reader who begins it with a lot of expectations, so I suggest approaching it with as few as possible.I was so intrigued by the lives of the characters that I had to force myself to slow down and savor the beautiful language. I couldn't wait for the story to resolve, but didn't want the book to end. I wanted to read it again as soon as I finished.I would also recommend using the family tree (included before the first chapter) early in your reading to help you keep the characters straight. It was very helpful in understanding the nature of some very confusing relationships."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I loved this book. It was fabulous. The ending was the best part. It was probably the best ending I've ever read (and I've read a lot of books. Shocking, but profound, and very original! Once you are finished, you will have a lot to think about. I loved the characters of the original Ursula and Aureliano and what they come to symbolize. Amaranta kind of gave me the creeps, although I guess you have to sympathize with her by the end of the novel. Very tragic, yet beautiful and inspirational."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This is a tough read. I almost gave up at several points. The reason is that the writing is \\"train of thought\\". The is little organization and it is quite hard to keep track of things.There is not much of a plot. You might call this book just several hundred pages of rambling.But in the end, I felt rewarded by reading it. I'm not sure why, but I did."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"One hundred years of solitude is a work of genius. Marquez takes us through the lives and times of atleast six generations of Buendia family, weaving one magical imagery over the other, layers and layers of fantasy build into characters and daily reality. The writer is a poet, with his metaphors taking the center stage and creating a marvellous world of miracles and half-truths, of lies that defy several laws of physics and yet are amusing and interesting.His novel is like a river flowing backwards from the ocean, and likewise he traces the trajectories of all its tributeries, rather mulls over the genesis and fall of each one, and describes all the floods, draughts, tides, swells and ebbs, in an continuous stream of highly imaginative narrative. Maybe my review is written in a rather unoriginal copy of the style of Marquez, and might appear full of long sentences. The same style in hands of this master sees flowering of an amazing piece of literature. It is rich in literary, scientific and philosophical meanderings, its full of several forms of life, each form of life is swamped by the overwhemling current of times, each generation discovers for itself love, lust, intrigue, tastes and temptations, talents and tempests.Gabriel Garcia Marquez never ceases to amaze me, every sentence is a work of art. The book is sufficiently complex to keep one engrossed for weeks. Most pages are too mindboggling to be handed more than a few at a time. He supplies your imagination with so much matter that you can almost sense your brain cells seething with creativity or to say the least a pleasant confusion and agitation. The book is full of mysteries and laughter, massacres and births, people who have same names, flying carpets, Sanskrit, alchemists, wars, women who live to hundred years of age, bastards, failed and flourished businesses, and every imaginable occupation that can be thought of in a small time AND MUCH MUCH MORE. Read it!"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I was cajoled into reading this &quot;required reading for all of humanity&quot; masterpiece. I had to fight to finish this novel - I thought that at the very least, it would be as magical as Allende's House of Spirits, but I was severely disappointed. Unlike everyone else (or so it seems everyone else), this book did not change my sensibilities. The best part of the book was the last 40 or so pages, which ALMOST, almost, made the other 400 pages worthwhile. I do not doubt Garcia Marquez' talent -- what I do believe is a lot was lost in the translation!"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This book is mind blowing! It drove me crazy, and the ending was insane! I think this is author is a genius and until you read this book you will not understand what I am saying..."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This was another summer reading assignment for my son, who was surprised to find out how much he came to love this novel. A must read - highly recommend Gabriel Garcia Marquez novels."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This is the most LUSH book I have ever read. The content is heady like the humid air of the rainforest. It is dense with wise, human understanding, the style straddling poetry and prose. I'll often re-read a paragraph in breathless amazement of what I've just read. I must take it in small bites - as if it's simply too rich, like a steak with bernaise sauce. But each re-reading brings joy."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I just read Love in the Time of Cholera before this. Marquez has a way with words. They are unlike other fiction I've read. They completely transplant me into the world he creates. As with Love, I felt the environment in every paragraph and experienced the atmosphere the way I imagined the characters t experience it. This novel in particular explores love, pride, deception, family. It evokes feelings of passion, pain, longing, fear of wasted time. I really did enjoy it, I hope my next novel is as giving as this was."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I first met Marquez through this classic in the home of a friend, but I had to leave before I finished (100 years is, after all, a long time). So I had to buy it. I have a Colombian daughter in law, but she surprisingly hadn't studied him in college. It's kind of a side issue in the novel, as well as in daily life in Colombia, but low-key internal &#34;war&#34; has been going on for more than 100 years. A fascinating place described by one of the world's great authors."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I would recommend GGM's works to every serious reader. However, I would also recommend some experience of the history and culture of his context before beginning. I have read three of his works in quick succession hoping I could benefit from an &#34;immersion&#34; experience. I think now Marquez requires more preparation."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This is a great book, but it just didn't hook me. Really the last 1/4 of the book was the best, so worth a bit of a slog through some earlier parts. Maybe it is the translation from Spanish to English, and maybe its that families don't play as key of a role in our identity in U.S. culture as in Latin American culture. It just didn't seem as lyrical and moving as I was expecting. Nonetheless GGM's writing style is unique and fascinating, and the book does provide a glimpse into another way of viewing the world."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"There's no question that this is a beautifully wrought piece of literature from one of our greatest Latin American voices. But this doesn't mean you don't need to put in work to really get all that you can out of it.I've put off reading this impressive work for just that reason ' its accolades and reputation make it a bit intimidating. Once you enter the microcosm of Macondo, you realize that the number and names of the characters can be unwieldy. This is my advice: take it slow. Maybe read half of it and put it down for awhile. M&aacute;rquez's storytelling tone and tenor lend itself very easily to a leisurely stroll through this novel. Don't rush through it.The exploration of life itself, with its unbearable solitude, economic highs and lows, friendships, family, culminating death, and every other facet of life reminds me of the great Russian works that, as Kurt Vonnegut said of The Brothers K, contain \\"everything there [is] to know about life.\\" Surely this is true of One Hundred Years of Solitude."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Gabriel Garcia Marquez is a master at his craft, and this is is one of his best books. He invented magical realism, a style that has influenced many Latin American authors. It's a classic and a wonderful read."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"From what I've heard, this book is far more powerful in the original Spanish, and I can only lament that I don't speak Spanish. I felt that long stretches of the book, such as Colonel Buendia's various revolutions and the chapters dealing with the banana plantation, were great. The elements of magical realism were as touching as they were astonishing. But I never grew unaccustomed to the book's pace, which moves herky-jerky through the decades, sometimes focusing on a single event for pages, then leaping several weeks in a single sentence. In the end, I felt like I hadn't gotten to know a single character. All the people in the book mystified me. Their fears, hopes, and regrets, were lost on me."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I'm not sure I would classify this book as one of my favorites, and yet it is entirely profound. Written in a beautiful style that is amazingly complex at the same time it is beautifully simple, One Hundred Years of Solitude reveals a true mastery of composition. The themes are as grotesque as they are beautiful, realistic and at the same time fantastical, bright and full of hope and at the same time cast in a hopeless darkness. Definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Anytime you're reading a book in which multiple characters existing at the same time have the same or similar names, there's bound to be a little confusion. Thank heaven for the family tree at the front of the novel. I kept flipping to it to remember who everyone was, how they were related, who was dead and who was still alive. The story isn't exactly linear, either. There will be a mention of someone dying, then three pages later they are alive again because the narrative is so recursive. That took some getting used to, but it kind of adds to the thematic idea that time is fluid, that history repeats itself.Confusion aside, it really is a stunning book: grand in proportion, very interesting to read. It is heartbreaking to watch the town of Macado fall into ruin after years of prosperity, its people forgotten. The style reminded me a lot of Faulkner, with his sprawling sentences and a focus on disturbing family history. I did enjoy reading it, even though I constantly had to flip back to figure out which Aureliano or Jose Arcadio we were talking about now. If you're a fan of family epics, or of Marquez, you'd probably love it."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I read this book over a year ago and after recommending it to everyone who cared to listen, realized that I had not written a review. This book is a riveting, entertaining, sometimes heart wrenching story of a family (several generations) set in the fictional Macondo. I don't want to give away anything but...I consider this an epic. If you like well written, complex, books this is for you. There are several characters in the book so if you like short simple reads, this is not the book for you. This was my first Garcia book and I am now hooked. I have read a few more but this one is by far my favorite! Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I truly cannot remember the last time I have read something so imaginitive and insightful. While this book is sure to make you laugh, the wisdom imparted through hysterical and fantastic happenings is almost chilling at times. This book reminds me of Voltaire's \\"Candide,\\" in that it takes a satirical tone towards the human race. A piece of advice: Definitely read this book at a time when you won't have to take too much time away from it. The character list is long, and it can be difficult to become reoriented. A perfect vacation read!"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I don't usually write reviews, because I'm not sure I'm very good at them, but this is my favorite book of all time, and I couldn't pass up the opportunity.This book is nothing short of prolific. Not only does it follow the history of a family but also that of a nation, from la violencia to the problems of United Fruit imperialism. Garcia-Marquez gives the reader a true view of the Colombian culture, from machismo to religion and almost everything in between.But more than what this book is about is how it is told. I admit that I love Magic Realism and Latin American fiction in general, not everyone does. However even beyond the genre and subject of the book, the way it is told--the rambling narrative resembling an oral story--immerses the reader into something deeper than a story, more like a tradition. If you read this story as more of a child listening to a fantastic bedtime story with fascination than an adult with clear definitions of what is real and what is unbelievable, then perhaps the book will be more accessible. Perhaps it is the austere Western tradition of Realism that makes this book intolerable to some readers. However if for no other reason, you should read this book just to know how other cultures write, and what is important to the author of the third world. But even if you come to this book with reservations, I would really be surprised if anyone was disappointed."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Let me begin by saying this is probably the most difficult book that I have ever read - at least when that difficulty is created in a valid manner - not simply by a lack of clarity of vision or expression, or by a forced tortuous plot path that aims to \\"keep the reader guessing\\" in a tiresome manner...The first time that I tried to read it, I was on vacation with my new amour and her children, and I was unable to give it proper attention. I could see that it was a very different work, but because I wasn't giving it the effort it demands, it seemed more strange than anything, and I put it down after 70 pages.The second time that I picked it up, I gave it my full attention, and perhaps 100 pages in, I was simply entranced, and realized that this was without a doubt the greatest book that I had ever read. The passion, the vitality, the insight and wisdom into human nature, and the challenges and surprises in life; the effortless use of language are in my opinion unmatched by any other, or by Marquez himself in his other works. Do not look for the beauty of this book only in its plot, since as with any work of literature, that is really the surface level. Marquez's weaving of the storyline is just pure magic, and his rendering of the characters and their actions is done in a manner that yields nothing to poetry in terms of it's richness, beauty and sophistication - but this is no short poem, it's a full length novel. This is truely a master work by a giant of literature - a person not only of ferocious intellect, but also very driven, because even for Marquez, this must have been a tremendous effort to sustain such a level of complexity, clarity and poetry through such a long work.As I approached the final chapters, I was wishing that this book would never end, and have searched in vain since then for another work of this stature."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This is definately one of my all time favorite books. The trick is to pay close attention to the family tree in front so you don't get confused. It's a great read for anyone interested in history, anthropology, english, lit.... Serious and amusing, nothing comes close to describing how perfect this book describes humanity. Read it."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This is a wonderful book, the author is so creative. Its so nice to read a book and get lost in a fantasy world."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"One Hundred Years of Solitude is a very interesting book and a brief synopsis of its plot would involve sex, violence, death, war, and adventure--all topics that usually hold a reader's attention. Unfortunately, it is also a very difficult book to read because of the confusion caused by repetitive names, the reality mixed with fable style of the narrative, and the pace of the novel which jumps around constantly. This poses a problem for someone like myself who often likes to read on the bus or just for a few minutes before I go to sleep--I could not get in a ryhthm and would forget important details so the book did not always make sense. When I had time to concentrate it was beautifully written, intense, and interesting, so I would highly recommend it for someone with the time to really delve into and read it in long stretches. For people who like to read great literature but don't have much time to devote to this book, I would recommend you come back to this one later when you can devote yourself to it."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Until the English language undergoes considerable change, I don't think there will be any translators of \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude\\" other than Gregory Rabassa. I know enough Spanish vocabulary to sense a strong fidelity with the original text. This fidelity is consistently maintained throughout, but not through a word for word translation. Very few literal translations convey the meaning of a text. Rather, this text preserves meaning through what I'd call a holistic fidelity to the original words. In many cases, Rabassa does mirror the original, but in cases where a mirror rendering would interrupt the flow of thought, he aptly conveys the mood or image of the moment through carefully crafted syntax and phrasing. The text creates a moving picture in the mind once you're in the flow. You become sucked into a whirlwind of thought, that builds like an orgiastic frenzy right to an inevitable culmination.This is not an easy book to read, in English or Spanish. There's lots of narrative, long sentences, and dialogue is only used at certain key moments. The first fifty or sixty pages may seem trite or silly, but if you go back and read them after you've read the rest, you'll almost certainly be muttering to yourself. Remember Melquiades. Don't worry if you confuse the characters. The text will move you foward, and you'll understand. If not, go back after you've finished. Do not skip ahead at any point while you are reading. This book can change the way you look at fiction forever. Stick with it!"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"...And magically real. Starting within the end, while terminating where it begins, the legend of the imaginary-and-mega-tangible village of Macondo (a.k.a. One Hundred Years of Solitude) is nothing but the consummate story of humanity and the world, with a certain-whatever (un)established civilisation in between... The saga of the descendants of Jos&eacute; Arcadio Buend&iacute;a, in (perhaps foregoing) and proceeding generations, is one and all, all in one, framed in a scenario where everything exists - though that is yet to be discovered. Within the indefinite and everlasting countless Jos&eacute; Arcadio(s) and Aureliano(s) (fill in the blank, or count them if you will), or &Uacute;rsula(s) and Remedios(es), lies the completeness of a novel as universal as night and day, where anyone can relate to anything - and where there are no boundaries between the real and the fantastic, solitude abounding.Woven by tales which repeat themselves all over again, endlessly, the grandiosity in this particular work by the finest writer Latin America has ever delivered lies in the very (post)structure of its own textuality, in its own deconstruction, in its own simulation. Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez's Buend&iacute;a network in the unfolding Macondo extends its representation to that of one hundred years of existence, wherever and whenever and whatever and whomever and however, while it recollects and reassembles the general wonder, sorrow, celebration, disgrace, ecstasy, stigma, and amazement that we refer to as life (but don't forget that, like in the novel, if it lacks a name due to its being too recent, you can grant it one by pointing at it).To put it in a few words, whether or not you're Ursula or Jos&eacute; Arcadio, or Aureliano or Remedios, a bit of each one or all of them at once, One Hundred Years of Solitude is your story and that of your environs, of your passions and emotions - the story instructing the outburst of being able to start all over again, of living one hundred years in the company of a novel so delightful which could be read way over one hundred times per life..."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This is the book about which its author said that he preferred the English-language translation to his own Spanish original. Besides being a remarkable admission, it is a fine tribute to the translator who, quite frankly, deserves it. This is a tremendous book but might not be discernible as such to us English types, without the translation. Knowing friends have told me that the French version is also excellent.Still that is not to detract (and how could one?) from the original work. It is a wonderful story told with supreme control by an author in his prime. One could go on about the &quot;magical realism&quot; so dear to certain schools of thought about South American literature, but enough has been said elsewhere. Yet it is a unique writing style and the book is all the better for having this advantage. There is a landscape to explore and a cultural background to examine with which we northerners are not familiar. For some reason, the book reminds me partly of Castaneda - there's a dryness to the text as there is on the ground and the houses seem to be earth-floored dwellings needing a good broom to keep in them in order. Yet these are just vague impressions gleaned from a wider reading.I don't think anyone who enjoys reading should miss this. On a list of my favourite 100 books, this would be very high up."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This book is captivating. One can only read on, living the plot, experiencing the events, loving, hating, existing within it. A fabulous tale, swirling around the characters, taking the reader for a journey. Similar to a Steinbeck novel in it's themes and subjects, this book is a timeless great. The author has spun a story made of gold."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I have read this book for a three times and I stil find here something, which can cheer me up. Marquez\` magic realizm is very sensitive and vital. His novel will be probably always in my bookcase."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"It is problematic for any reader to describe this book. Adjectives seem rather limiting. As a historian, Marquez manages to fold the entire history of Columbia into 100 years. As a poet, he evokes a sense of wonder with the material from beginning to end, as if seeing the world with the eyes of a child and the wisdom of the elderlymembers of the Buendia clan. The writing evokes imagery and metaphor which survives translation. Despite the novel's scope, we never lose interest in the maddening pursuits of the individual Buendias; Jose Arcadio's attempts at scientific inquiry, the tyranny of a thinly disguised Dole banana company, the military genius (ineptitude?) of Colonel Aureliano Buendia fascinate. You never feel suffocated by the expanse of time; you wish for it to disappear, for Marquez to magically grant his characters immortality. Instead he sends time in circles, as new generations replace the old ones, until time finally stops altogether. Give this book to someone you love; when they ask what it's about, shrug. &quot;Life,&quot; you can tell them. The genius of Marquez is that simple."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"hello!!!!! the best book ever. this man is a genius, i don't care if he smoked something or not. it's a book you enjoy and enjoy, the way the characters seem to live all together, and bring each other from death. everything they go through, its VERY representative of latinamerican myths, and brings so much of real history into it, it's fascinating.......READ IT."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I read this book in my freshman year of college. I loved it. It has many characters that flow together. The story has a magical realism to it. Characters die and come back to life, people live for years on end. It follows the lives of a family that deals with wars, tragic love, and mysterious dealings. I thorougly enjoyed reading this book and I recommend it to anyone who wants to enter a magical world filled with vibrant characters taking on all sorts of political and social issues to heart and then bending them as far as they can go. Think Dali."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I was pleasantly surprised to find this on Oprah's list. I read this book in college and it was my first exposure to magic realism. Such imaginative narrative is hard to come by and who could forget such events as the discovery of a dead angel, the whole town suffering from insomnia, or the beautiful Remedios (one of many)ascending to heaven? Just as a sidenote I find one of the characters toward the end is disturbingly like Michael Jackson with his lifestyle of decadence and his penchant for the company of little boys. It's a book that is very sensual and colorful, I would love to see it transferred successfully to film. But this book is not for anyone. Just for those who love truly imaginative literature."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I would like to take this moment to state that I am enamored with the way Gabriel Garcia Marquez writes. One Hundred Years of Solitude is the third book by Marquez that I have read. The first Marquez book I picked up was Love in the Time of Cholera and I was blown away by the story and the remarkable and beautiful prose. Next, I picked up a small novel of Marquez's, Memories of My Melancholy Whores, and once again walked away delighted. I found that Marquez had a very unique ability to create emotional ties to the characters in his stories. I also found that I was reveling in the joys of those characters, as well as suffering their grief. Unfortunately, in One Hundred Years of Solitude, I never made those emotional connections.One Hundred Years of Solitude is a novel that is ostensibly about a family, the Beundias, and the lot they drew which apparently leads to eternal suffering and misery for everyone in the family. As compelling as that theme should be, I found that deep down, the story was simply about a town, Macondo and the suffering is tangential and always on the periphery.Marquez does tell the reader that the characters are suffering, and he does so with vivid language:\\"The need to feel sad was becoming a vice as the years eroded her...\\"\\"He could not understand why he had needed so many words to explain what he felt in war because one was enough: fear...\\"\\"Rebeca, who had needed many years of suffering and misery in order to attain the privileges of solitude...\\"These are all beautiful descriptions of grief and torment; however, over the course of the novel, each set of characters is replaced about every thirty pages. No relationships or attachments are formed between the reader and the character. So, while I can see the pain and suffering, I can read the eloquent descriptions, I could not feel the emotion.The disconnect I felt while reading One Hundred Years of Solitude made finishing the novel a chore. The disconnect, along with frustration, grew with the passing of each set of characters. I found myself not really caring how Marquez wrapped up the end of the book, as long as the book ended. Therefore, I found the story had no climax, no central moment, no real theme other than \\"suffering exists\\".I was once told that if you have nothing nice to say, then don't say anything at all. Well, I may have broken that rule, but, I will stop here so that I avoid digressing and letting my frustration show anymore than I already have.For more reviews and suggestions, please visit: [...]"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Horrible! Boring and could not keep my interest. I stopped reading after the first 3 chapters because sleep kept invading my read time."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I read this book based on the assumption of its international acclaim and because I had previously appreciated other nobel winning others such as Naipaul, Hesse, and Morrison, who were each representive of diverse culture and human understanding in their novels. I could see the same context in One Hundred Years of Solitude, but, I feel what hampers my opion of this book is that its seems nothing but a gathering of short stories compiled together until you get a book long enough to be called a novel. As the generarions are mingled and the characters are never developed, one can see the reccurring theme that they are all disilluisioned by meaningless war, blind love and a dying culture. These themes are tremendously important but they are not ideally emphasized theatrically are with enough beautiful sadness to affect the reader. Just merely alluded to after a set of strange magical events occur. If you do decide to read this novel I think it is very imprtant to look at the context and not the characters."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"i thought that this book was great"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This book was highly recommended by a number of people who knew I was going to visit Colombia. They said it would explain the culture and tell the story of Colombia. After visiting Colombia and immersing myself in the culture and history of this incredible country, I do not see the fit. Colombia is a country with energy, action and forward momentum rather than a sleepy melancholy society chasing its tail."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"My experience with 100 Years of Solitude has been that people either love it or they absolutely hate it, but I'm apathetic about it. I had to read it for a world cultures class in college and not even the teacher could tell us how it was relevant to what the class was about. The repetition of the men's names makes for a very confusing story line, and the son that was born with a tail? Weird, to say the least. But apparently this book inspires a lot of people judging by the previous reviews. I would suggest that you read it if for no other reason than to form your own opinion about it."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I enjoyed the first hundred pages or so. The symbolism was very intriguing, but after a while it was just confusing with too many characters and a meandering plot. I could not stay awake long enough to finish it."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I fortunately was introduced to &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot; in an abridged version on audio cassette. The tape came with a printed guide which explained magical realism. I have found that it is easier to deal with &quot;difficult&quot; books like these if they are on tape (Toni Morrison comes to mind.&quot;) To expect someone to understand a novel in the genre of &quot;magical realism&quot; with no explanation of what it is , in my mind is pointless and unfair. To then accuse them of not being serious readers is also unfair. I listened to the book and found it interesting but not compelling or illuminating."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I wonder if only the good reviews get notice or do the people who don't care for it much take the time to comment on it. Not worth the effort,couldn't finish it."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"In what appears to be a stab at Western values this Prize winning author has created a confusing mess.Many people take this book and wade through it seeking some sort of enlightenment from such a prestigious work (Nobel Prize 1982). When, in reality, this book is a sophomoric slap at US and Western European anti-communist policies of the Cold War.I am not saying the Western policies were sound, but I will say that communism and the system it supported have been proven to be morally bankrupt and fiscally unsound. Perhaps the politics of the time pushed the Nobel Committee into giving an award that could have been given elsewhere."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"What is the point of this book? It doesn't have one, in my opinion. The author himself said that the reason for writing it was that he wanted to write a book about incest! I really do not enjoy graphic descriptions of this incest, either. I would not reccommend it to anyone, in fact, I tell others NOT to read it. I wouldn't have read past the tenth page if I hadn't been required to for my English class."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Marquez has such an eloquent way with words. He canalso spin an excellent tale as evidenced by this book.But, what I enjoyed most about the book was the strengthand depth of emotion which he was able to convey throughthe written word. This book pulls you into a magical andmorbid world and holds you hostage until the ending. It isan immense book, but well worth the committment. I wouldespecially recommend it to young developing writers. Thisbook will definitely increase your artistic perspectives."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"The One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel Garcia Marquez is one of the most interesting novel I have ever read. First it starts with a married couple who are counsins, afraid that they will have a child with a pig tail, a myth about what happens when you marry close relations. This novel has the most confusing set of characters with the same name carried on from generation to generation. And this novel has some of the most interesting events that you will ever read. As you read this novel, you can actually see each charactrer falling into their life of solitude, one by one.This novel is very good, and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"&quot;It's as if the world were repeating itself,&quot; (Marquez, 298). Every year, every decade, every generation, lives are being repeated over and over again. The names Jose Arcadio and Aureliano appear throughout the Buendia family tree, causing the same mistakes and the same love wars. When Rebeca comes to live with the Buendia family as a very distant cousin, she is welcomed and grows to the age where she notices men. She notices Pietro Crespi first. So does her cousin, Amaranta. Amaranta swears that Rebeca will die before she marries Pietro, yet it is not Rebeca that dies, but Amaranta's sister-in-law, Remedios. The feeling of hate and revenge continues in Amaranta's life, even though Rebeca spurns Pietro and marries her cousin Jose Arcado (junior). There are many people in the family, many married to relatives, or in love with them, and many that have many illegitimate children. Such as Colonel Aureliano Bruendia, who has 17 sons, all with different mothers, and with the same name as their father. But in the end, everyone feel alone, everyone is alone, though they are surrounded by people. This is a fantasy book where one village can withstand the modern world, can live in its own corner without discovery. But when that discovery comes, all that is there is betrayal, loneliness, and war. Everyone is trying to be who they are, but they just keep repeating the mistakes that their grandfathers made, with no other side of the rainbow. There are many bad characters and people who become those who are despised most. But in the end, there is just solitude. A state of just being, if only for yourself. These people lead enchanted lives, only to die while urinating. They see the ghosts of those long gone and long forgotten. This adds to the theme of solitude. Where no matter how many brothers, sons, girlfriends you have, all that remains is you. Such is the case with the Colonel. His wife of about 12 years dies and his 17 sons are all murdered and that leaves only him. This book is not the best reading. The beginning begins to take off, and then there is about twenty pages of dull description and such. Keep reading the book and you'll get to the parts that are interesting to everyone. There are about four such parts, but there is so much action that one can be interested if they just keep reading on. The theme was held strong with great ideas, and everyone ended up lonely. For this one theme to seep through the entire novel is a great sign of a well-written book."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I recognize the importance of this book and it's achievement in literary history as well as for latin american literature, but the book is still very difficult to read only because I wanted to enjoy it so much, but often found myself lost. Maybe that's what is supposed to happen, but it gets frustrating. I found A Clockwork Orange, Trainspotting, Maribou Storke Nightmares and Slaughterhouse Five all easier to read than this and most of those took some work. It doesn't have anything to do with the words or dialog. I admire the simple prose and find a majority of the book thoughtful and beautiful, but the circular story structure and the multitude of character names being so similar (especially in the later generations) does start to wear on you. I recommend it, with a warning."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"By and large, I did not appreciate this book. Most of the characters are stick figures - not very likable or dislikable, and essentially uninteresting despite their eccentricities. Halfway through the book, I was tempted to toss it in the trash. However, I did find the last generation or two of characters to be more engaging than their ancestors; the characters seemed more recognizably human, perhaps because Marquez found it easier to write about people closer to his own time."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I definitely agree with the reviewer below, who said people either love this book or hate it. This book was suggested to me by my junior HS English teacher, and it took me about 1 week and a half to finish. Normally, I can finish a book within a day or two. The reading took me longer, not because it's a big book (it's not), but because it is very intense. One Hundred Years is a marvelous story about the Buend&iacute;a family, and their trials and tribulations. I remember this story so vividly because it's hard to forget. My favorite character was the family matriarch, Ursula. None of the other female characters, in my opinion, could hold a candle to her. Whether she was taking care of poor senile Jose, or dealing with the pain of losing sons and grandsons, or even dealing with (in her old age) the bugs and plants her great-great grandchildren piled on her, she was a rascally character I couldn't help but admire.The ending was very different from anything I could have predicted, but in hindsight, the ending looks inevitable. It's a twist, a very different ending, then what most people are used to, and Marquez tells the story so fluidly, I think many are disappointed or even frustrated by the end. All in all, I think One Hundred Years is a terrific book club book, because this book needs to be shared and discussed."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Most magnificent, incredible novel that flows by like a bizarre dream but like most dreams lacks coherent plot or discernable direction. It's good, compassionate, humane, complex and very long folk tale spiced with philosophy and politics. Unfortunately I don't speak Spanish well enough to read this masterpiece in the original but I read it both in English and Russian translation and I would recommend it to any mature reader. An English speaker should only attempt to read this book if he is comfortable with other large foreign novels. If you can handle large works of Dostoevski (Dostoevsky) or Balzac in period translation, - cover to cover, - then go ahead. Otherwise don't even try to because what you'd be up against is pure torture. An abridged version of the novel or the same work narrated by a professional actor on audio tape could be considered a lighter cuisine but I am not familiar with either abridged version or the tapes. I guess people from nations which have had long periods of civil unrest and war on recent their historic consciousness could better relate to this work, its atmosphere and its characters than those who lack such experience or for whom it would be an extremely distant historic memory. While it is certainly not an easy read, as a complete work of literary art the One Hundred Years of Solitude must be one of the best 20th century novels written in any language."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"When reading is a chore and makes absolutely no sense at all, what is the point? I could not have made it through this book at all without the family tree in the front since so many of the characters have the same or similar names. I read on and on thinking it was going to all start making some sense or there would be a big ending, but in the end I put it down and felt like it was a huge waste of my valuable reading time. I re-sold the book as fast as I could unload it. It is really interesting and amazing to me how so many people love this book....I'm a reader in general but this one I just don't quite grasp. It is a nightmare of a read."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I heard about this book at roughly the same time from several independent sources and I took it as a sign that I must read it. I'm at page 200, and I'm still awaiting the brilliance and genius that it's supposed to embody.The repetition of family names is confusing. The plot, if there is a definite one, is somewhat stream-of-consciousness, which makes it difficult to follow at times. I understand the magical realism concept, but I'm not that charmed with it. The characters are vividly described, both on the outside and inside, but I've felt no real attachment to any of them. They feel more like caricatures than real people. Maybe I'm just not getting the book or its message. (What is the message?) I think it may be about how government and modernism can corrupt a simple people. But it's difficult to be sure, as it's disguised among the thickness of surrealism, incest, suicide, and murder. The incestuous scenes abound and were a shock to me. Why so much incest? Perhaps I'm failing to grasp the unique Latin-American culture this book is supposed to have captured so perfectly. I will say that Garcia Marquez certainly has an original writing style, and I have gotten a kick out of some of his creative metaphors.Otherwise, I'm having a hard time staying with the book, but in fairness I will read it all the way through . However, it has not been a page-turner thus far."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"a great book but it can be a little decieving. It will be different than anything you have ever read... and that can make it a little troubling... and tedious at times, however when you finish youl feel great about it and love it. so there ya go.check it out."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"It is incredible what this book can do, considering myself quite ayoung reader I can say that it was this novel the one that forged my future as far as the reading. 4 years ago with only 13 years this book arrived in my hands, in my opinion i had already had enough youth novels already and i felt prepared to to move on and so i decided that this would be the book with which would begin my reading maturity. If this was the best or worse desicion of my life i don't know, by one side it was the best one because i found my favorite book and writer aswell, but on the other hand it can also be the worse because no longer can i be conformed to reading light novels that do not make me feel as much reality in fictitious facts as they words of Garcia Marquez made me feel. That is what moves me to continue looking for something that gives that back to me , feeling so entered in a history that also becomes part of my history. I have nothing more to say than,if you have the opportunity to read this masterpiece don't give it a second thought and do it."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Marquez masterpiece is confused hodge podge of mystical comedy intwoven with futlity, fuzzy logic and frustration. Marquez tells the story of the town of Macondo founded by Jose Arcadio Buendia. The book revolves around three generations of the family that tells the history of the town and its inhabitants. Marquez moves in a semi linear fashion using major events to move along the 100 year timeline. The Buendia family is full of lively characters most severly faulted in various manners and each having their own little piccadillioes. Offspring share only a handful of names and all people with the same namesake are painfully famliar. The town is amidst of curses, magic and wonder in an interesting dichotomy that combines the majestic with the tragic. Every character is doomed to fail or change in some undesirable way except for Ursula Buendia whose love and warmth is only extinguished in her death. The men are bullheaded and all the characters are two dimensional and predictable in their actions and reactions but Marquez uses this represent his chatoic and futile world where nothing can be prevented. Macondo and its inhabitants are unable to change or adapt to the modernizing world and thus eventually must succumb to its fate.This is one of those sometimes wonderful, sometimes frustrating books that goes on a little too long. Marquez style can't maintain interest the whole book and I got upset with the characters after awhile because of thier similarity.Bottom Line: 50 years of solitude would of preferable! Fans interested in Latin Literature should check it out but I prefer Love In A Time Of Cholera to this."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Not sure why this book has been so raved about. When I bought it, the book store clerk told me it was his \\"favorite book ever\\". That's quite an endorsement.I found it to be really uninteresting. It's almost all exposition, with little dialogue. The characters may be \\"memorable\\", but only because they're \\"boring\\". None of them have any personality (although one is well-endowed, which is nice) and is the author just *trying* to be difficult when he gives them all such similar names?This book felt like the authors parents told him lots of stories and fables when he was growing up, and he tried to cram them all into one long stream on consciousness tale. I abandoned it half-way through."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"It's hard to make up your own mind when you hear so much praise about a book such as this one. It feels wrong to assign negative comments to a work labeled a world classic and whose author received the Nobel Prize.Indeed, the literary flowers abound inside and the ending is among the best. Marquez is a language virtuoso and imaginative (what else do you want from a writer, eh?) But, I did not enjoy reading this story at all. The narrative is a rather remote 3rd person omniscient, similar to what you would find in a fairy tale, that goes on about various situations happening to many generations of a family. It is not specific about the psychology of characters but looms large, an epic, if you want.As far as I am concerned - and perhaps I am blas&eacute; - I could not care less about these situations or these characters. I felt the scenes were like anecdotes, unimportant and leading nowhere. I had the strange impression the writer had literary diarrhea showing off his prowess with words.The fact that every once in a while a seemingly gratuitous sex or incest fantasy would happen to these characters who seldom ever love annoyed me. A beautiful love story? Are you kidding? Only the last couple love each others but they are related in blood and end up in a bad place.There are other epics to read that are more glorious and have more staying power. This one was not to my liking."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I am not even going to touch the fabula of the story; many before me have done it.I am going to comment on another aspect of the book.In the age of 20, after having red almost ENTIRE European wonderful literature and some of most important works of North American authors, I developed allergy to father reading. The reason was that having absorbed all literary styles and techniques, all the new books I was coming across where boring to me because of predictability.Then........... One day I saw a book in the hands of one of my fellow students. Totally oblivious of the author and Latin American culture I snobbishly remarked-\\"Can anything good come from Galilee\\"? (Of course being well aware that the Good came from the Galilee)My friend answered don't be so fast, just read the first paragraph.I did... It was overwhelming magical experience. All the time got mixed in my soul like in the paragraph. I could not believe the surrealistic magical tour de force I was getting into. I end up almost forcefully borrowing the book. That night I red one third of the book and for the first time in my life I didn't finish a book that I loved, in one sitting. The amount of joy was so immense that I for the first time in my life wanted to take time off to digest and prolong the excitement and elation.This book opened for me the amazing Latin American literature and again brought me back to reading.Dostoevsky once said that Don Quixote of Cervantes will be enough to present to the God to absolve the sins of humankind.I am not sure if this book could serve for the same purpose, but most certainly it brought the Speech as close to its quintessence-Music- as humanly possible.Jorge Borges is another titan of Latin prose, one of my very top, but... he definitely is not for the masses; he is solely for erudite reader.This book is in the list of 10 most important books of my life.Even though chronologically the last to join the list, but existentially in almost the top of the list (second or third)!!!"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I read this book before it became an Oprah pick- and was almost appalled that she had chosen it as something she deemed worthy for others to spend their precious time reading! It started out good to me, I didn't mind the magic realism. I actually thought it was quite charming. But after awhile it seemed that the story just went on, and on, and on... with no real end in sight. Most of the book just seemed kind of like page fillers to me,with no real significance to the story. I was ready to put the book down before I got even half way through, but forced myself to trudge through it to the bitter end. As far as recommendations go, I would recommend passing on this book- or at least borrowing it from a devoted Oprah book club reader. Don't spend your money on it."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"If you are looking for something simple that has no depth, this isn't it. Unless you enjoy Tolstoy or Faulkner, this book will be difficult for you to comprehend. Some people prefer light, easy reads with predictable characters, and that is ok.

I havnt read any of the authors other works, which may be a little more deserving. Anyhow, the book is genuinely origional. The idea of a story that goes through a whole family's rise and fall was great, the repetiton of names, however much it was needed for the underlying ideology of the story, got to be a little too much for me to bear though, bordering on annoyance. The book itself never really drew me into it either, too many parts of it read like a history textbook, by the time the last few chapters rolled around I was just reading to finish it up, desperately hoping for something to save it, and the ending, however meaningful, was too little too late. The book did have its moments, dont get me wrong, but for me the cons too much outwieghed the pros."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I read (well, not really...I got to page 100 and felt like I'd read it three times already) this book over ten years ago and I still rank it as the worse piece of tripe that I ever had the misfortune to come across.

However, I found the book extremely hard to follow, and without any identifyable plot line. Yes, it is interesting to see how a city can develop over 100 years of time, but all the characters kept dying off, and I found myself not being bothered by it, as nothing made me connect with them through the book.

I kept waiting for the story to generate even a spark of interest but it just never happened for me. Admittedly Marquez is a gifted writer and for this reason I was tempted to award the book 2 stars, but if I had to sum up the book in one word it would be PAINFUL, thus the single star. I've read a number of 'classics' which were difficult reads, but there were usually rewards for the effort.

As I continued to read, waiting for the plot to kick in, or for something to persuade me to keep reading, I realized the moment would never come. This book represents some of the worst writing I have ever encountered, and it seemed like Marquez was trying too hard to sound poetic. Oh, and after hanging on to witness the full plot, I discovered that there really isn't one.

Each Buendia lives their own unique lives, with some of them being travelers, and some secluding themselves from the rest of the world. The viewpoint of this book is through the eyes of the the town as the citizens see themselves growing into modernization with the discoveries of Melquiades and Jose Arcadio Buendia, and the Banana Company, who will later haunt the town with it's massacre. The uniqueness of the lives of the family and the residents of this town has made this book a metaphor for the reaches of imagination, and fixes the reader's brain to think perceptively about life."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I was thouroughly impressed at how beautifully this book was translated,nothing was lost.

I recommend everyone read this book!"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"The first time I read this masterpiece, it was a requirement for one of my college literature classes. This could have proved unfortunate, for as anyone knows, being 'forced' to read a book lends an unfairness to the possible greatness of the piece. Anyhow, this did not turn out to be the case in &quot;A Hundred Years&quot; -- I read it once for class and then a second and a third time and I plan to read it many more times throughout my life. Words cannot bring justice to Marquez's ability to paint words and phrases on parchment with the meticulous care of Chopin or Michaelangelo. It is simply four-hundred plus pages of wonderfully constructed poetry and, in my estimation, the greatest novel ever written."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"One Hunderd Years of Solitude left me disturbed.From the happy tale of two young lovers, who carveout a new village for themselves, to the incestousaccount of the last descendants of the family,the book has the power to unnerve the reader. Thestory rambles, so that you feel that time issuspended in Mocando. And yet as charactersgrow older, you notice that time is in fact movingin a circle. The same members of the family are reborn in theArcadia family, reincarnated as the 100 years passby. The forces compelling them to act as theydo, attract and repel you at the same time. Youtry and understand the events and thecharacters, but sheer incredulity and awe asthe story unfolds, leaves you stupefied.

The recent history of internal dispute among the different political factions, drug traffickers, and the presidency may find an allegorical reflection through some of the fictional characters in One Hundred Years of Solitude just as Dante's Inferno gleaned the political and theological charicatures of his time.

The solitude of the title that underlies the family saga is rarely mentioned yet is apparent it's a reflection of our own solitude; when your dreams become the direct opposite and stays that way.Marquez is Melquaides - writing in code which we can only decipher at life's end.

There is never a page without vivid imagination, without surprises, without a resonance to the human heart, even till the very last page. Marquez tells the story in a natural way. There is no lengthy scenary description, no boring social analysis, no emotional outburst, yet I could see clearly what he is seeing with his imagination, feel what each character is feeling.

Like almost everything in his book, the statement should not be taken literally. Just as a literal interpretation of the Book of Genesis is not required to appreciate the Hebrew bible, this alternative bible begins to make some sense only when you get the metaphor. Everything is known because human nature is what it is. Because we are human, we make the same mistakes over and over. History repeats. And, it repeats. And, it repeats.Marquez's man-made bible history tells you that you do not need his or anyone's written history book to know that pre-historic mothers cried for their future warriors even as they nursed them. Marquez wants you to know that you don't need a bible or a crystal ball to tell you that tomorrow's righteous dads will again be sending their brave sons into some bloody conflict somewhere. Everything is known. The past, the present and the future, it's all known. Marquez lays it out for you in this bible. It's not an easy read.

And this is one of his best books. While long, it is worth the effort."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"&quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot; might be analyzed from various standpoints; political, sociological, historical and literary being the most prominent among them. Politically engaged literature has always been controversial, and it's much too easy to dismiss an author because of the nature of his political leanings. I don't deny that M&aacute;rquez, Dostoyevsky, Bulhakov, Kesey and many other authors had a clear vision of the world, a vision they incorporated into their writing. Certainly, the political outlook and national heritage are inseparable from the particular work under consideration - but is that all there is to literature? I vehemently disagree with that point of view, since novels may be either &quot;written to order by poor hacks for the consumption of the illiterate&quot;, to quote Maugham, or they may be universal and timeless - with all shades of gray in-between, where a book stands on its own, more or less, offering us at least something beyond the overwhelming vision. Where does &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot; fit into the pattern? I think it fares considerably well, considering the political burden it carries, messages it conveys. Analyzed within the larger framework of M&aacute;rquez's literary heritage, the novel offers us quite much, its socialist vision notwithstanding. The times of rebellion and guerilla have passed, the soviet way of thinking, whether political or economical, went bankrupt, rendering the fire of the novel quite bland and naive, I'd say. Written in the late 60s, &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot; offers us a well-written fictional documentary of the emotions and visions polluting Latin America in that decade. I have read quite a few literary accounts of these times, and &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot; is the most readable of them all, since the redeeming qualities of this novel reach far beyond the political dimension. Needless to say, M&aacute;rquez is guilty of various sketches of similar tone and nature, short stories and miniatures also dealing with the bankrupt socialist vision. My sound advice would be to skip all these minor works, and treat yourself to this novel, which is rich in many different ways, being as close to universal as M&aacute;rquez could get in that day and age. Many years later, he wrote a delicious novel, &quot;Of Love and Other Demons&quot;, which lighter in tone than &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot;, calmer, toned down, more humorous, and as deep in the analysis of the Creole society.&quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot; is a multithreaded family saga of the Buendia family. Abstracting from the political connotations of the novel, I was continuously amused with the particular family tradition the Buendias were fond of. Namely, all their male offspring were christened either Aureliano or Arcadio, and since the novel's plot stretches well over the century, as the title might suggest, it is indeed increasingly difficult to keep track of which particular Aureliano or Arcadio is guilty of. The generation mix in the innocent reader's mind, forcing him to go back, and who knows - even make notes? I am very fond of the Buendia family, I admit I admire M&aacute;rquez's portrayal of family ties; the way they evolve in the south, in a region which is so far from anything I have ever known. If you come from the Caribbean or the Latin America, it will all sound familiar, but to the Hyperborean moose it's fascinating. The southern saga is enchanting because of the distinctive voice of M&aacute;rquez, whose observational skills and his ability to retell the family stories with their atmosphere preserved even under translation - are of the highest order. As much as I disagree with him with respect to his vision and sympathies I have mentioned in the introduction to this review, I give him due credit for the apotheosis of the Latin American tradition and culture. Reading &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot;, we grow increasingly attached to the Buendia homestead, mourning along with the author; mourning the passage of time, the disintegration of family ties, the wretched fate of the homestead, the lost lives of the serial protagonist, as emphasized by the reincarnation of Aureliano and Arcadio. Each generation of Aureliano and Arcadio, if you allow me to use this blatant metaphor, is progressively less attached to the land, to the culture, and increasingly engaged in affairs external to the local village, the cultural roots, as they were. M&aacute;rquez finds himself missing the good old times - and honestly, he can't be blamed, as this phenomenon is universal. As different as we are, the nations scattered all over globe, we seem to follow different, divergent paths which nevertheless carry us towards the unknown which is not necessarily better than where we used to be. Indeed.On a personal note, I discovered M&aacute;rquez thanks to one particular relationship I was once involved in. My muse at the time has a great influence on my reading patterns, and despite my enormous reluctance towards Latin American literature, I picked M&aacute;rquez, and since then have devoured his prose to my satisfaction. Weird as it may sound, I associate M&aacute;rquez with winter, with frosted glass of the window, with the puffy bed, where I was hiding from cold, reading M&aacute;rquez, now and then stopping to look outside the window, into the frozen landscape of the city. I feel so, because that was my life, an important moment in it, and thus it's my own, private M&aacute;rquez, one which I am reluctant to share with others."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I avoided reading this book for a long time because of people's claims of how difficult it is. My brother lent it to me and it sat on the shelf for months. With nothing else to read one night I picked it up, and after a few pages was completely absorbed in one of the most passionate, funny and beautiful stories ever written. Even if you're not a fan of magical realism and don't know anything about South American cultures (I wasn't and didn't either), don't be put off. The only thing that requires patience is keeping the characters straight, since there are a lot of them and many are named after each other. Otherwise, the writing is simple, and so elegant it's hard to believe it's a translation."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"My 24 year old daughter had to read this for college, she raved about it all during the time they reviewed it in class. I have always been an avid reader and decided to give it a shot. It was......interesting to say the least, a little hard to follow if you haven't read anything deep and introspective. However I loved the story and it was fun to read"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Solitude. This might be a regular word to many people; just like all the other words they use or know. But to Gabriel Garcia Marquez, the Colombian Nobel Prize Winner, it was an entire novel.The book reflects the author's life, ideology and perspective towards many important themes in life like the relationship between rich and poor isolated countries. It takes us in a journey of deep excavation for the history of mankind, the status of the human condition and the Latin American continent with its rich mixture of cultures and complicated condition. Each character in the novel stands for something of these things, and the fact that the names are repeated throughout the story indicates that everything is interrelated and spins in one circle.The story covers 100 years and six generations of the Buendia family and the foundation of the imaginary village \\"Macondo\\". It's an entire dynasty beginning with Jose Arcadio Buendia and ending with the death of the last family member born with a pig's tale.One day Jose Arcadio Buendia, accompanied with his wife Ursual Iguaran who also happens to be his first cousin, decides to desert his society and build an entirely new village calling it Macondo. Such desire was aroused mainly by his sense of guilt for having killed a man once over a cock-fight.In its beginnings, Macondo was a Utopia where no one has grown old and no one has died. There wasn't even a graveyard. Yet no sooner does the sins and mistakes of people corrupt it, and the story ends with a wind blowing and destroying the entire city. The writer concludes by saying \\"Those who are condemned to one hundred years of solitude have no second chance on earth.\\"The concept of apocalypse is significant in many of the works of Marquez like \\"Chronicle of a Death Foretold\\". As a writer he's interested in the end, the end of the world, the end of time, and how people deal with this concept, do they try to foresee it , and how exactly would they behave if they knew when is their end?One of the very important and interesting characters in the book is Aureliano Jose Arcadio Buendia, who was known in a later stage in his life as \\"Colonel Aureliano Buendia\\". Aureliano is the first born baby in Macondo. When his young wife, Remedios Moscote, dies, he falls into a deep state of depression and decides to get involved in politics. He soon becomes a revolutionary and an opposition leader who engages in many wars against the conservative system. Colonel Aureliano carries the revolutionary spirit prevalent in the content. He's just another Che Guevara or Augusto Cesar Sandino. But he doesn't die fighting. Soon he loses hope in war too and spends the rest of his life in solitude within the boundaries of his family's house making gold fishes. Colonel Aureliano is also known for his predictions. He has the ability to foretell many events in the future and told his mother that his father was about to die a few months before his actual death.This moves us to the concept of magic realism. According to Encyclopedia Britannica magic realism is a \\"chiefly Latin-American narrative strategy that is characterized by the matter-of-fact inclusion of fantastic or mythical elements into seemingly realistic fiction.\\" The Cuban novelist Alejo Carpentier was the first, in the 1940s, to use this strategy after recognizing that it was a special characteristic of much Latin American literature. Other novelists who have also used it are the Brazilian Jorge Amado, the Argentines Jorge Luis Borges and Julio Cortazar, and the Chilean Isabel Allende.Yet this concept doesn't apply only in the case of Aureliano, but it rather plays an integral part in the story and in the composition of its characters.Amaranta, for example, Aureliano's sister, had a prophecy many years before her death telling her that she was going to die the day she finishes making her coffin. \\"Remedios the Beauty\\", Jose Arcadio and Ursula's great-granddaughter, had angels lifting her alive one day into heaven. And Ursula herself lived her entire life making predictions, and her husband had many encounters with the ghost of the man he killed. Melquiades, a gypsy who once gave Jose Arcadio parchments that told the whole story of the Buendia dynasty (but they never understood them because they were written in Sanskrit) returned from death many times, as well.It's important to note that all the members of the Buendia family had an \\"air of solitude\\", except for \\"Remedios the Beauty\\", and maybe that's why she miraculously escaped their extermination. Marquez obviously sees solitude as a sin that leads to destruction. He tries to warn people as and lift their attention to the fact that poor countries, like Colombia, might die at the end if they were left alone and their problems were ignored by the rest of the world. Yet the story also notes that too much foreign intervention and technological advancements can also be major sources of corruption. Prostitutes were brought to Macondo for that reason.Another sin that the Buendias committed and which led to their downfall was that of incest. One of Amaranta's nieces and a great- grand niece both fell for her, but they refused to take any step further fearing that their children might be born with pig tails, as the children of incest usually do. Yet we find the last Aureliano getting deeply into a relationship with his aunt, Amaranta Ursula. They actually do have a son with a pig's tale, who happens to be the last Buendia.The story ends by Amaranta Ursula dying after giving birth, her baby eaten by ants, and the last Aureliano killed by the fierce wind that destroys the entire village moments after he understands Melquiades parchments(which told him the destiny he was about to meet).In 1982 Garcia Marquez received the Nobel Prize for literature. By that time he had many works published like \\"Love in the Time of Cholera\\", \\"The General in His Labyrinth\\" and \\"Of Love and Other Demons\\". Yet \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude\\" continues to be his masterpiece and one of the greatest (if not the greatest) novels written in Latin America."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I tend to run away from any book that Oprah recommends. I mean I love her but if she recommends a book it suddenly turns into a piece of mass consumption and ceases to be a true piece of literature. In fact, it is fairly upsetting that the reason this book is now being read by &quot;the masses&quot; (I am using another reviewer's words here) is because Oprah suggested so.With that said, this book is magnificient. I read it five years ago in English and am about to read it in Spanish. As a Spanish Speaker I can gurantee that the translation is by far the best translation I have encountered in books to this day.This book /can/ be a hard read for people not familiar with magical realism or Marquez at all (and his circular writing style). If you are looking for an easy read this is not it. If you are looking for a rich, beautifully crafted piece of literature then get the book.Still unsure? Do a quick search online for the book and you will find the countless awards this book received (not to mention the fact that Marquez won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1982). It is often listed on the best books of the 20th century.I was sad when the book ended and have reread it since."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"At one level, this book is about the Buendia family, a not-so-typical Columbian family whose members share confusingly similar names and who have many strange/magical things happen to them. Read in this way, the book will not fail to grip and entertain the reader.While one can never know the author's true intentions in writing such a masterpiece, I read this book as an allegory of something much larger. Garcia-Marquez's description of the fascinating rise and fall of the Buendia family seemed to serve as a mere microcosm of humanity, describing and predicting the the rise and fall of humankind. Read this way, the book had a powerful and moving effect on me, symbolizing love, war, peace, remembrance, time, joy, pain, and a plethora of other emotions beyond my ability to characterize.Although Garcia-Marquez's magical realism genre is vastly different than the realism of Mel Gibson's Braveheart, I found it strange and exciting that both were rare in their ability to involuntarily elicit and take control over the entire gambit of my emotions, tying me up in the author's/director's passenger seat to go along for the ride of a lifetime. For this alone, it was worth the read.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I owned this book for nearly a decade before I actually read it, and I still wasn't ready for it when I did. I was hugely disappointed with &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude.&quot; It was my first experience with the genre known as &quot;Magical Realism,&quot; and it just didn't seem to me to work as either magical or realist. My expectations were probably colored by the fact that I grew up reading books that fit solidly into the Fantasy genre, as well as &quot;realistic&quot; books like &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn.&quot; This is not your &quot;Harry Potter&quot; or &quot;A Wrinkle in Time&quot; kind of magic. Not at all.If you have never read Magical Realism before, be prepared to be knocked off your feet and, at times, very confused. It's also quite possible that you, like I, will be disappointed. My best advice for enjoying this book, if you should choose to read it, is to approach it with a very open mind, and throw all of your expectations out the window. I know many people who loved loved loved this book. I sincerely hope that you can enjoy it more than I did. It's been seven years since I read &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude,&quot; and I'm still trying to get over the disappointment of the experience."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"It's very difficult to describe \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude\\". On a very basic level it is the story of the Buend&iacute;a family from the time they found the city of Macondo to ... well, that would give the story away too much, but let's say it chronicles the rise and fall of the town and the family.Like with most great books, however, the story is of minor importance. What we get from this book is wonderful, vibrant, characters - individual, but at the same time, so alike. One of the overwhelming themes in the book, and it's commented on explicitly, is the circle of life. We see the same patterns repeated throughout the generations - literary techniques like the use of the same or similar names for various characters reinforce this.The book also gives us an insight into the politics of the times - and, perhaps of today. In the story a series of wars breaks out between the ruling conservatives and the opposition liberals. These wars, in which one of the great characters of the book, Colonel Aureliano Buend&iacute;a, plays an instrumental role end as the liberals become more and more like the conservatives they despise.One of the greatest influences on Gabriel Garcia Marquez's writing was, apparently, his grandmother who used to mix completely fantastical elements into her story with a total belief in their reality. This same device - though I doubt his grandmother considered it that - is used throughout One Hundred Years of Solitude. Women aged over 145 are commonplace; mysterious gypsies with magical powers are revered; ghosts naturally inhabit the house and interact with the family. The theme of myth and reality is enhanced by the way the villagers trust the gypsie's magic more than modern inventions and the way that events and entire characters in the story become legend by the end of it. \\"What is truth?\\" we ask ourselves.The language used in the book is beautiful; I wish that I had the ability to read it in the native Spanish but I have the impression that the majority of it carries through. Reading the book I was often reminded of Toni Morrisson's Beloved which has similarly beautiful language mixed with themes of family, magic and ghosts too. Some of the themes can be disturbing - incest, near rape, trophy women, etc. are dealt with in a very real way.Finally, if you are at all interested in reading one of the greatest books of literature, you must read this book."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Forgive me if I've missed the point of this book completely, but I feel it is undeserving of the praise. As a fan of \\"Love in the Time of Cholera\\", I was sadly disappointed by this book. Adorers are right in saying this book is a difficult read; I agree with this sentiment, but for different reasons. Read on.My main objection is that the story and the characters in the book don't live or breathe. What I mean is that character actions or propelling story events occur almost spontaneously with no real motivation or sense. The reason behind this is that the majority of the story is told in Marquez's (lyrical) exposition. We're given a hodgepodge of character chatter throughout the story, but the brunt of the novel is description. The problem with this is that Marquez rules the town with an iron fist: random characters arrive and are dead within a span of a page, 'magical' events happen based on Marquez's whim and lacking in cohesion with the other events of the story, motivation for character actions is GIVEN by Marquez in exposition (rather than having the actions flow naturally from our understanding of the characters), etc. So basically, we're reading Marquez's musings on a 'magical' town and its inhabitants. You feel no real compassion towards the main characters because Marquez is simply describing whats going on and telling you exactly how a character feels or acts. Supposedly, this is magical realism at its best. But I found myself rather detached from the proceedings and thought this technique was intensely frustrating.So basically, Marquez's style in this book can only be described as Faulkner with a dash of the brothers Grimm, sort of a fantasy stream of conciousness method of following the events of his magical town. Undoubtedly, this story is replete with some wonderful images and vague symbolism, and perhaps Marquez is successful in communicating these ideas to some of you, but this style of writing doesn't work for me or in this book, because instead of a character's mind, we're just getting Marquez's thoughts and feelings. You will feel like you're just reading a Macondo history book with a few quotes thrown in to break up the tedium. And while the book flows in the sense that it goes from the birth to death of the city, I felt bored reading because events and actions sprout and die with almost no rationale - that is until Marquez tells us exactly why it happened. Fun.In the end, I believe this book will prove difficult because you're simply apathetic to the characters or the town and what will happen to them. For as well as Marquez writes, events, characters, actions and ideas are indeed lyrically brought to the page - the imagery is sincere and vivid - nothing and no one is memorable or interesting. Sure you may vaguely recall ghosts, ice, or maybe even why they tied the old man to a tree and left him there, but they'll just be a disjointed spattering of memories, with no real appreciation or understanding for the scope, scale or symbolism of this work in its entirety. And frankly, you won't care.Please read \\"Love in the Time of Cholera\\" instead."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I am fascinated by the Mystical Realism with which Marquez uses to absorb his readers and keep them reading at a frenetic pace because they simply cannot put this gem of a read down! This book is wonderful, to say the least. I'm honored to read such a heart-felt magical exploration of the Buendias family and the subsequent growth of their village into modernization by invention and exposure to cultures other than their own. It is impossible, really, to define what this story is ABOUT in a paragraph or so....there are twists and turns and vivid accounts of nothing in particular; but you won't be sorry you bought this book. I am co-moderator of a book club and our group raved about this book from cover to cover. If you want to be a well-rounded reader, than you must have a copy of this book on your shelf. Its more than just significant, it's a treasure."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"If readers want to read one novel that is the likely choice as Novel of the 20th Century (ludicrous thought as that seems), I strongly recommend \`\`One Hundred Years of Solitude'' by Gabriel Garcia Marquez.Great fiction removes our usual methods of perceiving the world, bringing us a revised code of insight, understanding and comprehension.This novel has that transformative quality. The English translation from the original Spanish by Gregory Rabassa is also, in its own right, a classic of its kind.What readers want _ human insight, distilled reflection on the patterns of history, careful language _ are delivered in a magical, powerful way in this book. I have to add, personally, that this novel can be offputting at first. It took me 70 pages before the hook in my brain was completely set. From that point on, I was addicted to Marquez's prose.I'm about to read the book for the third time this spring."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I began this book before I heard that it was to be on Oprah's Book Club. I have to say that I am very delighted that it is on her list. I can understand the general population not getting into this book. It is strange, but within that lies the essence of the story. It has no purpose, no meaning, no lesson. It is just meant to be read and enjoyed. His &quot;magical realism&quot; is that of telling absolutely absurd events in the most practical of ways. And it adds such passion and heart and childlike sympathy that there was nothing else I could do but love it. Give this book a chance. All it needs from you is an open heart and mind. Expect to be taken on a journey deep into the mystical heart of Macondo and the solitary heart of the Buendias."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"&quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot; is Gabriel Garcia Marquez's masterpiece, the one novel he was born to write. Having said that, don't fool yourself by thinking that the book is an easy read, because it is not! At least it is not an easy read to begin with, but hang in there - it is evidently worth the struggle! Make sure that you get an edition that has a family tree of the Buend&iacute;a family in front of the book. Ear-dog that page, as you will use it repeatedly while working your way through this book. I mean, how many Jos&eacute;s, Aurelianos, or Remedios can you possibly remember and/or distinguish between?&quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot; is the story of the small village 'Macondo' hidden the jungle of Colombia. Jos&eacute; Arcadio Buend&iacute;a was the founder of this village, and it is the story of him and his family that keeps you spellbound through the 400+ pages. After finishing this book you will understand why Garcia Marques won the Nobel Prize.This is one of my all time favorite books. I have read it twice, and I am currently reading the book in its original language.I couldn't recommend it more highly. A great read!"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Gabriel Garcia Marquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude is an enchanting and engaging read that chronicles the lives of the Buendia family. The lively and eccentric characters like Jose Arcadio Buendia, the patriarch of the family, whose pursuits include getting a daguerreotype of God will make you laugh and make you think. Humorous incidents abound, including a supposed insomnia plague which causes the town to label every item in their house including the cow. Marquez's style is intoxicating and with every word he challenges the limits of reality and unearths the magical aspects of daily life. When Marquez describes carpets laden down with passengers flying through the air you simply accept an obviously impossible act as truth. The novel's length is somewhat daunting but very accessible. I would recommend this novel for anyone who enjoys fantasy or has an interest in Latin American culture. As the title suggests each character has his/her own private battle regarding the amount of solitude which is necessary and beneficial and amount that is overwhelming and debilitating. Sometimes the character's actions, like Rebecca eating earth and whitewash, seem absurd but Marquez always keeps in mind the nature of humanity and its varying inclinations. This novel won both the Nobel Prize and my admiration."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Vargas LLosa, another great writer, said once that the novelist is a God-killer, who creates and manipulates his own world. Perhaps the finest example of this truth is this novel by Garcia Marquez. A metaphor of Colombia's history it may be, but that interpretation would be excessively narrow. Garcia Marquez creates a world with its own physical rules, its own gods and its own destiny. It traces the story of the Buendia family and Macondo, the town they founded and that will exist as long as the lineage exists. Of course, this is a thoroughly unpredictable novel, precisely because it does not follow the rules of the world we live in. The characters are complex but they are archetypical. Another revieweer correctly described the categories and personalities of women and men, and of the people sharing a particular name. This novel prompted the surge of &quot;magical realism&quot; and modern Latin American literature. Unfortunately although predictably, many bad imitations have followed, like the very bad &quot;Like water for chocolate&quot;. Don't read imitations, come to the real thing where unbelievable events happen without ever becoming corky.The novel has biblical aspirations, and I could feel that throughout it all. It will rain for forty years; a man will stay enclosed in his room for years; a blood stain will wander the town. Extremely well written, it is a demandind text, not to be read while answering phone calls. Its beauty remains unsurpassed in its genre. It is perfectly woven and tightly knit, and it will stay with you for ever."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"How many Aurelianos, Arcadios, Joses and Buendias can one remember? How many civil wars can our countries suffer without autodestroying itselves? How many years have to go by before we understand who we are, what we are doing and how do we fit into a master plan?Well, Garcia Marquez discovered it: none. Or hundred. But he discovered something more important: time is something it happens when you want to be aware of it.GM told his wife (back in the 50s) not to bother him for a year, (you see, time can be a personal invention) because he was going to write a masterpiece. Mercedes did miracles to mantain her family for that period, but finally, when Gabriel emerged, he had 500 pages of pure wonder. His first tentative title was &quot;La Casa Grande&quot; (The Big House) but, if he was to invent a new category (magical realism) he understood he must choose a better title. No printer in Mexico (where he had wrote it) or in Colombia (where he was born) accepted it. So, with the last few bank notes he had, he sent it to Buenos Aires. Yes, the only copy of it (and there was no Fedex!) Editorial Sudamericana published it immediately, and it was a storming success.Since then, this novel triumphed all over the world, despite translations (I've read it both in Spanish and English and the magic's there) and, with the help of Cortazar's Rayuela put Latin America in the cultural map.But what is so astonoshing about a lost town, a family that repeats its names and its traumas, set in a country whose distraction is doing the best to eliminate themselves from the face of the earth?1) He demostrated that the judeo-christian theory of linear time is just a myth. Like Galileo before, he's discovery was rejected, but now we know better: time is circular, but we can modify it if we only have the guts to do it.2) Good literature does not need parameters. Long sentences? Repeating names? Difficult to follow plot? To destroy, one must first create, and this novel inventend not only a new theory of time, but also a new one in literature.3) You must have one and only one objective when writing. be honest to yourself. GM discovered this, quit life for a whole year, and produced the Buendias'story, a story that, if you read between lines, is the story of Latin America.Before you realise that you have but one chance in earth, submerge into this novel, and come out a new person"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I truly cannot remember the last time I have read something so imaginitive and insightful. While this book is sure to make you laugh, the wisdom imparted through hysterical and fantastic happenings is almost chilling at times. This book reminds me of Voltaire's \\"Candide,\\" in that it takes a satirical tone towards the human race. A piece of advice: Definitely read this book at a time when you won't have to take too much time away from it. The character list is long, and it can be difficult to become reoriented.

First of all, unlike the Pulitzer, the Nobel prize for literature is handed to an author on the merits of his or her entire body of work, so please stop complaining about how you can't believe this book won the Nobel because it didn't: the writer did for his body of work. Just remember that NO single book can win the Nobel prize for literature.As far as people complaining about this book, it's too bad but oh well, what can you do. This book isn't for everyone just like anything else. I loved it and many others have cherished it too. That's all folks."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I don't know what an average reader like me can say about this marvelous epic, but I love this book so much I feel compelled, as far as I am able, to give my thoughts about it.One Hundred Years of Solitude is, without a doubt, the greatest of all Latin American novels. It is also the most captivating and masterful modern epic ever told. And it is an epic; it details the history of a people, in this case, the Buendias, the most important and influential family in Macondo. In fact, the Buendias serve as a metaphor for the development of Latin America since its independence. The book follows the Buendias through the founding, development and decay of their settlement in the jungle. Readers with some knowledge of Latin American history will easily recognize the development of Colombia in the book. The civil wars in the novel parallel the civil wars in Colombia from 1885-1902, and Colonel Aureliano can be seen as modeled after General Rafael Uribe Uribe. In fact, Gabriel Garcia Marquez' grandfather, himself, fought under Uribe. A knowledge of Latin American politics, however, is not necessary to enjoy and love this wonderful book. In fact, many readers see no political implications in the book.There is a wonderful mix of the comic and the melancholy in this story. We meet characters who do the most delightful, or the most absurd things, and yet there is an undeniable strain of futility and sadness that runs throughout the entire book. Macondo is definitely a magical place and early in the book we come to expect the unexpected, to expect to be surprised, to accept the unbelievable. In fact, we have to ask ourselves if Macondo is real or if it is just a state of mind. Perhaps it is both. It is this intermingling of the factual and the fantastic that, to me, makes this book so special and marks Garcia Marquez' genius. The Buendia men, especially, are in possession of truly fecund imaginations and they use them in the most disconcerting ways.For all the wonder and beauty and fantasy in this story, this is ultimately a sad and tragic book. It deals, after all, with the failure of a town and its people, people who despite their amazing vitality and wit, are each immersed in a solitude from which they find it impossible to extricate themselves.If one looks closely at the Buendias, he can see that most symbolize a particular historical period. The founder of Macondo and patriarch of the family, Jose Arcadio, is a true Renaissance man. His son, Aureliano is a legendary military leader. Aureliano Segundo becomes a sort-of farmer while his twin brother, Jose Arcadio Segundo becomes a radical labor leader.The Buendias, however, seem to live their lives in a circular fashion. Their personalities constantly repeat the personalities of earlier generations and this repetition often has much to do with the name a child is given. The Aurelianos are all quiet and withdrawn, but prone to success, while the Jose Arcadios are energetic and enterprising but seemingly doomed to failure.One Hundred Years of Solitude, however, is not a psychological novel. All of the characters are rather two-dimensional and serve to carry out thematic points. The men are obsessive, intelligent and energetic. The Aurelianos are involved with ambition, while the Jose Arcadios are filled with earthy passion. Among the women, the Ursulas are stern while the Remedios are eternally immature. But, while the men are dreamers, the women remain anchored in reality. This may be a small part of Garcia Marquez' view of life in Latin America.The Buendia men have everything needed to be happy and successful and yet each ultimately fails, withdrawing into a frustrated loneliness or solitude, but not just any solitude. The Buendia men choose to be solitary, rather than having solitariness imposed upon them, they choose to accept the ultimate futility of their lives, and they know this solitude will be repeated in future generations.Some readers have said they cannot keep all the characters straight and the Buendia family tree is a twisted one, indeed. In fact, the final generation of Buendias really can't figure out where they stand in relation to each other and to their ancestors. This alone should tell us that Macondo is fated to end.On the surface, Macondo is fated to die when someone deciphers Melquiades' (the gypsy's) manuscript and learns the full history of Macondo. In reality, Macondo dies because its inhabitants simply don't choose to continue. Instead, they choose fantasy, solitude and a withdrawal from life. A piece of Macondo, and thus a shred of hope, does survive however, when the author, himself, takes the advice of the Catalan bookseller and leaves the town before its destruction. Thus, there does exist an ongoing testimony of the life that had been lived there. And what book does Garcia Marquez escape with? A volume of Rabelais, one the world's greatest comic geniuses. Perhaps, in this enigmatic ending, Garcia Marquez is telling all Latin Americans to be different from the Buendias, to learn to laugh at themselves, to learn from their mistakes, to be amenable to change and to stop repeating destructive patterns."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"i felt i had to put my two cents in. I read this book several years ago and still remember the magical way the story unfolded. Do Not Miss Out. You will long remember a place and people who existed in Gabe's wonderful imagination.

Neither was I enlightened.Try as I might, I kept putting the book aside and reaching for something more readable, Nero Wolfe perhaps or even the TV remote.The construct of the story, a too-complex tapestry, rambling and often wordy to no purpose, seemed especially designed to flag my attention. So the book has remained half read.Nonetheless I rate the book a strong Seven because I feel I'm probably wrong on this one. Too many friends whose opinions I admire differ with me. And I take into account the fact that I'm the only one I know who has never liked San Francisco."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This is the most wonderful, imaginative, seductively and creatively written book I have ever read. I have since read it again and again and have never had the same emotions twice. I appreciated his use of Latin American myths as reality while intertwining it with seduction and complex relationships. It made the writing so rich and full of color. I could picture each detail in my head and almost smell and hear events as they unfolded.To those who cannot decipher this book...then you are not reading it with your imagination and with your soul. True the writing is not traditional but it is so rich and full of descriptive characters that the narrative style contributes to understanding the story.I cannot express enough how much this book has influenced me to read and enjoy Marquez's writing. Since reading this book, I have read each of the books that have been translated into English."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I still do not know why I love this book so much but I do!

Definitely his best book and absolutely a classic. Top 10 best books of all time. Everyone should read it at least once in their life!"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Recently in my college English class we were discussing books that we read in high school. My professor asked us to list the ones that we hated on the board and someone listed \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude\\". Many people agreed with her, but I must say I do not. I absolutely loved this book! I actually was not required to read it in high school, I was learning Spanish at the time and was looking for a book with elements of Spanish culture. It is long, and drawn out, and confusing and that is what makes it amazing. After finishing it I felt like I had lived it instead of reading it. I highly recommend it. If you are required to read this book in school give it a chance before you toss it aside because it is long, or it looks boring. It takes some time in the beginning to get into it but once you do, if you go into it with an open mind, you will not regret it."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This just may be the most influential novel of the past fifty years, imitated by hosts of other writers. For instance, I was just watching ANGELS IN AMERICA on HBO, and this play would have been inconceivable without Marquez's novel. Magical Realism has become part and parcel of world literature, and it has effected every corner of the world. It has been widely read in the Arab speaking world, in Japan, and during the days of the Soviet Union people used to pass around cassettes of someone reading a Russian translation. Truly a book that belongs not merely to Mexico (he is Columbian, but wrote the book while living in Mexico City) but to the world."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"When you finish this book, you will have a feeling that you have just read something very important, a &quot;great novel&quot;, but you will be at a loss to recall what was so meaningful about the book. This is the curious effect of Garcia Marquez' writing style. Garcia Marquez learned to write by imitating many of Western culture's &quot;key&quot; texts (the Bible, Rabelais, Faulkner, the 18th century English novelists, etc), and the influence of these texts shows very strongly.From the Bible and from Rabelais (and presumably from his grandmother and other small town story tellers he listened to as a child) Garcia learned how to narrate through lists and how to use hyperbole to unsettle the reader. The results are humorous, and as we read Garcia, texts like the Bible echo and resonate in the back of our minds, without being identified consciously. Because of this stylistic quality, the words &quot;biblical&quot; and &quot;rabelaisian&quot; have been used many times to describe this book.Another fascinating aspect of Garcia's style is the ruptures between the time of events narrated and the time of narrative. Someone well-versed in Gerard Genette's &quot;Narrative Discourse&quot; could have a field-day picking apart all of the ways in which Garcia uses normal narrative to create multiple threads of story which wont get resolved for many pages. There is very little dialogue in this novel, because there is a compactness of time which is necessary to cover so many years and so many generations of narrative succintly. Because of the games played with narrative time, this book has been called &quot;post-modern.&quot;But the most talked about stylistic feature of the book is Garcia's &quot;magic realism&quot;, a term invented by readers who couldn't quite identify explicitly what it was about the novel that made it seem so curiously exagerated yet realistic at the same time. A careful reading, and you will discover that there is nothing &quot;realist&quot; in the 19th century sense of the word about this narrative. Without dialogue, our entire notion of the story is colored by the narrator and what the narrator shares with us. This is an anti-Hemingway &quot;all-telling, no showing&quot; narrative with a curious result. Time and again our emotional reactions to the events are dictated by the third person narrator's suspiciously subjective adjectives and omniscience into the minds of characters. We are told that so-&amp;-so was astonished upon seeing X or that the inventions brought by the gypsies were amazing. The world described in this book is heavy with words like &quot;incredible&quot;, &quot;amazing&quot;, &quot;inexpicable&quot;, &quot;astonishing&quot;... you get the idea. Eventually you are lulled into letting the narrator dictate your emotional responses to the events described, rather than formulating your own response to such events. The narrator tells you someone thought something was marvilous, and it seems so to you, the reader. Pehaps this is always the case with reading. In this case it is more pronounced than normal since the narrator's vision is marked by naivete, superstition, and a child-like pre-rational amazement with all things possible and impossible in this world. Such innocence is infectious. The result, you too will feel something strangely magical about the seemingly matter-of-fact world the narrator describes.But beyond the top-quality narrative brilliance of this novel, thanks to Faulkner Garcia has created a mythical Latin American &quot;everyplace&quot; located in no easily identifiable country. Although Garcia doesn't set the story in any real setting, the local-color element of this story is impressive. Because Macondo, the setting of the story, is nowhere in Latin America, Macondo is, in a sense, everywhere in Latin America. That, perhaps, more than Garcia's delightful &quot;magic realist&quot; narrative playfulness, is what makes this novel truly the quintesential Latin American narrative of the 20the century."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I read this book about six months ago (before Oprah added it to her book club), and I was very impressed. I'm a fairly slow reader, so the book took me about three weeks to read, but that is by no means a bad thing! For those three weeks I was completely absorbed in Marquez's world - I'd be driving down the road thinking of Macondo and the people in it! It's easilly one of my favorite books, but i'll admit there are parts that seem to drag on a little. What bothers me is that people are giving the book bad ratings for it being \\"depressing.\\" Sure, sad things happen in the book, generations die, new ones are born and eventually they die. Tragic love stories seem to be almost a dime a dozen in this book, major characters can unexpectedly die in a single paragraph. But even through all this I don't think the book should be categorized as depressing. It's trying to make a point about our lives in a very general way. Time repeats, generations make the same mistakes of their ancestors, and in a sense everything is the same old story. Ever know a person that you could go up to in six months and you'd know their story wouldn't change much - they'd still have car problems, family problems, the same job problems, hate the same people, etc etc. Things do seem to repeat in this world just like in the book. And One Hundred Years of Solitude has a lot to say about that, though not directly (you have to pull out your own meaning). The theme of solitude also runs parallel to the repetition. The town is isolated from the rest of the country (for a long time they thought they were almost surrounded by water). The Buendia's (the family in the book) are isolated from the rest of the town in many ways (there's even a lot of incest). The individual people even isolate themselves upon failure - and inevitably it is this solitude that causes things to never change and causes these people to die in such a depressing way. So, if anything, this book is uplifting in its message to break the cycle.It's one of those books that I liked but didn't love until it was completely done (the last paragraph and sentence seemed to almost make the whole book). It seemed to all hit me in the end and let me see what a tragedy had really happened, but still in a very uplifting way. I recommend this book to anyone that's willing to be challenged and has some time to invest. Maybe the cycle will be broken and things won't be the same old story for you anymore!"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Before reading this book,I had never realized that a book could be a piece of art as easily as a painting.

Granted, Panama is not Colombia, but it used to be.Regardless where you read this book, if you set out with the preconcieved expectation of an easily cut apart, straightforward family tree, you'll be disappointed. This book is not about how nicely the family unfolds; it's about the special moments that, when you read them, send chills up your spine and rekindle your faith in the novel. This is easily the best book that I have read in several years. It contains moments where Garcia Marquez's prose, unassuming and unremarkable at times, shimmers with this vibrant precision that fills you with awe.I don't think this book is for everyone, but give it a chance and read more than the first 100 pages.

Its actually easily accessible. What are people reading when they have problems with this one?\\"One Hundred Years of Solitude\\" is the story of a family and a city, and, of course, a tale of the whole human history. In other words, this is a book about everything. This is usually not good, because very many authors cannot handle a very wide focus. But Marquez is a very good writer. There are so many characters and plots in this book that many writers would have problems to organize it without losing focus. Marquez however manages to finish every subplot, to relate it to the other plots, and to keep track of all of his characters.The book is the strongest if it describes family life and the weaknesses of its characters. Here, the book offers a lot of wisdom. Its much less convincing when it becomes political. I don't like political books in general, and its no different for this one. Being Fidel Castro's best buddy, Marquez cannot resist to bring in some anti-Americanism (I am not American and certainly not biased!) and anti-imperialism (the evil is an american Banana Company, and its arrival is basically the beginning of the end). I find that a little \\"cheap\\", and I don't exactly see what it adds to the story.Everyone interested in serious literature should certainly read this one. Its a very good starting point for those who have not read a lot of literature before, because as I already mentioned, its easily accessible without being shallow."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Clear, cut, and simple: this book is amazing. The prose is so beautiful that one finds it hard to put the book down. The mystical story woven my Marquez is unforgettable. It is not the easiest of books, but the best never are.

You have these \\"agents\\" loose in literature classes, scouting out books you may have never thought you'd like or may never have read otherwise. \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude\\" was one of those books. Several months ago, my son David urged me to read Salman Rushdie's \\"Midnight's Children\\". I did, and I loved it. So, for Christmas, he gave me \\"One Hundred years of Solitude\\", with the recommendation that it was very much like \\"Midnight's Children\\".Once again, the kid was right. Like Rushdie, I just assumed that Gabriel Garcia Marquez was too \\"literary\\" for a fantasy and SF reader like myself, who reads for enjoyment, not to (Heaven forbid!) learn anything. Once again, I was pleasantly surprised. Like Rushdie, Garcia Marquez is far more accessible, far funnier, and far more entertaining than I expected. Even though I know nothing about the history of Colombia, I was still able to enjoy this book immensely, just on the surface level of a history of Macondo and the Bueneida family. And what a family it is!! I'm almost ashamed to admit that I say way too many members of my own family in there. . .I will admit, that like other readers, the constant reuse of names periodically confused me and I was most grateful for the family tree printed in front of the book. But, this reuse was somewhat central to the story, the \\"the more things change, the more they stay the same\\" syndrome. As a fan of fantasy, I was able to take the \\"magic realism\\" in stride and enjoy it. All in all, this was a great read and a great book.Once again I thank my son David and look forward to reading more Garcia Marquez as well as more Rushdie. I'm glad to know his education dollars are being well spent."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This book was written in a truly unique style, with the author often revealing what happens in the future first, and then going on to explain the plot and events that happen up until the revealed moment.

Indeed, it's easy to get tangled in so many Jose Arcadios and Aurelianos, but this is really a great story. His finesse, the metaphors and symbols he uses, the images the paints, all those lonely souls that inhabit this book, even the absurd that is to be found in this book, all of them combine together and form something really great. Something that is worth your time."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I've recently started searching for my copy of this--I know it's somewhere--because it really does need to be read again and again. I loved this book."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"What is it that gives One Hundred Years of Solitude its critical acclaim, where many high mimetic fantasies go unrecognized? This book kept me delightfully shocked and appalled with its depravity and bleakness, but what makes it more \`literary' and likely to be studied in a high school English class then the charming tale of a wizard going off to defeat his arch-enemy? Is fantasy silly and childish? Because the Buendia family is reminiscent of a never-ending chain of eight-year-olds playing in a sandbox and fighting like savages over whatever their hearts desire. Harry Potter is more mature than Jose Arcadio. This is the story of the lost boys never growing up, but in this story their bodies mature and they have adult desires that they gratify however they can.Is realism just more literary than magic? What about the striking contrast between the verisimilitude of Maconda and the sudden appearance of magical phenomena? One Hundred Years of Solitude is deliberate, artistic and crafty, but it is also ridiculous, over-the-top and at times childish. It really speaks to the human condition that this kind of debauchery is what we value over an imaginative epic of good versus evil.By the way, One Hundred Years of Solitude was a great read. It deserves every bit of positive critical acclaim it has received. It's incredibly engrossing and just taps into the darkness in humanity that we love to watch from afar."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Whenver I open a novel and find a geneological chart, I'm daunted--particularly when all the characters' names begin with the letter \\"A\\" or \\"R\\" and repeat in various combinations of the same name. Yes, you have to lace on your literary running shoes to make your way through this novel, but the read is sumptous and well worth the mental focus required.

Never even thought about almond trees until this book had me imagining it's smell. Although I was a bit biased at first this book opened me up to a whole new kind of prose. Needless to say this book had me reading every Marquez novel I could find."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"\\"One Hundred Years of Solitude\\" by Gabriel Garcia Marquez is my all time favorite book. It is a brilliant showcase for Marquez's powerful imagination and genius for storytelling. I won't go into any plot details because I believe this is the kind of book that needs to be experienced instead of explained. I will say, however, that I responded on a deep level to the vivid language and emotionalism of this novel. Marquez literally paints pictures with words, creating a story that is both comic and tragic, romantic and heartbreaking, surreal and earthy. Marquez's voice is articulate as well as accessible, making it seem as if were are sitting down to hear a family patriarch tell a colorful fairy tale. There is a great deal of symbolism and fantasy in this book, but the main running theme throughout is - as you may have guessed from the title - solitude. Despite the novel's surrealism, the heart of the novel is something any human being can relate to. All of the individual characters (and there are a myriad of them) deal with some form of loneliness at certain points. The Buendia family is often described as possessing a solitary gene, and while some of them are forced to face life alone through adverse circumstances, others choose solitude because of a sense of alienation, loss, or insecurity. The Buendia family spend most of their time together yet, as Ursula tragically points out at one point, none of them truly understand each other. \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude\\" is famed for being a part of the magical realism canon, but I believe the true gift of this novel is that its a beautiful, stirring, complex portrait of family and the existential loneliness of the human condition."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I have just started reading this book, but already I love the language of Gabriel Garcia Marquez. It's like you can see, feel& smell everything . Looking forward to many evenings in bed reading this book. It's not one that you want to rush."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This is probably one of the best books I've read in a very long time. It was my favorite several years ago, and I recently bought a new copy. I've read it several times; it never gets old. I have heard in the past that the storyline can be very confusing at times, but I didn't have a problem with following along. His style is very unique; it seems disjointed and jumbled at first glance, but as the reader continues everything falls into place.The imagery and metaphoric language throughout was especially fantastic. Gabriel Garcia Marquez has a way with words that makes you think. His use of magical realism is flawless. The book creates impossible situations throughout that for some reason seem plausible in relation to what is happening in the story. Some sentences are incredibly simple, and others may make you go back and reread. Magical realism can be very difficult to incorporate in a work of fiction properly, and I believe he has both produced a wonderful work of art and great instruction on how to do so in one sitting.If you've never read this book before, you owe it to yourself (if you're an avid reader) to check it out. Chances are very good you'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"A complete literacy masterpiece! I had been meaning to read 100 years of solitude for over 7 years but never found the time to do so until now and the book did not disappoint! Gabriel Garcia Marquez painted a whole society with his beautiful breathtaking descriptions of the town Mocondo. I loved the characters from the Buendia family and other fond myself laughing and other times pausing to contemplate his points on life through the actions of some of the characters. There is a little of everything for everyone in this book! Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I know there are people who make a fulltime job of analyzing and intellectualizing Marquez but rather than impress anyone with what a smartypants I think I am, I'm just going to give you my opinion of this book as a regular reader.I finished the novel over the course of a few months. Whenever I picked it up, I found it absorbing, and engaging but it wasn't by any means a page turner. Everytime I put it down for a period of time, when I picked it up again I had to flip back to the front to remember who I was reading about.It is an epic book wherein just about all the different characters have the same name.If you were just reading it for amusement, you've got to let go of the pesky anal urge we have to want to know exactly what is going on and just take it in pieces and trust that intuitively it will all fall in place in the end.It does. I think the Buendia family saga is really a protracted metaphor for the development of Western civilization.Trust the book. If you want to take it apart and study it, I suggest waiting to try and do that on the second read. Someday, I'll probably go back and read it again which means I must have liked it.And so,I recommend the book."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This book is in interesting look at several generations of one family. It has humor, romance, sex, drama, and action all in one. There are many characters, but Garcia manages to let the reader get to know all of them. Great book."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"One Hundred Years of Solitude tells the story of the rise and fall, birth and death, and vicissitudes of the town of Macondo through the history of the Buendia family. Detached and matter-of-fact, the narrative serenely unveils the happenings around the Buendia house and its prolific generations, filled with unforgettable characters. For some readers the novel might flow somewhat uneventfully and convey a breath of aridness - don't give up because after about a hundred pages or so Garcia Marquez has delineated a clairvoyant tapestry of human emotions, all types of solitude, love, and bitterness that accentuate struggles of townspeople and members of the Buendia family to the fullest actuality.Reading the book, it seems, at times, as if I'm travelling through still photographs. Life of the Macondians, as well as the Buendias, one after another generation, as it always was, fixed in its frame, just there at just that time. In a big picture, Macondo had been a prosperous place and well on its way until it was disordered, corrupted, and suppressed by the banana company, whose engineers brought on the deluge as a pretext to avoid promises made to the local workers. At the core of the novel are those who were caught up in the upheaval that unfortunately turned into a massacre killing 3000 people.The novel is beautifully written, with the author's attending to the minutest details and nuances. A recurring theme is that solitude had made (in many of the characters, men and women) a selection of their memory and had burned the dimming piles of nostalgic waste that life had accumulated in their heart, and thus had purified, magnified, and eternalized the others. People relapsed into intransigent solitude though they all live within a huge family under the same roof. As family members advanced in their years, they made detailed recapitulation (or brought to realization) of life in the house and completely changed the opinion they had held of their descendants and siblings.One Hundred Years of Solitude is a complicated analysis of human emotions and struggles through the decadence of a mythical town and its pillar family. The book evokes such clairvoyance as it scrupulously examines the most insignificant happenings and truths in a family that members of which did not see. The novel exposes to the full human flaws: incapability of love, gall of bitterness, invincible cowardice, irrational fear, and sinful pride (which led to the fall of one of the major characters, Colonel Aureliano Buendia).Final words of advice: have a notebook and genealogy chart of the Buendia family ready and do not hesitate to backtrek when names of the characters become confusing. Savor and ruminate the dreamy narrative that plunges deeper and sidles closer to core of human emotions.Also recommended:Love in the Time of Cholera, Gabriel Garcia Marquez2004 (25) MY"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I am a reader of Non -Fiction, especially anything related to courageous real life stories and this book, ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE fits the bill.

In the book reveal a history of Buendia family of Macondo, which is founded by Jose Arcodio and destructed by a predicted wind while Aureliano was deciphering the parchment written by a mysterious gipsy, Malquiades. This book did not inspire me the view of creation to destruction of the human race though many book reviews mentioned it before I began reading this novel. What I felt after reading it is human being destine to solitude. No matter young or old, no one can escape from the fate to be alone. Despite of the serious concept of this novel, it indeed a fun-read book, a page-tuner, a time killer, and also a book that you can devote great deal of time to decipher it as if we are members of Buendias who are trying to interpret Malquiades's parchment."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Marquez should be applauded for this work of magic realism that still had a very humanistic quality to it. Don't be afraid of the the length of this book, because it's never dull, and ends beautifully. The characters in this book cannot be forgotten, and the events range from tragic to joyous and absurd. I have read other Marquez novels and this one has been my favorite."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I must admit, I couldn't believe Oprah chose this book in her book club. I work part-time at a bookstore and have recommended this book for years to naive readers that wanted to broaden their horizons. What can I say about Mr. Marquez - one of my favorite novelists of all time - but appreciate his genious for wonderfully descriptive and colorful narrative that borders on the surreal with reality. Although one hundred years is my second favorite by Marquez, \\"Love in the time of cholera\\" is my favorite, no other writer in recent history has made me cry and laugh hysterically over a narrative. Reading one of his sentences is like, how shall I say, viewing a painting by an impressionistic great. It conjures colorful visions that are dreamlike on the surface but is so real in emotion underneath. In tradition with the history of supernatural that permeates throughout latin american history and storytelling, this novel is full of spirits, the unexpected and the impossible. I've told many Oprah worshippers to take their time and be imaginative at the bookstore. It's great to see people being exposed to great art, even if does require someone like Oprah to be a catalyst. For those who love this book, give Love in the time of Cholera a try, it's one my personal favorites and definitely THE choice from Mr. Marquez.

Sorry to say, the reviewers on this board who criticize this book as boring or depressing are illiterate morons who should go back to reading Nora Roberts and procreating with their kin.

This work, more than any other, is what brought Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez the Nobel Prize.Having read some of the other reader reviews, let me point out that those who have never lived in Latin America or experienced a foreign culture may find this a difficult read. The novel can be more easily understood by anyone who has actually spent time in Latin America (no, spring break in Canc&uacute;n does not count). I read this book in the original Spanish (if you know Spanish, don't bother with any translations) in 1985 and could not put it down. I almost didn't want the book to end! What some reviewers have clearly failed to realize is that the story of Macondo is an allegory for the history of Latin America.Enter a land where magic happens on a daily basis, where the improbable is routine. This could be Anytown, Am&eacute;rica Latina. Are the fanciful events of Macondo so truly difficult to accept? When the Buend&iacute;a patriarch dies, it rains flowers.... In the minds of many Latin Americans, such an idea is not at all preposterous. Among the surreal yet not inconceivable characters are a woman who floats into the heavens, a boy who automatically knows that the tea his identical twin is drinking has no sugar, a ghost unable to quench his thirst for water, and a man who for some reason speaks Latin when he sleeps. Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez's description of the arrival of the \\"gringos\\" and their \\"discovery\\" of the local, exotic fruit -- the banana -- is both hilarious and sadly real. Although I am not a fan of the author's politics, anyone who knows history will agree that it's not hard to understand the Latin perception that exploitative foreign fruit companies helped create the \\"banana republics.\\"This is a novel to cherish and savor. Linger over the breathtaking prose and the vivid descriptions of fantastic events. This is Latin American magical realism at its best."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"From my first sessions reading this book I was struck by how the magical things that happened in Macondo and it's surrounding areas were described as if they were no stranger than the every day tasks of the characters involved. By nature of Marquez's story telling style beautiful women ascending to the heavens, gypsies on magic carpets, and a man's prophetic visions of his death seem almost less wonderous than Macondo's introduction to many technologies that we consider so commonplace (locomotives, telephones, ice). The characters run the gamut of emotions, gifts, and afflictions though most of them are members of the Buendia family. There is plenty to absorb, maybe too much for me. It was hard for me to be introduced to a group of characters just to see them kick the bucket and then start over again with a next generation. Especially when they shared the same names, gaah! But I think that is intentional. I started to focus on traits of the family as a whole rather than those of the individuals. Anyway, I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"What an amazing experience it was to read this book. I was a little wary at first, but once you are introduced to the original characters, you have a genuine interest and concern for them.

I encourage anyone to read the novel and to allow themselves to be pulled into Marquez's Macondo, from which you may gain new perspectives on time, age, personality, knowledge, details, worth, courage, fear, history, beauty, perception, magic, life, and love.

I would recommend reading this book every couple of years as, depending on where you are in life, you will get something new out of it. This is my favorite book by Marquez.Garcia Marquez masterfully tells this tale, set in Latin America, about the birth and death of a family as revealed to the world by the finest of Latin American writers in the genre of magical realism. It is an essential book to anyone who wants to look at Latin American literature. Each time I read this book, I have found it to be funnier and sadder than the last.I am a serious reader, a lover of life, and a happy person except when I am not, and I usually have something good to say about every book I read if nothing other than I note a graceful turn of phrase or a creative use of some word but to say a book is one of my favorites and that I actually can recall the book title and author (I have read far more than one book a week since I was about 10 years old) is not to be taken lightly. This book is right up there in possibly my top 5 all-time favorites. Magnificent might be the best way to describe this book. Perhaps in my list of books to recommend, besides Irving who is my all-time favorite, would be Cuelho and Marquez as do-not-misses.The story itself can be a bit confusing but you cannot help but be sucked into the story about the town of Macondo and the lives of the Buendias, each with their own very unique life: some adventurous, some like hermits. The viewpoint is seen through thr eyes of the people as they see themselves growing toward modernization with the discoveries of Melquiades and Jose Arcadio Buendia, and the Banana Company (and its later massacre which haunts the town). The lives of the residents are a metaphor, in fact, for the reaches of our imagination and it requires us, the reader, to think perceptively about life.Read it if you have not already.

My highest praise for Marquez is in his character development, even characters who are barely mentioned (Fermanda, General Gerineldo) in more than name and minute appearances have strongly fleshed out personalities. It is rare that you see a character react in a way that you would not expect them to. The depth of character we see from the Buendia family truly draws you in and makes you feel as if you are not reading a book, but are observing a family over a long period of time.

You should never sit down with a Marquez book in hopes of a 'good story'. Marques is not a story teller. He is far above that.Instead, read a few pages at a time, even over the course of year. Pay attention to the scattering dialogue, 'why is it that it's always the stupid people who live the longest'? And, 'you can take your extra minute and shove it up your a$$' (said just before the 3,000 people were mowed down by the army).Pay attention to the surrealism, the oddities of the characters.

It reads like the most depressing book but even though it dips you really low it brings you back up"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I recently read Marquez' book and found it to be one of the most thrilling and entertaining books I have ever read. I now see why he won the Nobel prize for literature in 1982. I got so involved with the characters that I was actually dreaming of them (maybe hallucinating). I wanted to know why they behaved the way they did. Marquez had a systematic way of reavealing everything at the end. However, it was a little difficult to read, but challenging. It was funny,but at the same time weird. I loved reading it. Garcia Marquez has an incredible knack with words. Even though I read the English version of the book, I don't imagine much was left out as a result of its translation. He was able to show how individuals in this fictitious town, Macondo, become lost in their own worlds, desires (solitude) and at the same time disregard any social mores or laws and consequences. He subsequently showed that there are consequences for one's actions. Granted, there were many things that cannot be easily explained, but that is all part of his style of writing called &quot;Magical realism&quot;. I loved &quot;100 years of solitude&quot; so much that I intend to continue doing more research to understand the book. Great piece of literary work. This refers to the hardcover version of the book."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"In September 1992, I was still undecided for who I was going to vote in the Presidential race. Then, one evening I watched an interview with (at the time) presidential candidate Mr. Clinton. In the interview he mentioned this book as one of his favorite's books. That was the tie-braker for me. Anybody that appreciates the magical story of Macondo and Gabriel Garcia Marquez's work that much is allright by me!!This is my absolute favorite book ever!!. I grew up in a small fishermen village in Puerto Rico and reading this book taught me to appreciate the character of a town for its uniqueness and that no matter how obscure a life might seem, every life has a story to tell from where a lesson can be learn. I was overwhelmed by the incredible mix of magic and reality in the descriptions of the characters and of the town of Macondo. Recently, I read the book again, this time in English. I was mistified just the same!"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"When you purchase and read this book you will be exposed to many wonderful and fanciful narrative techniques. There is no arguing that the way in which the latter chapters of One Hundred Years of Solitude mirror the first ones is very skilfully done, or that there is a lot of depth and reflection on the subject of solitude in what's actually a novel.But buyer beware- a book is composed of both technique and content, and the content is not up to par. One Hundred Years of Solitude narrates the fictional tale of a family which lives in a small south american village in the midst of nowhere. It's the fatalistic and depressing story of the south america that has-been, with all the usual low-lifes from corrupt banana-republic officials to self-styled revolutionary \\"coronels\\". It's a tale of two-dimensional, impulse-driven characters with no depth and little to make them memorable or likeable. Most of all, it's a tale in which hope and happiness and most that is good in human beings is absent, and the few moments in which they seem to appear are illusory. Think of it as a Lord of the Flies but with a less interesting, adult, south american cast- and written with a very clever structure.Gabriel Garcia Marquez is a talented and powerful author. But much of what he writes about is distasteful (his latest book concerns an elderly man enjoying child prostitution), and in the case of this novel both the characterization and ultimate message are downright repelling. I finished reading it against my better judgment. I would only recommend this novel to literary critics and others like them who derive most of their enjoyment from the technique of a book rather than its contents. For a more palatable study of themes like the darkness of the human heart, I suggest reading Joseph Conrad instead."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This book is great for all of the reasons people have already listed in their 5- and 4-star reviews. No need to re-hash.Instead a brief meditation on the book's magical realism and its effect the narrator-character-reader relationship.The chronology of the book and its unusual treatment of character create a distancing effect. There are plenty of characters here and plenty of insightful moments with them but the narrator fleets between characters, and glances between intimate stays and vast summaries. This is clearly not a book that is read for character development (compared to a book that catalogs the life of a single character), understandable, but there is also a distancing effect caused by a lack of genuine sentiment. Often (even when we have rested with Ursula for many pages, or when we see the young Aureliano looking up to his father) this book feels as though it takes place in an alternate universe where the inhabitants are almost human, but different in a hard-to-place way. Uncanny valley, without the disturbing factor. Unlike Kafka's or even Grass's treatment of the surreal/magical, where the character is very thoroughly human in thought and action, Marquez's characters think and act in manners as stylized as the events. There is a charming, fairy-tale effect to this, but there is also a divorce of emotion both from the narrator and the reader. This seems to be a mark of Marquez (excuse me there), where his characters are either too stoic or too emotive and they never quite act as ordinary people. Does this further establish the enchanted world of Macondo as a place where the reader goes to frolic, to be dismayed, overjoyed, to be transported through time? Or does it act as a barrier, a pane of glass through which everything becomes two-dimensional? It depends on the reader."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"One of the most famous first lines of all time starts the book, \\"Many years later, as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendia was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice.\\" More profound, epistemologically, two sentences later, \\"The world was so recent that many things lacked names, and in order to indicate them it was necessary to point.\\" Legendary for its magical realism, it surprised me sometimes, for its ability to combine wrenching emotions, intellectual cleverness and plays on language, as with, \\"Although they seemed to ignore what both of them knew and what each one knew that the other knew, from that night on they were yoked together in an inviolable complicity\\" (p. 146) Trouble was, this was all during the first eight months of caring for our baby Catherine. As the book put it, \\"they already had too many troubles of their own to weep over he acted-out misfortunes of imaginary beings\\" (p. 230).Although the last 30 pages were some of the best I can remember. More self-reflexive references: \\"It had never occured to him until then to think that literature was the best plaything that had ever been invetned to make fun of people\\" (p. 394). And finally, close to the end, melancholy and eternity, \\"It was the last that remained of a past whose annihilation had not taken place because it was still in a process of annihilation, consuming itself from within, ending at every moment but never ending its ending\\" (p. 409). I at once loved parts of this book, hated its dragging on when I needed shorter stimulation, and am grateful for having had those beautiful moments it captured so lyrically. I'd grade it an A-."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This is not a conventional novel and readers will have to re-think how they look at a novel. I kept trying to understand exactly what was happening, until I got to page 135 and read the following passage and then it became clear.\\"A trickle of blood came out under the door, crossed the living room, went out into the street, continued on in a straight line across the uneven terraces, went down steps and climbed over curbs, passed along the Street of the Turks, turned a corner to the right and another to the left, made a right angle to the Burendia house, went under the closed door, crossed through the parlor, hugging the walls as to not stain the rug, went on to the other living room, made a wide curve to avoid the dining room table, went along the porch with the begonias, \\"What does this all mean? It is clear that the novel is not based on reality but instead has a dream like quality to the story. It is an allegory or myth. Was it all a dream by the narrator?The other literary feature is the use of names which is repetitive and similar. There are so many similar names and new characters that it is almost impossible to keep everything clear so the plot always has a certain level of chaos. Mixed in with that, the novel has the numerous unions between family members, revolutions, exaggerations, and the use of profanity by the characters. What are we to make of all of this chaos? In fact what exactly does Marquez mean by the word \\"solitude?\\" He seems to use it to represent social isolation between characters in the novel.Finally, all of the names and the relations tend to mix up the concept of time. The time does not seem to be linear. There seems to be cross generational discussions, even though we have five or six generations of people all related.This is an unusual novel like almost no other. The read is slow and complicated or a slow read is required to extract all the details. In any case, it takes more than one read.Very unusual: 5 stars."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This book frustrates me, but in a good way. Reading it, get this feeling of how difficult life is to understand. It's just such a great book-- it makes you laugh, it depresses you, it makes you think and it just leaves mesmerized. Go ahead and buy this book, read it, and you won't be left feeling disappointed."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"\\"The world must be all f***** up, when men travel first class and literature goes as freight.\\"It seems that when people try to describe this novel, they usually sum it up as a family chronicle. However, One Hundred Years of Solitude has so much more to offer than the mere tale of family (although the family is certainly very fascinating and complex)-- it offers life lessons, paradoxical truths, and a beautiful command of language. I wish that there was a category for works that are better than literature, that take the written word to an even more elevated place, because this novel belonds up there as one of the greatest pieces of writing I have ever encountered, and I am not alone in thinking this. As you can see above in the editorial reviews, this book has been placed alongside the Book of Genesis as a work that all of humanity should read! Gabriel Garcia Marquez has created one of the most interesting narratives I have ever come across, and he tells his story in such a unique way. The story moves without much concern for linear time, but this ends up making the narrative more compelling. This is the sort of novel that people cannot help but have a strong reaction to-- and whether you will love it or hate it, One Hundred Years of Solitude is completely worth the read."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"In One Hundred Years of Solitude, Gabriel Garcia Marquez writes of a fictional, mystical town called Macondo. The world is still recent and young, but one must question how young the world is due to conflicting descriptions in the book. One of the village's main founding members is Jos&eacute; Arcadio Buendia and his wife Ursula. With these two people start the beginning of six generations of the Buendia family in Macondo. Jos&eacute; Arcadio Buendia seeks knowledge all the time, and an important traveling gypsy named Melquiades helps out Jos&eacute; Arcadio Buendia in his quest. Melquiades actually records important prophecies of the village that are not decoded until the village's last days. Macondo starts off peacefully, and nobody dies for many years, but as time goes on, wars between the Liberals and the Conservatives rage with some members of the Buendia family executed, and capitalism takes its root with a banana company that leaves many massacred in a strike not recorded by the history books.Jos&eacute; Arcadio Buendia actually becomes insane because he realizes that time is cyclical and always repeating itself. In the six generations that follow, characters have the same names or names with slight variations, hinting at a cyclical history. Many instances must refer to past events to determine the future. A surreal air in this book is the result of many events and bustling people. Some members of the family live for abnormally long periods of time; dead characters never really die because their ghosts stay in Macondo; a pure and beautiful Buendia girl rises to heaven; and passionate (and sometimes incestuous) relationships flourish all the time. While some of the Buendia men are very hedonistic, especially for women, many men in the Buendia family have an air of solitude around them and never form true relationships with others. At the end of the book, the solitude of one of the Buendias is what brings the demise of the mystical town.One Hundred Years of Solitude, a book on distorted reality and cyclical history, is one of the most mind-boggling books I have ever encountered, and even though the book was very difficult to grasp, I'd say the 400+ pages were worth the magical trip. Marquez is a master storyteller, and although there were parts that were agonizingly long, the book as a whole is to be commended as a magical classic."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This book makes me want to learn Spanish so I can read it in Marquez's original language.This story is an epic of a kind you've never read. No heroes, no great voyage - just a family and their town. It's a kind of Book of Genesis for the Buendia family, a family that you will know intimately by the end of the novel as if it's your own.Marquez skillfully blends the tangible realities of hard life with supernatural interludes that help make this book one of the most beautifully poetic that I've ever read. It's the kind of book that when you finish - incidentally having one of the most perfect endings put to paper - you will sit back and think about it for a while. You will walk the hallways of the Buendia house long after you finish this book and swear that you've known the many people that lived and died there. And you will miss them.This book is a masterpiece. Put this first on your list."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Gabriel Garcia Marquez's &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot; is fantastic in every meaning of the word. Like an imaginary Bible, it is the story of the beginning and almost apocalyptic end of a world, albeit a microcosm. This &quot;world&quot; is a South American village called Macondo, of which one of the founders is a man named Jose Arcadio Buendia. The novel tells the story of Buendia and five generations of his descendants, the last of whom is carried away by ants (yes, ants) to be devoured. Consider it &quot;The Rise and Fall of the House of Buendia.&quot; Or, metaphorically, &quot;The Rise and Fall of Man.&quot;Garcia Marquez writes as though he were spinning a rug of a wildly chaotic and exotic pattern on a loom. Such things as flying carpets, an insomnia plague, a levitating priest, a trickle of human blood that propels itself through village streets, a rainfall of yellow flowers, a girl whose erotic fragrance drives men to acts of desperation, a man whose appearances are preceded by a swarm of butterflies, &quot;invisible&quot; doctors, a future-telling witch who lives to an unthinkable age, and a five-year-long rainfall are just some of the wonders to be found within its pages. However, there is an eerie cohesion that blends these elements with the realistic backdrop of the narrative, so that the novel feels as natural as walking down the street. For comparison's sake, it contains the kind of mixture of fantasy and realism used by writers like Gunter Grass and Salman Rushdie.The novel does not have an arching plotline; it is more like a collection of connected anecdotes, but there is an overall plan to the events which unite the Buendia dynasty. The narrative has a tendency to fast forward and reverse chronologically so that a situation introduced early is resolved later in the action, usually with an ironic surprise. For example, the novel begins with Jose's son, Colonel Aureliano Buendia, facing a firing squad; how he got into this predicament is explained later, along with his uncanny knack for escaping death.The idiosyncrasies of the characters are another focus of the novel. Jose, the patriarch, has a fascination with new gadgets sold to him by a gypsy named Melquiades and dabbles perseveringly in alchemy. Aureliano, a metalworker who fabricates little fishes out of gold, proclaims himself a Colonel and leads dozens of unsuccessful Liberal revolts against his country's Conservative government. Rebeca, Jose's adopted daughter, arrives at Jose's house carrying the bones of her deceased biological parents in a sack and has a nervous habit of eating dirt. Jose's wife, Ursula, acts as the family's moral backbone and rational center. The history and fate of the members of the Buendia family are prophesied by Melquiades, whose cryptic parchments are left after his death for one of Jose's descendants to decipher. Also documented is Macondo's growth from a primitive village to a town thriving with commerce (including an ill-fated banana company), entertainment, and the latest technology.This is truly one of the best novels I have ever read. It transcends its time and place by virtue of being mythical and universal. The last paragraph in particular is incredibly profound and seems to summarize not only the novel but mankind's existence; consider how it relates to religious concepts of creation, destruction, and human sin. Few novels offer greater scope, imagination, imagery, or ideas."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I have just put down &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot; with pride and shame.

The author's ability to build characters is amazing, his prose is elegant and his descriptive technique knows no match.

The work has been translated even into languages like Quich&eacute;, Guaran&iacute; and Catal&aacute;n. This unusual tale depicts the origins and ultimate demise of the mythical town of Macondo through the saga of the enigmatic Buend&iacute;a family. In this richly symbolic and multilayered chronicle of life and death -- with repeating names, endless revolutions and deluvial rains, lust, incest, death, a search for truth and a plague of menacing red ants-- we are witness to the magical realism that essentially defines Latin America in every regard. To understand intimately Latin America is to understand the subtleties and wry humor of ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE.This novel by Gabriel Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez, my absolute favorite author without exception, was first published in 1967 in Argentina under the title CIEN A&Ntilde;OS DE SOLDEDAD, with the English translation appearing in 1970. It must have been about 1972-73 when I first read the original Spanish version and became enraptured immediately by the brilliance of this masterful piece of Latin American fiction, the most unusually crafted and the most widely discussed/debated literary creation in several decades across Latin America. Since its initial success worldwide, this rare gem has seen accompanying study guides, essays, dissertations, seminars, related university courses, entire books authored by noted contemporary literary figures devoted to the subject of interpreting this novel as well as to the author's entire body of literary production. I recall once viewing (1985) a personal interview filmed by the author, \\"Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez est&aacute; cansado de las equivocaciones de la cr&iacute;tica\\" [GM is tired of the errors of the criticism]. The artist himself set the record straight regarding what he intended in this monumentally ambitious tale.Here in a nutshell for novice readers of Latin American literature translated into English are the preeminent themes running through this mystical novel: the interconnectedness of myth, reality, time and space; myth and history; the journey through the labyrinth of Latin American reality; the intertextuality of fiction and reality; a reality called \\"fiction\\"; the three levels of reality in one hundred years; violence and death as imaginary acts from a Latin perspective; man in search of himself in the surrealism of time and space; Macondo as a distinctive magical and Latin American domain; the fictionalization of history; the comic and carnivalesque; the subversion of time and space; geneological imperatives; the origins of Western civilization in Latin America; a portrait of Latin America: civilization vs barbarism; the Latin American novel as symbol of myth and archive; the tragic cylce and concept of collective identity and simultaneity; Latin American history as hieroglyphics; and perhaps finally ... the myth of apocalipse and human temporality.Gracias, Oprah, for bringing to the eager attention of your book club readers this serious literary work intended to provoke thought and a profoundly important classic from my part of the world.

The Story of Sugar (a novel)"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"One of the unforgettable and favorite books for me has been for many years Gabriel Garcia Marquez's \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude\\"] (which I believe should be translated as \\"One Hundred Years of Loneliness\\") - the marvelously told story of the rise and fall of the Buendia family, their times, their struggles, their curse and damnation - the loneliness that would finally destroy them and the universe that they created and inhabited. The story follows 100 years in the life of Macondo; a village founded by Jos&eacute; Arcadio and Ursula Buend&iacute;a and occupied by their descendants with the variations on their progenitor's name: his sons, Jos&eacute; Arcadio and Aureliano, and grandsons, Aureliano Jos&eacute;, Aureliano Segundo, and Jos&eacute; Arcadio Segundo. Then there are the Buendia women--the two &Uacute;rsulas, Amaranta, three Remedios, Fernanda, Rebecca, Santa Sofia de la Piedad, and Pilar Ternera -- the women in the family all have the strong personalities and are \\"more stubborn than jennets\\". The genre of the novel is defined as \\"magic realism\\" and I can testify that I've never read the book of such magic power, the book which is highly comical and deeply tragic in the same time.The world that Marquez created is bright and sparkling; the images are vivid and memorable: the flower rain, the yellow butterflies that would always announce Mauricio Babylonia's entrance; the never ending Amaranta's work on her shroud and the letters she would collect from her neighbors to give them to the dead or mysterious rise to Heaven of Remedios the Beauty, the girl who possessed the beauty of such disastrous power that no man in the world could resist it.

But it was something completely different. The book tells the rise and fall of an imaginary city, complete with stories about incest, lust, hate, and love.Some of the passages that Gabriel Garcia Marquez writes, could have single handily won him the Noble Prize for literature. \\"She spun an invisible web around him, which he had to remove every night with his bare and ringless finger.\\" Or something like that.It was a great story. Worth the read. The beginning will swallow you into the book. It starts with a soldier who is about to die, recanting a memory about his childhood. After that, you are taken into a world of magic and reality."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I have had this book on my bookshelf for years having picked it up simply because I loved the title and then finding out it is actually a classic literary epic.This novel is a heavy read, at times tedious and at times quirky, it is most definitely not a book to delve into while half asleep. Gabriel Garcia Marquez forces his readers to pay attention wrapping his fantasy tales around deep and abiding characters it is sometimes very difficult to interpret where the story ends and the fairy tale begins. I found Marquez's writing style very difficult to read without having a few notes scribbled about me to refer back to. He has so many characters in the book, some with the same name, and bounces back and forth between decades that if you are an unorganized reader by page 50 you will already be lost. I am amazed at Marquez's ability to sustain his own thoughts during the writing of this novel. I found the women to be far more interesting than the men, each woman a central figure in family life as well as the most entertaining fantasies. You will be confused, uplifted, humored, informed, saddened and satisfied when you reach the end of this unique novel.I enjoyed this novel but did not find it to be the life sustaining recommendation that so many others insist it to be. So many literary professionals and celebrities have pumped this novel up to such great expectation that I would almost dare to say I was disappointed that I missed the affect it was supposed to carry. I imagine if this novel was read several times and studied with a fine toothed comb it may produce such elation. But for the average person this classic novel is almost a chore although very much worth the effort."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Great book. I recommend it for anybody. A very deep sensual and at the same time a bit mystical novel. The book is written in a very original style that leaves an impression of listenning to the story in reverse, as if it was taken from somebody's memory. Makes you draw parallels with your own family and your own life. Definitely worth reading!"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I cannot put into words how amazed I was by this book when I first read it several years ago. It is full of the subtle characterizations and plot nuances that make magical realism such a pleasure to read. Like Borges did so well in Ficciones, Garcia Marquez provides readers with believable characters in detailed settings adding just a touch of the supernatural. I applaud Oprah for choosing a different type of classic and giving magical realism to a new generation of readers.A word of caution: Ignore the negative reviews. Other reviewers (the negative ones) have talked about the confusing character names, the length, etc. as reason to give this book 1 or 2 stars. Read the book, concentrating on the narrative and description. Don't get bogged down in the denseness of the prose. Reading this book, along with all other books for that matter, should be a treat, not a chore.The 1 and 2 star reviewers should just go back to reading those books that offer you a way to pass the time without actually using your mind."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This book has been so hyped that it would almost be impossible for it to live up to the high expectations that I had. That being said, I do think it was a wonderfully written and haunting novel.If this book is read on the surface for an entertaining story, then it definitely drags and is hard to keep the various characters straight. Sometimes the mysticism seemed forced and detracted rather than added to the story. It was also very much like a soap opera with so much drama and cheap plot twists that it was hard to take seriously at times.Marquez has a very beautiful writing style and often there will be sentences and phrases that jump off the page for their purity and wisdom of human existence. At other times, his writing style made me feel as if I was viewing this saga through a glass window and was never quite able to get into the scenery and characters. This could also be because Marquez would jump between characters as soon as I was getting to know them.However, now that I have finished the novel and am able to view the story of the Buendia family as a whole it is much more interesting than when I was in the midst of it. Each member of the family was used to personify the various tactics and personalities we employ to live our lives. No matter what anyone did during their lifetime, whether it was attempting to escape or embracing their loneliness, they were reduced to their solitude before death.There are many interesting parallels and symbols that make the read more interesting for me. Perhaps the people are really symbols for countries and represent the different strategies of countries to be successful, yet no matter what they do they are always a government condemned to the chosen system? Maybe the family is used to represent the entire human race, and the fact that we refuse to acknowledge our inherent flaws has destined us to our own destruction? Whatever the interesting parallels that you draw for yourself from this novel, there are important thoughts about war, humanity, solitude, love, lust, happiness and life woven throughout the pages."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"For years most of my life, until I read D. Foster Wallace's &quot;Infinite Jest,&quot; One Hundred Years Of Solitude was the single greatest piece of prose I had ever encountered. Even now it surpasses the truly gigantic I.J. as the most profound of novels. If you are going to read this book don't read it once or even twice, read it over and over again. Garcia Marquez has crafted so many different levels of meaning into the story of one family as to explain the entirety of human history from creation on. This is nothing less than the meaning of life, revealed through the virtues and faults of the Buendia family. The town of Macondo is a experiences everything of importance that has happened in the Americas since they were discovered by europeans. The Buendias are perhaps the most human characters I have ever encountered in literature. The mistakes they are doomed to keep repeating show how where one comes from will always be his destiny. This novel is anything but a crass tear-jerker, but it triggered emotiong in me of increadible power. This is the one book I buy for all my family and friends when it's time to give gift. I could keep going on and on, but you know how strongly I recomend this.

It is, in my opinion, as monumental a work as Moby-Dick because it isn't about one thing, or two things, it is about everything! Marquez never fails to surprise with his writing, the wonderful poetic way he tells of how people try to keep an ounce of humanity in the face of the vicious meat-grinder which we call life is absolutely amazing. Reading a Marquez book is the sensory equivalent to the smell of an impending thunderstorm and is the tactile equivalent of moist earth. If that description seems odd, it will seem fitting after you finish this book."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"reading &quot;100 years of solitude&quot; is like contracting some wonderful, exotic disease. you see bizarre apparitions, babble in foreign tongues, and claw at the pages all through the night, as you howl in delight and then crumple with sadness. a life-altering experience."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Gabriel Garcia Marquez's voice in this book echoes like a grandfather's telling fantastic tales like they were straight from a history book. If I were to deliver the same words I would not be able to stop my face muscles from twitching or my eyes from rapidly blinking... For how does one keep a straight face while talking about a ghost that conducts itself like a normal person, a patriarch tied by his family to a tree for years, a massacre of townspeople that nobody saw, a tangle of depressing secret relationships a few of them incestuous? That is the secret of Garcia Marquez's amazing skill.This book is not all roller coaster and nothing else. The evil in it is chilling, the ignorance frustrating, the wisdom mysterious yet magical, and the love--misdirected, undeserved--is searing.The end struck me speechless, I wanted to throw the book for overwhelming me so. Everything comes around in a circle. And time passes and people forget. That's what echoed in my mind after the smoke cleared."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Gabriel Garcia Marquez' groundbreaking masterpiece '100 Years of Solitude' (1967) is both a comic and a tragic meditation on numberless vagaries of human existence.As the book's title suggests, the novel details the history of three generations in the Buendia family, who found the small, isolated, and swamp-surrounded South American town of Macondo during the 19th century. As an authentic and frequently unprecedented work of literature, '100 Years of Solitude' stands as a robust and healthy challenge to the social, religious, and literary excesses of Protestantism, to which it offers a brilliantly colored, deeply felt, and sensual alternative. With its underpinnings in pagan Catholicism, '100 Years of Solitude' boils over with a psychologically profound, brash, visceral, and distinctly Latin vision of life.Flying freely in the face of Western scientific and philosophical rationalism, the novel offers its readers plagues of forgetfulness, sleeplessness, and clouds of yellow butterflies, ascensions by the living into the heavens, lifelong correspondences with \\"invisible doctors,\\" \\"suspicions of elves,\\" and rain storms and droughts that continue for years on end. One character senses that the Buendias are caught in a tight chronal frame of eternal reoccurrence, while another, perceiving a world without genuine boundaries of any kind, plucks knowledge from a collective unconscious floating in the air while claiming \\"everything is known.\\"Though levitating priests, flying carpet-riding Arabs, fraternal twins who trade destinies, and miraculous inventions abound, the novel never strays very far from its genuine and sincerely felt focus on the vicissitudes of the perpetually vulnerable, desiring, and inherently daydreaming nature of man. Among other things, '100 Years of Solitude' is also a profound meditation on the absurdly barbaric nature of war and the greedy, egotistical, and shortsighted character of the political arena.The Buendia family produces--and keeps producing--two basic kinds of men: idealistic, solitary, single-minded, and creative introverts, represented by the family's patriarch, Jose Arcadio Buendia and his son, Colonel Aureliano Buendia, and the more virile, self-serving, and callous hedonists best represented by sexually potent near-giant Jose Arcadio.Only the perceptive, long-suffering, and ancient family matriarch, Ursula Iguaran, struggles to maintain an objective and ordered understanding of the generally Dionysian chaos that surrounds and eventually envelopes her extended brood. For Ursula, there is little if any relief ever, as the forces of nature and ungainly human passion continuously destroy and deface the fruits of the family's often admirable labors. In the extended, complex, and secretive tangle of Macondo interrelationships, it is Ursula who consciously struggles to prevent incestuous couplings; her continuous prophecy that unbridled lust and misguided emotional liaisons will eventually produce a monster, \\"a child with the tail of a pig,\\" resounds throughout the book.The theme of human solitude is underscored as the one constant and dependable fact of human existence. Every character, by the very nature of their individuality, as well as by the simple hard truths of procreation, is set apart from the others in some distinct but irrevocable manner, whether it be their otherworldly beauty, idiot nature, inherent reflexivity, or a traumatizing episode in their childhoods. Living together in the vast Buendia complex, which is continually collapsing and being rebuilt, the characters often spend months in silence or near silence, even during periods of prosperity and relative happiness.Some characters happily board themselves up in shuttered rooms and become unwashed hermit scholars, while others, quietly planning illusory acts of revenge in response to illusory wrongs, simply don't speak out of spite for the span of their lifetimes.Some lose their minds as a result of their shattered dreams and obsessive memories of youthful promise. Ghosts of the dead walk the rooms and corridors too, equally isolated in death as in life. One comparatively minor character, Santa Sofia de la Piedad, like Georgina Hogg in Muriel Spark's 'The Comforters' (1957), simply ceases to exist from time to time at the author's whim.Even the more blithe and extroverted characters express themselves predominantly through action rather than words, and for all except Ursula, the stifling burden of unconsciousness is easier to bare than the sustained effort that consciousness requires.Gabriel Garcia Marquez has said that '100 Years of Solitude' came to him in \\"an illumination,\\" a statement that the novel's warm, organic, and fluidly archetypal prose bears out completely.Unlike the later 'Love in the Time of Cholera' (1985), the author's discerning, discriminating, and intruding hand is never sensed. Although frequently funny, brilliantly sustained passages of imaginative and fantastic material (some reminiscent of the Washington Irving of \\"Knickerbocker's History Of New York,\\" \\"Dolph Heyliger,\\" and \\"Wolfert Webber\\") are often followed by short, terse sentences of extreme brutality, such as one concerning a child hacked to death with a machete for spilling a drink on an arrogant soldier's uniform.The novel's conclusion, which unhappily recalls several of Edgar Allen Poe's short stories, may seem inevitable to some readers, while others may find it something of a betrayal of the book's overall tone. Regardless, the glorious miracle that is human existence, and a sense of the inherent, if often hidden, possibilities in all things are sumptuously served up for the reader in passage after passage.Throughout, '100 Years of Solitude' offers a compassionate, beatific vision that, while free of hard-edged moralizing, also never swerves away from the unpleasant truths inherent in human nature and man's finite physical existence. Though the repetitious names of many of the characters can become disheartening (5 major and 17 minor characters, for instance, share the name \\"Aureliano\\"), like Muriel Spark's 'The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie' (1963), it is a novel that can appreciated and understood by all people, regardless of nationality, social status, educational level, or background."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I picked this book up initially because it made a few top 100 lists and also because I had heard it favorably compared with Salman Rushdie's &quot;Midnight's Children&quot;. Most of the reviews for this book are glowing and for good reason. GGM's writing style is unusual, perhaps reminiscent of Carlos Castenada and also Rushdie. Marquez uses the events and emotions of his generally shallow characters to paint a picture of human emotion and struggle. The characters are painted almost in composite rather than as a picture. Details are used not to create a complete portrait of the character or of the town but to set a mood and convey almost intangible concepts. Appreciating this work is perhaps a little like appreciating Salvador Dali's paintings. The events that occur in the town are fantastic and surreal by design. Taken at face value, the book is almost nonsensical. Read and understood perhaps more as art, as an attempt to paint a picture, the book is haunting, moving, and evocative. This is definitely one work of literature that will stretch your boundaries and stands up to any of the classics."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Hailed by many as M&aacute;rquez's finest literary work, One Hundred Years of Solitude tells the story of the Buend&iacute;a family, who live and work in the South American jungle. M&aacute;rquez unites great wit and comic timing with philosophy to produce the extraordinary book, and the combination of fantasy, magic and reality makes for enthralling reading.Laughter and tragedy, love and death are all bound together by Garcia's unique writing style. There is exploration and adventure, but always with a slight tinge of sadness and nostalgia. M&aacute;rquez brings you into the Buend&iacute;a family and lets you experience their joys and triumphs, failures and disappointments at first hand. You experience life through their eyes, and become intimately acquainted with their fears, hopes and dreams.In 1982 M&aacute;rquez was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, and his other works include Love in the time of the Cholera and Of Love and Other Demons, as well as several short story collections. In all his books he invokes real emotion from the reader, and One Hundred Years of Solitude is no different. Whilst reading this book you are sent into an almost trance-like state, and become completely enveloped in the story. Fantasy and reality are intertwined so closely that it becomes impossible to tell the difference. M&aacute;rquez also explores the notion of time, as the later generations in Macondo repeat the experiences of the first generations. The names people receive are also relevant-for example all 17 Aurelianos are articulate, solitary men, and all Jose Arcadios are enterprising and energetic.This is a challenging read-I found myself turning to the front page to look at the family tree many times. However, this is an excellent book, destined to become a classic. An unmissable read, by perhaps the greatest author of our times."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I was not forced to read this in higschool; I was not forced to read it in college where I took several literature classes. It's a shame it took me so long to discover such a masterpiece and I wish I could go back to make this novel more influential throughout my ENTIRE life. The magical realism of this novel is unbelievable. It leads to a very exciting epic journey into the livliehood of hundreds of years in generation after generation of a family. The passion of the author seeps through it's every page. I believe it was a descriptive account of the feelings a young boy had growing up in Columbia through all of it's governmental changes; and how it changed his life in such a way to be able to write such a moving work of art. I believe it speaks to all of us, that we can all identify with SOMEOME in the book, and is a portrayal of what we all come to know as a familial circular history. As sad and tragic as it may be sometimes. I can definitley say that this book changed my perspective and thinking in some ways and I only wish I had had the experience earlier."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"While I think that this book was competently translated from Spanish, I do think that the translation does change the style of the book considerably. I was surprised to read reviews where readers considered the book &quot;difficult&quot; or &quot;dense&quot; until I read parts of it in English. I've read this book several times in Spanish, which is my native language, starting from when I was 16. And I find that the prose is not dense at all. My criticism of this English translation is that it overemphasizes the &quot;magical&quot; and &quot;exotic&quot; aspect of the language, making it almost self conscious of its own &quot;magical realism&quot;. I think that in Spanish, the magical realism is implied in the language, in the story. It feels like the English translation is intentionally dreamy, almost forced. Anyway, I think this is an excellent book in whatever language you choose to read it. Everyone should read this book at least once, don't worry about the hype, the analysis, etc. Just enjoy it, it will be worth your while."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Marquez transfers you through the words and thoughts of the Buendia family of the development of a primal foraging community to a community self involved in taking and developing a new world order with man at the center."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Everyman's Library edition of One Hundred Years of Solitude is a masterpiece of book publishing. Great binding, ribbon marker, typography and paper. A pleasure to hold and read."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This surrealistic excursion, told matter of factly in a style reminiscient of James Joyce, traces the life of several generations of the Buendia family, ordinary folks living ordinary lives in a small Colombian town who accidentally become witnesses to such monumental events as civil war, plagues, social oppresion while cherishing passionate encounters and obsessive fixations on obscure activities. Only in the final pages does it become clear that all which has transpired over the generations was foretold as the rise and fall of the Buendia family by the mystical gypsy Maquiliades. I suspect this literary masterpiece is more impressive in its original Spanish version, but its constant surprises and matter of fact style compel the reader's attention."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"There are many stories. But this one is perfect. I will always cherish this book."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This is my favorite novel by some distance. The novel is simultaneously the story of several generations of an extended family and the story of the entire human race from the beginning of history. It is full of magic not only in the sense that magical things happen, but also in its glowing prose and deeply sympathetic portrayals of its characters. The repetition and near-repetitions of names over the generations invite the reader to conflate information about different characters, demonstrating the interconnectedness of the family members. Maybe it doesn't matter if we keep their identities straight, and maybe we're not even supposed to. Let the plot swirl and let Marquez work his magic. Then step outside and notice how the world shimmers and glows."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"If you like James Joyce, Salman Rushdie or any kind of poetry you must read this book. It is an easy, accessible and exciting read. It is an incredible, magical work that truly deserves every accolade it gets."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"In short there is no reason not to read this novel, but I must say that I would have been reluctant to read it after it received the ignominious classification as an \\"Oprah Book.\\" That aside here is my take.Upon entering this novel the family tree stares you in the face -- telling you where the action is starting (in medias res for you fans of epics) and when you turn back to it during your peregrination tells you how much is to come. The term magical realism is oft applied to Marquez, yet his magic is actually his knack for telling a story like one of your grandparents. The book reads like an oral history yet the action never reads like an exaggeration. I am not composing this review to engage in talking about Marquez's commentary on religion (namely the Catholic church) or governmental corruption (including a send up of the federal system), but this book's take on those issues is refreshing / thought provoking. One could read this novel as an endorsement of anarchism but I think that might be oversimplifying the matter. As an aside, I believe that the idea of death as a human construct (i.e. unnatural), as developed here, is beautiful. I submit this five-star review noting that I am one who has a predilection for modern storytelling and diction but I can't help to find a timeless quality in the writing -- the expostion would be wrong using any other style. I may sound like the back of a pulp novel yet I still enjoin you to \\"read this book because it is the human drama writ large.\\" You shan't regret it."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"My all-time favorite book (before this one): \\"A Confederacy Of Dunces\\" by John Kennedy Toole. As a resident of New Orleans, LA for 21 years, I have revered John Kennedy Toole's work as a signpost for the future of literary genius. Walker Percy helped bring 'Confederacy' to the marketplace because he saw Toole's magical view of the world.Most who revere '100 Years' will think me absurd, but there is a magical quality to 'Confederacy' which mirrors the yellow butterflies of '100 years'. Please consider these _so disparate works_ together. They are both ___GENIUS___. \\"100 Years\\" clearly out-writes \\"Confederacy\\", but they are DAMN CLOSE."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"After reading half way into the book, I started to enjoy the author's methodology of writing. I have never read a book with such an unique and amazing way of linking things together from different space and time and putting it in a linear fashion. Unfortunately I cannot appretiate the story anymore than the average person can appretiate modern art. It is something only a few select intellectual connoisseur can appretiate. But one thing is how many of the people would actually give it 5 stars if they never knew anything about the Noble Prize or the Oprah book club etc?"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This story takes you through a small town cut off from the outside world, and it's founding family. Each character has their own obsession, problem, passion, or insanity. You get to follow generations through almost supernatural events. All the while there is something much bigger happening. This book has the best ending I have ever read that left me absolutely awestruck and weeping as I was devastated that the adventure was over."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"There are relatively few books that I've had to read for my college classes and truly enjoyed. This was one of them.Now, be warned: this is not a clear-cut story; the prose can be confusing, and the repetition of names makes it more difficult by far to keep track of who is who. The novel does indeed cover one hundred years, so expect to see favorite characters die if they first appear early on. There is no one protagonist. The family is the protagonist--the family, and the town.Perhaps despite these potential confusions and perhaps because of them, Marquez has woven in this book a shroud of mysteriousness and magical realism that make reading it something like stepping into a dream; his Macondo is like nowhere else on Earth (or at least nowhere I have ever heard of), and things at once comic, tragic, and unreal can happen there. You will find dreamers and would-be scientists, layabouts and soldiers, matriarchs and wantons in this enchanted household. Enchantment of a murky sort hovers over the land like a haze, touching everything and separating the descendants of Jose Arcadio from the world as we know it.You may not want to read it in one sitting; you may find yourself putting it down for awhile, confused or exasperated by the latest turn of events, but it is quite likely that you will pick it up again in due course with curiosity drawing you back into the realm Marquez has created. As classics go, this is one worthy of the title, and it is a story to be savored."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"One Hundred Years of Solitude, the greatest of all Latin American novels is the magic and multi-layered epic of the Buendia family and the story of their jungle settlement, Macondo.Like many other epics, this book has deeply-rooted connections with historical reality, i.e., the development of Colombia since its independence from Spain in the early 19th century. The story of the Buendia family is obviously a metaphor for Colombia in the neocolonial period as well as a narrative concerning the myths in Latin American history.The finest example of magic realism, One Hundred Years of Solitude is a wonderfully comic novel, yet the book also exudes a pervading sense of irony; a strong undercurrent of sadness, solitude and tragic futility. The intermingling of the fantastic with the ordinary keeps readers in a state of constant anticipation, especially where the generations of Buendia men are concerned.Some of this extraordinary novel's most important effects are achieved through the interplay of time as both linear and circular. The founding of Macondo and its narrative, for the most part, follow time in a linear sense, as does the history of the Buendia family, who form a series of figures symbolizing the particular historical period of which they are a part.The book, however is almost obsessively circular in its outlook, as characters repeat, time and again, the experience of earlier generations. The book's fatalism is underscored by this circular sense of time. Even a name a person is given at birth predetermines his or her life and manner of death, e.g., the Aurelianos were all lucid, solitary figures, while the Jose Arcadios were energetic and enterprising, albeit tragic.The characters in One Hundred Years of Solitude represent the purest archetypes; they are two dimensional and are used to convey certain thematic points. This enhances the beauty of the novel rather than detracting from it, for One Hundred Years of Solitude is thematic and metaphorical in nature rather than psychological.The male figures are obsessive, and full of ambitious projects and passionate sexuality. They are, however, given to extreme anger, irrational violence and long periods of self-imposed solitude.The female characters also lend themselves to categorization. With the exception of the Remedios, the women in the book exhibit either common sense and determination or passionate eroticism. But while the men are dreamy and irrational, the women are firmly rooted in reality. Both sexes, however, embody a similar fatal flaw; they lack the ability to relate to the world outside of Macondo. They fall victim to their own constructions, plunging them into a harsh and long-lasting solitude.Macondo is fated to end the moment one of its inhabitants deciphers Melquiades the Gypsy's manuscripts regarding the town's history. In a sense, however, Macondo does survive. One of the few who take the advice of the Catalan bookseller and leave the town before its destruction is Gabriel Garcia Marquez, himself, who escapes with the complete works of Rabelais.This self-referential ending, pointing to the world beyond Macondo from which Garcia Marquez is telling the story tells us that whatever life is to be lived in Latin America should not be the magic but self-defeating experience of the Buendias, but rather an ever-widening life of learning and moving on; the development of an awareness of doing what each situation requires.Garcia Marquez is more than a Nobel Prize winning author. He is a magician par excellence; someone whose unique ability to produce a magical realm where anything is possible and everything is believable is unrivaled. This is the overwhelming reason why this dazzling masterpiece does, and will continue to attract, convince and hypnotize readers for decades to come."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"The beginning of the book contains a family tree of the Buendia family, and if you're like me you'll surely mangle and dog-ear this page as you work your way though the book, trying to keep track of the Aurelianos, Remedios, and Ursulas.But the struggle is worth it. This was truly the great novel that Garcia Marquez was meant to write; to me everything of Marquez that followed seems like recycled material. I first read One Hundred Years of Solitude years ago before moving to Latin America. Now that I here and have read it again, many of the messages that before were inaccessible now reveal themselves. The Story of Macondo is the story of Colombia and, to a larger extent, of Latin America. The reviewers tell us this, but it is amazing to see it with my own eyes.The literal and the fantastic are interwoven with a seamlessness that amazes. One compares his style with Kafka before and Kundera after, literary voice established in this novel has withstood the test of time. It remains unique.The book is at once funny, sad, tragic; it's history and fantasy. But overall it is a marvelous read. Clearly one of my all time favorites. There are very few books that I recommend as highly as this one. A true classic."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I first read this book about 10 years ago in a neighborhood book club I belonged to. Of the group of about 10 people, 8 hated it and only 2 loved it. No one was indifferent.Just because I gave this book a 5-star rating doesn't mean I think everyone will like it. In my experience most will not. That's because the book is hazy and doesn't make sense. I often found myself flipping back 100 pages to figure out how the current character was related to the other previous characters. Sometimes I would find that the current character was the same character that had died or disappeared 100 pages previously.If you don't know already this book is the fictionalized story of generations of a family and the latin-american town in which they live. It was one of the first books to be written in a style that is called &quot;magic-realism&quot;. That means that the book doesn't have to make sense.This book is one of the top books I have ever read because it is the history of the world and everyone in it. I found myself over and over identifying with a character or recognizing someone I knew in a character. And as far as the &quot;magic-realism&quot;, I find that that is exactly the way life really is. I found that this book applies to everyone and its themes and characters are universal. Don't make the mistake of thinking this is just a latin-american genre book. Nor should you think it is a dense, philosophical novel. The stories and sub-plots are captivating and interesting.In short, this book is weird and wonderful. Give it a shot and you might be surprised as I was."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"'One Hundred Years Of Solitude' is a fascinating book, full of symbols and allusions, a book that is easy to read and the strange and fragile surreality of which is truly outstanding.However, there is quite a huge number of people who dislike it - and after reading some negative reviews I think I might have understood why it's like that. First of all, many object to the immoral things described in the book (especially incest). I myself don't read exclusively books by authors whose morals I agree with, but I understand that can differ. That is not the case with the second possible reason for people disliking this novel, however - and the reason is: people try to find traditional characters and a traditional storyline in the book. That is, naturally, impossible, because Marquez is very much of a postmodernist - thus there are no characters you can 'care for' and no real plot to follow - because these things simply do not matter, they have little or nothing to do with the meaning, the essence of the book.The main character of modern novels is usually an individual who doesn't fit in with the world, and Marquez certainly stretches the concept of that - in this case, the individual is the whole family. It matters not what each of the characters says, feels or does, because all the events are not meant to illustrate the characters' life, but rather the whole family's life - that is emphasized by the fact the names in the family as well as whole scenes from the family history continuously repeat in the novel. Marquez destroys the barriers of time, no such thing exists for him, everything was meant to happen long before it happened and thus time has no meaning, he freely moves events and characters in time, it seems. In other words, the whole book is not a history of a family - it is a history of an individual, really (you can see the birth of the family, its childhood, youth etc. and then death) or - perhaps - even the whole civilization (many classical themes have been used - from the Bible, for example).Marquez's language is immensely interesting - it is lively and changes throughout the book. He is also extremely good at exploring seemingly insignificant details (they can usually be taken as symbols - for example, butterflies have long been considered the symbol of the short life of happiness). Another thing that cannot be left unmentioned is the truly mesmerizing way he merges the real with the unreal, thus rising a question - what IS real?I think 'One Hundred Years Of Solitude' is one of the most important novels in the history of literature. It is open to interpretations - and if you are willing to try, you will find very much in this book."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This is one of the strangest and most powerful books I have ever read. I usually read European classics but had read \\"Love in the Time of Cholera\\" years ago and decided to try Garcia Marquez again. I can honestly say that \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude\\" is by far the most miraculously incredible, fast-paced, confusing, and magical novel I have ever read. I wasn't sad when it ended, because it simply HAD to end where it did; Garcia Marquez has a perfect sense of time.You find things in this novel that you simply cannot find if you're tied to the European tradition like I am (was). People who live to be 144. Rain that lasts over four years. Women so beautiful they cause death. A man whose presence is marked by swarms of yellow butterflies. People taken up to heaven. An \\"immaculate\\" suicide. These things happen all the time in this book, and the remarkable thing is that, for Garcia Marquez, they are perfectly unremarkable. They are an integral, wholly normal part of the world of his imagination, and the reader is fully engrossed in that world until the very last page.My one piece of advice for those wishing to read this book: read slowly, even when the pace of the plot begs you to flip the page. Things happen suddenly in this book -- people die in a sentence and are reborn in the next. The paragraphs are usually long, but they contain thousands of literary treasures you will miss if you blink.This is a book I will not soon forget."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I agree with others that this is a difficult read. I was honestly enjoying the book after the first couple of chapters, however. The writing is excellent, the story and its many twists intriguing. It all fell apart for me about halfway through when I realized I was no longer able to distinguish the characters and keep up with who was child of whom and who had died and how, etc. -- all critical to the continuing understanding of the story line. The author's choice to give the vast cast of characters very similar names was mind boggling. After a point, I simply could not -- without a fair amount of note-taking and diagramming I was not willing to do --keep up with all of the Aurelianos and Arcadios. Hats off to those who could finish it. I, unfortunately, could not."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This is not an easy to read book; if you are looking for light reading, this is not it. Also, this is not a book to read quickly; it takes a lot of reflection to try to grasp the meaning (and often times you don't) of the wonderous stories.Having said that, this is a wonderful book. Garcia Marquez tells the story of a family and a town, Macondo. The things that happen there are surreal; strange murders, sleeping disorders, scientists, soldiers, all revolve around the mansion of the Buendia family in Macondo. The tales introduce the reader to 20th century Latin American literature, with tales of love, sadness, desperation, hurt, and loss.This is Garcia Marquez's most famous work, and arguably his best. It is a book to be savored slowly, page by page, contemplated and reflected upon. If you are looking for a page turner or light reading, feel free to skip this book. It is made for a very specific type of reader, one that will take the time to decypher the meaning of the stories and uncover the artistic content hidden just below the surface of the page."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I don't really think this book needs my recommendation. It's a legend by itself already and I doubt what I have to say will influence your opinion more than the book when you actually read it. Still, I'll try to say what to expect and what not to expect.Most readers don't need this warning, but some will probably catch the book because it's \\"well known and great\\". Remember, this is a classical novel, not some action one. If you need action and adventure, go elsewhere, just don't try to plow over the book and then give it a one-star rating - you have been warned.Warnings aside, for a short description. The book is actually a case-study of one family's lives in a small village \\"on the edge of nowhere\\" (supposedly in South America, on the verge of the XIX and XX century, but this is not something you want to attach too much attention to, since the village is actually a sort of \\"neverland\\" and its geographical location is, I think, only due to the fact that Marquez felt better describing places that felt 'nearer' to him).The book is actually a philosophical work, best described I think as a study of situations when a human being, though seemingly surrounded by friends, relatives and even loved ones, is actually alone. Hence the title - it's actually a study of solitude without solitude, a solitude among people. A study made by a brilliant writer, in a breathtaking style which makes the book read like a thriller. Marquez builds the magical place that is the village very meticulously, making you almost want to seek out this neverland in reality.The main value of this book, its characters, atmosphere and the philosophy is not something you can describe in a review. You will just have to find it out for yourself. Which I greatly urge you to."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This remarkable novel had been on my \\"Must Read Soon\\" list for nearly twenty years, and with some shame I admit that I only recently got around to it. What a stunning masterpiece this is! I had read LOVE IN A TIME OF CHOLERA shortly after it appeared in English translation, and enjoyed it immensely, but as excellent as that was, it in no way prepared me for this amazing book. Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez's virtuosity is apparent on every page, assembling a vast array of improbable and unusual elements and blending them together to produce something utterly unique. He reminds me of those jugglers in a circus who spin plates on sticks, balancing them on every conceivable part of their body. Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez brings in such disparate elements that one can't imagine that he will manage to be able to keep all his plates up in the air. Remarkably, he does.ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE is the novel we most frequently associate with Magical Realism. It is impossible to think of this book without referring to \\"magic,\\" but the magic has as much to do with Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez's astonishing mastery of his material as it does with the extraordinary events that occur in the novel. In the hands of a lesser writer, this could have been a dreadful novel. Even a very good writer could be given a Cliff Notes summary of the book, and be asked to produce their own version, and produce a literary horror. The material is difficult, but Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez works it with a phenomenally deft touch, crafting it as superbly as Colonel Aureliano does his tiny gold fish. What is as unlikely is the way that he continuously introduces one supernatural element-a woman ascending to heaven while folding sheets, four years of rain followed by ten years of drought, a woman so sensual that her lovemaking causes livestock to reproduce at an usually fecund pace, a priest who levitates when drinking hot chocolate-after another without each new miracle seeming stale or losing its effect.The novel differs from most modern novels in that it does not contain in depth analyses of the characters. In fact, the characters aren't in general realistic characters at all. They function more like archetypes, and are sharply divided by gender. Men tend to act in the public arena, while women are guardians of the home and have it as their realm of influence. But not even the more fully drawn characters in the novel, such as Colonel Aureliano or his mother Ursula, emerge as full blown characters as in most serious novels in the 20th century. Nor is there a tightly constructed plot. Rather, the novel consists of a series of remarkable, fantastical collection of events and characters centered on a particular South American town. Some readers I know who want in depth, realistic characters have found the novel disappointing. But I have trouble accepting that a novel can take only one form.One could easily make the case that this is the most influential novel of the past forty years. It has had a profound influence not only in the Latin American world, but on writers in virtually every culture in the world. It has achieved a remarkable success in countries as disparate as Japan, Russia, the United States, and the various European nations. It is widely read in Africa and has been embraced in the Arab world as a modern day version of the Arabian Nights. The novel enjoys as close as one can find to universal appeal of any work of the past half century. My belief is that its success is merited and that it is one of the most remarkable novels that one can find."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I recently read the author's acclaimed work \\"Love in the Time of Cholera\\" and enjoyed it very much. It spurred me to seek out more work by Marquez, hence this and several others that I recently purchased.Marquez's writing is certainly unique in its earthiness. He deals with such subjects as sex, bodily functions and graphic illness as if they are parts of everyday life ... because they are. It is refreshing. Marquez is also known as one of the leading practitioners of the literary device of \\"magical realism\\" in which events are introduced into the story which are quite fantastic (for example, a character being swept away into the sky as though taken to heaven, a rain event that lasts over four years followed by an absolute drought of ten years).At its heart, this is the story of a remote South American village, from its founding, growth, prosperity, decline and ultimately through its destruction, as seen through the prism of a single extended family. In something of an annoyance, the numerous generations of the family all have the same or very similar names and usually inhabit the same time frame. So, you might have three or four actors with virtually the same name inhabiting the stage at once. This can be very confusing, especially when resuming the story after a night's sleep. Luckily, the author includes a family tree in the front of the book, a page I visited with regularity.The author's writing is indisputably beautiful and at times mesmerizing. However, I must say that I enjoyed LitToC quite a bit more, simply because it actually contained what I found to be a haunting and compelling story. I felt that the writing here dragged at times, but that's just me, a philistine. In my world, beautiful writing, in and of itself, can only take you so far before you need an end to the means (at least I do)."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I am sorry to say that I gave up on the book. I tried and even read some very intellectually capable folks reviews to see if I was missing something. I came to the conclusion that an individual who rarely reads fiction and who is an engineer by training could probably never \\"get\\" something like this book. It almost seems that the technique of the writer fascinates many of the readers perhaps more than the substance. The magical realism style is too much for me. I regret I could not finish Nobel prize winning author or not- maybe at some future date I will go back and try again. Sorry ----"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I love Amazon, but sometimes the book reviews are a little amazing. The author of this book won the Nobel Prize, largely for this book. It would probably make the top-25-of-all-time list of most reviewers. You would have little clue to the significance of the book by reading the reviews shown on the Amazon site -- one by Amazon and one by the Libary Journal. Snore."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This book is one of the best novels that I have read for several reasons. First, the style of writing is very lucid and simple. Unlike many novels, the reader will find himself hooked on to the book in the early stages, not because of the story, but because of the way the story is told. Second, this book is about a family, and this is why there is a sense of coherency and continuity even though important characters die at different stages of the novel. The emotions that are linked to the death of important characters are missing from other novels, except at the very end in some cases, because the death of the main character would result in a loss of interest in the rest of the story. In this book we are allowed to live and feel these emotions without them having a negative effect on our interest. By the time one of the main characters grows old and is ready to die, a new one is born and a new angle is woven around him. Third, the ending of the story is simply amazing. Some say that our last impression of the novel is the real deciding factor. In this case the ending of the story is probably one of the best parts of it and the reader closes the book while still imagining the picture that the author carefully painted in the last few sentences."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This book defeats a lot of people which is a shame because it is truly deserving of all its praise. It took me awhile, in fact several years to get going on it. The first couple of tries I was like what huh? I don't get it. Finally it made sense to me and I've now read it several times and will read it many more. So If you are having trouble getting going on this book try again and again and eventually you will get it, it will be worth it when that happens."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This book is like Achilles' dream of Patroklos: the yearning pain when the book ends is almost too hard to bear. I have read this dozens of times and never tire of it, nor am I ever any less moved. It is for those who know the torment of nostalgia. The language and depth are astonishingly beautiful; it is hilarious and searingly tragic. This is one of those books that makes you wonder how such brilliance can come from a single human being."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"In One Hundred Years of Solitude, Gabriel Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez introduces us to the mythical town of Macondo, and tells the story of the Buend&iacute;a family who live, love and die there. It is a fascinating novel, full of dozens f plots that wind through a land where magic is part of daily life.We follow the Buend&iacute;a family through the town's founding and the first Jose Arcadio Buend&iacute;a, throughout several generations to the books conclusion. In the beginning, the town of Maconda is a peaceful town isolated from the rest of the world, save for gypsies who visit every year, bringing new amazing things with them. Eventually the town, and the Buend&iacute;a family, lose their isolation as civil war, innovation and industry (in the form of the Banana company) sweep in.One Hundred Years of Solitude is hands down the best book I have read this year. It is not an easy read, but it is worth it. As much a philosophical study as an entertaining novel, you can read as much, or as little, into the story as you wish. There are complex themes blended with funny stories and exciting and surreal mini-plots. It is written in the style of \\"Magical Realism,\\" and there are several events throughout the book that are totally unexplained, and you are just forced to take them for what they are. Surprisingly, this is not as hard to do as you might think. The book has a great flow and you find yourself sucked into the lives of the Buend&iacute;a family.M&aacute;rquez does an amazing job of mixing fantasy with reality and weaving them into a moving novel. The loneliness and desperation of Colonel Aureliano Buend&iacute;a is palpable throughout the war years, and the theme of desperation pervades the whole book. When a character finds its way out of the city, such as when Remedios the Beauty rises to heaven, one feels elation for that character that they found a way to escape. Despite the sense of apathy that surrounds the book, the short anecdotal story lines keep the book from becoming bogged down and boring.The hardest part of reading this book was keeping some of the names straight. Several of the male characters have the same two names (Aureliano or Jose Arcadio), and many of the lives are so intertwined that even those with names that are not similar are still easy to confuse. This was a detail I became accustomed to however, and there was a family tree included in the beginning of the book that helped to clarify thing.While One Hundred Years of Solitude, may not be light reading, it is a novel worth finishing (If for no other reason that to finally put all of the story-lines missing plot pieces together.) Like all good novels, there are questions in the book that are answered in the end and others that we can only answer ourselves. If you are looking for a book to challenge you and at the same time entertain you I highly recommend One Hundred Years of Solitude."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"With the sound of foreign laughter reverberating through the nearby wall, the letters upon the page began to shake and melt over one another.So I went to finish One Hundred Years of Solitude in a way that served as an unintentional reverence for the superb novel by Gabriel Garcia Marquez: in the solitude of my silent bathroom.I say that because the walls in my apartment are paper thin, and I couldn't have the final chapter of such a wonderful book spoiled by the unintended rudeness of my roommates who were causing a ruckus in the hall.In One Hundred Years of Solitude, Marquez crafted a masterpiece with a story filled with an absurdity infused with a kind of certitude that forces you to believe in the unbelievable.I won't bore with the details, but it's the story of the rise and fall of the Buendia family and the equally fated town they establish along a swamp in an unspecified Latin American country. It's filled with the personal dramas of the individual family members and others who find their lives merged with theirs. Incest, betrayal, yearning souls, and tormented consciences define the predicaments, all spelled out in a beautiful and heart-wrenching narrative.You must believe in ghosts, inexplicable defiance of the rule of natural law, and have an affinity toward tragedy, but One Hundred Years of Solitude will have you spellbound if you allow yourself to be smitten by it."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I only made it to 195 pages. The book is just boring. A lot of sound and fury signifying very little. There are marriages; there are deaths; there are love affairs; there are suicides; there are battles... so a lot does happen. BUT-- I don't care about the characters. If you don't care about the characters, then all their quirky faults seem abstract and dull. Like dusty butterflies in a catalog, their various lives are chronicled. It's a dry description of their adventures and I'm left with a \\"so what?\\" Maybe his dryness passes for sophistication, but this book left me cold."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I just finished reading \\"100 Years of Solitude\\". I really enjoyed it, tho it took me 3 weeks to read it. Everytime I opened it back up to continue where I was I felt like I was stepping back into Macondo. There's no place like it nor is there a family like the Buendia's either. The story and the words used by Marquez are so deep in meaning and a sentence can mean so many things. I loved it and I love the twists and turns the family goes thru like any family. However, I knew what was going to happen in the end, which was really kinda ironic and funny. You have to read to find out."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I've read this masterpiece 7 times since I was 17, now I am 24...Everytime I read it, I discover new things, even author's mistakes.

Since then this book has been number one for me and nothing has come close to it. I also loved No One Writes to the Colonel by the same author. The interesting thing is that I tried to read One hundred Years .. again a couple of times but I couldn't get through , so maybe this book has magical powers and calls upon its readers if it finds them ready."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"One Hundred Years of Solitude is not only Gabriel Garcia Marquez's masterpiece, it is THE masterpiece of the twentieth century. Years from now, this book will (and rightfully so) be required reading for your children and grandchildren, and generations afterwards. My advice to you, the wary shopper, is to order this book or buy it IMMEDIATELY. If you consider yourself a mature reader (as I do), you should get this book and grow.I should only be so lucky as to have never read it, so I could experience it again for the first time. If you've started it and don't really know where it's going, FINISH IT. It is the best ending ever written, in my humble opinion, and would certainly be a contender for the best novel ever published period. Read it, and whether or not you finish it, pass it on. There is much to be learned here, if you are willing to learn it. And to those who can't finish it-- stick with it. To those who finished it and still didn't like it-- try again a few years down the road. You will discover a whole universe in those pages.Gabriel Garcia Marquez, like Toni Morrison, did not win the Nobel for no good reason. Find that reason and cherish it."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This is an excellent book. I recommend it to anyone.

If you enjoyed this book, do read it!"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This book is broken down into pseudo-chapters which follows a family through several generations. It's fiction, but it's a bit more than that. I remember reading somewhere that there is no difference between poetry or prose, fiction or nonfiction, that all these are just tools for writers to explain a truth. This book explains the truth in humans and everything from our vices to our virtues.The story also falls into a certain realm of fantasy because it does involve some supernatural elements such as ghosts and alchemy. It shows great men who lost their humanity, poor men who sold their souls for greed, the corruption of governments, the madness within ourselves, and the fallacy of our belief that people who are different than us are beneath us. The book follows an omniscient narrator as he tells the story of various family members of the Buendia family. Spanning several generations, these characters fill every quirk and vice that dogs humanity. My favorite character is Remedios the Beauty, who out of either extreme ignorance or extreme clarity is thought of as an eccentric, dumb girl. Her character poses the question, \\"Is she really dumb or is she just smarter than us all?\\"The best books, though, are impossible to summarize and break down into succinct little paragraphs for those that haven't read it to truly understand. I plead that you read a few chapters into this book just to truly understand. More likely than not, if you prefer stuff by Stephen King or Dan Brown, you may not like this book. The book does not explain things point blank for you. It confuses you with over 30 characters, half of which have the same name. It melds storylines together from father, to son, to brother. It doesn't hold your hand and create suspense to draw your attention and it surely does not answer every question you have like a nurturing parent. It requires pensive thought while reading and an intuitive grasp of things deeper than what the author writes to truly understand. When you finish the book, there will be a myriad of questions left unanswered and you may or may not feel a certain disdain for the author for creating such questions within you. Answer them yourselves, the answer is in humanity."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I read this book about 30 years ago and recommend it to all my reading friends. It's been a cult classic and now I see Oprah has finally caught on! This book was translated from Spanish to English and it is wonderful!My son told me the name for this kind of writing is suspended realism. Like so many Spanish speaking authors, Marquez takes the reader on a beautiful journey with his words."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"One Hundred Years of Solitude chronicles 100 years of a family (of Buendia) and a village (city) that the \\"first of the family line\\" founded. The prose is lyrical and flows as smoothly as a river. That is, sometimes there are rapids and other times calm. The genre is magical realism, and it is fascinating watching the magic evolve with the family and village. After finishing this book, I'm not 100% certain what Marquez meant by it, though. It has anti-war and anti-oppressive-regime themes, but there's something more that I haven't quite put my finger on yet. I may need to re-read it after letting it settle for a while."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This book taught me to love reading. There are many characters and it's a bit difficult to keep track of them at times but I still couldn't put this book down. I have to put it back on my reading list."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Just an awesome, awesome novel. At first it struck me as something I would detest, full of telling and no showing hardly at all. But after a hundred pages, I realized there was a certain genius to what was being written. At its most basic, this is the story of a family and the growth of a small town in South America over a hundred years. But it's really so much more than that, so much so that I can't really describe it. This was my first knowing experience with literature that is supposed to be from the magic realism genre, which is closely related to fantasy, but I can see the difference. Would I recommend this novel? Not for everyone. If you are someone who enjoys overly literary tales which say much between the lines, then this is for you. If you are a reader who likes straight-forward stories, this won't be your thing."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel Garcia Marquez is a book of great lyrical magic which tells the story of Jose Arcadio Buendia, his wife Ursula and their descendants in the village of Macondo which they founded after leaving their home in the mountains and searching for the ocean. They failed to find the ocean but built the town on the edge of a great swamp. The town grows and changes as time is transformed by modern inventions. The first of these inventions are brought by the gypsies, one of which was a heavy man with \\"an untamed beard and sparrow hands\\" who introduced himself as Melquiades. He sold Jose Arcadio Buendia a magnet and later a telescope. These items transformed Jose Arcadio Buendia from an industrious man who helped build the village into a man obsessed.Obsessions, solitude, love and war are themes of One Hundred Years of Solitude. Character after character seems to fall into one strange obsession after another. There is a girl who eats dirt to manage her pain, a man who loses his mind and is tied to a chestnut tree for years, a man who spends years writing on parchments and another man who spends years trying to decipher them.As Maconda is at first an isolated village, we see also that many of those living there have isolated themselves in one way or another and live in solitude. Indeed, solitude is a word which Garcia Marquez using frequently in the book. Aside from those characters who have locked themselves away physically are those who have removed themselves in other ways by rejecting love for fear of the transformative hurt which love can cause or by allowing war to take the place of love and human feeling.Gabriel Garcia Marquez wanted to tell the story in the way in which his grandmother told stories, with a granite face and a rambling way in which both listener and storyteller became lost in the story. He certainly accomplished this. At any point of the book the language and story telling is beautiful, but also is a twisting path in which the reader wonders both where are we going and where have we been?Because of this manner of \\"story telling\\" One Hundred Years of Solitude is a challenge to read, but well worth the effort with its tale rich with strange and magic characters, and mystical events."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I began the novel with very high hopes; I love magic realism, and I'd heard that this is the best of the lot. It did not disappoint. Marquez is a brilliant author who has created a brilliant story of a family and a town and modernization. His writing is spectacular, funny, sad, wistful; his characters are amusing, poignant, and sad, and have a humanity that is rarely seen in literature. All in all, well worth the effort and touching, and very worthy of being called the greatest work of magic realism."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"The best way to describe 'One Hundred Years of Solitude' is as an adult fairy tale. What with flying carpets and people living for over 100 years, to name but two of the fantastical elements of this story, you need to suspend disbelief to get the most from this poetic and rich story. Based around the various generations of the Buendia family this book explores the various lives and exploits of each family member. It has a mixture of events that make for interesting stories in their own right and give the book the feel of a short story collection with the same characters and a loose over arching theme to tie it all together. It took me some time to get used to the style, but once I did I found it to be an engrossing and rewarding read. Well worth a look if you like evocative language and vivid imagery and due to the fantasy elements it reminded me of Salman Rishdies 'Satanic Verses' and if you liked that then this is well worth a try. A strong 4 star book.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"It's a sophisticated read with MANY subplots (most of which include characters with the same name). It can be confusing at times, but it's a good book once you learn each character. I read this book 5 times since 2008 and each time I read it, I discover something new. Don't expect a book you can just read once and move on with your life. It's not that simple."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Most likely the greatest epic I have ever read.

Fabulous characters, based on Garcia Marquez's memories of his childhood, and magical realism. Once you have read this book, you will never, ever forget it! Since I have read \\"Solitude\\" I have also devoured Marquez's other books, in particular, \\"Love in the Time of Cholera\\" which is the most beautiful love story ever written.

You don't see many books like this one, so it's definitely worth a try =)."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Yes, this is a seriously engaging book, and as far as the style of \\"magical realism\\" goes - this one has it ALL. However, even though I enjoyed reading it and could not leave it alone for any long periods of time, I was still a bit disappointed by this family-saga classic, and I must admit I am much more fond of Marquez' \\"Love in the Time of Cholera\\".I found it a pretty easy read, and that might actually be part of the problem - I feel it is actually too easy...Most aspects of the story, including the people and all their thoughts and feelings, are almost \\"over-explained\\", which does not leave the characters with any mysteries. I almost felt cheated out of my desire to ponder their personalities, thoughts and actions - perhaps with the exception of Remedios the Beauty, where the author resists the urge to dissect her interior emotions.As a sidenote, I kept referring to the family chart in the beginning of the book quite often. Some readers have complained that the book is hard to follow due to all the similar names in the family tree that appear with regular intervals in the different generations. When I state that the story is too \\"easy\\" I am mainly referring to the portrayals of the charcters and not Marquez' elaborate construction of generational relationships.Overall, I liked the descriptions of the town, landscapes and scenery the best since Marquez left me something for my own imagination.In conclusion, I liked the book, but I did not love it"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This book was slow to grab me. I made the mistake of trying to read it an hour or so at a time. Because keeping track of characters is a bit challenging, due to the topic family's re-use of names generation after generation, it helps to sit down and read for good stretches of time to keep things straight in your head. When I did that.....I was transported into another place and time. What a moving and beautiful story! By the time you reach the end, you are dizzy in the tale, and the strange and fantastic ending makes perfect sense and ends the story perfectly. Not for the light reader, but for a curl up and read for a weekend reader, this is a good book to 'escape' with."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This book blew my mind. I can be a bit slow and confusing (there are many characters with the same of very similar names) but the writing is of a caliber seldom seen. The story is intense and the people stick with you for years!"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I first read \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude\\" not long after it was first published in English, almost 40 years ago. It was a wonderful, and magically, if you will, introduction to Latin American literature. Subsequently, I've read several other works by Marquez, notably,Love in the Time of Cholera (Vintage International)some 20 years later, but none have quite cast the spell of my first \\"love,\\" this one, so I figured a re-read was in order. The \\"magic\\" of magic realism has lost none of its charm.The story involves six generations of one family, established by Jose Arcadio Buendia and Ursula Iguaran, who also helped found the town of Macondo, in the lowlands of Columbia, though the country is never specifically identified. The in-breeding (and also out-breeding) in this one family is simply astonishing. I can't remember if the original edition had a genealogical chart at the beginning, but this one does, and it provides an invaluable reference in keeping the philanderings, and the subsequent progeny, straight, particularly since numerous individuals over the generations have the same name. What is the \\"Scarlet Letter\\" that is prophesized for a family with such a high degree of consanguinity? That a child will be born with a pig's tail.Marquez dazzles the reader with the intensity of his writing; it's as though he had a 1600 page book in him, but is given a 400 page limit. It is the furious sketching of a street artist, making every line count in a portrait. The strengths, follies, and interactions of the men and women are depicted in memorable events. And there seems to be a realistic balance and development of his characters. Marquez is also the master of segue, from one event to the other, and from one generation to another, with his characters moving from swaddling clothes, on to adulthood, and then into their decrepitude.From my first reading, I had remembered Rebeca, with her \\"shameful\\" addiction to eating dirt. First time around, I chalked it up to Marquez's \\"magical realism,\\" since no one really ate dirt. Several years later I learned that it is a wide-spread medical problem, often driven by a mineral deficiency that the person is trying to remediate. The author also describes the disease of insomnia which was spread to Macondo, with an accompanying plague of forgetfulness. Magical realism, or the forgetfulness of the \\"now\\" generation that has lost the stories of the past?Establishing the time period comes slowly. Marquez mentions Sir Frances Drake, but he is in the unspecified past. It is only when a family portrait is taken, as a daguerreotype photo, that one realizes it must be in the 1840's-50's, with six generations to go. There are a multitude of themes: since this IS Latin America, Marquez has the obligatory gringos and their banana plantations (alas, all too true); there is endless, senseless war, with the two sides eventually unable to state what they are fighting for, except, of course, the war itself; there are the women who drive men crazy with their beauty, and there is the spitefulness of women to each other (alas, again, the \\"sisterhood'); there is economic development, and a worker's revolt, and the use of other members of the same class, but in uniform, who repress it; there is the role of the Catholic Church in Latin America, and even a family member who would be Pope and there are unflinching portrayals of the aging process, alas, to the third power.On the re-read, I noticed a portion of the novel that was much further developed inInnocent Erendira: and Other Stories (Perennial Classics). Also nestled in the book was an important reference: \\"Taken among them were Jose Arcadio Segundo and Lorenzo Gavilan, a colonel in the Mexican revolution, exiled in Macondo, who said that he had been witness to the heroism of his comrade Artemio Cruz.\\" Checking Marquez bio, he has been a long-time friend of Carlos Fuentes, slipped this reference in 100 years, which is an omen for me, since I was considering re-reading Fuentes marvelousThe Death of Artemio Cruz: A Novel (FSG Classics)And in terms of omens, redux even, do future travel plans include meeting another character in the book, the Queen of Madagascar?I recently had dinner with a woman who had been Ambassador to one of the Latin American countries. Spanish is her native language, and she still reads some of the Latin American writers in Spanish to \\"keep her language skills up.\\" As for \\"100 years,\\" she had read it four times, each time in English. It's a record I am unlikely to repeat, but this novel, which honors the Nobel Prize with its name, could use a third read, if I am granted enough time. It ages well, sans decrepitude, and provided much more meaning the second time around. 6-stars."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Marquez credited Kafka's \\"The Metamorphosis\\" with giving him the realization that stories could be written in that way--and, indeed, he could be a writer. The Kafkaesque influence comes in subtle and beautiful ways throughout this book; where the fantastic is presented so matter-of-factly that one cannot help but accept it as reality. It *is* reality--and it gives the entire book a sense of everyday magic.Quite simply put, this is one of the most beautiful, sweeping novels that I've read in a very long time. Characters not only benefit from their exquisite drawing, but are enriched by a hundred years of family history--of the growth and death of a town, of the patriarchs, of the ghosts of ancestors who may or may not walk around. They are perpetually haunted, lonely, driven; cemented in time and place even as the world moves on.It's a book you want to crawl into and live within its pages. You want to feel the whitewashed walls, to taste the dust and the tang of mercury, to see the sun shining through the windows on the skin of the inhabitants. And, perhaps, because the book presents the fantastic as the real--it feels like you really *could* do that fantastic thing and escape inside forever.It's a rare 5-star rating for me."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"If you want an example of how to touch the human heart with words on a page, look no further than the work of the incredible Gabriel Garcia-Marquez. You could open this book to a page in which the making of a ham sandwhich is being described, but if it is being described by Garcia-Marquez...you may find yourself in tears...this is not an exaggeration. The plot is completely original, the characterization is some of the best with certain characters such as Colonel Aureliano Buendia and Remedios the Beauty, and if there was ever a book that provided an escape to another world...this is it. After putting it down, you may look at your surroundings and find everything to be painfully dull. Gabo is a master."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Gabriel Garcia Marquez accomplishes a superb piece of literature. This book is written in a fascinating manner and transports the reader into a world that is seemingly impossible yet totally didactic. A+! Bravo, Mr. Marquez, and thank you."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Gabriel Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez who has created in \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude\\" an enchanted place that does everything but cloy. Macondo oozes, reeks and burns even when it is most tantalizing and entertaining. It is a place flooded with lies and liars and yet it spills over with reality. Lovers in this novel can idealize each other into bodiless spirits, howl with pleasure in their hammocks or, as in one case, smear themselves with peach jam and roll naked on the front porch. The hero can lead a Quixotic expedition across the jungle, but although his goal is never reached, the language describing his quest is pungent with life:\\"The men on the expedition felt overwhelmed by their most ancient memories in that paradise of dampness and silence, going back to before original sin, as their boots sank into pools of steaming oil and their machetes destroyed bloody lilies and golden salamanders. For a week, almost without speaking, they went ahead like sleepwalkers through a universe of grief, lighted only by the tenuous reflection of luminous insects, and their lungs were overwhelmed by a suffocating smell of blood.\\" This is the language of a poet who knows the earth and does not fear it as the enemy of the dreamer.Near the end of \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude\\" a character finds a parchment manuscript in which the history of his family had been recorded \\"one hundred years ahead of time\\" by an old gypsy. The writer \\"had not put events in the order of man's conventional time, but had concentrated a century of daily episodes in such a way that they coexisted in one instant.\\" The narrative is a magician's trick in which memory and prophecy, illusion and reality are mixed and often made to look the same. It is, in short, very much like M&aacute;rquez's astonishing novel.This book gives you kind of a feeling of living in a dreamland that is all too real. I highly suggest checking this book out asap"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"The novel opens with one of literature's greatest leads \\"Many years later, as he faced the firing squad..\\" and never lets up through the four hundred some odd pages that follow. People will often say about an author \\"There's nobody like them..\\" and that's especially true for Garcia Marquez. This isn't a traditional novel, and I can't guarantee you'll love it. Like a lot of great Latin America fiction, it just isn't for some people. However, if you love Latin American writers and for some reason haven't read Marquz's masterpiece, I recommend you do so as soon as possible. The novels plot, in so much as it has a plot, is documenting a family, the Buendia's, over a period of one hundred years. The family is imperfect and dysfunctional to say the least, but are also very powerfully described, and by the end you will know them so well you'll feel as if you know them personally.I would also recommend getting the Everyman's library version of this book. It is well bound, beautiful and will hold together. And I don't know if other versions have this or not, but it has a Buendia family tree at the beginning, which is helpful for telling apart characters, as their names are often nearly identical. As one review put it, it leaves you with a pleasant exhaustion that only very great novels provide. There are very few books I've enjoyed as much as this one, and I recommend you at least give it a shot. Even if you put it down for a while, I'm willing to bet you will be drawn back to it before long. It's interesting and well written, with all of the magic you'd expect from a Latin American great, and it's definitely worth a read."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Gabriel Garcia Marques is a giant among world and South American Writers. This book is an eye opener for those interested in South American lore and Magical Realism. A true masterpiece. Could not put it down."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"First of all, I must say that GGM is probably the one writer that gave me an endless appetite for all things literature. I now read like a book per week thanks to him.This novel basically describes the progress mankind has been able to accomplish throughout millennia and how in the end we are not that far away from were we started. Moreover, it makes this whole thing that people will behave according to their names which just makes you think about life.I must say that I read it in the summer of 07. It took me a month to read it from cover to cover. I got mad at the end because I seriously did not like it one bit. However, I sat down with a friend of mine and she broke down all the aspects of the novel and I was able to better understand the whole thing. I have been reading GGM for several years now, this by far is the cream of the crop.If you think this novel is too much for you, I don't blame you. Start with other, shorter novels, like a \\"Chronicle of a death foretold\\" and \\" Of love and other demons\\" to familiarize yourself with his style. Then try again to undertake the arduous work of reading this masterpiece. lol"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Like many that reviewed this book, it can be a struggle, the names are difficult to follow and it is not an easy read. I learned a very important lesson while reading this book... great literature is not always simple and straightforward. I believe you get as much out of this book as you put into it. This is probably one of the top five books I have ever read and after all of the \\"work\\" I put into it, I was rewarded many times over. All of my good friends are getting this for Christmas."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This is another book I admired more than enjoyed. The term \\"magic realism\\" has been coined to describe it, but what Garcia Marquez does, is akin to what Kafka and Joyce have done, but in a style less concise than the former, and less abstract than the latter. He tells the fantastic tale of Macondo and the Buendia family in the most sober of styles, offering up surrealism as part family portrait and part Latin American history.The repetition of names serves as a device to hermetically seal off the Buendias from the rest of society, thus ensuring their solitude. It can be overwhelming at times, and I frequently had to refer to the family tree to get my bearings. Each member of the clan has unique strengths or attributes, as well as fatal flaws, that isolate them from others. The Buendias seem to be in constant struggle, either with themselves, with the rules of society, or with the natural world in the form of ants, scorpions, and torrential rains that last for almost 5 years. The alchemic quest, the transmutation of the dross into the sublime, seems to be a running theme.Garcia Marquez is very adept at descriptive imagery, but it seems overused at points. I never felt empathy with any character. There is a lack of pathos in this novel. Outrageous humor is in my opinion, one of the chief qualities of this novel, and probably it's greatest strength, more so to me than the surrealism and obvious symbolism."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"The critics ran out of adjectives to describe this one. When I finished reading the last word in the last sentence on the last page, I understood what they were talking about.This is NOT just a novel. It is a fairy tale. It is an epic. It is poetry. Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez is a modern day Vyasa. If you love books and haven't read this one yet, WHAT ON EARTH HAVE YOU BEEN DOING?!"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"In our reading group, the question was asked, &quot;What's this book about?&quot; That's the problem with a work so unique - it passes description. One of us tossed out &quot;the life of a village&quot; and maybe that's the best way to say it. By whatever description, this is a book of rare wisdom and deep pathos. Truly one of those books that you will be glad you read."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel Garcia Marquez is the type of book that once you finish reading, you will want to buy a copy for everyone you know. This tremendous novel is so pressed with humanity that you will suspect that every person you know will be able to relate to some aspect of it. One Hundred Years of Solitude is the story of the Buendia family, a dynasty that inhabits the mythical village of Macondo for ten decades until the last of their line breathes his last breath. The cast of characters continually changes as new Buendias are born, grow up and die. Mr. Marquez invents a singular, mystical air for each of his characters, charging each of their tales with enchantment, wonderment and meaning. In the span of their existences, some of the family seek love, others solitude; some serenity, others uprising; some industry, others intimacy. Regardless of his or her life's pursuit, each member of this family is absolutely unforgettable and very easy to sympathize with. Some novels incorporate a tremendous range of the uniformly important aspects of life. This is certainly one of them."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This epic novel is as much about non-change and having one's subconscious roots stick with them, as much as it is about the outwardly, external transformations going on in the adaptable town of Macondo. The vast interplay among genders and other relationship roles between the conservative moralist and the liberal freedom fighter, religion and science, old and young, lovers and lustful temptations, community and business, health and openness, etc define the rapid transformations that invade the sleepy hamlet of Macondo and the residents of it's original founders of the Buendias and the Arcadios. As much as men are at the center of action during war, strikes, assassinations, persecutions, scientific and geographical discovery, and the search for sexual satisfaction, women hold the core of the household and people's sanity together. It is the patience and selflessness Ursula, Pilar, Renata, and finally Fernanda exude that smoothes out the roughened edges and keeps the house remarkably intact without any significant violence breaking out, with one exception and with maintaining a self-respect for the pioneers that came before them.It is through the ineffective fallibility of the men's characterstics to repeat the mistakes of the past and eventually lead into a parochial faceted neuroticism that leads to the destruction of the last becon of fortitude in Macondo, the Buendias household. Melquiades' prophetic words reverberate in one's mind as the final victims of their complacency are diminished to death by the ravages of nature and by their resignation to complete the cyclical journey of ending peacefully one's journey at the point of one's nascent origination.One hundred years pass never to be repeated or documented and written off to the annals of history. This ending, sadly paralleled the destruction reaped upon this quaint villages through the forces of imperialist, industrial, capitalism. Losing it's connectivty and bonds led to the destruction of Macondo with such unforeseen forces only to be overwhelmed by it at the end with nothing to record the reasons for it's fall. Therefore, it was bound to repeat and repeat it did until a higher consciousness was awakened by further tragedies that would lead to the obliteration of millions of lives with WWI and WWII.The Macondo's no longer exist and innocence has been lost through years of backstabbing exploitation, but Gabriel Garcia Marquez has given us all a treasure that we can rejoice in our solitude that will balance our perspective and leave us attune to our inner peace among the rapid, stop n go, rollercoaster ride hecticness that is life. Truly a must read for anyone searching for the roots and meaning of effective balance."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"It's a spell. You can't love it, hate it, or ignore it. You can only read it with sometimes teary eyes. An infection that's been dormant in a deep memory. It doesn't look at life, but gravity itself radiates from an infinitessimal center to a pulse as big as all time and all space. It goes with ease through the evidence of reality without making a religion out of it, and all the religions that have been stuck to it peal away. Reasons, pride, taboos, all imposed order floats harmlessly in the stratosphere, with only humanity down here, as if there were only one person playing with memories that don't make sense. Or as if there were only the memories with nothing to make them into sense. It's an experience that lingers from original incest to the final dust."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"The copy I have of One Hundred Years of Solitude had been passed between backpackers in Europe in 1994. Each person read it and passed it on to someone else at the next hostel they arrived at. It is dog-eared and falling apart but its world trip ended with me as I just couldn't pass it on...I was told by the man who passed it on to me that it was the best book he had ever read and he wanted to share the gift. I agree - but I'm too selfish to share and will read it over and over until it turns to dust"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I've read a lot of the reviews for this book and none of the writer's state very well why they liked it. Opening to a random page in the bookstore, I discovered delicious prose which gave me a sense not only of being there with these people but of the history they endured. And yet.... As I actually read the story, I felt increasingly disappointed. Marquez gives me a family of people who make one stupid mistake after another. I never connected with any of the characters, because right around the time I might begin to feel an affinity with a character, he or she would either do something stupid or die. I really wanted to care about these people, but Marquez seemed determined to create characters for whom I must not care. Worst of all, at the end he betrayed the sense of history he so beautifully constructed throughout the book by wiping it off the face of the Earth. &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot; is worth reading for the descriptive skill Marquez displays, but don't expect to be captivated by a character or uplifted by the story."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"In the afterword that describes the author, it is said that the Marquez was deeply influenced by two things in his life. One was his first eight years of childhood with his grandparents. His grandmother would tell him the most fantastic things with the same expression and voice with which she would talk of normal facts. Another was the reading of Kafka's 'Metamorphosis', which recounted \\"the wildest things with a completely natural tone of voice\\", in his words.The same technique is used in this novel. Improbable things happen and happen and happen in this book; long run-on sentences describe ordinary and unbelievable events in the same breath. The reader is swept into the torrent of mystical happenings of Macondo, the small, pertinacious, fantastic village.The book follows the rise and fall of the Buendia family and Macondo, intricately knit together by the thread of fate. Six generations of Buendias appear in this book, and several generations exist at once: especially Ursula, the first mother, who doesn't die almost until the end. The lives of many people go on at once, in a great noisy tumble. The book detailedly describes the petty doings of one character while completely ignoring others; the focus switches this way and that way wildly. All sense of time is lost, as the book races through several days and several years at the same pace and skips back and forth; people live to impossible old age and others die young, ghosts appear suddenly. The vicious circle of history is unbroken to the last; Macondo is a village of mirrors, even the names of the Buendias repeat themselves in the passage of time, despite the efforts of some such as Ursula or Amaranta Ursula to break it.The book finally succeeded in shocking me at last, when Aurelius puts his formidable, healthy, wailing, newborn son with a pig's tail in a basket, then sets out to wander aimlessly searching for the past, returns, suddenly remembers his child, and finds \\"a dry and bloated bag of skin that all the ants in the world were dragging toward their holes along the stone path in the garden\\". Melquiades' prediction is finally revealed in that instant, near the end of everything: The first of the line is tied to a tree and the last is being eaten by the ants. The story ends with the end of everything, in a great gust of apocalyptic wind.One of the curiosities I discovered while reading the afterword is that Marquez's sons are Rodrigo and Gonzalo, the exact names Amaranta Ursula wanted to give her sons. And the name of Marquez also appears in the book, Colonel Gerineldo Marquez. I wonder what he was thinking of when he set that up. I think it's a great technique, involving oneself and one's life in the book. The term 'magical realism' fits this book perfectly."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Gabriel Garcia Marquez' \\"One Hundred Years Of Solitude\\" is the literary equivalent of a magic carpet ride, your own magic genii come to life, and Shaharazade's 101 tales wrapped into one brilliant, multilayered epic novel. From page one you will voyage with the most remarkably original cast of characters, through worlds of vibrant color, where the sun shines almost always - when not obscured by a four year downpour. You will find yourself laughing out loud when you are not sobbing in sympathy with someone dying of heartbreak. I do not like to label Sr. Garcia Marquez' work \\"magical realism.\\" There is no label to accurately describe the writing that gifted us with \\"One Hundred Years Of Solitude.\\" This is a book that defies description. You must read it to experience the fantastically real world of Macondo, and the people who live there. Once you know them, they will be a part of your own world forever. Have you ever looked at a painting, walked into it and become a part of it? When you open this novel at page one, you are beckoned to enter.Macondo is a mythical South American town, founded, almost by accident, by Jose Arcadio Buendia, and populated primarily by his descendants. This is the story of one hundred years in the life of Macondo and its inhabitants - the story of the town's birth, development and death. Civil war and natural calamities plague this vital place whose populace fights to renew itself and survive. This is a huge narrative fiction that explores the history of a people caught up in the history of a place. And Marquez captures the range of human emotions and the reasons for experiencing them in this generational tale.There is much that is delightful and comical here. Surprises never cease, whether it be Remedios ascending, or a man whose presence is announced by clouds of butterflies. There is satire, sexuality and bawdiness galore. But there is also a pervading sadness and futility that permeates throughout. Cruelty is a reality in Marquez' world, as are failure, despair and senseless, sudden violence. The plot is filled with passion, poetry, romance, tragedy and the echoes of the history of Colombia and Latin America.I first read \\"One Hundred Years Of Solitude\\" in 1968, while living in Latin America. I have read it 2 or 3 times over the years, always picking up new pieces of wonder that I had previously missed. This is my favorite novel, and I am an avid reader. My favorite fictional character is Melquiades, the gypsy who foretells the future of the township and whose ghost accompanies the reader until there is no more to read. Having read this in Spanish and English, I must laud Gregory Rabassa's extraordinary translation which faithfully brings to life not only Marquez' story, but his lyrical prose. This is one of the 20th Century's best works of fiction. It is a masterpiece not to be missed.JANA"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Absolutely.This, in my mind, is one of the greatest accomplishments in South American literary history, and perhaps some of the greatest of the past century period.Nothing in this novel is in there just to be in there. I've read this book 3 times, every time more is unlocked and the seemingly random points of the book suddenly connect, and then they landslide into further amazing ideas and meanings, and I can honestly say that no book since the Bible has this many honest life lessons and profound meaning.No word is wasted, and every letter sets you one step closer to unlocking this treasure of a novel hidden at the center of a forest of imagery. I read this book for school, wrote an essay on it, discussed it with friends, and read it again, and then I was so fascinated with it that I read it again. The story is captivating, the cycles of life the handling of time are simply so profound I cannot believe that this all came from one man. I thank you, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, for writing quite possibly, my favorite novel of all time. I could only imagine it's brilliance in its native Spanish. Much like Naruda, each reading unlocks even more beautiful subtleties and spectacular connections to modern life.So, in conclusion, if you have any curiosity, entertain it and pick up this novel. Please ignore the dissenters about this book, read it for yourself and decide."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This is the definition of literature. Years from now, when this age in art history is named Magic Realism or something like that, this book will be its definition. I dare a serious, mature reader to pick this book up and not at least admire the writing. And the ending is something else altogether. Garcia-Marquez leaves the reader to ponder it. I promise that if you pick it up, finish it, and think about it, you will realize that it has the most wonderful, important, and intelligent endings ever written. The realization of it for the reader is almost overpowering. I'm only 17, and I know I will read this book many more times in my life. A MASTERPIECE."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"The book tells of the fascinating rise and fall of the Buendia family. It is not really all that long, never dull, and clearer than the most transparent crystal (although, taken at a deeper level, the book offers much more than what appears on the surface). In many respects, the book tells of the rise of, and predicts the fall of, humankind. In this sense, it is allegorical fiction at its finest. Along the way, it tells a cornucopia of stories about love, war, peace, remembrance, time, joy, pain, and many other emotions beyond description in this small amount of space."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I bought the other hardback translation and found it almost impossible to follow.

Anyone could read this book and thoroughly enjoy it. This book is not beyond anyone's reach. I loved it. The characters were so symbolic of the times. The whole Jose Arcadio Buendia family just makes me laugh.

It created that thirst that took over 400 pages to satisfy.desc I've read the reviews of others on this site, and most either loved it or hated it. (Which is the usual responce when a book this amazing is written.) The slow, destined, circular descent of the Buendia family promoted the view that time does not travel in a straight line, but twists and turns and repeats itself. The family represents mankind (i think), and many of the occurences and metaphors of the story remind the reader of historical and psychological truths. And the little tidbits of &quot;whaat!&quot; kept the book light-hearted and fun to read, as all 400 page books should be. Those who didnt like it probably mis-directed their attention, avoided the depth but critiqued the purposely shallow ends of the book.

So I'll put it simply: As soon as 1999 comes around and we have to start reading everybody's top 5, top 10, top 100 lists, I'll sit down and make my own, but it will have to do only with books. Faulkner's &quot;As I Lay Dying&quot; will surely be on the list; Hemingway's &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; and &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; will be there, too. Some living people might even make my list: Updike's first and last Rabbit books will get serious consideration, for example. You won't find Mailer or Bellow or Doctorow, but their dead comrade Malamud could sneak in. But at the top of the list--all alone, with no competition at all--will be this magnificent work by Garcia-Marquez. It is sweeping and powerful in a way that no other work of fiction even dares to be. I have probably sold twenty or thirty copies of this book in airport bookshops. Whenever I have seen anyone flip through the book, trying to decide whether or not it is worth the money, I have handed that person my business card and told him or her to buy the book--Just buy the book, I've said, and if you don't like it, write to me.

It wasn't until college and when I read Garcia Marquez's 100 Years -- that the American novel took on a new and wonderful meaning.

Thanks, Oprah.I have read this book maybe 20 times in the past 15 years. It is like going back to your favorite place, or to your favorite memory. In a few pages, and with astonishing clarity, wit and poetry, Garcia Marquez creates an allegory of the history of mankind. And he makes it look so easy. The final 2 pages of this book alone should qualify as one of literature's greatest achievements.While some may argue that \\"Love in the time of cholera\\" is his best book, \\"One Hundred years\\" is by far his most ambitious and engrossing read. Be warned: This is a book that rewards the effort that it takes to read. It is not easy. It is not \\"light\\". It is a very complex work by one of the greatest writers in the history of mankind. Read it carefully, savor it, understand it, think about it. The language is beautiful (at least in Spanish it is), the images unforgetable. I wish I could read it for the first time again.I hope that Oprah took her time to explain this. Otherwise, there may be a lot of disappointed people... and it would be a shame to be disappointed because you approached this book with the wrong expectations. Many people here are complaining:\\"all the characters have the same names\\" This is not necessarily true... they do share the same names (Jose Arcadio and Aureliano), but there's always something that distinguishes them. If you get confused, you can always go to the family tree that's provided.\\"it is boring\\". As I said, it is NOT an easy read. If you want something easy, this is not the book for you. It takes time to read it properly. It takes longer to understand it properly.\\"it is crap / why did he win a Nobel / etc\\". Approach it with the right expectations, and you won't be disappointed. Garcia Marquez's style is very unique. If you want to try something similar, but shorter, try \\"Chronicle of a death foretold\\".Don't be put off by the negative reviews. Read it carefully, and you're in for one of the greatest stories ever told.Oh, and if you can, try reading it in Spanish. I'm sure that the translator did a very good job, and I'm also sure that he could not replicate the beauty of Garcia Marquez's words."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This book is an absolutely perfect example of Marquez' talent.

The novel tracks the life of a family and the village it founds since its creation to its death. With a passion for inventions and progress the first Jose Arcadio Buendia creates a village and family that thrives driven by friendliness, hospitality and genuine curiosity. As the family expands however, and the years pass, this original drive is replaced by less noble ambitions. Jose Arcadio's heirs are gradually caught up by their weaknesses and relive the lives and mistakes of their ancestors.The novel would not have been such a masterpiece if Marquez had not employed a style that fitted perfectly with his goal--through magical realism, somewhat dispassionate and cyclical storytelling he manages to convey to the reader his main idea--that the life of the Buendias and Macondo and pretty much every human being in this world is full of tragedy and drama, hope and hapiness. It is the flow of life that makes Marquez characters stand out--yes, unknowingly they repeat the mistakes of their fathers and sometimes they recognize it, even if it is on their deathbed. But the stregth with which they continue to live and love makes them stand out. Those that do not do not leave any memory or sign of their existence.(...)"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Why is this book one of the greatest pieces of literature ever written? First, it speaks to universal truths about the human condition, independent of culture. The behaviour and motivations of the people of the mythical town of Macondo, near the Caribbean coast of Colombia, seem as familiar as those of our neighbors, wherever we live. Secondly, the work illustrates how we are fated to repeat the successes, follies, and failures of our ancestors. It makes rational the belief of the Indians of central and Sourth America concerning the circular nature of life and time. And thirdly, it is written in language so elegant that it cries out to be read again and again. I have read it four times in Spanish and three times in English, and I am sure I am not finished yet. By the way, the translation by Gregory Rabassa is a remarkable piece of literature in itself."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Un cl&agrave;sico de la literatura de latinoam&egrave;rica. uno de los mejores ejemplos de realismo m&agrave;gico y, probablemente, la mejor obra de Garc&igrave;a M&agrave;rquez."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"From its' famous opening sentence (probably the greatest opening sentence of all time) to its' unlikely ending this is probably the greatest book ever written in this hemisphere.

I have read this book three times, and notice new glimpses of Marquez's genius each time. And if the lyrical passages and poetic descriptions aren't enough, there is lots of sex, war, jealousy, violence, passion and love. Only the brilliance of Marquez could combine all of this into one book.

I must admit, however, that I was a bit mystified by the novel at first. The books I read tend to fall into three classes. The first class of books are books I feel like I \\"get\\" right away on a first read through without having to read anything about them. The second class of books are books that I \\"get\\" to some degree, but I often feel like there is a lot I am missing, and I usually try to find some good books and articles to read that will help me figure out what I am missing. The third class of books are books that I enjoy, but ultimately feel like I am missing the main point. One Hundred Years of Solitude fell into that last category for me (if anyone is wondering why there is no fourth category of books I do not enjoy at all, it is because I almost never continue reading a book if I am not enjoying it).One Hundred Years of Solitude is not a difficult book by any means. Anyone can read it and will be capable of understanding the story and appreciating Gabriel Garcia Marquez' narrative techniques (his magical realism, and foreshadowing, for example). Gabriel Marquez is a beautiful writer, which comes across even in translation, and he tells a very interesting story, in a very unique way. That much is evident right away. But I think a lot of people who read this book will have the sense that there is more to the work that they are not getting despite its outward accessibility. I know I did. So I decided to do some research and it turns out I was right. There is a lot in this book, and there has been a lot written about this book, and while I have only read a small sliver of the available English language scholarship on this novel (if one includes Spanish language scholarship on the book I am sure the hills of material turn into mountains), the little that I have read has increased my appreciation for the novel a hundred fold. I am now sure that this will be a novel I continue to re-read and study throughout my life. So before I provide my own short interpretation of the novel (which is heavily indebted to essays I have read about the novel) I would like to recommend the works I found most helpful in unpacking some of the riches in this novel (I am sure there are more I have yet to discover).First, there is a collection of essays:Gabriel Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude: A Casebook (Casebooks in Criticism)edited by Gene H. Bell-Villada. The essay \\"Gabriel Garcia Marquez: Cien anos de soledad\\" by James Higgins serves as a particularly good general introduction to the novel. There is also another collection of essays I found helpful:Gabriel Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez: New Readings (Cambridge Iberian and Latin American Studies)edited by Bernard McGuirk and Richard Cardwell. There are two really excellent essays in that book on One Hundred Years of Solitude: \\"Magical realism and the theme of incest in 'One Hundred Years of Solitude'\\" by Edwin Williamson, and \\"On 'magical' and social realism in Garcia Marquez\\" by Gerald Martin. Those two essays totally transformed my interpretation of the novel. And finally there is a short book:Gabriel Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez: One Hundred Years of Solitude (Landmarks of World Literature)by Michael Wood. Michael Wood has a lot of interesting insights into the novel. I thought the sections where he discussed tone and narrative structure were particularly interesting, and those were aspects of the novel that did not get as much discussion in the other essays I recommended.Now, onto my synopsis and discussion of some of what I think are the most interesting themes of the novel. I should give my SPOILER ALERT at this point. I give away the ending of the novel, as well as a great deal of what happens in between, so if you have not read the novel yet, you probably should not read on. You have been warned!The novel, of course, tells the story of the Buendia family and the town of Macondo. The town is located in Colombia but as many interpreters of the novel point out, the setting ultimately serves as a universal representation of post-colonial Latin America. Macondo is, in other words, both specific and universal, at least universal within the context of Latin America. The novel encompasses roughly a hundred years, and I think six generations of the Buendia family, and within that time span the two major historical events are a Civil War, and the arrival, and eventual departure, of U.S. imperialism in the form of the Banana Company. These historical events provide the background for the events within the family (marriages, infidelities, feuds, suicides, murders, etc.).The story, of course, incorporates what has come to be known as 'magical realism'. Supernatural events are described in a very matter-of-fact manner, as if they were simply everyday occurrences (levitation, ascensions into heaven, magic carpets, raining flower petals, etc.). This technique certainly spices up the narrative, and has given rise to a number of conflicting interpretations in terms of its meaning (I will have more to say about this when I get to the themes of the novel). The novel also makes extensive use of foreshadowing, where events are described out of order. The narrative jumps ahead, and then moves back to catch up. It might seem like this would be a particularly ineffective narrative technique since the author is, in effect, giving away what is going to happen in advance, but it actually functions quite well, and ultimately produces some surprises by taking advantage of the readers' natural tendency to jump to conclusions. I will give one particular example from the first page of the novel (remember my SPOILER ALERT is in effect). The very first sentence of the novel is, \\"Many years later, as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendia was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice\\" (11). The reader, of course, jumps to the conclusion that Colonel Aurelian Buendia is eventually killed by firing squad, and yet, we are told much later in the book that Colonel Aureliano Buendia died of old age (104). And it is only later in the book still that the firing squad incident is actually narrated \\"in the present\\", and, of course, much later we discover how, and when, Colonel Aureliano Buendia actually dies. So despite the foreshadowing Gabriel Garcia Marquez is still able to keep the reader guessing about what is going to happen.There are really two main themes of the novel that I want to highlight. There are, of course, more than two themes in the novel. The theme of solitude is, obviously, central to the book, as the title suggests, but I don't feel like I really have a firm grasp on what Gabriel Garcia Marquez is trying to say about solitude, so I will not be discussing that theme in any detail. The two themes I find most interesting are: the meaning of 'magical realism', and the theme of time (or the meaning of history).In regards to 'magical realism' there have been a number of interpretations put forward by different scholars (I owe this little summary largely to the essay I referenced above by Edwin Williamson). The first group of scholars tend to see 'magical realism' as a means for creating a fully autonomous fictional universe, similar to the fictional universes created by Jorge Luis Borges in his fiction. The second group of scholars tend to see 'magical realism' as a means for critiquing the Western/European obsession with \\"objective\\" material reality, and its tendency to deny any reality to the narrative mythologies that actually tend to make up our life-world. The third group of scholars, represented by both Edwin Williamson and Gerald Martin, see 'magical realism' as a means for examining the relationship between consciousness and ideology, on the one hand, and objective/material history on the other. I tend to side with this third group. I think 'magical realism' is a brilliant technique for highlighting the separation between consciousness and historical reality.The actual history of Macondo is largely driven by external forces. The Republican period where the central government attempts to assert control over the largely independent municipalities ultimately leads to the conflict between Conservatives and Liberals and the Civil War, which has a dramatic effect on Macondo. The arrival of the fruit company, and U.S. imperialism, dramatically changes the shape of Macondo, so much so that when the fruit company finally leaves, Macondo is little more than a ghost town, and is ripe for the eventual apocalypse that will sweep it off the face of the earth. But the characters in the novel, as Gerald Martin persuasively argues, remain mostly unaware of these objective forces shaping their fate, and live within their own narratives, their own mythical understanding of their history. This ultimately leaves them powerless to shape their fate, and this powerlessness is perhaps why there is such a deeply pessimistic strain in Gabriel Garcia Marquez' vision of history. But is this powerlessness the final word? The novel seems to me to be arguing that it will be the final word as long as people continue to live in their own fantastical narratives about history (ideology in the Marxian sense). If, however, people wake up (as Jose Arcado begins to wake up in his labor struggles) then there is a possibility that this historical determinism might be overcome. The novel does not present the solution, but simply presents the problem. Anton Chekov once wrote to a fellow writer \\"you confuse two things: solving a problem and stating a problem correctly. It is only the second that is obligatory for the artist.\\" I believe that Gabriel Garcia Marquez has, in this novel, stated the problem correctly, and he has, to that degree, fulfilled his function as an artist. The solution to the problem, if one exists, must be found in life itself.The other theme I found the most interesting was time. There are, ultimately two visions of time presented in the novel. A circular vision, and a linear vision. These two views of time are summed up beautifully in a symbol that appears late in the novel when Pilar Ternera, a fortune teller and occasional lover to the Buendias, has a realization, \\"a century of cards and experience had taught her that the history of the family was a machine with unavoidable repetitions, a turning wheel that would have gone on spinning into eternity were it not for the progressive and irremediable wearing of the axle\\" (364). This image combines both the circular view of history (the turning of the wheel) and the linear view (the wearing of the axle).The most obvious evidence of the circular view of history in the novel is in the often frustrating repetition of names. I think that every male in the entire Buendia family (and there are a lot of them) is named either Jose Arcadio or Aureliano. This illustrates that history may be progressive if conceived within the span of a single life, but if one widens one's view it becomes apparent that each generation is a repetition of all previous generations, and is condemned to repeat the same struggles as the last generation. The circular view is somewhat pessimistic, though I think there is a lot of truth to it. The pessimism can be seen in Colonel Aureliano Buendia's realization of the meaninglessness of his political struggles, and his decision to spend the last years of his life making little gold fishes just so that he can melt them down and continue remaking them over and over. This view of time could also be called the \\"archetypal\\" view, since it views history as the repetition of a limited number of archetypes (all the Aurelianos share certain characteristics, or are expressions of the same archetype, just as all of the Jose Arcadios are expressions of a different archetype). This is essentially the same view of history that one sees presented inFinnegans Wakeby James Joyce, in which every character is a repetition of a particular archetype that has been repeated throughout history since the beginning of time, ultimately going all the way back to Adam. I find this view of history quite compelling.The wearing of the axle, however, presents a more linear notion of time, though it seems to be associated with degeneration, as opposed to progress (both of the notions of time presented in the novel seem to be opposed to the most common Western European view of time as continual progress). This second notion of time is expressed, in the novel, through the degeneration of Macondo and its eventual collapse. The axle has finally broken and the wheel has fallen off. The repetitions are finally over. It is safe to say that both of Marquez' notions of time are fairly pessimistic.It is instructive, I think, to compare the view of time and history presented in the novel to that of the philosopher G.W.F. Hegel. I just recently came across this interesting quote from Hegel'sIntroduction to the Lectures on the History of Philosophy, \\"Even world-history is not like a romance; it is not a collection of accidental deeds and events; it is not accident which rules in it. The events in it are not the forays of knights-errant, not the deeds of heroes who knock about to no purpose, who toil and sacrifice themselves for some trivial thing\\" (63). I think it is pretty safe to say that Hegel's view of history is, in many ways, the polar opposite of Gabriel Garcia Marquez' view, at least as presented in this book (I know very little about Marquez' personal opinions or philosophy). I think the view of history presented in this book is, precisely, a view where heroes \\"knock about to no purpose\\" and \\"toil and sacrifice themselves for some trivial thing.\\"Colonel Aureliano Buendia, for example, while fighting his Civil War, is asked to compromise on some of the reforms the Liberals are demanding in order to gain wider popular support for the cause. The Colonel is told that this is a purely \\"strategic decision\\", but the Colonel rightly realizes that by going along with the compromises the war he is fighting essentially becomes a war over who is in power, and nothing else. In other words, it becomes a war between heroes who are fighting over some trivial thing. Anyone who thinks this is an unrealistic picture of history should check out the bookWinner-Take-All Politics: How Washington Made the Rich Richer--and Turned Its Back on the Middle Classby Jacob S. Hacker and Paul Pierson. There is a point in that book where the authors are describing the tactical decision made by the Democratic party to become more friendly towards business interests in response to the Republican parties superior ability to raise money. The thought occurred to me, as I was listening, \\"If the Democratic party sacrifices its whole platform as a strategic decision to raise money, and ultimately win elections, then there is really no more difference between the two parties, and the candidates are not really fighting for anything other than power.\\" In other words, what is the point of winning a contest if one is forced to give up what one is fighting for in order to win? I had this thought before I read One Hundred Years of Solitude, and when I came across the passage where Colonel Aureliano Buendia came to his realization, it immediately reminded me of what I had read in Hacker and Pierson's book. This seems to me to be the way that history actually works, and Gabriel Garcia Marquez has diagnosed it brilliantly in this novel. Whether this pessimistic view is, or should be, the final word, I cannot say. But, like all good art, Marquez' novel provides not only entertainment, but genuine insight into the world we live in, as well as ourselves."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This is a great work of the imagination and one of the best novels I've ever read.The Influence of William Faulkner is apparent in only the best way -- Garcia Marquez has his own original vision and an endless amount of creativity, but he obviously took inspiration for his mythical town of Macondo from Faulkner's invention of Yoknapatawpha County, to create his own microcosmic South America on a biblical scale populated with brutally real people in fantastic situations born of 'the human heart in conflict with itself', which bluntly reveal man (and woman) struggling with and against nature, tradition, family ties, their own secrets including incest (both imagined and acted upon), repetition of family names symbolically conjuring cycles of family flaws and curses, country, God, and various related antagonists; though Garcia Marquez adds an element of magic that Faulkner did not indulge in, and is much more willing to directly explore the nature of women and sexuality, and is more judicious than Faulkner in his use of endlessly rambling sentences, which Garcia Marquez uses sparingly but to great effect in the last five chapters, particularly for a long rant against her lazy husband by the character Fernanda which goes on a couple of hilarious pages.Keeping up with the names and characters can be a little confusing, but if you liked Faulkner's 'Absalom, Absalom!' you will love this book.Breathtaking and unpredictable to the very last word."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Thumbs up to Gabriel Garcia Marquez' fantastical epic novel, \\"100 years of Solitude\\"! It is the story of Macondo, a fictional South American town founded by the bold patriarch of the Buendia clan, Jose Arcadio Buendia. Twenty households of folks subsist in peace and relative isolation, minding their own business, until hosts of visitors and newcomers, bringing new ideas--scientific, political, and economic--descend upon the sleepy village. These developments, along with the growth and development of the Buendias through generations, lead to unexpected and often bizarre and tragic results.Marquez' imagination seems to know no bounds, as he recounts story after incredible story in ridiculous detail, which are bound together with certain common recurring themes. The style of the novel, \\"magical realism\\", means that the most freakish stories are told in the same matter-of-fact tone as the most prosaic ones. Marquez grew up in the home of his grandparents, natural story tellers, who related countless such tall-tales in such a way, blurring the boundaries of reality and unreality. My favorite of these tall tales is the part, toward the end of the book where it rains for \\"four years, eleven months, and two days\\". What they went through during that time was hilarious and outlandish!Another big theme is the recurring personalities of the male Buendias across five generations. The author does a good job of creating real and interesting characters, but I particularly enjoyed some of the female ones, as they were each quite different and extraordinary. Ursala, the matriarch, is a central central figure who lives over a hundred years, during which she works endlessly to care for the family throughout the generations. Fernanda, the wife whom Aureliano Segundo takes from a ruined aristocratic family in \\"the Highlands\\", never really fits in. The best Fernanda scene is during the rainy season, when she drones on complaining at Aureliano for an incredible three pages with just one sentence!One of the many themes in the book that interest me is the strong sense of irony which pervades the novel on many levels. The overriding irony which also underlies the whole story is the circular nature of time--the recurring personality types and their dysfunctional actions which they seem doomed to repeat. This is an irony of tragic futility. At times it seems tedious, but the author uses it to brilliant effect, and particularly at the end, where the story culminates with one surprising final ironic twist.These are just a few of my ideas and reflections about this monumental work. Lastly, I suggest that you buy one of the other editions of the book because this one is rather flimsy and cheaply made. The Oprah book club edition (which I have not seen) can be had for $7.00, including shipping, and the hardback for $11.12, if you click on the words \\"32 new\\". I hope this helps. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I had trouble following the book at first, but eventually caught on to the message. I recently read another book,America's Keenest City, by Mongo which reads the same for me. Both Marquez and Mongo use bizarre characters and situations to hide their true commentary on their respective societies. Marquez writes about Latin America and Mongo writes about North America. I would recommend both books as essential reading and would suggest reading Mongo if you enjoy reading Marquez."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This is the best book I have read in a while - a real jewel in modern literature. Like a fuge, the novel is composed of interweaving variations of the same melody. This melody is the life itself - the life of a family and of a country. Absolutely brilliant are the occasional bits of fantasy narrated with the same nonchalant, sarcastic and slightly nostalgic tone as the rest (e.g. a levitating priest). These do not make it into a fantasy, but only amplify the novel's connection to our symbols and our world. Beautiful."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"100 Years of Solitude is another in the list of books from our book group, because otherwise I'm not sure I would have chosen it myself.It's quite difficult to describe exactly what it was about, because it didn't have a proper plot. It's more of a long history of a particular family set in a small South American town, with various motifs and themes that occur throughout. The overall journey of the villagers can be read as an escape from corruption and guilt, towards a rebirth, which has obvious religious overtones. The novel belongs to the genre of magic realism, so supernatural and paranormal things are common, and give the story a fairy-tale-like quality. Garcia Marquez writes with almost no dialogue at all, instead relying on his incredibly descriptive style to carry the bulk of the narrative.Most colourful of the characters I thought was the mysterious Meliquades the gypsy, who brings modern technology to the sleepy backward village, though his influence is not always welcomed by the superstitious villagers. Personally, I think the writer could have spent more time on him. He could even have his own book if you think about it. He's almost like a time-traveller - he could travel the world helping people out with his strange technology.Going back to the book, I had a few problems with the various family names, all of which seemed very similar. This wasn't a problem for my girlfriend, who said she loved the sense of ethnic layering and historical repetition that this created which reinforced the overlying theme of the novel. So it might be simply my narrow-minded twenty-first century western viewpoint that makes this a problem for me.But One Hundred Years of Solitude is the work of a genius, and my girlfriend has already ordered The General and His Labyrinth and Of Love and Other Demons on Amazon to read. It's not the easiest of novels, but it is a rewarding one when you recognize the hundreds of themes and motifs in this multi-layered narrative to take in."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"But if you give up before, it will not make sense to you and excuses will start to appear.

After the first few pages I was complaining that I wasn't getting into it. Since I can't start reading a book and leave it un-finished, I pressed on and got to the 100th page or so, errr, I still wasn't getting into it. Figuring out a way to remember who is who, was my first accomplishment, figuring out how old people were wasn't as successful. I thought this was important because trying to understand the feelings behind the crush of a 13 year old is different than that of a 16 year old. Was Remedios 9, 12 or 13 when she got married? This by itself should've been a big hint for me that I wasn't relating to the culture of the author. I imagine the emotional/sexual relationships between the different members of the family was meant to represent something in the way it occurred, evolved and eventually produced the final results, but it is unclear what. No, I didn't think it was offensive or immoral, I simply didn't know what to think of it. Maybe this was the problem.Finishing the rest of the book took more energy than I care to put into reading anything non scientific. The general idea was pretty obvious. The specifics were hard to grasp or relate to. Like other readers suggested, the characters are one dimensional and it was hard to care or like any of them. I kept on anticipating that Colonel Aureliano or Ursula will carry the book to the end. I was convinced of it when it dawned on Ursula that Rebecca was more of a Buendia than Amaranta, and the reason Amaranta behaved the way she did... that we were going somewhere, but... the \\"whole page\\" Marquez dedicated to this moment of \\"explosive\\" enlightenment reduced the quality of the piece even further and we went right back to more boring events and more Aurelianos and Jose's being born. Then, I hoped that the Colonel in his old age, when he realizes the reality of his 32 wars, will enlighten us with his \\"wisdom\\" (I am still convinced that the Colonel was supposed to represent a more complex object). It didn't happen either... By the time of the town massacre I have lost all hopes of getting getting anything out of the book. Even though I can sense the signals lurking there, they remained ambiguous at best... The only contentment I had while reading this book was when I found I only have 18 pages to go...Maybe this book was more interesting in the period it was released before a hundred other books were produced about the same subject."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"It is a wonderful journey where the author takes you back and forward in a smooth way through the live in Macondo the little town in the middle of nowhere.It may takes you a while to understad I read the book 3 times the first time I had it and so far I read it 8 times in my lifetime and it never stops to excite me.You want to forget your problems, travel to Macondo and learn about making gold and many other things! discover another world."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I guess people like this book; I've been hearing about it for years and thought it was about time I had a look. Starts well, with the introduction of quirky characters and bizarre situations delivered in a charmingly straight tone, somewhat reminiscent of Louis de Bernieres, but, to be honest, it loses it for me in the long middle section. The names are confusing, the characters have sudden and unlikely personality shifts, and none of it is shown - there is very little dialogue - but told. It gets pretty dull, pretty quickly. Having said that, the story picks up again when the number of characters is reduced in the last section, allowing us to see through the clutter, and I must confess I did feel a sense of missing all the Aurelianos and Arcadios, if only because I had become so used to repeating their names. If you're like me, and won't put a book down once you've started, then I'd say exercise some will-power and avoid this one - there are far better reads out there, and many more books worthy of the status \\"classic\\"."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Scroll back through a few pages to the customer comments from before this became an Oprah selection and you'll see uniformly 5 and 4 star reviews.

This is my favorite piece of fiction in all the vast world of literature, and I so regret my inability to read it in its original language. I even own a first edition, purchased after a bit of a hunt.Are your shelves filled with Danielle Steele novels? Go away, you'll hate this. If on the other hand you want to weep for joy at the utter magic a single writer's imagination is capable of, this is your next read. But take your time. I didn't read it until I was ready, and I thank my lucky stars every day that I was so, at last."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I was one of those people who loved all of the required high school and college books and wanted so badly to love this one too; but it was really hard to read. First, there is no one main character or characters and no set plot. Second, the story is written in circles requiring you to read and reread sections over and over again. And to top it all off there a million (I'm exaggerating but there are a lot) of characters and they all have similar names! The first couples of chapters are okay and kept me interested but after the third or fourth chapters (and generations) everything just starts to run together. The family tree in the front helps but with the names so similar the family tree can also get confusing. This book is considered a classic and worth reading for that reason alone but be forewarned: it is a lot of work to get through."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Ok, let me begin by saying this is my first Amazon review. I had to come on here and read some negative reviews of this book to make sure I wasn't totally crazy. After doing so, I feel a bit better, but still feel the need to add this:Yes, it annoyed me that all the characters have the same name, and unlike other reviewers, this was not something I was willing to either overlook, get used to, or appreciate for it's symbolism, (i.e. that the individual characters aren't supposed to matter, it's the family).Also, I couldn't stand how a paragraph would run an entire page without breaking, and if you skip a line or two, you miss A LOT. For example, in one paragraph, spanning one page, a character may have a child, but the focus of the section is more on the character's father than the new family member. Or a character may die, and you would entirely miss it. It's like trying to read someone's stream of consciousness and decipher a very intricate plot line from it: infuriating.Some other negative reviews mentioned issues with the morality of the story, which actually does not bother me in the slightest. I can appreciate a story that bares the ugly insides of the human soul with the best of them. The politics of the story were not a deal-breaker for me, it was the writing style.This all being said, I am perfectly comfortable with the fact that many (if not most) other people reading this review feel sorry for me for missing the point. I probably did miss the point, but I do feel better knowing that I wasn't the only one. I now feel like can stop torturing myself by forcing myself to read the last couple of chapters."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Oprah, when recommending this novel years ago on her show, read off the list of modern novelists who practically owe their careers to this man, Gabriel Garcia Marquez. I found out through that show that my favorite novelist, Nobel Laureate Toni Morrison, had him and this book, ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE, as HER favorite writer and book of all time. She also made the point, repeatedly if not repetitively, that this book is only for true readers.With that said I would advise anyone who is interested in this novel to not read reviews of it or even the back cover. I chose not to read it upon discovering it through Oprah or anyone else's recommendation until three days ago, when, removed from the hype surrounding it, I picked it up, read the first three or so pages, and cancelled the majority of my plans and committments to everyone for the next 72 hours until I finished it, literally gasping.Gabriel Garcia Marquez has written a novel in ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE that is born from a genius that shines on the relevance of humanity, and a love that reveals the depths of humanity itself. Pablo Nehruda and many others have said it is the greatest novel from the Spanish/Latin culture since DON QUIXOTE of Cervantes. But it is even more than that. Like Nietzsche said about Goethe, Gabriel Garcia Marquez is a human event, not just a Latin American one. And this must be, by far, the greatest novel of the 20th century, if not the greatest novel of all time."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I was amazed to see that 100 Years...was on the OPRAH book club list. Not to be unkind but some of her fans will drop out of the club because of this book. It requires patience, imagination, and some historical knowledge of South American politics and writers. Much of this book is written in metaphor to protect the author and other individuals. The informed reader will note that Marquez received the NOBLE PRIZE not the Pulitizer for this incredible literary work. To the new reader keep reading if you want to have a life changing experience. It is my favorite book of the late 20th century."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"A friend recommended this book to me. He said &quot;it is incredibly life-affirming.&quot;A week later, he asked if I had started it yet. &quot;Started it?&quot; I asked, &quot;I just finished it yesterday.&quot;&quot;What did you honestly think of it?&quot; he asked eagerly.This is pretty much what I told him:This wonderfully poetic novel follows the Buendia family in a way that is at times deeply touching, terribly amusing, and genuinely tragic. The book reads like a dream: slow, circuitous, confusing, beautiful, enchanting, disturbing. I could list adjectives forever, but I won't. I'll just say that this book represented some of the best prose I have ever read. Garcia Marquez takes the reader through one hundred years with an amazing touch that makes the magic feel so real.on that note: read this book. it is well worth it."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I was given this book by a friend so I felt obliged to finish it. I realised early on that I was not going to enjoy it but I still hoped that it might be possible to admire it. About half way through, when the vestiges of a plot petered out, and with the appearance of another generation of individuals with the same name as the last and with equally unfathomable motivations, I resigned myself to the fact that the novel's greatness was passing me by.In hoping for believable characters in whose fate the reader might summon up some interest I am probably displaying a prejudice about literature. While I concede that there are a few flashes of brilliant imagery, these certainly seem a very poor reward for six weeks of reading time. However this does not altogether explain the hostility I began to feel towards the novel. Underlying the pretentious story telling there is, I suspect, a social theory which I find deeply inimical: a more careful reading than I am prepared to give would be needed to confirm this."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"&quot;But the fact that it's on Oprah's list and that Amazon thinks the word &quot;years&quot; is spelled with an apostrophe are enough to put me off.Moving on.&quot;Quite frankly, both of these are idiotic reasons to pass up one of the greatest pieces of literature ever put to paper. To other readers considering this book, all I can say is... it's a heart-stopping experience. You can read plot and theme details in other reviews, so I won't waste space here re-hashing that information. It's a profound and beautiful book, an amazing and an entertaining read as well.Don't waste time. Buy it now, or go to your library and check it out. Read it. I can't tell you enough what an incredible book this is."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I read this book in spanish about 30 years ago, and I read it in english last year and it is a good translation. Latin American literature, especially from the XX century and on, is a difficult and arid task for somebody who has not had an European or Latin American education, particularly Americans. And Garcia Marquez's \\"realismo m&aacute;gico\\" is a very good example of that difficulty. You need to have a certain degree of education and world culture to approach these kind of works. It is a masterpiece of world literature (not a \\"best seller\\"), and like Kafka's works, it is not an \\"easy\\" reading. It demands a lot from the reader. And, if you really want to know \\"realismo m&aacute;gico\\" in its purest form, you have to read Juan Rulfo's \\"Pedro P&aacute;ramo\\". A caveat on Rulfo's book; if \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude\\" seemed difficult to read, then don't even try reading \\"Pedro P&aacute;ramo\\". This kind of literature is not for everyone, and it is not for anyone to love or hate, it educates you, period."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"And this book discussed this in great detail over a whole town over many many many years.This book is poetry. It is wonderfully written (and translated)and beautiful. It wasn't difficult to read like some books and really kept me going. I'm really interested in checking out some of Garcia's other works.This story is definelty *not* for the humanist or the easily depressed. There is a lot of sorrow and torment throughout this whole novel. I found I had to stop reading when I got to the part about the Italian man who commited suicide because the love of his life refused to *ever* marry him, even though she loved him and her denial was just a weird game of torment she was playing with him. My explaining it does not do that part justice. It was truly sad... and I had to stop reading right there.I recommend this book to everyone. It is a wonderful books to start expanding your horizons away from al ot of the pulp novels and mass market paperbacks with nothing learned and nothing gained.This books will teach you a lot about our secret condition."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I first heard of this novel when I was doing research on the film adaption of \\"Love in the Time of Cholera.\\" It was very mediocre film for a brilliant author, but I digress. This novel was a feat of genius to me. It is an immersing experience and it calls fro the reader to swim in it's oceans, to walk in the streets of Macondo, and to feel for the characters within. The only comparison this boo has is to the masterworks of Joyce, Kafka, Steinbeck, the Brothers Grimm, and the early parables of The Bible. I could not prescribe a book more. It is a feat only experienced, not told about."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I read this book what seemed like 100 times in college (in Spanish). It is not an easy book to read, but it became more interesting (and easier to understand) each time I read it. The writing style, timeline and naming convention of the characters make the book challenging to understand, but also make it quite hysterical once the reader can get past that.One Hundred Years of Solitude is a story about life and generations (each generation becoming the same as the previous). It's about history and culture. I would recommend this classic for anyone who has the patience to read through the challenging parts and push through to reflect on the deeper themes posed by Garcia Marquez."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"With a foundation in magical realism, One Hundred Years of Solitude follows the growth of the Buend'a family and the city of Macondo. Drawing from childhood stories, M&aacute;rquez pens an extraordinary tale of love, death, and loneliness. The book begins with a foreboding sense of determinism when M&aacute;rquez writes:\\"Many years later, as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buend'a was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice\\" (p. 1).In fact, an impending sense of helplessness meanders through the book as the family expands with children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. With each generation, the names of Aureliano, Jos&eacute; Arcadio, and Remedios are recycled. There is a sense in which each person is merely an extension of a larger character. \\"There was no mystery,\\" claims M&aacute;rquez,\\"in the heart of a Buend'a that was impenetrable for her because a century of cards and experience had taught her that the history of the family was a machine with unavoidable repetitions, a turning wheel that would have gone on spilling into eternity were it not for the progressive and irremediable wearing of the axle\\" (p. 396).Just as each character blends with previous characters that have come and gone in the narrative, each lives and dies in resolute isolation. Whether through external circumstances or internal influences, each family member succumbs to a life of seclusion. For example, M&aacute;rquez describes a character's despair, saying:\\"Instead of going to the chestnut tree, Colonel Aureliano Buend'a also went to the street door and mingled with the bystanders who were watching the parade. He saw a woman dressed in gold sitting on the head of an elephant. He saw a sad dromedary. He saw a bear dressed like a Dutch girl keeping time to the music with a soup spoon and a pan. He saw the clowns doing cartwheels at the end of the parade and once more he saw the face of his miserable solitude when everything had passed by and there was nothing but the bright expanse of the street and the air full of flying ants with a few onlookers peering into the precipice of uncertainty. Then he went to the chestnut tree, thinking about the circus, and while he urinated he tried to keep on thinking about the circus, but he could no longer find the memory. He pulled his head in between his shoulders like a baby chick and remained motionless with his forehead against the trunk of the chestnut tree\\" (267).Originally written in Spanish, One Hundred Years of Solitude is a difficult read. The sentences are long and the narrative does not follow a singular arc. However, the book brings harsh questions into focus. Are we free to choose the direction of our lives or have they been set in motion long before we were conscious of our choices? No matter how many friends and loved ones orbit our lives, are we actually alone? I encourage you to pick up Marquez's masterpiece and struggle your way to your own answers.Originally from Where Pen Meets Paper Blog"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This is a hard book to read. It is equally despising and depressing, and somewhat boring in its literalness of the biblical-style apocalyptic approach to the whole fiasco that is the comedy of Latin America. But at its surface (and the novel is entirely a surface phenomenon because of its literalness) there are levels of cruelty unimagined by any other writer, and maybe for this the novel deserves its distinction. Jose Arcadio Buendia, a former god-believing man hoping to acquire science (because he doesn't want to \\"live like donkeys\\") then losing his faith (because the \\"daguerreotype proves god's inexistence\\") declares after extensive investigation that the earth is round (\\"like an orange\\") and ends with him going crazy (in the deadest of dead languages, Latin). Garcia-Marquez saves the worst cruelty for the son, Colonel Aureliano Buendia, who hopes for military glory and meaning to his life, but who instead is thrown back into the dark pit of memory and regret, dragging around military failure and indecision like a paralyzed limb, despising everything, women, ideals, etc. And introducing vultures at his death just seemed to underscore the literalness and cruelty of the text as a whole. Every other Buendia after them is parodic of the modern man or woman. Choose the degeneracy, and Marquez embodies it in a later Buendia: the libertine, the glutton, the free spirit, philanderer, the rake, the reprobrate, isolationist. All of these are present to some extent in Jose Arcadio Buendia or Colonel Aureliano Buendia, but they are not definitive of and do not circumscribe their personalities as they do in the later Buendias. And of these later Buendias Marquez depicts their downfall like roaches being stamped out, in the blackest of black humor, which is why readers complain about the unheroic qualities, the hollowness and boredom of succeeding generations, which is the whole point. Marquez detests his world (not in the beginning which is idyllic, but its later manifestations) and weaves his story with the cruelty this form of detestation takes: Locked in fatalistic moments as inescapable as Homer's, whether living tediously (usually the women) or dying early (usually the men) for they-don't-know-what. The Buendia men utter stupid things before being executed and wholly misunderstand their existence. And there are no gods to lighten things up, like in the Iliad. War is farcical (Ursula reminds them that although they are soldiers, their \\"mothers reserve the right to take down their pants and spank them\\"). Loyalty is literally a laughing matter (the illegal painting of ballot cards being the spur for Aureliano to choose political sides, because one side is \\"trickier than the other\\"). There isn't even a redemptive figure, like in the Bible. There is a level of literalness here which is juvenile (e.g. names as determinants of behavior), almost nave for a modern novel, until you realize the meticulous stage-setting for destruction taking place. The novel doesn't suffer from too much fantasy, it's mired in too much depressive reality. The fantasy only leavens it a bit, but this doesn't distract from the cruelty being perpetrated. Sex is of course freely enjoyed (and that taboo, incestual sex) but this sensual mirage is only a distraction, for the characters and the reader, from what's happening right before their eyes. The book has no political, philosophical, or sociological agenda, moral or immoral. The only point, foretold in the beginning and coming at the end, is eventual extinction, which is hardly a point. Although it is better than the Bible and the Iliad, by being crueler, the reader should beware: this novel is like a Toltec or Aztec statue, one with snakes for heads and hearts and severed hands for necklaces, unimpressive at first sight until you do a complete 360 survey of it and realize it fits right into the cruel landscape their sculptors inhabited. And there is no way out. Everything is there on the surface. There is no redemptive value in this kind of fiction. It doesn't extend outside itself. Multiple readings do not yield multiple levels of meaning. It means everything it says."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"After striking out at Borders Express one evening, I was at a loss for what novel to read next, the store having been exhausted of their copies of \\"The Tin Drum,\\" \\"Stranger In A Strange Land\\" and \\"The Golden Notebook.\\" The Manager, noticing my distant pauses, asked me if I'd like to have a look at the best book he'd ever read. I said I would.Such was my accidental crossing of paths with Marquez's \\"One Hundred Years Of Solitude,\\" a sprawling, epic story of several generations of the Buendia family in early South America. From the very first page I couldn't put this thing down. I've read a lot of books this year but none of them can compare to the simple yet graceful poise of this masterpiece. Marquez expertly mixes fantasy with the staunch realism of raising and nurturing a family in a newly formed society.It begins with patriarch Jose Arcadio Buendia and his wife Ursula just after having trekked many, many miles with a small group of nomads in search of a good piece of earth in which to plant the seeds of a new community. Slowly but surely they build their homes and expand their families amid vividly created stories from the author's own mind and experiences. The characters in this book are incredible. There were the random exploits of the wild Gypsy sorcerer Melquiades, the raging sexuality of the giant Jose Arcadio Jr., the hateful sadomasochism of spinster Amaranta - every persona gets a chance to shine in this story of 100 years in the line of a great family, each one of them obsessed in some way with a solitary form of existence.It's fascinating to read about a story that begins with people who don't even have words for certain things in this world and ends after having depicted great advances in moving pictures. It's like voyeuristically peeking into an actual piece of history. So absorbed was I with this piece that I didn't even notice until after reading a review on Amazon.com that the word \\"solitude\\" is written on almost every page of the book. Repetition doesn't usually get by me so easily; in fact, it annoys me to no end. But everything else about this thing shines so brightly that I didn't have the eyes to notice the things that I'd normally consider flaws. Steeped in thought-provoking symbolism, radically attacking the world of politics, literally filled with the taboos of pedophilia and incest and murder, this is without a doubt one of my favorite novels of all time."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This novel is honestly one of the most captivating and well written works I have had the pleasure of reading. Marquez is a master of the literary word. He is able to intertwine realism and fantasy in a way that does not hinder the work but enriches it. Marquez utilizes many literary devices and his use of time manipulation in the novel allows the surreal aspects of the novel to be applied to it seamlessly. Marquez presents the novel in a way that resembles storytelling; the whole novel seems to occur at one time without a linear chronology of events. Thus the work often parallels the way in which the bible was written and takes on a vast significance. The book addresses all aspects of human nature and leaves the reader in awe. It is truly a triumph of literature."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"There's something very hard to explain about this book. It can be very confusing at times, with the names of the characters, and very slow at times, when you get bogged down in events and wonder what significance they could possibly have. But by the end, something very emotional emerged in my reaction, something that made me very happy to be alive. This is a wonderful book."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I recomend this novel to all whom may read this review. It is the most profound, interesting and wonderful novel that I have read. Marquez nimbly creates a world modeled after his own in which all different emotions flow and characters are very real. To fully appreciate this book one must have a knowledge of South American culture, although the first read of mine I claimed no such knowledge and I still couldn't put it down. It is a book which captures both the small, wonderful details of life and the greater questions of humanity in an easy to read package. I strongly recomend this book to everybody."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"'One Hundred Years of Solitude', as most of the other reviewers agree, is a tremendous achievement. In a sometimes indirect fashion, it chronicles the soul and psyche of 19th century Colombians as the 'civilized' world sweeps into their lives, turns it upside-down, then recovers. The author achieves this by tracing generations of an extended family in a remote village, glued together by a strange mixture of heredity, emotion, and mysticism. This is not historical fiction by any means. However it perfectly projects a sense of ... I don't know ... spirit? soul? of the local people. One cannot help but feel that the author has written something unique.Despite all this goodness, the book is difficult to read. At times the author seems to be rambling aimlessly, talking about the (too) many characters with identical (or nearly identical) names. But I sense not a single word was written without a strong purpose. Therefore I recommend NOT reading the book alone but rather share it, discuss it with folks interested in Latin American society. I did not do this, and I fear I simply read many portions of the book without fully appreciating what was written."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"There is very little that I can say that hasn't already been said. In short, this is the greatest book that I have ever read. It changed my life. It comes, as you might guess, VERY highly recommended."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I've heard a lot about this book recently, so I thought I'd give it a whirl when I saw it at the local library. The plot was extremely intruiging - the tale of the Buendia family, original settlers of the fictional town of Macondo in what seems to be South America. The characters were unique and colorful and I enjoyed traveling the generations of the family and sharing their experiences.However, someone in each generation (and sometimes more than one person) was named a variant of Aureliano or Jose. I was constantly confused at which character experienced what and feeling as if the plot was contradicting itself. I continually flipped back and forth with the family tree provided at the beginning of the book which caused me to feel disconnected from the story. I would lose track of the plot and ended up rereading many sections multiple times.Eventually, I felt like reading the book was a chore, and I'll admit, I was relieved when I finally finished it."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"&quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot; follows the history of the fictional town of Macondo from its founding to its senescence. The story is centered around the Buendia family and its progeny. Town founder and patriarch Jose Arcadio brings progress to Macondo as he pursues his search for alchemy and science. Ursula, the long-lived matriarch, tries to keep the family together through their problems and conflicts. Son Colonel Aureliano Buendia fights in over thirty civil wars before realizing the futility of waging war. Son Jose Arcadio pursues a Gypsy woman, travels around the world, and returns a tattooed giant. Macondo has a very turbulent history. It is torn apart by war. It expands as the railroads bring foreigners, businesses, and technology that irrevocably change its course. It suffers severe floods and droughts. It is decimated by a bloody labor battle.Nobel prize-winning author Gabriel Garcia Marquez was inspired to write this novel by the tales told to him by his grandmother in Colombia. His grandmother filled her stories with a mixture of fantastic and truthful elements and told them with a serious and natural demeanor. In a similar fashion, the author tells his story using magical realism, where mythical details are intermingled in a very offhand manner with a realistic story line. Among the mundane events of town life Garcia Marquez casually scatters such magical elements as a Gypsy who is bored with death and returns to life, a man followed by swarms of butterflies, levitating people, and a contagious plague of insomnia.If there was anything about the story that I found a bit difficult to follow, it was the fact that most of the characters shared the same names. Every generation of Buendias had its Jose Arcadios, Aurelianos, and Remedios. During his military campaigns, Colonel Aureliano fathered many children by women all over the country. Seventeen of them were adopted into the family and given the name Aureliano. Fortunately, there is a family tree at the front of the book that will help the reader keep track of the generations of Buendias.This novel is beautifully written. The language in this English translation is rich, lyrical, and poetic. The story is full of humor, irony, and tragedy. It contains such universal themes as nostalgia and regret, strength and madness, passion and revenge. Never has a family had more long-lived and colorful characters than those in the Buendia family. Solitude is an omnipresent theme in the story, since many of the Buendias secluded themselves in their rooms or homes for years on end because of broken dreams, broken hearts, and pursuit of the impossible. I recommend this book highly. Find some solitude for yourself for a while and lose yourself in an amazing story.Eileen Rieback"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I do sympathise with people who found this book long and difficult. I am fifteen, I read this when I was fourteen, and this, to date, is one of my favourite books from one of my favourite novelists.This book if for people who truly love writing and language rather than 'thrilling' plots. It is written beautifully. The words are rich and the images are dream-like. The town Macondo, is a dream. You need to read it for the words. For the links. For the images and for the characters. The magic is part of it. It is what makes Macondo Macondo and is what makes Marquez Marquez. I can't understand how people can hate it.You read a sentence, you stop, and you savour it."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"As I opened this book, I thought to myself &quot;Wow! This seems like a great story!&quot; I found myself growing more depressed and disgusted with every page. Although the style and Marquez' technique are unquestionably wonderful, the overlaying themes of lust, lack of self-control, and immorality outweighed the good. The goal of nearly very character's life is the same; to please him or herself. Very few characters are in the least bit caring of self-sacrificing. The only way I could reconcile myself to reading this disapointing work was the fact that it is a lesson in man's depravity. I realized that every person, without God's intervention, is just as bad or worse than Marquez' perverse characters. The book is not without its high points- I loved the ending, the mystery of the Segundo twins, and Ursula's strength. There are some passages where the language is incredible. Marquez is a mastery of imagery! I only wish that there had been more positive images to remember...."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"to relate to his writing style, otherwise you'll find it dull and boring. Just as I did. I'm not that much of a fan of Gabriel Garcia Marquez's books, because most, if not all, of them are written in a sense that the writer is making up the story as you read along... A sense of disorientation. I don't like that in a book. I like a story line, somthing to expect to... suspense, drama... not a vague idea as to what the writer thinks of his hero's (or his own?) miserable life.It's written beautifully, that's for sure. But it's most certainly not enough. Being able to write attractive and intellectual phrases does not make a bad story better. Especially if there's no story at all. I didn't like."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"One hundred years of characters and you won't care about one. This novel is overloaded with characters, but I didn't feel much of anything for any of them. It lacks focus, and failed to make me care about anything that happened in the story."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I bought this book based on a firend's advice, who claimed that it was the best book he had ever read. Well, the first page was very interesting and captivating, and then I started suffering through the rest. A never ending, boring, slow, and confusing book. It took me almost a year to finish it and I suffred through every page. What is all the fuss? I didn't find it intelectually challenging, entertaining, or fun to raed. It was just boring and confusing, pure and simple."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"The first paragraph of this book is one of the greatest in literary history. It's enough to compel the reader to read the next one hundred pages. Unfortunately, the book becomes one of the most overrated in history.Many of the praises given say the book is difficult, confusing, and yet they come to the conclusion it is a great book. Why? Why not just say that difficult and confusing books are not very good. This is a parable with many characters, magic realism (a genre that deserves to be ignored, though that's another discussion. To give Marquez credit, his magical realism is a response to the limits placed upon him by the government he lived under, but it is, nevertheless, a poor literary form and when imitated purely awful), and the intertwining of lives, but they just don't move. The story only makes the reader wonder what the big fuss is all about?Marquez' book about Miguel Litton, and News of a Kidnapping are much better, but this book just bores and bores."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I'll come clean first. I stopped reading after 100 pages. A lot happens in this book, with deaths and spirits and insomnia and marriages, and it's all fairly easy enough to figure out what's going on. Yet, nothing happens. So much plot takes place that the characterization suffers. I simply didn't care what happened to the characters, or anyone in the town. If a bomb had levelled Macondo, I would have simply flipped to the next page to see what happened next, not to read on about the characters. If you're interested in a classic worthy of its praise, where characterization is king, do yourself a favor and pick up Sound and the Fury by William Faulkner. You'll work to read, but your mind and soul will be enriched. Faulkner's novels are like movies you watch in slow motion to get every nuance. Marquez, on the other hand, is like a movie you watch in fast forward. You get the plot and action, but when all is said and done, nothing sticks in your mind that is worthy of the space it occupies."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"As mentioned in the prologue, Gabriel Garcia Marquez makes an attempt to grasp the storytelling voice of his grandmother throughout the novel. He also tries to capture the surrealistic elements of these stories as they presented themselves to him when he was a child. Thus we have that familiar element of a tragic fairytale being told, which makes the story convuluted and difficult to read. Perhaps something got lost in translation. Perhaps I'm just an idiot. But my second attempt at mastering the novel, spurned on by Oprah's literate voice, failed at about 300 pages in (it's a little over 450 pages). I was frustarted with the continuing use of the Jose Buendia name and the fact that I had to keep flipping back to the family chart at the beginning to remember who people were. Again, maybe I'm just an idiot who happens to hold an English degree, but my continuous feeling that this book was more work than pleasure pesisted and I kept asking myself how could people possibly consider this to be his best work. It's not. I reserve that role for Love In The Time Of Cholera and Chronicles Of A Death Foretold. Both are profound page turners that makes one contemplate, well, everything because he seems to say everything that needs to said in those two novels. However, One Hundred Years of Solitude is just Garbriel Garcia Marquez talking trash."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This book is long, dull, boring and confusing. It lacks the passion that makes Love in The Time of Cholera so beautiful. It make &quot;Tess of the D'Urburvilles&quot; look like a fast-paced romp. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"The acrid smell of sweat, dung and animals, coupled with the stifling heat, permeates the village of Macondo, where the novel takes place. Incest, murder, and suicide are everyday happenings, especially the first. Marquez pushes a dizzying and horrifying picture of the human condition, which left me feeling as if I had been raped. My options here seem to be either to dismiss Marquez as an extraordinarily skilful madman or to go mad myself. I choose the former. An ugly novel, not the less ugly for the undeniable talent with which it is executed. I do not recommend it."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I read literary fiction, &quot;smart&quot; books, and could deconstruct an eggplant if I needed to. And this book is a chore to read.It is all tell and no show. One long narrative.But that is not what I consider to be the source of the problem. Here's what is: the book is not compelling.Many people assume a book that has won prestigious awards must be great, but awards can spread like a virus, wiping out independent judgement along the way.I just finished reading Cities of the Plain by Cormac McCarthy. It is smart and beautiful and compelling and much more worthy of your reading time."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I can see this is an unpopular but not unique opinion, but this is one of the very few books I've stopped reading halfway through. And I have no intention of ever finishing it. Despite the fact that I horde books, I gave this one away.While the prose was beautiful, the story tended toward the dull and was difficult to follow. The fact that there were only a handful of names reused by dozens of characters did not help much. Most of the characters were unlikable and hard to relate to. After awhile I decided I just didn't care anymore.Is this book a masterpiece? Perhaps it is, but that doesn't mean it's a good read."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I have been a fan of magical realism for years but had never gotten around to reading this one. I am so glad that I finally did. Marquez says that he wrote this novel in the way that his grandmother used to tell stories, where the real and the fantastic are blending effortlessly together, without any change in tone or facial expressions. He definitely succeeds in creating an alternate reality. It becomes so believable that a magic flying carpet would pass by the window, or that a woman would live to be 145 years old. The reader never questions him. There are some slow parts to this book, but the journey was definitely worth it. The female characters in particular are absolutely fascinating: the matriarch, the prostitute, the queen-in-training, the spinster, and of course, the beautiful-ascended-into-heaven. The language and imagery are almost without compare, and Marquez has definitely made a place for himself in the canon of great world literature. This should be required reading for all college lit majors (unfortunately, if wasn't required for me!), as the influence Marquez has had on other authors is obvious. A great read!"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"After closing the final page I opened up the first and read it again.You are drawn into this book like it is true to life and suddenly you get slapped with mystical apparitions that jolt you back into reality. The apparitions serve to fuel the reader! It is a must read."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"A hundred years of solitud depicts a bygone era of South America. The uniqueness of this book is the portrayal of \\"small town Latin America\\". This is a book you should read in Spanish, something is always lost in translation. The frame of mind of Latin America is well described and trasnports the reader into a world, that has been later explored by other Latin American authors.His writing style is widespread and well known worldwide.His \\"Novel Prize\\" in literature was well deserved."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"One Hundred Years of Solitude is one of the most fascinating books I have ever read ( and I have read thousands).Marquez is a giant. His skill is like that of a mythical creature, like a Phoenix combined with a hundred great authors.The pure fact that this book was written by one man is amazing. I don't want to say anything about the story. If you care about great literature, do not let life pass by without reading Marquez' masterpiece."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This book captivates you from beginning to end. I fell in love with the characters and enjoyed the colorful lives of each one. The symbolism and translation make this book one of a kind."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"There's been a huge amount of reviews about this book already so there is no point in resuming the story. This book, although not at all the kind I usually enjoy kept me in its grip from beginning to end. The events are far-fetched and unbelievable but it still holds you. The style of writing is very particular. There's almost no dialogue yet you know all that is said or done. I really loved the passage, toward the end of the book where Fernanda goes on and on and the actual sentence is actually pages long! It's a very passionate, very interesting book. I really loved. I think people will either hate or love it. There is no in-between. Happy Reading!"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"There is no words that can show the way that i feel since i have read this book...In my heart that book will alwayw be the best thing a human ever wrote!when i finish the book the tears was instopeble and i am not the type of a men who cryes often!My deepest sympathy for the author Gamriel Garcia Marcuez i prey for him to step over cancer!I am Greek and i have get with this book the real taste of the pain that feel a Latinoamerican!I hope that region of the earth will find peace and democracy in the future."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"100 years of Solitude is a confusing book to read It is enjoyable nonetheless. It is hard to keep track of what each character is doing, because there are so many characters with the same name. Gabriel Garcia Marquez paints a vivid picture of a fictional setting called Macondo where the people speak Spanish. The founder of Macondo is Jose Arcadio Buendia. He is an adventurous person but he gets crazy and impulsive with anything new. These traits seem to pass on to all of his descendants with the same name. The people of Macondo endure a civil war and a widespread plague where no one can sleep. They also have to adjust to living with the white man.I liked about how each character is changed by the events happening around them. Aureliano Buendia is a great example of this. He is a happy, intelligent, compassionate person at the beginning of the novel. However after experiencing defeat in a prolonged civil war, he loses his capacity to appreciate life and his loved ones.Each woman in this novel has her own individual quirk that makes them unique. Ursula is the matriarch of the Buendia family who holds the family together despite being blind. Pilar Ternera is the fortune teller who predicts the future using cards. Rebecca is a reclusive character who eats dirt from the ground when she is depressed. 100 years of Solitude is an ok book but it's just a little hard to follow because of all the many characters."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"After trying futilely to read Cien A&ntilde;os de Soledad in its original tongue and realising my Spanish just wasn't up to it, I bought and finished the English edition of this great novel. (Note to Dorea, my Spanish-1 instructor from years ago: I tried my best, and I failed my miserably. The lesson is, I'll never try that again.)There is a clear theme in this book, at least to me. Five generations of this family, fathers and sons, mothers and daughters, are all bonded. Lust, tragic character flaws, and fate tie the generations together. However, this is a difficult story to follow, as many readers have already mentioned. The characters in the multiple generations are given very similar names, making the genealogy tree at the beginning of the book invaluable. (By the way, the tree in this edition is much better drawn than the one in the Spanish-language Cat&eacute;dra edition, although that one has a nice 50-page introduction.) Although I wouldn't say I was ever thoroughly bored by the writing, I sometimes felt the storyline was a bit rambling. It's still a powerful story, and the apparent rambling is more than justified by (and perhaps even a prerequisite for) the incredible final page."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This is considered as the best book by Gabriel Garcia Marquez and the beginning of magic-realism. OK, so what? I enjoyed the book until I reached page 200 purely because the story was in the making. Characters were introduced and built. But once all that had happened, it was story of how more characters are born and how they arrive at their ultimate fate, that of SOLITUDE. It simply could not hold my attention. And I am sure most people will agree with me. It is a chronicle of Buendia family, written in a style that is not my cup of tea. Mind you, I can read slow, heavy and depressing books but books that make sense. And thats where magic-realism comes into play. I expected the book will at least make me think which it did but only in the sense of figuring out who is who (names are repeated and I had to consult with the family tree provided at the beginning of the book once every 5 min or so).So if you dont like heavy books, dont even touch it. If you dont like slow read, dont even touch it. If you read for fun, dont even touch it. Touch it only if you are interested in a so called masterpiece by Gabriel Garcia Marquez and have the appetite for magic-realism (meaning the book does not have to make sense) which I know now that I dont have."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":".... While _One Hundred Years of Solitude_ isn't garbage, it doesn't deserve all the hoopla it has received.I found all the outrageously unrealistic happenings and crazy activities of the characters very amusing (the reason I gave it the second star). Unfortunately this tactic got stale less than half-way through the book. The major downside to this writing style is that the characters lack credibility so it becomes difficult to see them as real people or sympathize.It boils down to your typical post-modern piece of \\"literature\\": nihilistic contempt for moral norms, gratuitous sex (including incest), characters who largely lack any regard for the welfare of their progeny, and what is fashionably called 'beauty': a mathematically symmetric plot not unlike a dog chasing its own tale---and just as meaningless.The book was worth a few chuckles, but I'm glad I didn't pay money for my copy. If you like fantastic stories from Latin America, I recommend reading the *short* stories of Jorge Luis Borges: each is crafted like a jewel; whereas _Solitude_ is just flaccid and tiresome."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"100 Years of Solitude is the BEST book I've EVER read. But it's not for everyone: you either love it, can't put it down and can't wait to read it AGAIN, or you can't go beyond the first 10 pages. Another reviewer said the book is not easy, I have to disagree: it's pure magic and a pleasure. I guess it doesn't work for those who are too rational, it's not a book to be read but that reads to you. One way or the other, a little advice: don't try to memorize names or understand the family tree. It's NOT important. It will flow and make sense, beautifully, I promise!"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I had high hopes for this book, since it's touted as a showcase of my favorite style of writing, magical realism. At its best, magical realism draws intangible ideas into the physical world in a way not easily done by everyday things. This book does not do that.Reading GGM's comments about the book, one can see how shallow his basis for the narrative really is. He wants to tell stories like his grandparents did, with no clear separation between fantasy and reality. Fair enough. Noble goal, though not Nobel-worthy. Unfortunately, telling-fantasy-like-it's-real does not magical realism make. The book comes off as a southern hemisphere Faulkner clone with a few supernatural events tossed in for stylistic effect.There's no getting around the fact that the same stuff happens over and over again, without interesting variation, throughout this leviathan of a book. Yes, GGM, we understand that time is a circle and that the family's doomed to repeat the same patterns in slightly different ways. This does not merit 422 pages. At page 100 I was hopeful a plot would develop; by page 200 it was clear that it would not.Major structural and premise flaws aside, though, GGM's just not a good stylist. I'm sure he's more elegant in the Spanish, but there's no redeeming \\"the fragrant and wormy guava grove of love that was dragging her to her death\\" in any language.This book would be an excellent fit for checkout lanes in grocery stores where very smart people shop, or for those who want to say they've read it. For those looking for quality books in the magical realist tradition, though, Borges' Collected Fictions, Calvino's If On A Winter's Night A Traveler or even Eco's Island Of The Day Before will offer far more rewarding reading."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This is a book that comes but once in a lifetime. Everyone should read it. It is an interesting journey that will allow your mind and senses to places they've never been before. Don't be scared by its number of pages, it is an adventure one should undergo at least once."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This is the second book that I have read by Gabriel Garcia-Marquez and I absolutly loved it! I was board one day and picked it up to read. I finished it in three days but will remember it for the rest of my life! This book truly made Garcia-Marquez my favorite author! I went all the way through college without reading it, but I suggest everybody read it at least once! I also reccommend &quot;Chronicle of a Death Fortold.&quot; Its words, too, hold all of the power and magic that grip you tightly as you can't wait to read the next page!"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I rarely get chills when reading a book, but my skin crawled for most of this one. Every paragraph seemed to have some phrase that just plowed over me. I can't believe it was so good in translation. A recent book that picks up on Gabo's themes and style is Roy's &lt;The God of Small Things&gt;. It's not quite as awe inspiring but what is?"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This highly overrated book indicates the havoc that overweight talk show hosts can wreak upon the literary world. Garcia's most juvenile and frustrating book is now being yammered about by book clubs the world over who suddenly think they know about South American authors.The book is overly long and repetitive; themes are repeated ad nauseum. Characters (some of whom have the same name) are one dimensional and unbelievable. By the time you reach the halfway point in the book you are praying for something different to happen. Then Garcia introduces a new character, has him act just like all the others, and die within 3 pages. It's amazing how quickly he mows down his creations, as if he is as tired of them as I was.In the end there are no surprises, and you feel exhausted from the repetition. Underwhelming, and nowhere near as good as &quot;Love in the Time of Cholera&quot;.Give it a miss and try &quot;Blindness&quot; instead."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"wow is all i have to say. this is the third book i read from garcia marquez and i think i like this book the best (or at least so far). it's like reading a dream, his words flow like water and keep you turning the pages. it's a little hard to follow with all the names at times and a little strong on some issues. but i wouldn't have it any other way."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"One Hundred Years of Solitude is a beautifully written book filled with memorable characters and packed with raw emotion and truth. Why not give it five stars then? Well, it was a rough decision. From a writing perspective, this is top notch stuff, no questions asked.Some people have called the book boring, which is not true. Most of the characters and their stories are highly entertaining. The problem I encountered was that once a certain character dies, or his/her story stops being the primary focus, it takes a while for the reader to get involved in the next character that the book chooses to focus on. There were certain characters I liked more than others, and I found myself really taken out of the book once they were relegated to secondary characters and I had to adjust to a whole new set of characters and subplots.Also, I never found myself confused by the similar names family members. Rather, I had a harder time keeping up with the numerous characters who only appear for two chapters and then die or just go off somewhere.On the whole, I really enjoyed this book. Not one of my all-time favorite, but a beautiful book that really brough out emotion in me, especially towards the end, with that jaw-droppingly beautiful final sentence that ties together the overriding theme of the entire book."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I bought this book four years ago and finally forced myself to read it from cover to cover. I can't believe all the &quot;5 star&quot; reviews people are giving it. This book was one big disappointment and has been exiled to the bottom shelf in my collection. The characters are meaningless, the text is scattered and awkward. Perhaps something was lost in translation, who knows. I've never been one to give up on a book but I considered it many times with this one."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This book is pernicious. LIfe is predetermined, plotless, circular and meaningless. Why bother to write a book at all, if in the end, this is the grand message. How sadistic."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I read constantly and although I've only read a few books that I feel warrant 5 stars, I am amazed that this best seller IS a best seller. Most of the characters have the same or very similar names. The family tree at the beginning of the book is no help since the men seem to sleep with the same women. If you want to read a latin magic themed book read Blindness. This book is difficult to get through, but has an absolutely amazing premise and once I got used to the narrative style, I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I've heard almost everwhere about people saying this was the greatest book they have ever read, I often don't think much of peoples comments with statements like that and put them in a category under recommended reading. After reading this book however; I started a new category called \\"avoid at all costs.\\" The book has high hopes comparing itself to the creation story and the first 5 books of the Bible, I don't beleive critics should even repeat this comparison because it is so off kilter. The story tells the plight of a south american family and its countless generations struggle with society and establishing norms. However, the book drags into a boring and overwritten lull, each page made me cry because I am in no ways a fast reader and it moved me to tears to realize that I had lost about 18 hours of my life over the course of three months, and you need that many breaks when you pick up a book like this. If there was anything good to come out of this was the realization that a number of books tell the same story a lot better for instance John Steinbeck's \\"The Pearl\\" and his other master work \\"The Grapes of Wrath.\\" You treasure every page in those books."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I can count on one hand the number of books in my life that I have been unable to finish. I am oftimes mocked for my reading, the rate at which I devour books being astronomical, but I could not drag my weary brain kicking and screaming through more than a few dozen pages of this book.I love a good fantasy novel, or anything that gives you a sense of the magical, but I could not find anything interesting in the random and inexplicable bizarre occurrences in this book. Mix that with the dry, long winded prose and I find myself doing something I have NEVER done; sitting with a book in my hands, looking around the room for something else to do."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Was this story lost in translation? I almost gave up on this book half a dozen times, but kept on reading thinking it could only get better. Boy was I wrong!The dozens of characters blur together in an entanglement of crooked, incestuous limbs on a family tree. Even the family chart (yes, a chart) provided at the beginning of the book wasn't enough to keep the members of the Buendia family straight. Look elsewhere!"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This novel was painful for me to finish.

I realize the 'payoff' on books sometimes doesn't happen until the very end. I'm not a modern bestseller reader or 'a great beach book' reader. In my lifetime, I may have intentionally stopped reading abut three books that I could not bear to finish. This is such a book. I got to abut page 189 and realized what an awful experience this book was to read. The style is kind of like the driest, dullest high school history book. I echo what some of the other 1 star reviewers have stated. There'e a point where the military is formed. After that, most of the characters and either Generals or colonels, predominately named Jose who get shot and killed. There is not an ounce of felling or tone to the prose. No character has any depth, no epiphany's of universal awareness, no compelling relationships or moving romances...nothing. Things just happen to them (dull things). I admire those who slogged on with it. Good luck if you can."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I first read &quot;Cien Anos de Soledad&quot; in 1976 when I was in jail in Saltillo, Mexico, in fact, I loved this book so much I learned spanish reading this book.

I was drawn in from the very first sentence. And I have not looked upon the world the same ever since. To date, I have read - nay, experianced - it about seven or eight times. The mark of a great novel, I think, is that it reveals endless layers of meaning at each subsequent reading. Solitude is one such novel. But nothing beats the wide-eyed wonderment of the innocent first-time reader.

The magician of Marquez's pen let the reader keeps dreaming in the time the book is closed down too."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"It takes a writer like Garcia to undertake a novel of such mythic proportions. He weaves magic and fantasy into the politics of progress and greed, the loves, hates, incest and lies of human existence. Macondo is every place and Buendia is every man and woman. Garcia draws the reader to experience the depth and purity of the soul even as he constantly parodies its high moral ground by bodily functions and the smell of human pain and suffering. He lulls the reader into the bliss of solitude but forces them to confront the unbearable loneliness that it breeds. Here is life in all her forms!"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"George Orwell once said that reading James Joyce's &quot;Ulysses&quot; gave him an inferiority complex. That's how I feel towards this book. This may sound corny, but it's true that no words can express how much I admire Marquez's talent and how much I enjoyed reading this book. The magical realism is convincing, and how Marquez was able to chronicle one hundred years of a family and village convincingly is beyond me. He addresses every part of the cycle of life, so I believe there is no one who can't relate to the characters or events in this book in one way or another. Marquez also defines a culture and, in a way, practically gives a history of the world in just 400-plus pages.

Marquez out did himself with this literal masterpiece. The story is superb. enjoy it, I certainly did"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"One Hundred Years of Solitude felt a bit dense at times, and then there where times when you couldn't put the book down, the way G G. Marquez tells the story is just wonderful, he makes time go not in a linear sort of way, but as what felt in a branching kind of style.Sometimes I needed to stop reading because of work, and when I'd get back to it in some days, it felt really different, and sometimes confusing. till about the 2nd half, this because so many things are going on in the town of Macondo and the names where very similar at times. I believe this is either the most bothersome thing or the most entertaining and helpful thing to the complex story, depending on your memory of the storyI can't recommend reading the book twice or three times a week, I highly RECOMEND reading it, at least a bit every day. When I finished It after about a month or so, I felt that I had missed out on some interesting people, moments, and emotions, not because the book is complicated to fallow, but because one needs to sort of take everything in as one reads, and when you put the book down for a few days and then pick it up, it feels that the story lost the intensity that it had, mainly because the level of retention toward different events that is required if planning to understand the mood of the moment. There so many things one needs to keep in mind as this \\"Illusion\\" of time progresses.I'm planning on reading it again when I get the chance.(P.S.) - One of my favorite things was the amount of Foreshadowing used, at times it even felt that the writer could be intentionally trying to confuse or deceive, and then one realizes that it was all very essential for the gravity of the story."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I found this book a little difficult getting started due to the way the author seems to skip aroundand introduces so many new characters but after about a third through the book, I began to get into it.The over all scope of the novel and the intimate details of emotions and feelings gives the story a realsense of feeling. It was a slow read as I kept going back and forth with it for about four weeks but I amhappy to have read it and now have a better understanding of another place and another culture."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I first read this book in college and found it to be so captivating. The story of Macondo feels very real. At the beginning we are introduced to the Buendia family and they seem really simple. It's not until the book progresses that we start to get confused with every family member having the same name. What is Marquez's point in this? I think to show that life is simple and to keep the family going in a circular motion. By the end of the book, everything seems to have gone full circle, from life to death, and inventions people make to eventually exploiting the earth. I love the slight magical realism in this book. It really adds so much quality as if to mock what we value so much on earth."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This work can only be the product of a mind in an extremely imaginative state. Gabriel Marquez blends the real and the surreal to weave a fantastic tale around the town of Macondo and the Buendia family starting with Jose Arcadio Buendia, the patriarch characterized by his entrepreneurial zeal and scientific spirit who, among other explorations, attempts to use a daguerreotype to disprove the existence of God and all the way to Aureliano who is finally seen deciphering parchments. In between you will find numerous Aurelianos and Arcadios all of which can get pretty confusing; to keep track of them all, fortunately, the book has the Buendia family tree printed at the beginning. Actually, unless you are very good with names and names that you don't hear often, you may want to write down the additional characters in there. Heck, even the teacher Melchor Escalona had the same problem \\"...used to knowing Jose Arcadio Segundo by his green shirt, went out of his mind when he discovered that the latter was wearing Aureliano Segundo's bracelet and that the other one said, nevertheless, that his name was Aureliano Segundo in spite of the fact that he was wearing the white shirt and the bracelet with Jose Arcadio Segundo's name. From then on he was never sure who was who\\".The beautiful aspect of this story is that you are invited to passively sit and watch the events unfold (over a century) in Macondo, a town where, as explained by a poker-faced Gabriel Garcia, flying carpets, yellow butterflies, ascension to heaven are as mundane as the rest. Each moment in Macondo is as good as the next and the beginning is as good as the end and the end is as good as the beginning of the end and the beginning. You are not going to ask \\"what is next?\\" since, the way it is told, the beauty of the story lies in the 'here and now'. I don't know how it comes across in Spanish, but I would certainly give credit to Gregory Rabassa for the captivating presentation. Looking forward to reading it again."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This book had a habit of being extremely wordy with very little dialouge and even a bit confusing (i.e. multiple family members being given the same name, making it a bit of a burden to tell who is who from what generation) but the storyline was so creative and captivating to me. I guess that I was able to get through it (unlike some other readers) because I have a good imagination and I don't need a lot of action and dialouge to help me envision the story better. I found the characters and their experiences to be very unique. They were so profound that i felt like I was growing up with the Buendia family and when each one finally met their demise in their own bizzare way I found myself genuinely feeling heartbroken, as if they were my own family members! The author had a way of really connecting me with this family, which each generation. For a fantasy, the realism was amazing."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I'm a bit ambivalent that this has that mark of Oprah's club (no offense) but I think this book is just in another league.I was first introduced to this book in high school for an AP Literature course. I absolutely hated reading before I started reading Marquez. I became a literary freak after I read this. I read all his books after this then started to read other Latin American writers (Isabelle Allende, Carlos Fuentes et. al) and on and on.His style is definitely unique, a bit wordy and somewhat overly complex utilizing confusing similar names, flashbacks, and long drawn out descriptive sentences. He knows the rules of storytelling and he effectively smashes them to pieces.This is not an easy read. But take the time to invest in it, absorb the words and let the world of the Buend&iacute;as' come to you. Upon multiple readings, you'll gain clarity. By far, #1 on my top favorite ten books."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"One Hundred Years of Solitude is marvelous--extraordinary in its emotional depth.

Colonel Aureliano Buendias endless melting and creating his gold fishes also highlights this cycle and the interplay of memory and forgetting.Full of sensuous smells as Melquiades' laboratory, tastes as Rebecca's mud, and delightful colors as Mauricio's yellow butterflies the book can be intoxicating.

It is hard to understand because of the complex family structures and the nonlinearity of much of the time sequence. But I keep returning to it, with the intent of reaching full understanding. I have theCliffs Notes guide and Murray Abraham's audio cassette reading, and I have borrowed several books of commentary from our university library.I loaned the Spanish copy to a bilingual friend. She read a little over a hundred pages, and all she could say was, &quot;This is a strange book.&quot;Some people say the story covers Genesis; others, that it covers Genesis to Revelation.

What a wonderful story full of imagination, sorrow, laughter, solitude, and reality in the same time. How the wars changed the mentality of people, change their behavior, traditions, and it makes them lose the respect for any human relation. How the founded city went from being the most simple, and peaceful place, to this horrifying, deserted city that the technologies ran through it, and its own people stopped caring about what's best for it.How being solitary was the response to many answers, how the Buendia men acted to their defeats, to their pleasures, and how far did they go in order to explore what was out there.The story could be slow at times, but the end has its own unique twist that shows how important history is, and how sad it is when we waste time not doing what we always dreamt of.Such a classic worth reading by Marquez, what dreams, deaths, madness, war, and what pressure has this life on us."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"It isn't your fault if you haven't read this classic novel yet. Rather than read people's reviews you should just buy the book and begin this incredible journey!I first read this while living in a rural South American village over 30 years ago and it provided insight into the people around me as well as those where I grew up in the Detroit area! What! At each reading I marvel at how Garcia Marquez weaves images and events into an enjoyable show imagined inside your head.This outstanding novel weaves a story of intriguing and oftentimes absurd history that causes you to reflect eventually on today's political and economic events. While written about different countries, cultures, and times from our own, yet as humans we are still movtivated by the same things. As one reads about outlandish happenings and goings on in a far away land you suddenly realize you are facing today's reality presented in a much different form.While the size of the book is daunting you soon become familiar with Aureliano Bunedia, Ursula and the other characters. The book snuggles into your being like a very good friend and you feel compelled to open it up to see just what is happening now, just as one talks with the neighbors, co-workers or family members. Avoid surprise at discovering you start carrying the book with you to snatch a few paragraphs while waiting in line at the supermarket or while commuting to work. You won't be able to put this down for very long and will miss it when you aren't reading it.Spanish version or English version doesn't really matter as you get so caught up in the events that you start dreaming about the book..... However, I'd caution that unless you have a top notch Spanish vocabulary, like those that have taken university level courses in Spanish, this book and Garcia Marquez will challenge your vocabulary and limit the images in your mind. You may wish to begin with the English version and then on a second or third read do the Spanish version. Yeah, I know, I only used to read books one time, too. This book you will read again and again. Good reading!R.H. Curtiswww.robertoshidokan.com"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Once again I have fallen under the spell of Solitude.

His characters are vivid, intense but not realistic. He wants the reader to understand from the very first line that he is not looking for reality but introduces us to a magical world with heroes bigger than life. His characters do not follow any ethic laws or care for our kind of morality, they live in a universe of their own, a dimention set apart from everything we know. They are not good or bad, they just are. Marquez does not even try to judge his characters, the reader can try if he feels inclined to do so. I think that we do not want to judge them. Who judges Agamemnon, Clytemnestra,Electra a.so. I just love them as they are, unique, mad and incredible.I must say that I read the book in it's original Spanish."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Gabriel Garcia Marquez has written many novels over the years, but I have had the privilege to read only two. This book is written in the style of magical realism, so you have to be very open minded about the creative and surrealistic characters. It's a wonderful, classic book from a great Latin American author."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This is an excellent book that describes the realities of South America through the window of fiction and legend. It is a page-turner, and the kind of book that one wishes could have more and more pages..."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I felt this book captured the decay of memories and the human mind with immense efficiency and accuracy. The story of the Buendia family that lasts for 7 generations or so portrays death, wealth, happiness in some regard; however always followed by some disaster, and lastly loss of face and time. One main concept remains the common theme that money does not buy happiness. For example Aureliano Segundo's wealth is extensive, yet he does not find happiness in his wealth or with Fernanda, but rather with his concubine.I really like the magical aspect of this book in the beginning. Magic allowed my imagination to theorize inventions, possibly irrational ones, just as Jose Acardio Buendia the founder of Macondo imagined bizarre concepts. For me the book lacked substantial plot in the middle once Colonel Aureliano came back and awaited natural death in his silver fish work room and after the tragedy of his sons, yet pick up again once the \\"conservative\\" and oppressive Mr. Brown and his banana industry.The underlying concept I believe to be most important is that the past defines you. It never leaves you, just as Prudencio Aguliar(sp?) followed Jose Acardio Buendia even after he died. The past usually haunted each character; emphasizing and erupting a flame of solitude to encompass each of them forever. Whether their solitude remained their inability to love, or the physical decrepitude over time, or even the family values they were brought up on. However portrayed, peaceful or haunting, solitude as a result of the past defined the characters and the book."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I guess that is where this book is usually categorized in. Apparently, Gabriel Garcia Marquez popularized the genre. I loved the book and would put it in the top five of my list. There are people who I've talked to that thinks it was confusing or complicated. That was not the case for me. It's true that there were many characters (and it does not help that a lot of them are named similarly). But, I think each of them is distinct and was developed very well. The book is not about the town of Macondo...it's about the people who lived there. And, you will be able to relate to the book because of its very human characters set in an environment that is often very real but occasionally eerily surreal. That's magical realism for you."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I'm still not done with reading the book, but I'm amazed at the portrayal of the many coming and going characters in this book. It's interetsing how the writer portrays each main character's state of solitude leading to his death. The style of writing is also very different, going back and forth yet when you think about the book when you're not reading it, you do have a complete recollection of everything that's happened despite they're not being in chronological order."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"When I first read this book, I had never heard of Gabriel Garcia Marquez. I had never heard of \\"Love in the Time of Cholera\\". What Nobel prize? I picked it out because it was big, I liked the cover, and I had plenty of time on my hands back in 1983. Once I got through Chapter 2, I was permanently hooked. Images from this book still haunt me. Few novels have had such an impact on me and I have re-read it many times. This book is a ravishing one of a kind, truly a jewel, and clearly, not for everybody. Nothing is, after all! Gee, maybe I have to change my thinking about Oprah.. nah."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Twenty-one dauntless people led by Jose Arcadio Buend&iacute;a founded the settlement of Macondo somewhere between the mountains and the Caribbean Sea, bordering the swamp. One Hundred Years of Solitude is the rise and fall of Macondo and six generations of Buend&iacute;as. It is a study in the futility of mad adventures to defeat the guile of church, state and the Banana Company.M&aacute;rquez tells this tale as if it were oral tradition, a legend passed along through generations, spoken to children in rapture by once sturdy great-grandmothers rocking on the porch on cool summer nights. Grandmothers, when telling a story to youngsters, are apt to blend illusion and reality, and M&aacute;rquez preserved that quality of the narration. For example, the insomnia plague that infected the residents, not with drowsiness but with gradual loss of memory, requiring that every object be tagged with its name and purpose until Melquiades, the ancient sage, returns with a curative potion.Young Rebeca, an unrecognized relative of the Buend&iacute;as, probably brought the insomnia plague. Rebeca, who has an ancestral urge to eat dirt and whitewash, arrived at the Buend&iacute;a home with her parent's bones in a sack. The sack roams through the house, with an annoying clac clac rattle, because no one has died yet in Macondo and the community lacks a cemetery. That will change soon enough, though.Macondo, founded in tranquillity and innocence, welcomes bands of gypsies bearing science (like ice and alchemy), magic and illusions. The town admits Arabs too, who trade manufactured gadgets for macaws. The state invades in the form of Don Apolinar Moscote, a self-proclaimed magistrate in a town that did not need one. Likewise, the residents had become \\"accustomed to \\"...arranging the business of their souls directly with God...\\" until Father Nicanor, invited to perform a wedding, decides to stay and build a church. The people of Macondo, unaware they require a church, donate pitiful amounts for Father Nicanor's project until he resorts to levitating six-inches by drinking hot chocolate. Eventually the Banana Company arrives and dumps 3,200 citizens into the sea rather than pay their workers a decent wage.Solitude is withdrawal and denial, a loneliness and helplessness, an acquired madness instilled by philanthropy and greed upsetting tranquillity and innocence. M&aacute;rquez does not offer solutions for this phenomenon. It's up to us, I suppose."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Suffice it to say, there are surely enough glorifying reviews of this novel to choke a donkey. But one more can't hurt at this point. I first read this novel for a class, ripping out the family tree to use as a bookmark so I wouldn't lose track of which Aureliano or Jose Arcadio I was reading about. It is very interesting to read a book with such a broad scope with a group of people available for discussion throughout. It is safe to say that there are few themes this novel leaves out. Love, hate, religion, revenge, progress... life literally oozes out of this book at every page. There wake of the story drags you along behind it long after you finish the final page. And Garcia is one of those authors who inspires us to ask after each sentence, &quot;How the heck did he come up with this?&quot; Easily one of the best novels of the twentieth century that I have read, and one that, at the very least, inspires us to see the beauty and the magic that resides in the world, to seek it out and love it."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This monumental novel is the originator of &quot;magic realism,&quot; a style that has since been used so often by lesser writers as to give the genre a bad name. However, Garcia Marquez's work is the true original, disclosing to the reader a world in which the ordinary and the mystical live side by side, a state of existence viewed as unremarkable by the characters, and eventually by the reader as well.The characters are sharply drawn, masterful combinations of the down-to-earth and the eccentric. These succeeding generations of the Buendia family often have the same names as their ancestors, and while this can become confusing, the people themselves are such individuals, each of their lives bearing their own distinctive stamp, that at times we see them as clearly as if they were before us.The style is wholly original, a sonorous parlance that rolls along like the river described in the opening passages, in which the water has polished the stones to the smoothness of &quot;prehistoric eggs.&quot; The language catches this sense of almost geologic history as it traces the intertwined fortunes of the Buendia family and of the mythical town of Macondo from their beginnings to their definitive ends. As I read this book, I could not imagine how Garcia Marquez could possibly provide any kind of satisfactory ending to this pellucid, rollicking history. Suffice it to say that there is no doubt of the ending when the reader reaches the final pages of the book.Gregory Rabassa's translation is so good that the author himself commented that he liked parts of the translation better than the original. Having read the book in both Spanish and English, I can state with complete honesty that I thought the translation was masterful, just as good as the book itself. He captures perfectly the tone and cadence of the Colombian coastal Spanish without any of the stilted quality that characterizes so many translations. If there were Nobel prizes for translators, I have no doubt that Rabassa would have received one."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"One Hundred Years of Solitude attempts to define the human element by telling the story of a family in a fictional Latin American town, Macondo. The book recounts the rise to and fall from prominence for both the town and the family. The story begins with the romantic dreams of the town's founder, Jose Arcadio Buendia, and ends with the ruin of his family line , his house in disrepair and hurricanes ravaging the city he endeavored to make great. Mr. Marquez admirably tells the story of Buendia and all his descendents without losing the individuality of any of the characters. Though the Buendias tend to name sons and daughters after their grandparents, creating a confusing family tree, each member of the Buendia family has a distinct personality. Solitude undoubtedly prompts the reader to think about his or her own family tree and roots, and eventually what it is to be human.Maruqez's Nobel-prize winning talent shines best in two specific areas. First, it shows in the style Marquez crafted from the influences of everyone from Cervantes to Faulkner, magical-realism. Marquez credits his grandmother for the storytelling style. Magical realism affords him the luxury to describe a block of ice as a glittering wonder and the appearance of ghosts in the in a nonchalant manner. Though disconcerting at first, the style is both clear and exudes the charm of a child experiencing everything for the first time.Marquez also dazzles in his ability to probe at the heart of the human element. Colonel Aureliano Buendia, the patriarch of Macondo's son, is seen as a cyclic person, who begins his life sequestered in a workshop making golden fish to sell at market, and after losing 32 consecutive wars, dies in the same shop making the same fish, which he eventually melts down to make more fish. Still other characters, scarred by the death of husbands lock themselves in large mansions, forgotten by everyone. The climax of the epic is the invasion of the small town after a foreigner discovers the quality of the bananas grown there. The banana company comes to Macondo, separating the white settlement with a fence from the natives and mistreating the workers. In the end, however, everyone is forced to leave Macondo except the last remaining Buendia descendents who, embroiled in an incestuous love affair, fail to notice the danger of the storms or the fire ants to are always eating away at their house. It may sound depressing, but what it strikes the reader as most is as the unalterable flow of human history, a bleak cautionary tale. A great Oprah pick! A great buy! Another Amazon.com Quick Pick would be a startling novel by Tom Grimes with the difficult to remember title, WILL@epicqwest.com. Another reviewer mentioned, THE LOSERS' CLUB by Richard Perez. I enjoyed it, too, although it's quite modest. I'm not sure Oprah can cover all these novels -- but one never knows!"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I thought this book was alright. It is a good story with excellent insights into human nature. There are many truths about people and society ingeniously woven into the text. However, it is not a leisurely read, which I admit, I read way too often. Therefore, I began reading this book with the wrong attitude, which has probably tainted my opinion. Nonetheless, enjoying this book is hard work. It is very long and, in my opinion, very wordy at times. It is not one of those books that caused me to hang onto every word and read for hours on end because I couldn't wait to see what would happen next. There are also many characters who share similar names (many are named after each other) which gets confusing. Some of them are not mentioned for long stretches in the story, only to pop up again, making you ask, \\"And who was that again?\\" There is a family tree printed inside the cover which I had to refer to often. So, if you begin reading anticipating some mental stamina, you will probably enjoy it more than I."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Oftentimes, lengthy and detailed novels suffer from boring plots. But ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE is anything but boring. Once you opened it, you will become unaware of the time reading it. This book offers hundred reasons for you to wish it will not end. However, due to my incompetence to capture the thought of the genius behind this book, I can only give you a few of those reasons.1. Characters are vividly described. Each was carefully introduced by Garcia-Marquez in a way unforgettable to the reader--Real emotions, distinct personalities, and unique but intertwined experiences.2. Garcia Marquez tried to create a storyline of impossibilities to be unexpectedly believable. Myths, taboos and sins are included. But instead of defeating the popularity of the novel, those factors added spice, magic and uniqueness. Never this novel will fall under mediocrity.3. The author was able to give a balance in describing human and natural aspects. He succeeded in creating a psychological standpoint of his own and polishing this aspect using environmental descriptions. You will encounter statements digging to the mind and heart of the character. On the other hand, you will be impressed by the details he gave to the setting wherein the characters are amazingly connected with. For example, he gave a detailed description of the Buendia's house and at the same time captured the happenings of its dwellers.4. Symbols are proliferated in the novel. Through this, Garcia-Marquez gave the readers an opportunity to explore the story themselves, to think what caused this to happen and what happens next.5. The story is a web of emotions. It is like a roller-coaster ride of feelings (sadness, excitement, love, discoveries, happiness, and extreme solitude).ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE is surely a novel worth the Nobel Prize. It was able to capture hundred years of the lives of the Buendia family and is now sharing it to millions of readers of our time."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I was just reading the press release issued by the Nobel committee in '82 and I couldn't help remembering the sense of magical (yet tragic) surrealism that permeates through his writing.. the past, the present and the future all come together in an incredible, liquid mosaic that's simply mesmerizing. Both '100 years of solitude' and 'love in the time of cholera' are vivid and oh-so-alive. The historical feuds that have shaped the landscape of LatAm and the political, social turmoil of today all flow together as one surreal, mystic river and Marquez navigates the river like no one else."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Garcia-Marquez's masterpiece is the fountainhead of an entire genre (often termed magical realism), though it has yet to be duplicated. Getting into this style of book is remniscent of falling asleep - you can't do it if you try. Once you are comfortably into the book - which many people fail to achieve - reading it is much like a dream, which only ends when you reach the end of the book and awake from the reverie that Garcia-Marquez has created. This experience alone makes the book worthwhile.The story itself concerns the lives of several generations of the Buendia family, in the mythical town of Macando. The story is intensely cyclical, with the names, personalities, and fortunes of the townsfolk repeating again and again, from the foundation of the town until its bitter end. While at times confusing, the bewilderment the story creates adds to its dream-like effects.One Hundred Years of Solitude is an immensely satisfying book, and a literary experience like no other. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This lush book by Gabriel Marquez-rightly called by many his masterpiece- is a book which expolores the mythical town of Macondo through the eyes of the members of the Buendia family. From Jose Aracado, the founder of the town, who was a philosiphist to the second to last Aurelino, who finally discovered the secret of the old gypsy's papers, this story fludidly explores humans, as well as goverments and towns. While at times breathtakinly beautiful, at others rather mundane, and at others almost ridicolously fantastic, this is one of the most powerful books ever of the 20th century (and definatly shows that this author's later Nobel Prize was justly deserved for his collection of works.)This tale is almost like a series of tales which explores each of the members of this amazing- and yet realistic- family. Told in a third person narrative, Marquez tells the tale with little judgement- he works magic at letting the reader get close to the characters without passing insight or judgement on the protagonists so you almost forget that the narrative isn't told by the characters themselves.While the story at times may be confusing (manly in part that most of the characters have the same names), and outlandish, expecially if one isn't familar with the concept of magical realism (when something in an ordinary setting happens that wouldn't normally happen- i.e. while Remodios the Beauty, one of the characters ascends to heaven while helping hold out a sheet), it is one of the most poignant, most deep and sad storys of our time, and one which everyone should read, and everyone will enjoy at one point of their lives."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"If I read One Hundred Years of Solitude at any other time in my life, I would've hated it. Before I was diagnosed with breast cancer, my taste for books were more of the romantic, happy-ending, leave-them-feeling-good selection. I stayed away from the gritty, brutally realistic types of books, like this one. But now, I don't shy away from books that lead you to an inevitability of sadness and hopelessness, and this book is certainly that.One Hundred Years of Solitude is a story about the Buendia family, one of the founding families of the Macondo village. It opens with Jose Arcadio Buendia, the head of the Buendia family. He leads a group of people from their village in search of the sea. Unable to find it, they decide on an area to settle in and begin building their village, Macondo. From here, the author weaves the story and history of the Buendia Family. There are recurring themes, like curses, within the Buendia family: An unnatural attraction between certain male members of the family toward the female members; the boys who are named Jose Arcadio tend to be lazy, calculating, and shady; and boys named Aureliano are thinkers, intellectuals, rebels; and the women are strong, shrewd and very few of them marry. I'm sure there are other recurring themes that I've missed.The parallelism between the rise, prosperity, and fall of the Buendia family and Macondo is very striking. I'm not sure, however, what you can take from this story, assuming, of course, that there is something to learn from it. The writing, however, is beautiful, moving, and poignant, drawing you in to the storyline and coaxing you to empathize with its characters. The author's ability to blend realism with the supernatural is convincing.I recommend this book but with reservations. I think it will all have to depend on the type of reader you are. If you tend to avoid books with storylines that are heavy and coarse, especially when they end in a \\"everyone-dies-tragically-in-the-end\\" type ending, then this is another book to avoid."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I don't want to spend time explaining the plots or merits of this book. I couldn't do them justice anyway. I just want anyone out there who hasn't read this book to know that it would be an absolute travesty to die having never read it. I've read it three times in English and once in Spanish and I never once got tired of it. I have a bachelor's degree in Literature and will soon be atending grad school. I've read a fair amount of stuff, and this book is without comparison. I'm telling you people, READ THIS BOOK, love it, and then read it again."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"As an author with my debut novel in its initial release and an educator in an impoverished border-area high school with a student population usually 99% Latino, I can safely say that Gabriel Garcia Marquez's ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE is among the most common book recommendations I make to my most gifted students. ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE rests near the top of last century's literary works. It is the perfect example of magical realism, and it practically introduced Latin American literature to the world scene. This book is tops. If you haven't read it, do!"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Although I liked some aspects of One Hundred Years of Solitude, I do have some bones to pick with it.For one, I don't like the way Marquez tells the story. It is not in chronological order. To be honest this isn't my favorite way of telling a story but that isn't the worst part. What really bugs me about it is the fact that he spoils his future events. Not by foreshadowing but by blatantly telling you what will happen later in the story.Another problem is his sentence structure. Some of them were quite long. I like highly expressive writing styles and complicated sentences, but Marquez does it all wrong. There was one particular one that started more than half way up page 348 and ended at almost the bottom of page 350. Now call me cynical, but that sentence was pretty much a short story in itself. Needless to say I didn't like his sentence structure. (I highly doubt that this extremely long sentence was made with the translation since Marquez complimented Rabassa on his work and even said he preferred the English version of his novel.)I must say I did enjoy the actual story and the message that Marquez was giving. He was very symbolic and I liked that part of the novel.In all I think that One Hundred Years of Solitude was good but not the best. If you're curious about my favorite novel, here it is: the unabridged version of The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This book is on my top five list. I come from a Latin American background, and this book manages to create the feeling of being in Latin America and living with a Latin American family. The thought patterns, the logic, and the ready acceptance of extraordinary things are all so familiar to me, and yet I never would have been able to verbalize or recognize them had I not read this book. This is a classic...it should be required reading for all students. It is amazing."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I had never read any of Marquez's works before I read this novel as an English assignment. Once I actually got into the novel, I found myself stuck inside the village of Macondo day and night, until I finished the book. The writing, while incredibly descriptive and beautiful, tends to leave me wondering where the end of the sentence is. Another drawback is that you can't find anything in the novel, unless it's the ending, which is a bit unnerving in and of itself. However, I loved the way Marquez wove us in and out of reality, playing on our senses, presenting us with incredible feats of magic while we readers sat there, drinking it all in like greedy children."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"One of the most compelling scenes in &quot;100 Years&quot; is Arcadio stuck against the wall, shot within Rebeca's horrified glance. Aureliano escapes by the intervention of Jose Arcadio, who in turn is shot by Rebeca. The trickle of blood has trailed in its seventeen-verb course through town to be discovered by Ursula just as she is about to separate the thirty-six eggs for the baking bread. Then Ursula like Theseus follows the trail in reverse, discovering both victim and murderer. As readers we too pursue a trail of clues to unravel the family saga.Both firing squad scenes form a gruesome irony on a potent symbol of Hispanic culture, the ubiquitous crucifix. Somehow I had not expected to witness, as reader, either of those scenes. It is almost a &quot;Ben Hur&quot; effect, that the witnessing of an execution sets one to thinking and in his case believing. On the other hand, Aureliano appears to be the main protagonist, and thus his death is hard to believe in, despite all the foretellings. Several of those little warnings deviate to the effect of &quot;years later, when he was an old man,&quot; so that his death by firing squad is incongruous. But other &quot;facts&quot; we accept have already been violated and therefore it is not impossible.There is something amusing about breaking oneself away from &quot;100 Years,&quot; ending at Ursula's comment upon getting a letter from Aureliano in Cuba that he will spend Christmas at &quot;the remote ends of the earth,&quot; to turn to Alexander Humboldt's real-life &quot;Voyage to the Equatorial Regions&quot; from the Canaries across the Atlantic to some of the very places (whichever they are) traversed by Aureliano. Indeed, &quot;100 Year&quot;'s insistence on anonymity of place (except for the obviously fictitious Macondo) implies its events can happen practically anywhere in South America. The not infrequent mention of the Caribbean, the seasonal rains and the tropical forests specifically suggest southern Venezuela or Brazil or anywhere within Garcia Marquez's Colombian homeland.Even so, we should not take geophysical signs too literally in this work. The very mixture of alleged facts allows us to conceive of a Pan American (or Pan South American) ethos, a world of chaos in which the whole world is one's own tiny village, in which one's life is but a process in an entire generation and an entire genealogy. In turn, the genealogy is played out in the entire lineage, each individual living out both the past and the future.Then, too, Garcia Marquez forces us to examine our own assumptions of reality and civilization, to examine microscopically every detail we consider normal and reassess it from every angle. What are familial relations? What is war? What is communication? What is love? What is peace? What is the development of a town? What is manly honor and womanly virtue? What is philosophy? What is a noble idea vs. a silly charlatanism?All these and more are facets of life that he turns upside down and inside out -- the priestly levitation is one of the more literal examples -- to reveal ever more intimacy of the individuals involved and ever more that makes us question our very selves. To read Garcia Marquez is to journey into the heart of oneself, even as Humboldt travels into the very geographical territory of Garcia Marquez. It is a fascinating quest, each author enriching the other and both enriching me. Garcia Marquez assembles such an oddball amalgam of verisimilitude in the details, while at the same time presenting such an outrageous sequence of events, that the whole notion of history and of fiction (as in Borges) is called into question.It is interesting to see how the people of Macondo hear war and rumors of war from all parts, how contradictory reports reach them, only to be reversed by even more mutually contradictory notices. All of that is so typical of a world without mass media, yet to turn on CNN and read a newspaper account or two creates the same chaos. The only difference is the quality of the presentation, the so-called reliability of the sources. It is just a game whose sophistication has been improved, not -- I think -- its essence.At the same time of the limited communication of Macondo, Humboldt reveals his marvel at the wonders of &quot;modern progress and civilization&quot; (c. 1800) that allow residents of the remotest pampas of Argentina to communicate via mail with their fellow espanoles in Mexico and Florida. Together, these two concepts of communication, occurring more or less simultaneously since the war in &quot;100 Years&quot; seems to happen just after the great south American revolutions, comprise a dramatic irony to the state of mail I find in today's Venezuela. To send a letter from Caracas to Punto Fijo (some 200 miles) sometimes takes thirty days, while in Humboldt's day a twice-monthly trip was made from Buenos Aires to Spain. In &quot;100 Years&quot; news often travels faster, but always with a question of reliability. The supreme irony is that all is already foretold, right back at home.This is a book I will read over and over again to savor the richness of its poetic tones and the multiple layers of ironic and dramatic richness. It is like an English trifle, to be visually admired as a whole then to be nibbled away at in bites, each time savoring a new flavor and an unexpected taste"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"If the 4th of July was every day, day in and day out, I think we would all get pretty dang sick of fireworks. That pretty much describes how I feel about Marquez and this book; it is a parade that lasts hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of pages, and an endless display of literary aesthetic achievements.If, however, you can remember back to the days of the \\"Where's the Beef?\\" ads, you might understand my irritation at a flawlessly written novel that lacks a cohesive idea - even a thread of one - to unify all the beauty contained therein. Is this book a masterpiece? Undoubtedly, for its perfection of style and flavor. Could it have been more? Could Marquez have added substance to his style? Much more?Sadly, yes."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"There appears to be a good many who support this book, but none that actually ilustrates explicitly its hidden gem or genius, if there is indeed any. personally i don't see why it's so fantastic. the suspension of fixed parameters and a \\"realistic\\" framework in general seems to be an easy way to avoid the more prosaic elements and ensuing entanglements in life, and may also be construed as a rather cheap method to beguile readers into a seeming style and artistry."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Whenever one looks into Colombian literature, Marquez is always mentioned as being the best writer in the country. Needless to say, I can enjoy symbolism, but the amount in this book will confuse even the most advanced readers.After finishing this book and being confused at it's ending, I had to look up what the point of the book was. Only then did I find out that this story represents Colombia's history. That will already leave a large number of readers asking what is going on, including Colombians since I'm one myself who has read extensively on the country's history.For example, the house represents Colombia's political stance. No one is going to comprehend this because Marquez just leaves the reader guessing as to what each thing represents. Even the red ants symbolize something although I've yet to figure it out.Marquez wrote a decent novel in which only he can understand. I can just as easily make up a story symbolizing anything in my mind, but if others don't comprehend it, than what is the point? The book is overated by people who mistake complexity for being excellent writing. Just because no one can understand what you say, don't necessarily mean that what you be saying is deep.Magical realism was also abused in this book and Marquez just seems to use it at the end of the novel to finish it off quickly but with many questions unanswered."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Garcia Marquez is easily the world's greatest living manipulator of language. His words are beautiful in Spanish and well-translated into English here."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"To me, Gabriel Garcia Marquez' brilliant One Hundred Years of Solitude is best classified as a fairy tale for adults: after all, what is magical realism (which critics have tagged as Marquez' style) but an attempt to take magical fairy tale elements and make them seem real to adults?But whatever you want to call it, One Hundred Years of Solitude has earned the prestige that the decades have bestowed upon it. All the elements of a great story are in it: love, passion, hope, tragedy, hope out of tragedy, and finally the affirmation of life's goodwill. The village of Macondo, and the Buendias family that founded, defined, affected, cursed, and charmed it, are in a way a world where all human emotion and meaning coexist or do battle. The power of their passions live on after the deaths of some of their characters in this beautiful dream-logic universe.One warning: there may be confusion when it comes to the characters' names. There are multiple Jose Aurelianos and Remedios, among others. Fortunately, there's a geneaology chart at the beginning of the book to help you along.In any event, don't let the first few chapters intimidate you. It does all make sense, magical sense, in the long run.Rocco Dormarunno, author of The Five Points"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I am dismayed to see that some people have given such a negative review to this novel, I think in great part it is because they don't understand or appreciate the intricacy of the novel. This is by no means an easy read, but after all you don't look for greatness in airport novels...If you are a serious reader interested in finding one of the best book ever written then look no further. Marquez manages to create a whole new world in his novel, one that will live on and stand the test of time.The other recommendation I can make is that if you know Spanish then try to read it in its original language, one of the greatest things about Marquez is his mastery of the language. Every sentence feels like a delightful adventure.If there is only one book you will ever read in your life, then this should be it, pure and simple."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"The best way for me to describe this book is that it's a very long folklore tale. That seems to be the simplestdiscription of Magical Realism. You can hear it in your head, being passed down between the generations. Eachchapter feels like it represents one story that is told at one sitting; they compound on each other to make thiswonderful story complete.The fantastic elements of this story take on mythic qualities; explaining those things in the world that seem to beunexplainable without the notion of some kind of spiritual intervention. The characters in the book, as well as thereader, must have faith that these explanations are true or else the story is nothing but a passionate fable.Be prepared when reading this book: GGM is a gifted writer. Every sentence is full of discription andinformation that must be savored in order the grasp its complexity. Not one idea is out of place; every word isdeliberate. This translation is pain-stakingly good, as well.It may take a while to get into this book - give it time. The end is well worth the effort. Also, keep a flag on theBuendia Family Tree as the names and lineages will get a little confusing!"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"No, the story doesn't exactly have a plot, but more of a collection of fantastic stories of each member of a large family through generations. Each character has their own obsession, problem, passion, or insanity. You get to follow generations through almost supernatural events. All the while there is something much bigger happening, and Marquez succeeds in bringing it all together beautifully in the end. This book has the best ending I have ever read that left me absolutely awestruck and weeping as I was devastated that the adventure was over."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This book is not for those who only loved the Chicken Soup for the Soul series. No, this one's for the strong individual. If you have trouble living outside the block - don't touch this one. This one will take you through a journey, with a family through a period of hundred years. The characters are real,raw,blooded,bold,beautiful-people as they should've been before the great civilizations marred our brains with less significant worries. This one is a fantasy with characters you're only dreamed of , if ever. I would recommend it to those who have done a great deal of reading already and not someone checking out on some classics."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"My husband gave me this book our first Christmas together. He told me it was his favorite book ever, and hoped I enjoyed it as much as he did. I many times opened the book and read the first line, &quot;...as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendia...&quot; and thought, oh no, a war book, I can't bear it. Well now after 10 years of marriage and 3 kids I've taken the time to get past the first paragraph and can't believe I didn't previously give this masterpiece a chance. This is a brilliantly written work about so much more than a soldier, it's about love, hate, and all of the emotions in between in all human relationship. I found the characters to all be well-defined and diverse so that any person reading this book could identify with any one of the many characters. The magic-reality aspect is particularly well-done for an audience outside of Latin America to accept, not necessarily easy for many Latin American books to achieve. In short, give this book a chance to change your perspective; you'll find it is worth the time."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"To write a negative review of a book widely regarded as a classic is a somewhat intimidating task. But let me try.A statement of personal taste first. The label of \\"magic realism\\" is, to me, a positive lure, and is one of the reasons that I picked up this book. I have a great love of other writers, like Borges, who blur the lines of realism and fantasy and fable and metaphor. My favorite contemporary writer of all, Steven Millhauser, I would consider to be a \\"magic realist\\" even though I have not heard others use the term.On an intellectual level, Garcia Marquez's book has an obvious cohesion. It appears to mimic the great religious texts of old, such as the Book of Genesis. The town of Macondo, as the world in Genesis, is provided with a founding myth. Various fantastical things take place, the realistic superficial world uneasily overlays a magic-based otherworld; boys are born with pigtails, others are born with unnatural large genitalia, gypsies roll into town bearing every manner of magical device.And, as in Genesis, events pile upon events; just as in Genesis the reader is subjected to a never-ending series of \\"begats,\\" in Marquez's book, one is treated to an indistinguishable and never-ending list of people named Aureliano (and several other similarly overused names.) This is intentional, to confuse the reader, to cause them to wonder which Aureliano is doing what, and to contemplate how this world is often stuck in repeating the same comedies and tragedies over and over.Some things are uniquely Latin American in the tale; you can see in the book a certain fatalistic attitude towards the region's political troubles, the suggestion that there is little higher meaning in them, rather a culture that is doomed to repeat the same old stories until that world eventually dissolves.But here's the problem: it's really boring reading, and it lacks the spark of other magic realism. Quite willfully, the author never brings any personalities to life; they exist as archetypes, one-dimensional figures, actors in an endlessly recurring play. So too with the \\"magic\\" events; there is really very little magic in them, at least insofar as they inspire any sense of same in the reader.I finished the book having reached the conclusion that it should have been a short story, not a full-length novel. You get the sense later on that the author is simply going through the motions, having decided on his superstructure for the book, he executes it with little feeling of inspiration or concern for the emotive or sensory power of literature that attracts readers.Which is to say, if you find reading Genesis boring, with its endless \\"begats,\\" you will probably find this boring as well. It is a flat, mechanically generated place, an intellectual comment on the world rather than a compelling, enjoyable piece of literature.Some of the other comments here suggest that most people will dislike the book, but few will love it, even as they give it high ratings. I believe that to be fair; I have friends who enjoy the book. I found it labored and the reading of it laborious."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"There is so much about this book to comment on that it is better for me to keep my comments simple. Yes, it is a difficult book to read and many times I felt myself very confused over who was who and about what was going on. I suppose if you are someone who doesn't want a challenge and you want things very clear and uncomplicated, then this book may not be for you. However, the magical realism does not take away from the absolute beauty and emotion of this book. After reading the book I was in awe of how anyone's writing could be so complicated and so beautiful! I honestly think it is one of the best books ever written and I have read a ton of books! I recently purchased Marquez's newest book (I believe it is his autobiography?) and cannot wait to read it."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"The negative reviewers here seem, more or less, to want this book to move faster, or get to some kind of specific point, and are upset that it doesn't. So I'll make this suggestion, if you are reading to get to the end of a book, don't read this book; you won't deserve it. Read a Michael Chrichton book or something. On the other hand, if you are willing to be swept into an epic story that is written (and translated) with style and grace, plotted with a mature sense of wonder, and will make you weep, laugh, and seethe with anger, then read this one.No matter how many times I reach the last page of this book, I never feel like I've &quot;finished&quot; it. it always pulls me right back into it."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"First, a foreward:I was initially struck by the difference in reviewer opinions between those who read the \\"oprah\\" edition, and those who reviewed the regular edition. The Oprah edition contains a much higher percentage of 1 and 2 star reviews, with the most common complaints being \\"confusing\\" and \\"depressing.\\" Then I realized what it is: one review actually begins with the statement \\"I usually love anything our girl Oprah says to love.\\" You see, most great literature requires you to think (gasp!); it's not there to boost your self-esteem, and it most likely will not end with a million hearts wrapped inside a teddy bear holding a bouquet of understanding in one hand and an undying torch of reassurance in the other, so that you can feel like everything is perfect in the world. If your mental faculties have become so atrophied from reality tv show exposure that you cannot think for yourself and need a talk show host to tell you how to live your life, then you may want to avoid this book. But enough of my arrogant, pseudo-intellectual rant; now for a little about the book:There is a legend Gabriel Garcia Marquez likes to tell about the writing of his most famous novel, One Hundred Years of Solitude. He claims that he wrote the book barricaded in his study in Mexico, after receiving a vision. One day, while he and his wife and children were in their car driving to Acapulco, he saw that he \\"had to tell [his] story the way his grandmother used to tell hers, and that [he] was to start from that afternoon in which a father took his child to discover ice.\\" He made an abrupt U-turn on the highway, the car never made it to Acapulco, and he locked himself in his study. Fifteen months later, he emerged with the manuscript, only to meet his wife holding a stack of bills. They traded papers, and she put the manuscript in the mail to his publisher.Like everything Marquez writes, there is some truth and much fiction in this tale. The truth in the tale is that One Hundred Years of Solitude is a very personal book for the author. It would not have been written if he had not experienced the childhood he had. Marquez grew up with his maternal grandparents in Aracataca, Colombia. His grandparents were cousins who moved to Aracataca from Riohacha at the end of the War of a Thousand Days (1899-1902), a few years before a leafstorm. Marquez's childhood anecdotes tell of a big house full of ghosts, conversations in code, and relatives who could foretell their own deaths. It was also a house filled with guests and social events, shaded by almond trees and bursting with flowers. When Marquez's grandfather died, Marquez was sent to live with his parents. In his grandfather's absence, his grandmother, who was blind, could no longer keep up the house. It fell into a state of ruin, and red ants destroyed the trees and flowers. Also early in his childhood, Marquez witnessed the massacre of striking banana workers (workers at a plantation named Macondo) at a train station. The government made every attempt to block information from the public and pacify the foreign plantation owners. Marquez was horrified, and even more horrified when he reached high school and learned that the event had been deleted from his history textbook.Careful readers of One Hundred Years of Solitude will recognize many of these elements in the book; there is no doubt that if Marquez had not grown up in Aracataca and had a keen ear, the novel would not exist. On one hand, the context for the book is Marquez's own personal nostalgia- for childhood, for his grandparents, for a big house filled with ghosts and laughter. On the other hand, the context for the book is Marquez's political beliefs and the oft-brutal realities of growing up in a particularly tumultuous developing country. Growing up in Colombia, which has a long and tragic socioeconomic history, Marquez learned about politics and economics early on. In his conversations with other Latin American writers he developed his own theoretical views about writing and politics. He often claims \\"The first duty of a writer is to write well\\"(implying that writing must not be polemical) but there is no doubt that the economic history of Latin America, which is a history of inequality and exploitation, has had a crucial impact on all of his writing.Marquez's approach to writing One Hundred Years of Solitude- combining his own memories and imagination with focused aesthetics and an eye for the tragic history of his country- has had an immeasurable impact on writers of color worldwide. Coming at the time it did, in the midst of a boom in Latin American writing, it was immediately recognized as one of the finest, if not the finest, offerings from that period. More importantly, it crossed every boundary to becoming an international bestseller and worldwide phenomenon. Even Latin American writers who found fault with it could not deny that it had directed the attentions of the literary world to Latin America.In much of the world, the unimaginably old coexists with the unbearably new. For writers conscious of straddling two cultures, nostalgia for a simpler, primitive past vies with wonder at the persistence of habits of thought, patterns of life, and modes of belief that surely ought to be extinct, mere harmless fossils. Garcia Marquez turned puzzlement or outrage into ironic wonder, and he enhanced the strangeness of the real. Today, we see his influence in such celebrated writers as America's Toni Morrison, India (and England)'s Salman Rushdie, and Trinidad's V.S. Naipaul."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Just recently, I decided to give this book a second chance. Like other reviewers here, I hardly ever give up on a book. But about 30 pages into the SECOND attempt, I am feeling exhausted. All of the bright and shiny books on my bookshelves have never looked so good at this point. So I came here, read the reviews and feel better. I think I can put this book away and be at peace with not appreciating it. I will say, some of the words Marquez uses- his descriptions, seem to have been created especially for the world that exists within this book. But is the trip worth it? I have decided that it is not.

Perhaps it lost something in translation (although I don't think I'll be attempting to read it in Spanish anytime soon!), or maybe I just had trouble with the non-chronological ordering of events (I like my stories to be linear!).

He tells us the story of the Buendia family, presented, as is his usual style, within the dualities of fantastic magic realism and a these-are-the-facts journalist voice. Marquez seems to transcend the concept of scene as he jumps from one point in the history of Maconda to another without warning, but the prose never loses its storyteller's focus nor its steady gaze into the lives of the characters.This is a wonderful novel for those who appreciate literature as art, and for readers who want to stretch their limits and become immersed in a fully realized fictional community. Personally, I would also enjoy casually reading this novel, but it's certainly not for the faint of heart, or someone who is reading merely to be entertained. I would suggest it for the human race as a whole, but don't think you're buying a Stephen King. This is difficult literature that demand a lot from it's reader.That said, this novel will impress you. As I read through it, I was constantly struck at the truth in Marquez's prose. There were counteless moments where I said aloud, \\"That is exactly what (X) feels like, in all of it's gritty complexity.\\" Or something akin to it, since I don't speak like a book critic in real life. One Hundred Years was an amazing journey for me; be prepared if you start it. It's addictive.And the ending is the most complete and gorgeous of any I have read."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"The first thing I thought of while reading the book was how much is reminded me of Middlesex by Jeffrey Eugenides. Obviously Solitude was written first. What I loved so much in Middlesex (family history, foreign country), I grew to enjoy in this book.What I think is crazy about the book is that the most frustrating parts of it the author included on purpose! For Example, everybody has the same name regardless of what generation they are from. The frustration of separating the characters was done on purpose to show much of the family's history and experieneces repeated.Another frustrating thing about the book was that it would skip around chonologically. This took a bit getting used to but became another example of the repeating of history.I was equally impressed to meet someone over the weekend that had read the book in spanish. I was VERY impressed. This book was great but at times I felt it a bit dificult. I needed a dictionary next to me while I was reading :)"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Gabriel has a unique talent of showing a whole new meaning for life.

Don't read on if you've not experienced the magic of this book. Draw your own conclusions; you're adults, no? That having been said:Oh for heaven's sake ... OK, for all of you whiners out there who complain bitterly about the novel containing so many similarly named characters, try this: It's a story about ONE MAN, ok? One man's life, from the mystery of ice to through the fecundity of youth/middle age to the senility of the childish couple, offspring carried away by ants and then carried away themselves by a whirlwind."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Gabriel Garcia Marquez has woven together a complex story of the human condition in his novel One Hundred Years of Solitude. It is at the same time a realistic history novel and a magical fantasy tale. Told through the lives of the Buendia family, the book chronicles one hundred years in the history of the ficitonal town of Macondo. The founding of Macondo picks up right after Genesis of the Bible with Jose Arcadio Buendia and his wife, Ursula. Their lives and influence are central to the novel and I soon found myself engrossed in the book.It is sometimes difficult to follow, as the Buendia family has a habit of conceiving children often and naming them after their elder family members. However, Garcia Marquez craftily uses this pattern to comment on the cyclical nature of history; that is, that history doesn't merely travel in a linear path, but goes back and repeats itself. Many times I found myself flipping to the front cover of the book, where there is printed a family tree. Without it, I think keeping track of the characters would be an impossibility. For example, Jose Arcadio Buendia and Ursula have sons named Jose Arcadio and Aureliano; their sons are named Arcadio and Aureliano Jose; the next generation includes sons named Aureliano Segundo and Jose Arcadio Segundo; the last of the sons are called Jose Arcadio and Aureliano. The women of the novel are not quite as difficult to remember, as they are named Remedios, Rebeca, Amaranta, Pilar Ternera, Santa Sofia de la Piedad, Fernanda del Carpio, Renata Remedios, and Amaranta Ursula. Still, the sheer number of characters in the novel makes it sometimes difficult to remember.Garcia Marquez manages to make his novel simultaneously a comedy and a tragedy as he weaves together his characters with heartbreak, civil war, love and lust. His characters find themselves in impossible and preposterous positions, but they so greatly reflect human emotions that they become real. Garcia Marquez's ridiculous situations and poignant observations of human conflict make this book a thoroughly interesting and enjoyable read. However, it is not to be approached lightly, as it takes great thought to understand the symbols of the novel. But if you discipline yourself to explore the lives of the Buendias, you will find a remarkable work of fiction that reflects the human spirit and fills you with both desperation and hope."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Far from being a novel yet a bible in the context of human history, this book tells much to all man kind. Once you finish the book, you would realize you're always alone even if you're living in a metropolis.The book is a story of a family who has lived in Macondo for about hundred years. The family started with mischief, which prevailed the fate of the family. But the family and Macondo vanished from the Earth when a baby was born with a pig tail.Bible tells about God's love towards human being; the book tells about the life of people who were deserted from God. Bible says about the Judgement of man kind; the book says about the suffering of deserted people. Bible is the promise of the uncertain salavation and Second Advent of Christ; the book is the story about the fate of deserted people who should suffer solitude even after dying.If you couldn't help but feel lonely, this book tells you why."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"If magic realism means magic in parts and mundanely real in other parts, then the book was faithful to that style. I must admit feeling cheated at the end to discover that what we had journeyed through was just Melquiade's script. On the whole, it was pretty laborious reading - even for a rapacious reader like me. The book is mainly a linear narrative punctuated only scantily by actual dialogue. This makes it rather tedious as you have to trudge through a lot of narration before you arrive at actual dialogue, something that deprives a lot of the characters of color. I think there is an optimum ratio of dialogue to narration that they preach in writing schools, but clearly Marquez is above those. Redundancy in the names of the characters greatly bottlenecks the fluidity of the texts. I kept wishing that he had named the characters uniquely because this style is not at all reader-friendly - and I don't care how illustrious and felicitated a writer you are supposed to be, it is just plain sadistic to foist that on unsuspecting readers. I guess I am not the first one to say that I had to keep reverting to the family tree to re-orient myself with the characters. It seems to be a signature of Marquez that his characters sexualities blossom pretty early. I read Love in the Time of Cholera some while back and this was the most disturbing of that book (okay aside from a senescent man's capering with a pre-pubescent child), until I realised it was a recurring feature in One Hundred Years too. I am still unsure if that's the magic or realism kicked in, or if I am just in a cultural warp. All that said, the reason I can't entirely trash the book is that Marquez's expressions and felicity with words in parts is exquisite. I am a sucker for masterstroke opening lines, and this book's opener will remain in my memory long after that of the characters has dissolved. So I do appreciate those vignettes of genius that emerge from what is otherwise an ordinary work that doesn't merit the rapture surrounding it."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This was my first encounter with the magical realism style and I love it!

As soon as I put the book down, all these questions started popping up in my head: was everything real or was it just a dream? What was Marquez'point?Even with these questions, Marquez' storytelling was superb. The dischord in narrative, the fantasy intermixed with reality and Marquez' political beliefs, make this book memorable. The surreal quality of the narrative is supposed to make us detached from the characters. It is this detachment that makes us ask, whether we are reading a history of the Buendia family or whether we are reading Melquiades' parchments; whether Macondo really existed or whether it was a figment of somebody's imagination.If you enjoyed reading this book, consider these other books to read:--&quot;Like Water for Chocolate&quot;--&quot;The House of Spirits&quot; by Isabel Allende--Anthology of Short stories by Borges"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Marquez's use of magical realism allows this novel its endless possibilities! While considered a great work of literature, I found this book to be easy to read. The only part I had trouble with was keeping everyone's similar-sounding names straight.

Since half the characters have the same name (actually, there are two names that repeat through the book), I would suggest to read it all in one or two weeks...it's easier to remember the names and small details - which are plenty, by the way. Its characters are well depicted, and show the difference between anglo-saxon and latin characters. Also, the sensuality of the latin novel is quite well represented in this book, though it main focus is far more broad than sensuality. Comparing the sensual passages with - say - those from Henry Miller, is quite enlightening...While the second is objective and raw, the former brings the reader a richer experience."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"It took me until I was 21 years old until I finally read this novel.

When I got to the last page, I started the book over again just like I was turning the next page. Upon second reading, the storyline (which admittedly can be confusing) made more sense. The only complaint I have about the book is that characters first names are all so similar that the reader must continually consult the family tree at the beginning of the book. The book is an astonishing achievement of literature, and the reader must be willing to suspend belief and be challenged. For me, this book was a bit like water: fluid and moving, reflecting, rushing or still. It has so many qualities that are had to put words to. Also, the story has a very timeless quality to it in that the reader is forced to be completely present with the story; one can truly only be with this book one glorious sentence at a time."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"One of my favorites as a child, and one of the novels that led me into studying foreign literature.

It tells the story of lovesick Florentino, who has waited for the love of his life, Fermina, for 50 years. Fermina was married to Dr. Juvenal Urbino and therefore unavailable. Their love story began through letters. But then Fermina rejects Florentino because she feels their relationship was naive. She is forced to marry Dr. Urbino by her father. When Dr. Urbino dies, Florentino comes back into Fermina's life and tells her he has waited for her all these years. Then, their correspondence continues and their love grows again.Garcia Marquez has written an amazing love story that employs elements of magical realism. This only make the story better and even more amazing. This love story is as no other, and only Garcia Marquez could have written such an amzing book. The characters are so well written that they come alive in the pages of this book.I read the book in Spanish and I reccommend that if you understand Spanish, to read this book in its original language. Although the English translation is good, I feel the Garcia Marquez touch, the \\"it\\" that makes this story what it is may get lost in the translation.This is a book that everyone should read and I cannot reccommend it enough."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"One Hundred Years of Solitude is the novel we compare all attempts at Latin American magical realism to. In this book Marquez perfectly executes the requirements of the genre, making sure that the more unrealistic elements are used purposefully, not just to shock or confuse (although I do understand some readers' initial disgust with several incestuous encounters and with the scene in which red ants are carrying away an infant). Nothing is done randomly is this novel, the characters, events, stories and dialogue tie together to prove the strength of the Buendia family bond.Just about everyone should be able to find thematic elements to interest them in this dense, lengthy novel. Violence and war, success and defeat, love and loss, friends and enemies, loyalty and betrayal, tradition and innovation and, above all else, the role of the family. Marquez's style allows for humor to coincide with very serious, grave emotions and events.A novel everyone who considers themselves \\"a reader\\" should read."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This is a marvelous book that remind's me in both style and message ofAmerica's Keenest City, by Mongo.

Marquez enlightens us about Latin America and Mongo about North America."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I picked this book up simply for the photograph of Gabriel Garcia Marquez on the back, which I found very eloquent. Yet all the way through the novel, I couldn't quite understand why he won the Nobel Prize for Literature--I thought it was a good novel, yes, but a great novel . . .Then I came to the last page--in fact, the last sentence. I have never found so much meaning explosively packed into a single sentence in anything else I have read. Marquez manages to make every smallest detail of the novel pertinent to the reader and to the human experience, when that last sentence fires through your circuits like a bomb going off.I'm not usually one for the surreal in literature--but I can not think of another medium that could so perfectly depict the truths that Marquez has to offer. This book can be frustrating at times, but is more than worthwhile to read all the way through."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Gabriel Garcia Marquez has written many interesting and beautiful books about his native Colombia. This is, pardon the expression, the granddaddy of them all. It tells the story of the Buendia family who left a town near the coast and traveled through the mountains to found the town of Macondo in the interior of the country.The plot tells the story of several generations of the family and chronicles, in an almost off-hand way, the revolutions/civil wars that plagued Colombia throughout its history, the amazements of invention and technology of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the strength and drama of family, and of course the romance in life.If this is the first Garcia book you read, it will take some time to get used to the book. The characters have similar names, and the story twists and turns through time, going back and forth almost at will. The characters and the author all accept magical events as commonplace. A few of the deeper thoughts may be difficult to understand; I know there were some sentences that were too deep for me. But, above all, you will be charmed by the beautiful writing, engrossed by the plot and in love with the world that Garcia creates."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I read this book In spanish for my AP Spanish class when I was a junior in high school and now that I am a college junior I still think it is one of the best books that I ever read.

It takes you through a journey that swings between being far-fetched and absolutely real and passionated. Sometimes you're going to be confused, sometimes you're going to feel dizzy, but the thing that will always remain is that belly titillation that something great and marvellous is happening, 'cause every single detail, every single event in &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot; is moving, weird, and most of all, simple. Dive into one of the most important latinamerica (and maybe worldwide) writers of the twentieth century. One piece of advice, though: try to find somewhere in the internet the Buend&iacute;a Family Genealogical Tree, or try to figure it out while you are reading. This because sometimes it may get a little confusing, due to the male characters' names (they are all named Arcadios, Jose Arcadios and/or Aurelianos)."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I stumbled upon this book quite by accident and without meaning to, rediscovered the world around me. That's what truly great literature can do; transcend its status and color a person's view of the world like some life changing event, a birth or a death.Clearly I have personal feelings towards this book, but, to put it simply, this is the novel that made me love literature. In the past I appreciated good writing. I had my degree in English, was prepared to throw down over Moby Dick as needed, but I never loved literature until I discovered the Buendia's and Macondo.What I had been missing was what so many modern writers fail to get across-the mystery of life. Garcia-Marquez solves no riddles and answers no questions. In fact, he doesn't really ask any questions. That's not why he writes. On the contrary, Garcia-Marquez is just a simple storyteller, plying his trade, lolling around in the melodrama of life."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"It may seem like a glib comparisson, but really 100 years of solitude is a lot like a Latin American literary version of the Simpsons. The book is deliciously fast pased. Like a good Simpsons episode it's jam-packed with bizarre events, so many they jump at you almost faster than you can take them all in. Just like you can watch a Simpsons two or three times and always find something new that had escaped you the first time, you can read Solitude many times over and it's always seems fresh, there's always something new waiting for you there that you'd missed the first time around in the great storm of occurrances.Just like the Simpsons paints a disturbingly true-to-life picture of contemporary American life, Solitude is a great running allegory of Latin America. No single element of it can be described as realistic, but the overall effect is a remarkably lifelike feel for the cultural feel of the region. Of course, everyone knows that no Nuclear Plant worker is as incompetent as Homer, but the caricature of his incompetence captures a facet of American tolerance for mediocrity we can all recognize, and does it far more effectively than a more direct representation could have. No one in Latin America can eat 8 cows in a 4 day binge like one of the Aurelianos does, but the way the scene is written gives you a sense for a specifically Latin American attitude towards the Feast that is both factually wrong and metaphorically perfect.Also, the book is just as much fun as a good Simpsons episode. Like the real master that he is, Garcia Marquez won't make you choose between great art and great entertainment: here, you get both.The only part where the metaphor really breaks down is that Garcia Marquez explores melancholy, bitterness, and just plain sadness in a way that American prime time TV could never get away with. There's a deeply human quality to the suffering, the solitude of most of characters in the book that's never watered down, and it's intersperced with the scenes of great joy rather than canceled out by them."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This book is a spell, 100 years long but its never broken. I've heard the term magic realism a million times but never have heard it defined in any way that includes more than one book at a time. Every Latin American writer is very different. Perhaps the term was useful when the Latin boom occurred(as a way of referring to a new group of writers) but now it seems kind of meaningless. This book is magical though in that everything from natural phenomenon to supernatural phenomenon is told in the same river long sentences and every unlikely thing seems perfectly natural. The realism part is perhaps the fact that Garcia-Marquez is addressing very real issues like History though with a very unreal fable. You can enjoy this as a kind of imaginative feast which takes you into a kind of Midsummer Nights Dream of a world and you can let yourself just let it all flow by and through your mind like a dream some poet is transmitting to you directly which is a highly recommended way of enjoying this, as art. Or you can pay mind to the themes, mostly tragic, that run through this and realize that the reason the author chose to write in such a way was to supply his world with a continuity, a story, that his country did not provide. Any way you read it some of the events told will remain in memory long after the book has been loaned to someone else(the arrival of ice to the village). It is a beautiful book. It seems light while you are reading it but the power of the book builds and builds and the ending is quite remarkable. Easily one of the top ten books of the last fifty years if not one hundred."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I've often heard that authors have to hook the reader within the first ten pages or else. This is the first book that ever hooked me in the first sentence. A great story told by a master teller with a wonderful translator. I only wish I read Spanish so that I might experience this novel in its original form. Garcia Marquez is the only writer whom I've read who could pull off &quot;magical realism&quot;. This is Garcia Marquez's finest book."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Some books I recommend because I enjoyed them, or thought they were funny. Others are works of art, crafted by a genius mind. I give you Gabriel Garcia Maquez and his 100 Years of Solitude, an etheral, dreamlike story of the founding family of a small town lost in the jungles of Columbia. Often comic and surreal, but strangely believable at the same time, this Nobel Prize winning book is inexplicably brilliant. Totally blew my mind! Don't miss it."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I was born in Colombia and the first time I read this book I was 9. Of course it took me almost one year to finish it and I didn't understand it very well. Over the years I've read it other 15 times in spanish and this is the first time I read it in english. Everytime I read it I found new things, new characters, new words, more magic, more about South American people, more about my culture. That's why I want to thank the people who took the time to investigate about Colombia, its history, its people, its culture, its geography, etc. It is almost impossible to read this book and understand it without knowing all this background. When you read this book a door opens between you and a magic world, that, even though never existed, is so close to reality than it can trap you for life. I don't know how many times I'm going to read it again, but it's always a pleasure to open any page and start reading. It is never a repetition because you never know if you'll find something else. Apparently the story itself evolutes with you through the years. READ IT AGAIN!!!!!"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"When I first picked up this book to read, it was because I was frankly quite intrigued by Salman Rushdie's 'Midnight's Children' and wanted to know more about Magic Realism. Until I finished this book, I could not get an inkling of what the author had tried to convey. On the surface, it seemed to me that this was the story, albeit an unusual one, of the life of a family, with a town in the background. It began as a small settlement and grew into a town and finally got destroyed in a Biblical storm. The story was narrated like a fairy tale, with a minimum of dialogues and apparently very little attention to the intricate details of characterization that you normally find in other great novels. And then, other novels don't generally span five generations and even if they do, don't evoke such phantasmagoric imagery. In a nutshell, I was confused.The first thing that made me sit up and take notice was the imagery that the climax evoked. The part where Aureliano (the protagonist at that time) deciphers the parchments that chronicle the life of the family, and deciphers the lines that describe him in the act of deciphering them, and then realizes that he would never leave the room after he has finished... I was reminded of something I had heard about a man's life flashing before him an instant before his death. The pieces began to fall in place - the phrase &quot;the house of mirrors (or mirages)&quot; took on a new, and much more significant meaning in the scheme of things. The whole story began to appear to me in an entirely new light then.I realized then that 'One Hundred Years of Solitude' was not a novel about Latin America, or about a town or about a family - it was about a human being's life, from infancy till death. It was about the different things that he discovers about the world and about himself at various stages of his life - the excited discovery of the outside world in his childhood, the youthful vigour of adolescence, the kaleidoscopic stages of adulthood, the serenity of old age, and that last breath of life, vigour and stormy consciousness before death.It was an experience as enthralling as life itself is. The book is always at the back of my mind - every day reveals something new about the book that had been hitherto undiscovered. This book is a constant voyage of discovery - a must read for anyone who is looking for a meaning to existence."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"First published in Argentina in 1967, this novel has captivated millions of readers through the years. I'm glad to say that now I've joined their ranks. I've never seen magic realism, the essence of Latin American fiction, done so well. The story drew me in and held me fast for its full 458 pages. All this was done without one wasted word or one moment when my interest lapsed. The book is pure fiction in every sense of the word. Right from the beginning I knew that things couldn't have happened the way they did. But I was so enchanted with the author's use of poetic imagery and storytelling ability, that I found it hard to put the book down. And when I did, the images lingered, forcing me to think about them well beyond the scope of the story.This is the tale of the rise and fall of a mythical town somewhere in South America founded by the Jose Arcadio Buendia family. It follows the town and its people for 100 years and I was glad there was a family tree printed at the front of the book because many of the characters had the same, or similar names. We meet gypsies and soldiers and circus performers. We see a beautiful woman disappear into the sky. We see blood from a suicide travel miles down a street. We see copulation both within and outside of marriage. We meet a woman who chooses a lifetime of virginity. We see hard work and self-indulgence. There's a rainstorm that lasts four years. And an illness that keeps people awake for months. There's the impact of the railroad and a banana plantation. There is a war that rages for years and years. There is death by firing squad or senility. Some of the people live as long as 120 years or more. There's a lot of sadness. And the conclusion is brutal. Yet, so much of it the book is so comic that I laughed out loud at times. Always, however, there is the central theme of solitude. Every character, in one way or another, lives in his or her own isolation. And, believe it or not, it all seems real.I loved this book. It was a delicious refuge to take me out of my ordinary world and let me experience this mini-masterpiece. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This book was a bit of a slow start for me, but once it got ahold, it wouldn't let go; I couldn't wait to come upon the next marvelous insight or memorable phrase like \\"he had peeped into the abyss of greatness\\" or \\"children inherit their parents' madnesses.\\" There were no characters quite up there in the first tier of fictional acquaintances in my memory (hence four stars instead of five), but I left this book with reinvigorated faith in the ability of literature to transcend geography and time, the good judgment of the Nobel literary committee, and the conviction that the best fiction can teach us more than life itself."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"It is simply breath-taking. Hunker down for the long haul. This is not an easy read, but it is magical. It is everything that we still wish existed in our cold, scientific, rational world and everything we are thankful does not. Beautifully written, it is a lesson for our times that all civilizations must have an end and that even the most technologically advanced and, dare I say, civil can only be repetitions of what has already been. We, as the citizens of Macondo, simply do not recognize it through the passing of years. It is a hard and yet stunning look at the reality of humanity."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Where to start? Gabriel Garcia Marquez is a genius. This is absolutely the finest novel I have EVER read. I keep rereading it because I like it so much. It must be known that I am usually an objective, discerning reader. I don't call many books &quot;great,&quot; but in this case I have no proper words for the quality of this novel. Thank you, Mr. Marquez, for giving us such a beautiful piece of literature!"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I just love this author. Ihave read everything he has written, in english at least, and this and 'Of love and other demons' has got to be my all-time favorite books anywhere. do read it, it hooks you right form the start and never lets go. i realy laughted out loud and cried horribley throughout the course of this book. i just have no words to express how wonderful this book really is, you'll just have to read it yourself."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I actually bought this book in an airport several years ago without even knowing what it was. (All I'd heard was the title and that it was worth reading). I didn't put it down until I was finished. It is such an imaginative book and so beautifully written. (Rabassa does a fabulous job of translating). I really recommend that you read it in the original Spanish, but if you don't understand it, this is almost as good."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Gabriel Garcia Marquez weaves a story of a hundred years of love, lust, tumult and downfall in this chronicle of the rise and fall of the Buendia family and the settlement of Macondo. His lyrical prose makes family curses, fortune-tellers, magic carpets and levitation as real and alive as civil wars, passionate and reckless men and women, and banana company plantations. Foolhardy and powerful men, their wives, and mistresses match the tempestousness of the times as they contribute to the fated doom of the family. Marquez creates an atmosphere of languid fatality where old men and women do and undo their chores in an unending spiral till death relives them from their solitude.The translation by Gregory Rabassa preserves the musical qualities of the original langugage.Certainly among the finest novels of the 20th Century."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Appearing in 1967, 'One Hundred Years of Solitude' created an uprecedented stir in the world of literature, and opened the gateway for a host of Marquez' South American contemporaries to show their remarkable talents to the world.'One Hundred Years of Solitude' concerns the history of the town of Macondo, a town which is essentially a reflection of our world whilst not quite being a part of it, from inception to destruction. Parallel to this is the colourful and bizarre story of its founding and chief family the Buendias. The novel is filled with particularly peculiar literary techniques. Marquez introduces the concept of 'Magical Realism', a feature of Latin American writing and culture, into this novel especially, and into all of his novels to some extent. 'Magical Realism' concerns seemingly incredible and fantastical events being described as if they were a perfectly normal everyday occurrence. Marquez wished to write a novel as his own Grandmother would have told a story-hence magical and inherently impossible events are recounted with unshakeable faith. Yet these events are often reflections of reality: for instance, when the workers union of the banana company organise a protest, the army open fire and slaughter thousands of people. Bizarrely, the next day the survivors have forgotten this event entirely. While this is indeed strange, Marquez likens this to the fact that, governments of South American countries have committed slaughter, yet withheld any knowledge of this from the public via manipulation of the media. Hence Marquez deploys political and human comment throughout the fantastical events of his work, using magical realism. Largely due to this technique the novel is a particularly enjoyable read: the incredible events keep one captivated, while the frequent and flagrant sex in the novel adds a touch of excitement and humanity to the work. Also, there is a constant repetition of events which seem extremely similar. Whilst there is a definite sense of linear time in the novel, a sense of history being almost circular is also apparent. Thus, personalities constantly repeat the experiences of earlier generations, though never in precisely the same way. This repetition imbues the novel with a strong sense of fate. For instance, once a person has been named then the major events of his or her life have already been pre-determined.The novel is extremely dense and the repetition of names can at times make for confusing reading. Yet each action is so perfectly ordered thematically, each fantastical event so subtely allegorical, that the novel requires, indeed demands a second or third reading, upon which it will impart much of its meaning.A massively important and enjoyable book, which everyone should own."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I had heard from many people whose opinions I respected that this was a great book. I had high expectations and many of them, though not all, were met.Its use of magical realism is engaging as the reader follows the lives, loves and tragedies of the Buendia family over what seems to be the entire course of human history. The book covered a tremendous emotional range as well: funny, sweet, tragic, romantic, sexy, stupid, mundane, brilliant and more. The details of such extremes lent the story truth in spite of its mystical elements.What disappointed me was the lack of emotional connection to any of the characters. Their experiences, though exaggerated, were universal. Yet the characters never quite felt real in spite of being complex and dynamic.I recognize that it is a richly textured and well-written work, yet I was not moved to love it, and in that I found disappointment."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I was given this book by a close friend many years ago. &quot;Read this, it's my favorite book,&quot; he said. He explained that it was given to him with the same words by someone else. It was the most wonderful gift I have ever been given. I was completely blown away. Since that day, I have bought many copies, and given many away with those same words: &quot;Read this, it's my favorite book.&quot; I want everyone I care about to read it. I have sat a non-reader down and read the first chapter to them aloud. I think it is the greatest first chapter ever written and it never ceases to move me. This book makes me cry, it makes me laugh, and I make a point of reading it any time I fall into a funk because it never disappoints me. It is the one constant in my life: My favorite book of all time."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Why write a review if there are already so many? Perhaps one more will tip you over the edge, and you will buy the bookThis fantastical tale is based around the life of the Buendia family and the village that they founded, Macondo. While epic in its scale (one hundred years) it does not read like an epic. Rather, it is like listening to an old relative recount past ancestors, with a decidedly magical-realism spin. This book is beautifully written (and translated, by Gregory Rabassa) with some of the most evocative and lyrical prose you are likely to come across. Yet it is still a very sturdy story - while you could read it for the craftsmanship of the words alone, you would miss a very good tale. Marquez has the interesting technique of referring to events in his stories before they happen, so you joyfully look out for events coming up.A word of warning - make sure that the edition that you buy/borrow/steal has a copy of the family tree in the beginning - with so many characters having the same name, and the branches of the family being so entwined, you will find yourself referring to it time and again. And don't be put off by the number of pages - even though it has over 400, it never bogs down. Once you have read this wonderful tale of a village and family gone full circle, from a beginning to an end, you will realise why it was awarded the Nobel Prize. Treat yourself."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This is one of the few stories I've read that always give a fresh jolt for every reread, in fact its hypnotic beauty has found me reading it for the third time now. One Hundred Years of Solitude teems with allegory and renders a reader to a full state of brooding and perspicacity. From the concept of the revolution and its paradox, to the ineffable alchemy; across the detailed and odd sounds of sex and death, promiscuity, incest, love and wild love, this amazing tale will surely dissolve you like a trance.The story's beginning is distinct and its end penetrating but what rich plots and (sometimes larger than life) characters span them in between. The comic and the tragic intertwine gracefully, while some few hints of ancient science are amusing. While this story constantly talks about a man's or a woman's solitude because of a pursuit or obsession or perhaps because of a forgotten past or one's inability to deal with reality, or just plainly a secret to an old age (time plays a significant role), it also expresses man's hope of raising virtue and integrity again in spite of dissolution and madness. It depicts social realities (most outrageously) and seeks contemplation on the nature of our being.Whatever description this novel has gained, being marked as Magical Realism, Postcolonialism, Historical Narration or whatever, I would rather call it a pure expression of of life."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Be warned: this is one of my favorite books of all time (the other two are *Alice in Wonderland* and *Huckleberry Finn*). It's the book that convinced me to learn Spanish, so I could appreciate it in the original.&quot;Wonderful&quot; doesn't even begin to describe this novel. It transported me out of my world into a magical kingdom of poetry, character and mythology.People will still be reading this marvel at the end of the Twenty-First Century.Have I mentioned I *really* like this novel?"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"There has been so much written about this book. I've read it twice and it amazed me the second time more than the first. It is magical and marvelous, you won't believe what you are reading so you must go with the flow or the oncoming rain in this case. Sometimes it's best to suspend one's disbelief and skepticism and move where the maestro (Garcia-Marquez) takes you. To say anything more is pointless. Please stop staring at the computer and order this book! And enjoy!"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Forget about the complexity of the story. This book is not meant to be a nice story with a happy ending.Enjoy reading it. Enjoy how little details are connected. Enjoy how feelings are described. Enjoy how destiny can not be fooled (and if it is, the consequences of it).After reading it, 6 months after, one year after, open it again. Do not worry, open it in the middle, without the rush of not knowing the end, and enjoy the story. Get caught by the feeling that every sentence was thoroughly thought and written.Discover how Jose Arcadio Buend&iacute;a realized that time was not going forward or how Ursula Iguar&aacute;n learned that time was going in circles...who was right??Only then the book will open its magic to you. Start dreaming!"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"From the first to the last line, 100 Years of Solitude is utterly incredible. One of the few novels with the power to actually transcend the act of reading words from paper, it will lift you to a place you never knew existed. Curious onlookers will wonder at your zombified, open-mouthed state as you shout in your head: HOW DID THAT JUST HAPPEN?!!! THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE!!! The book charts the history of the Buendia family as they love, lie, fight and rule for a century in their magical settlement Macondo, deep in the South American jungle. And that's exactly what this book is - pure magic. My favourite book of all time, I doubt it will ever leave you either."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"One has to be in the proper frame of mind to read this. Hence, after several &quot;false starts&quot; (caused by the extraordinarily long sentences, convoluted paragraphs and compounded with severe irritation that the names the characters are identical), I finally started reading this book properly four days ago and could not put it down until last night.And what a great experience this book is. With unforgettable characters, set against a setting fertile with imagination. The richness of the plot entices and weaves the reader into a rich, magical world, and the reader's definition of reality is temporarily suspended in the pages of this masterpiece.I would not recommend this book to everyone, only to those who can appreciate and recognise truly great literature, and those with the patience and forebearance to succumb to the unlikely, passionate, warped, tragic, amusing and wonderful world conjured by Marquez."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I have less than 50 pages to finish this book and I can only say it was simply gorgeous. I have heard about Marquez before, but somehow I was never able to lay my hands on one of his books until now. Indeed he deserved his Nobel Prize, he was awarded 25 years ago. I will definitely read a few more books by Marquez."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I have read this book both in english and spanish. It's not that hard to read (if you can handle with Tolkien's world, you will not have any problem with this). Maybe a lot of north american readers have no idea of what \\"realismo m&aacute;gico\\" (magical realism) is. This is a genre that became very popular in South America and Mexico on the fifties. In it, writers mix the political, social and economic reality of their countries with fiction trying to deliver a much more complex explanation of reality.This book tells the story of a little village called Macondo and a family that has been living there since its foundation. You have many humorous situations and references to colombian history and you better pay attention to the book because it has dozens of characters, some of them of similar names (remember that we are reading about a family).As I said before, you will find some impossible situations like a girl going away thru the sky. If Crounching Tiger, Hidden Dragon were a book, it will be like this. You know that some things are impossible to happen in the real world, but if you think on terms of the logic of this fictional world you will enjoy a story about universal topics like love, revenge, hate, etc.Again, if you were part of the people who didn't like Crounching Tiger, Hidden Dragon because \\"people can't fly in the real world\\" then you'd better stay away from this book. On the contrary, if you don't mind reading about fictional people in a fictional world, maybe this book is for you. Give it a try, there's nothing to lose and a great writer to discover.By the way, if you happen to like this book, then Vivir para Contarla is a must read. You will find many facts from Gabo's actual life that were translated into this book. That will help you understand what magical realism is about."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"\\"One Hundred Years Of Solitude\\" can be a daunting book. At almost 500 pages, the book covers six generations of the Buend&iacute;a family--a fact which is even more daunting when you consider that Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez uses the repetition of names within the family as a thematic device. The events of the book all have a mystical overtone, and magic and reality frequently collide.Once you begin to read \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude,\\" those facts which make the book at first seem daunting actually give the book its attraction. The grandiose scale of the story of one family and the apparently uncertain and magical reality in which they live make the book seem like a fairy tale told over a campfire, whose origins have long been forgotten. Even though Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez has a very distinctive style of writing, he falls far into the background in \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude;\\" it is as though the story is telling itself.The book follows the Buendia family from their founding of the village of Macondo until the last days of both the family and the village. Time--as with everything else--is not straightforward, however; past, present, and future all seem to mix, confusing the reality of the setting. Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez further confuses this by including information and stories which are too fantastical to be believed alongside a seemingly realistic and straightforward narrative, and refusing to distinguish between the two. The result of these devices is not to undermine the reality of this world, but to actually give this world the sense of ultimate reality and our own world the sense of fiction.\\"One Hundred Years of Solitude\\" is my favorite book, and one of the very few that intrigues and beguiles me more after every reread. It is not an easy book to start, but within a few pages, you will be drawn in Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez's world and will not want to leave."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"But dont let that stop you from reading this book. This is the a must read for everyone. As I finished the last page of this book, I flipped it over and started it again. Mr. Marquez takes literature to a new level. This book is seriously clowning on a lot of other recommended and required books throughout history. To not read this book, is to not ever truly experience a great story. Whatever sad excuse for a book you are reading put it down and pick this up. You will never forgive yourself if you dont."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"My decision to read this book was based on its \\"Nobel Prize\\" winning status and a desire to expand my knowledge of world literature. I was not disappointed. The fluid writing style of the author seems a bit tricky at first, but as the story unfolds, one recognizes a natural cadence and rhythm which is like the flow of a river through time. Perhaps, the translation from Spanish into English omits some of the cultural milieu, however, the more one reads the more admiration one has for the writing skill and creativity of the author. This story is a fascinating account of the Buendia family who helped found the town of Macondo, somewhere out in the jungle of South America. This family dynasty includes the founding patriarch Jose Arcadio Buendia and thematriarch, Ursula, as well as more modern adventurers, revolutionaries, rebels, and eccentrics both male and female, who express their physical and spiritual natures as they build complex lives and produce the future generations. The family rises to a position of prominence in the region, each generation is tied to the previous one through legends and stories, making the ancestors seem mythical and magical. The extraordinairy cast of characters also includes vagabond gypies who come from the other side of the ocean, describing another world, even Macedonia is mentioned. They bear gifts, such as magnets, and one charismatic figure, Melquiades, carries with him experimental chemicals and alchemy books. He gives demonstrations of his talents. He captures the imagination of Jose Arcadio Buendia, the family patriarch who becomes an amature scientist. In an unusual creative twist, the book of secrets also becomes a book of knowledge, a book foretelling the future. In a symbolic manner it provides cohesion to the book. At the end, reading about the author's life, one learns how he was influenced by his grandmother who was a master storyteller. She wove fact, fiction and superstition into a magical mythical realm that felt very real to the author when he was a child. This story telling spirit became the impetus, the driving force to write this historical family chronicle. It is filled with love, humor, sadness, rebellion, naivite, adventure, glory, revolution, entrepenurial success, implusive acts with unexpected consequences and the magnetic appeal of bigger than life characters, both men and women. There is a free verse poetic flow to the writing which is totally captivating and infectious. Most highly recommended reading. Erika Borsos (erikab93)"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This was not an easy read by any means. I forced myself to finish it. The writing is good to excellent, but the multi-generational Aurelianos are so convoluted and confusing. Luckily, Marquez reminds you of the characters', background so you aren't totally lost following all the threads. The imagery in many places is sublime, fascinating, dark, mystical, crazy. It almost reminds me of watching a Tim Burton movie ( I had just seen Big Fish) with much more detail and story weaving. Sometimes you don't know when reality starts and stops, but that is also the beauty of this story. So many characters were living in their minds and not in the present. The matriarchal strength in this story binds it all. You have to pay attention and not read this before going to bed. At the end, I had to brush off the cobwebs and scrape off the moss from myself. I was lucky the ants remained outside."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"... that Oprah chose this book for her Book Club.

It was a struggle at times, though. But I would recommend it to anyone wanting to expand their streams of consciousness.

This is the best book I've read!"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I have never been a lover of reading but I have read \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude\\" not once but twice because of its depth and angle on humanity. Gabriel Garcia Marquez is pure genius, there is absolutely nothing prosaic about his prose. This book deals with every single human emotion and experience imaginable ranging from murder, incest,prostitution, sex, gluttony, family, friendship, hatred, unrequited love, self-acceptance, death, war, sadness, weaknesses, love and a whole lot more.The way in which each character of the Buendia family is described is magnificent to say the least. Their faults are portrayed in the most unapologetic way, as equal to their strengths. Somehow it seems we can't escape fate and although we would want to do what seems moral we always end up simply living. The lessons are profound not simply because the characters suffer from many a self-inflicted wound, but rather because we can relate to each and every one of them. Regardless of age, race or station in life everyone can see themselves in at least one of these characters. As the name suggests, the underlying current is one of the emptiness of the human spirit and the ease with which man can become at war with himself. This book has had a tremendous impact on the way I look at the world and human nature - it doesn't cut to the core, it punctures it. The sentences are the longest imaginable but somehow you won't find yourself out of breath by the time you get to the full stop. Put simply, I would like to get my hands on every single Marquez novel!"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I understand that this book was absolutely groundbreaking and created whole new literary techniques. But that's the only thing that made me slog through it. I kept expecting it to get better, but it didn't.

I plan to give GGM a second chance."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Wonderful work, one of the rare works in 20th century literature...

I can't even begin to compare the prose, the images invoked, to any other writer I've been exposed to; they just don't compare to Marquez. I'm reading it for the 4th or 5th time and can't put it down. The words just seamlessly fall into place in snyc with my thoughts and imagination. That part of this novel is a wonderous experience. As to the content, the Buendias are a family I've become familiar with and increasingly revolted by. Behind all of Marquez's dense fog of magical prose is the sick reality of this family. I understand the intent, but didn't really pay it any attention until the 2nd reading or so. It's animalistic, barbaric, incestuous, and callous; it's a fairly tale on heroin. If you enjoy the style and prose this will be one of your favorite books, but you'll only know if it clicks with you if you give it a try."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"And fascinating illusions don't let me go.

The comedy of life, of our solitude that has its roots deeply inside our souls. This book is a mirror of the human soul and of our society. The image reflected is tragic, is the image of souls that fight to survive in this mix of love, hate, ignorance, geniality and pain that is commonly known as LIFE. Marquez is great and this book is the reason why Marquez is great.

This book is a debatably fictitious freeze-frame of the unrecognized Colombian lowlands people's previously oral history. What you may consider magical may well be considered reality by the people you are reading about - don't belittle it as a quixotic author's imagination. Circular timeline and Spanish names consistently flummox English readers. You cannot read a few pages and put it down, though -trust me- Plow ahead - after 100 pps. it will begin to clear up. Note the tenses of the first line - time is not linear in this rainforest - reader beware. It has been written that this one line contains the entire book.

I never realized that the written word could be so expressive. I was in my first year of law school, right in the middle of exams, when I finished reading the book around 2:00 a.m.. I immediately started reading it again. I have read it since then, and plan to reread it on a regular basis. Many times I have walked into a bookstore and read the last page, and everytime I get chills up my spine."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"100 years of soliltude is touching in a way that few things in the world ever are. It is almost uniquely insightful, and makes you wish that the real world was so poetic and melancholy. I have been told that it spawned a genre called 'magical realism' in which a realist text is troubled by supernatural occurance. In a similar way this novel will trouble and change the way you see your world. Few writers ever manage this feat, in this half of the century Gabriel Garcia Marquez has only Milan Kundera and V.S.Naipaul for company."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"&quot;My Dear Friend,I shall try to express to you the joy and release that I have experienced through your thoughtful gift of &quot;100 Years of Solitude&quot;.It has more firmly cemented my belief that the right things find their way to you at the right time.As I read the last words on page 81 of this beautiful book, I broke into a fit of joyous laughter and saddest tears such as I have never experienced in my life! As if all of the pain and joys of living up to this moment had found release.I can find no proper words to describe what I feel, except to say that I feel strangely at peace; with a sense of hope and love for this life that is ours. No matter that all that we work and strive for in life may end in being &quot;tied to a chestnut tree with a shelter of palm fronds&quot;.I am reminded that it is the very struggle that makes life worth living and beautiful. I am left with a sense of indefinable courage to go on. I love this life! What a wonderful adventure it is, and how lucky I am to have all that I do. When it comes down to what is important, I shall die happy knowing that my life is filled, and made worthwhile, by the gifts of love and friendship of many wonderful souls.Thank you for your gift my friend.&quot;These words were written spontaneously upon finishing the first part of the book. That was over 3 years ago. Although I have not yet reread it, the ghost of this fantastic work has never left me. I would have liked it to end differently, but the magical power was not in my control. Truly one of the most compelling and glorious works I have ever read."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This is one of those books that you can read as many times as you wish.

Anyway, I think this is Garcia's best work ever."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"100 years of solitude broke ground in Latin Amercian literature, by taking it out of its regional dimension into international recognition. Garcia Marquez masterfully told tale of the birth and death of a family revealed to the world the quality of Latin American writers, and consolidated the genre of magical realism. It is an essential book to anyone who wants to look at Latin American literature. At least I have read it about 15 times and find funnier and sadder every time"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I am so happy I can now afford a hardback version of this classic of world literature. I first read this book in high school - thank goodness for open-minded, world-view teachers. And every reading brings new insights.Rabassa is a fabulous translator. In the original Spanish, this is totally hypnotic, and that dreamy state is crafted lovingly in the translation."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Marquez is the most important living writer in any language. This book is a classic and will still be considered one in another hundred years. It may not be palatable to the suburbian children of the Politically correct era, but it reflects a different time and a reality that exists even today in Latin America. Often imitaded (Isabel Allende) but never equaled Garcia Marquez soars with Borges, Cortazar, Fuentes, Vargas Llosa, and many other Latin American writers to create the best literature of this century, only comparable to the Russian writers of the nineteen century."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I always know that when I set out to read a novel by Gabriel Garcia Marquez I am asking for it! Marquez's writing style and characters are like none else I have ever encountered. I was initiated through Love in the Time of Cholera some years ago and found I was still recovering from it before I chose to read One Hundred Years of Solitude. Marquez I believe, is one of my favorite storytellers yet! In One Hundred Years of Solitude Marquez captures time with ease. He tells a story that begins somewhere around where Genisis left as I understand it and spans the cenuries to the life of today as if it where as easy as flying a kite over a field of flowers. It does not take long before you as the reader feel like one of the Buendia family and are as exited as they when the gypsies come to twn or are as curious as to where Colonel Aurleiano's troop is as Ursula, and you only wish you really were there so that you could see the faces of all the Aurleianos's, Arcadio's, ans Remedios's to be sure of who is who. The characters can be very confusing. I really enjoyed this book it was like ecaping to another world, another time each time I picked it up, and that to me is my favorite part of reading."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"&quot;One hundred years of solitude&quot; is incredible for many reasons, including its cyclical portrayal of the Buendia family. The family is being torn by the desire for solitude, as the Colonel becomes very aware of, and the need for love. Many characters repeat history, doing what theyre ancestors have done. This is a splendid book that was and easy read, but had alot of messages underneath the explicit."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This book made me fall in love with reading again. It is by far the most enjoyable and life altering work of art I have encountered. Deeply rooted in South American culture and history, it gives the reader insight into a mystical and somewhat magical history. It's a true masterpiece, a modern clasic. READ THIS BOOK NOW....and thank me later!!!!"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Garcia Marquez's writing makes the reader savor every sentence. It is poetry more than prose. This book does not tell a story as much as it conveys the feelings and emotions that make us human. Its &quot;magical realism&quot; seems to leap out of the page and take the reader to the land of Macondo, but anything I write here is inadequate to describe this piece of work, such a task is an impossibility."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I was surprised at how little was lost in the translation of this book. Garcia writes this novel as if it were poetry, he has a wonderful use of language that seems to braid mystical as well as humurous aspects into his writing. This is a novel that I won't forget and recommend readily."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Even though this became one of the best classics in modern literature, it's not really &quot;classical&quot; or dated at all. If you like mystery, you will like it. If you like Sci-Fi, you will like it. If you like psychological novels, you will like it. If you like picturesque novels, you will like it. Anyway, you will difinitely like it!!!"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This is a book written by a real master, Gabriel Garcia Marquez has made a very special book that captures your heart, mind and feelings. You will keep thinking of it through out your lifetime."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"One Hundred Years of Solitude is, essentially, the most important work of one of the 20th century's supreme masters of the written word. And it's also an incredible read. Garcia Marquez has somehow managed to balance an absolute clarity of symbolic thought with a kind of earthy pragmatism, the like of which I have not yet found. There's none of that stylish European existential angst in here; the kind which appears in, for example, Waiting for Godot (another work I adore, at least on an intellectual level). In this I think there's an important message to be found: when you get done reading this book, don't just sit on your butt and muse on the glories of the written word -- go out and DO something! Write a book of your own, compose some poetry, fall in love, what have you ... just alleviate that solitude, any way you can! In that alone, he already takes a more active role than most important authors in pushing for an active participation in society, as opposed to the kind of hermetic isolation from which so many of us suffer today.Additionally, for all the hullabaloo about Magic Realism, there's really nothing to fear; everything that happens within the book is completely consistent with what Garcia Marquez would have us believe about the world of Macondo and the Buendias (the main family of protagonists in the novel, if you haven't read it). And I believe that a mutual coherence between all the internal elements of a work of literature is far more important than its being consistent with what we're used to reading. And frankly, I found it hilarious. Cheesy justification aside, Garcia Marquez is a master of comic timing, and wit spills out of the sides of this magically realistic book as copiously as does significance.In any case, this book is just a perfect balance of everything that I wanted in literature but was never able to find -- clarity of thought without loss of depth, a philosophical bent without a loss of a sense of reality, and an absolute mastery of the use of symbolism. This last point is perhaps the most significant; not a single word in the book is wasted. While it is possible to enjoy the book without thinking about it too hard, almost every sentence contains some metaphorical double-entendre -- some easy to spot, some more difficult.Yada yada. Anyway, this book is absolutely wonderful, and there's no excuse (that I can think up) for avoiding this book besides an utter distaste for everything written in the 20th century. Or maybe a chronic lack of time in which to read. I hope this review bumps it back up to five stars on the rating meter; it was at four and a half, and that's just not fair. Well, now I will stop blathering."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"First I read &quot;Love in the Time of Cholera&quot;. That book I keep always open ready for the moment. So I was curious to read an earlier book by Marquez. Maybe it is also a great book, but after &quot;Love..&quot; I found it disturbing mainly because of its fantacy and lack of clarity by comparison. If you go for mystery and underlying meanings and lots and lots of characters then this is for you. Marquez paints vivid word pictures. but I think he grew wonderfully after he wrote 100 years of Solitude. Maybe he emerged out of solitude to find &quot;Love&quot;!"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I loved this book. I highly recommend for every one to read it."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This book is an echelon or two ahead of the stuff put out by second-rate authors with literary pretensions like Toni Morrison and Norman Mailer, but it might be a bit overrated too. As a reader, you'll be edified, and it certainly isn't a waste of time. Marquez is quite talented, and the plot, though plodding and cyclical, will hold one's attention. It may be remembered in the future, but if so, most likely as a footnote."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"read it and you will know why!"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I simply could not finish reading this book. The characters' lives and their family lines twist in and out of each other until the tangled mess is too difficult to decipher. The magical, surreal quality of some of the stories felt \\"cheesy\\" and not very convincing. I do not understand what the big fuss is about this book. I quit after about 100 pages."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I even finished Brothers Karamazov and Bleak House, but this one I quit. I felt like I was wasting my time trying to remember the characters and their relations and what in the world is occuring in this make believe town of Macondo. Marquez may be a skilled writer and storyteller, but this book confused, bored and frustrated me without offering entertainment or insight.So what if Oprah picked it and if it has been labled a classic...it is not enjoyable or remarkable to me. I think I made it to about page 150 or so.With so many books to read, why waste time trying to decipher this one?"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I think that Mr. Marquez is a far superior story teller than he is a writer. It is too bad you can't sit around a fire listening to his stories instead. This book basically has no overall plot, but many smaller plots for each little story within it. I thought the sheer number of characters who names were similar (if not the same) was very annoying. I had a hard time connecting with any of the characters due to the weaving in and out of other characters. I know that there was a family tree in the beginning, but I just got tired of flipping back to the point that I just did not care.To the average reader, without a discussion group or a literary expert, many of the \\"hidden gems\\" will be missed if there are any. On the whole, I just couldn't shake the vibe that I was reading an extended version of the Old Man and the Sea.It was interesting from the point of reading a Mexican writer."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Disturbing! This is the only single word that I can use to describe this book.Although definatley unique it the composition style, the book is dark and depressing. The theme of incest and child porn appeared to be the primary focus in the book instead of creationalism as eluded to in other reviews.It had an interesting ending but not worthy of the time spent leading up to it."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Yes Mr. Marquez is very intelligent and has a remarkable story-telling ability, but the thing he wasn't able to do for me, was get me to care about the characters. He lost 2 stars for that. It was in certain parts very interesting and rich in detail, but I have to admit, I forced myself through many parts of it. And did Mr. Marquez try to act a little 'Joycean' by making his sentences long.....(look at pgs. 329-331 paperback edition)? And yes, I have the same gripe about similar sounding names. However if the reader keeps reading, he/she can usually figure out what is what by the context. Mr. Marquez, very few will ever win a Nobel in literature, but could you please pump out something in what I know is your brillant mind, that will make me CARE.?"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Reportedly the author himself did not understand the success of this book. He said, \\"Most critics don't understand a novel like One Hundred Years of Solitude is a bit of joke.--they take on the responsibility of decoding the book and risk making terrible fools of themselves.\\" I'm glad to know that at least the author wasn't fooled by his mediocre work.Throughout the book there is no uplifting or cathartic passage; the supposedly comical elements don't make you laugh; the tragic episodes don't make you cry; the style is unpolished; \\"magical realism\\" is used indiscriminately; and so are the words \\"solitude\\" and \\"solitary\\" which appear in every few pages. In the book practically everyone and everything is solitary. It's a red-tag sale of Solitudes. Yet, their solitude is merely circumstantial. It is not the type of haunting or ennobling solitude you find in Kafka's or Camus' work. Even in \\"Hijo de hombre\\" (Buenos Aires, 1961) by the contemporary Paraguayan author Augusto Roa Bastos, different characters from an impoverished village carry their true cross of solitude silently and bravely without even being aware of it.The book is worth reading only for the purpose of pondering why it has gained such popularity and acclaim."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Its been a while since I read this book, but I thought it was excellent. It was part of a modern literature course I took at my high school, and it was my favourite book out of the whole semester.One Hundred Years Of Solitude really opened some doors for me. World literature and more importantly, Magic Realism called to me. As a literary work, it is important because it marks the beginning of Magic Realism as a genra.The plot is increible and my friends and I have spent countless hours discussing what, exactly, the point of this novel is. This only goes to show that it is intellegent.I would recomend this novel to anyone. It's well worth you time and I can hardly wait to read it again."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"A wonderful read. Marquez' prose is amazing, poetic!"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I read this book during one of my sophomore literature courses (course selection) and I was kind of blown away. It's the type of book that you pick up and really can't put back down without being mysteriously drawn back to it. Within the bounds of the book, you get sucked into wondering how in the world the Buend&iacute;a family became so [messed] up and end up marvelling at the \\"progress\\" of their town. I didn't give it five stars because I thought that it became kind of murky towards the end, kind of hard to follow. Be warned though, this is a pretty dark book, and if you're one to desire that resolution occur for the sake of having an ending, then don't read this - it might make you angry. If you don't mind a bit of random humor and can breeze past the bit of vulgarity that's in the book, then press on. It's a great read, especially on a rainy day when tornadoes are on the prowl."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"One Hundred Years of Solitude is the Latin American classic which introduced the concept of magical realism, fantastic occurrences told in simple, unexcited prose, as if they were perfectly natural, to the literary world. Can this style keep a reader enchanted for almost 450 pages? No and there are were times when I found myself skimming over details just to get to the next part. Still, Marquez's breakthrough novel is well worth reading. The book captures roughly one hundred years, from the time when, \\"the world so recent that many things lacked names\\" to the age of the first automobiles and movie theaters, in the lives of the Buendia family in the mythic village of Macondo. The six generations of Buendias, whose lives are told in the book with a unique poetic motif for each character, are trapped in an endless maze of death, war, love and search for meaning while the kind of magic, which caused a rain of rose petals to fall during the funeral march of Macondo founder, Jose Arcadio Buendia, gently slips from their world."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":".... and I read it everytime I can't find anything else that interests me.It took me four tries to get through it the first time, stick with it. If you can't get it the first time put it down and come back to it in year or two.15 years and numerous re-reads later the end still sends me reeling."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Certainly a great novel. This story is about various generations of a family. A book once you start reading one cannot put it now. Be warned it is a large boo, so start reading it only when you have loads of time."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This is the book I have to read at least once a year once in Spanish, the next one in English (the translation is close to perfect, or as GGM generously says, better than the original). If one ever needed to confirm the relationship between force and violence, love and lust, family and acquaintances, this is the book once has to cherish... In the background there is the violence that even today affects Colombia, with the parties still called by the same names and characterized by the same non-ideology. The violence is perfectly described in its horror, in its non - cause, in its lack of purpose. It is as it existed in Bolivar's times and as causeless, goal - less but as pervasive as Bolivar described it and lost hope on it. As Bolivar predicted it, the USA is very much in the horizon, as represented by the United Fruit banana plantations and its zero-tolerance for workers unions. Family life with its strengths and excesses is presented here as nowhere else. The beauty of the human being in its nakedness, the difference between cuteness and attractiveness in women, the enormous ability of women to carry life, and men, in their shoulders, is shown here like nowhere else. It easily explains the Nobel Prize of the author, his being such a great prophet in the world more than in his own land, his being consistently denied a visa to the USA, and the almost addiction of the New York Times Book Review to this author and his books. I have not seen any other author from Latin-America, or the Americas for that matter, reviewed so many times and with such deserved enthusiasm as the Colombian, Gabriel Garcia Marquez."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This book seems to move beyond so many other books not only in its message, but also in the beauty of description. The intricacy and almost surrealism of the plot draws the reader in so intently its exhilarating. Also, the tone is calming as you learn of the Buendia family and their history. You will come away from this book with a sharper eye for the magical aspects of everyday life, as well as a few hours of absolute escape and bliss. Read it. You're not likely to regret it!"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I read this book many many years ago when I was 14. I did not read it in English or Spanish. At the time I didn't know either one. I read it in Persian, but that did not diminish the effect it had on me at all. I guess the translation must have been good. I must have read the book some 12 times over the period of that year. And still, every once in while as I am driving my car, a passage from the book comes to my mind and takes me back to the magic that it was. I do not want to read this book again. I don't think that after getting accustomed to the reality of life around me my heart can handle such surge of emotions as it did then. If you haven't read it though, and you are able to pull yourself back to reality after finishing the book, I strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Not quite a 4 star, but not a 3. The book was very good but the story is longwinded in places. The saving grace of the book was the last chapter and all which Meliquades predicted soming true once reflected upon."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I just finished reading this book, and like most fresh reads it is staying on my mind. The writing from the first chapter is so fanciful and descriptive it compares to no other. I loved and hated this book at the same time. It is dark, it is about family and war and infidelity and love. It doesn't mention the word solitude until you're about half way through - and when Marquez does mention it, he keeps mentioning it and it seems to be the obvious title for the book. It is almost like when he first says it, you experience his \\"Ah, ha\\" moment. Being a happy go lucky person myself, I found myself rooting for happiness, and there is happiness. It is a good read. It comes full circle. Enjoy"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"To be honest, this is the best book I've ever read. Like \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", it houses a whole world within itself. It is a bit like \\"realistic\\" fantasy, or true sci-fi. It's also like the best wine, if you come to love it, you'll never understand how so many people prefer CocaCola.When I first read it, in spanish, I couldn't help having it in my pocket, just to re-read it, for over one month after I had finished it. The music and the rhythm of the prose is untranslatable into english, but the fable and the feeling, that brand new world, is truly unique.Try it, if you can enjoy something different."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I have read this book in Spanish and English. I read the english version out of curiosity and I found out that sometimes it is difficult to keep the original context of a book when it is translated from its original language (Spanish). Spanish is such a rich language that sometimes it is very difficult to translate the words with the same feeling, and I know about that been bilingual and spanish been my first language. This book is pure magic realism and sometimes the magic, for me, was lost in translation. Anyway I know it is a difficult reading doesnt matter in which language, but let me tell you it is all worth at the end. If you let go and get into the story not trying to think or make sanse of everything but just follow the rhythm of the words you will find yourself in Macondo and will enjoy it till the end. This book is a piece of art."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Although I liked some aspects of One Hundred Years of Solitude, I do have some bones to pick with it. For one, I don't like the way Marquez tells the story. It is not in chronological order. To be honest this isn't my favorite way of telling a story but that isn't the worst part. What really bugs me about it is the fact that he spoils his future events. Not by foreshadowing but by blatantly telling you what will happen later in the story.Another problem is his sentence structure. Some of them were quite long. I like highly expressive writing styles and complicated sentences, but Marquez does it all wrong. There was one particular one that started more than half way up page 348 and ended at almost the bottom of page 350. Now call me cynical, but that sentence was pretty much a short story in itself. Needless to say I didn't like his sentence structure. (I highly doubt that this extremely long sentence was made with the translation since Marquez complimented Rabassa on his work and even said he preferred the English version of his novel.)I must say I did enjoy the actual story and the message that Marquez was giving. He was very symbolic and I liked that part of the novel.In all I think that One Hundred Years of Solitude was good but not the best. If you're curious about my favorite novel, here it is: the unabridged version of The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I read this book ages ago, and since I can remember it's been considered a masterpiece worldwide. It seems like in some places a celebrity's blessing is needed to get the attention of those who instead of reading good literature are connected to the television watching crappy stuff. Well, if you fit the glove, then don't even bother leaving a review, carry on watching your stuff and leave the reviews for the ones who really enjoy good literature."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Okay, I too discovered this book while flipping the tv channels and saw Oprah raving about it and decided to judge for myself. I admit the book is captivating, but hardly the best book I have ever read.One first glimpse at the family tree increased my curiousity, some intriguing relationships there, for sure, and I love sagas. The names were not at all confusing for me. Then after a few pages I thought... well, it's easy to read (for me anyway) and the author never forgets to come back to the scene he left hanging several pages earlier.Then all of a sudden something didn't make sense... Mmmm, this is strange, I said to myself, but let's go on. So I kept going and got used to this \\"magic realism\\" you all commented about it but didn't much care about it. At times I wished the magic didn't interfere with the credibility of the story. If you have to tell us about history, tell us as it was, without useless \\"magic\\" twists. I love historical fiction when it teaches me something new about the political and social problems of the times and places in the book and I did learn some of this by reading this book, but the \\"magic\\" side did not work for me. Especially that Remedios the Beauty ascended to heaven... well I struggled to even find a spiritual meaning of that. The only woman to be so \\"down to earth\\" ending up like the Virgin Mary... No, it didn't work for me.The only character I really got attached to was Ursula, the matriarch, she was the anchor, a steady point in the whole story, although I kept asking myself...\\"How long can this woman live??\\" but the longer she lived the longer I wanted her to live. After her death everything came crushing down, the descendants completely lost their sanity and the house she cared so much about was slowly devoured by termites and red ants, so at that point I stopped caring about the whole saga, it made me feel as if the whole family line existed for nothing. Was this the real intention of the author? To tell us how irrelevant we are in the great scheme of things? Anyway, the author does leave to the readers' imagination as to the end of the last Aureliano, will he go mad or will he find love again and live and prosper? At that point I stopped caring and closed the book. Let's read another one..."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This one at times I had to struggle through, but in the end the whole thing came together wonderfully like separate ingredients that make up a delicious pie. It was, however, depressing. I had to go and pick up my copy of &quot;The Little Guide To Happiness&quot; and read that over. LOL. Regardless, this one is well written."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Magic realism plus rich, beautiful latin culture combines to make a beautiful novel of a town's history. So many wonderfully impossible things happen that this was just a treat to read, even during the heart wrenching moments. I think it's one of the riskier books for Oprah's club, but I can't wait to see what people say. Splendid!"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I would equate my experience reading 100 Years of Solitude to watching the movie Groundhog Day 5 times consecutively.I mildly enjoyed the first 150 pages or so, though in my opinion it still is not spectacular writing, but merely competent. But still, if this book was only 200 pages, I would look on it favorably. Unfortunately.... it's twice that long. The foundation of the book is incessant reincarnations of the same family members over and over and over again. Brevity and succinctness is obviously not Marquez's strong suit. This, along with a very fable-like style makes the book strangely feel more antiquated than Beowulf (but not nearly as interesting).I will admit that it is initially captivating, but unfortunately this is accomplished the same way soap operas and Lifetime movies do: ridiculous interpersonal dramas endlessly unfold in a cantilevered manner.100 Years of Solitude painfully beats a dead horse in a manner which makes Atlas Shrugged seem like a pamphlet in comparison."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"The book is indeed a masterpiece and the story is good, but it can be monotonous at times. There's too much sex in the book for my taste (nearly every 20 pages!), and the author presents an overly pessimistic view of humanity, as most of the characters are driven by sex, food, and egocentrism. It was an interesting read, but I wouldn't read it again."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I'm one of those obsessives who forces himself to finish any book he starts so I plugged away hoping I'd experience the enlightenment all these other reviewers seem to have found...but I just didn't get it. Maybe it lost something in the translation, but I prefer a little dialog in my fiction...even in my heavy, pretentious intellectual and politically correct fiction. I don't mind the magic realism, but I do get bored with sentences that run on for two-plus pages without a period. Oh, well, chalk up the dissent to a libertarian crumudgeon redneck who's educated beyond his intelligence. But I was underwhelmed."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I've heard almost everwhere about people saying this was the greatest book they have ever read, I often don't think much of peoples comments with statements like that and put them in a category under recommended reading. After reading this book however; I started a new category called &quot;avoid at all costs.&quot; The book has high hopes comparing itself to the creation story and the first 5 books of the Bible, I don't beleive critics should even repeat this comparison because it is so off kilter. The story tells the plight of a south american family and its countless generations struggle with society and establishing norms. However, the book drags into a boring and overwritten lull, each page made me cry because I am in no ways a fast reader and it moved me to tears to realize that I had lost about 18 hours of my life over the course of three months, and you need that many breaks when you pick up a book like this. If there was anything good to come out of this was the realization that a number of books tell the same story a lot better for instance John Steinbeck's &quot;The Pearl&quot; and his other master work &quot;The Grapes of Wrath.&quot; You treasure every page in those books."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"It takes a long time to learn about over fifty characters and this novel's meandering prose and run-on sentences don't make it any quicker. This is gritty, offbeat stuff for the serious Garcia-Marquez enthusiast. The reward readers must feel at the end is that they've endured a tedious, difficult novel, but not an enjoyable one."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I recognize that lots of people think this book is wonderful. However, as an extremely well-read English major, I think Marquez must be laughing. Without repeating the comments of the other one-star reviewers, I'll just say that I was more than underwhelmed. It's nonsenical, and (am I the only one who noticed?) misogynistic."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"After reading the reviews for this book, I was excited to read it. I am a huge fan of magical realism, but this novel...I just don't get it. I have about 100 pages left, and this may be one of the first books I do not finish reading. It just seems to go on and on and on...with nothing exciting or engaging. I feel like I am missing something about this book after reading the overwhelming majority of GREAT and moving reviews, but it just isn't my cup of tea."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I agree with the other reviewers that say this book is tedious and much overrated. I read quite a bit, and I usually enjoy everything I read. However, I just cannot get in to this book. Yes, it is rambling, confusing, and all those other adjectives someone else used. But I don't want rambling and confusing. I don't want to be spoon fed, but it would be nice if there were an identifiable path for the book. I wonder how much is lost in the English translation, and if it would be a much better read in its native language.I am a few hundred pages into the book. I'll keep reading -- and keep hoping that it improves."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I read a ton of books, and have no problem with long or \\"difficult\\" reads. But it was just plain excrutiating to read this book! I got about halfway through and, after speaking with others who finished it and was told nothing really ever happens, I gave up. It's the same boring stuff over and over again. The characters' names are all so similar it's impossible to keep track of who's who, but who cares, because the author doesn't give you reason to care about any of them anyway! It's business as usual for a long time with regards to realism, then out of nowhere.. a flying carpet. (I'm sure at that point in the book, I resembled my dog tilting his head to one side over something perplexing and unexplainable.) There are sooo many captivating and enriching books out there.. I don't recommend wasting your time on this one."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"My wife loved this book. I belong to a book club at work and they chose this book. I finished it. It was painful. Other members in the club also agreed -- It was extremely tedious, repetitiously annoying and not funny."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Boring, boring, boring. After 120 pages, I gave up. What is the point? I guess I don't get it. What was this guy smoking? How many characters need the same name? How many absurd tortures do we need to read about? The fantasy appears to be thrown in just for the sake of making incidences wild and imaginary and do not seem to be relative to the story or themes. Maybe something was lost in the translation, but if this is the next best thing to Genesis, we're all in trouble. Read The Red Tent --- it comes a lot closer to that billing.Sorry, but I have other books to read, and many yawns before I sleep."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Well, I have to say that Oprah's latest choice was a little disappointing for me. There were parts of this story that spaned 100 years of a families generations that I enjoyed. I loved how unique the stories were. And each person in the family had their own quirks &amp; personalities. There were surprises along the way &amp; some shocking moments. Overall, the story &amp; characters were great.The part of the book that dragged it down for me was how the stories were woven together. I'm not sure if that is a part of this magic realism. I could accept that magic realism makes things that could never happen, happen. But it was the flow of the book that I had a hard time with.Some tips: You'll need to pay attention to every word on your page. If you zone out for one moment, you'll surely miss something. Make sure you read the book with the family tree in the front- I used it probably just about every chapter. It's hard when everyone's names are the same or similar. Also, stick with it. There are parts that are slow and parts that are very interesting. In the end, the read was worth it, even though along the way I was a bit frustrated. I wouldn't have given the author a nobel prize, but I agree that it's a memorable book."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I have purchased \\"excelent\\" used books before but his came with writing in the text. This book was not in \\"excelent condition\\""},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Some interesting parts to this novel, but it drags on much too long and does not translate into a good American read. Sorry, Oprah!Paragraphs can last for pages and everyone has the same names--Aureliano, Ursula, Segundo, Aradio, and Remedios. Heck, one Aureliano had 17 sons who were ALL named Aureliano. so, often times the reader cannot tell who Marquez is referencing without looking at the family tree graphic in the front of the book.Maybe I am not a deep thinker, but I found this book to be ponderous. And the story lines that are somewhat interesting are never are made clear as to their importance to the overall tale."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I forced myself through this because someone told me it would be good. Every day I read this I expected to be blown away. Alas, I was disappointed. After several hundred pages of unoriginal dribble and disgusting incest, I finally came up for air. About every three lines in this book I felt like having an aneurism. The \\"magical realism\\" crap that everyone rants lovingly about in this book is a load of garbage. No, it's not creative. It's boring and annoying. The author randomly throws supernatural phenomena into the story at random points and doesn't have enough originality or creativity to explain it or make it interesting; he just moves on. No, sorry, I won't explain why this person is psychic. Oops, this person just snapped. Sorry. Hey, whaddya know! It's raining flowers. Oh why not I'll throw in some ghosts... maybe some magical gypsies... and we've got an inane bore-fest. Useless."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I read it halfway hoping that a plot line would develop, it never did. Too much incest and I hated how everyone had the same name. I love thought provoking books that you have to work at but this is just plain silly. This book is for the phony intellectuals who want to say they read it and feel cultured. This book is just awful, there are way too many good books to waste your time on this one."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"The story is about a family of inbreds told over a few generations. Most of the characters in the story have the same name , who suddenly die and get replaced with another character with the same name. It becomes confusing after a while to track who is who, who is dead or alive or who is the parent of who. I stopped reading about half way because I was lost and confused. The book is not a light or fun read, it requires great concentration and mental effort."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I checked this book out of the library after reading rave review after rave review.I wanted to like it, I really did, but I honestly cannot understand all the high marks. To me the book reads as if it were written by a 6th-grader. Characterization and storyline aside, the language itself is what turned me off. It seemed stilted, contrived, lacking in fluidity, and devoid of any real color; an amateurish effort at best.Perhaps this reads better in its native tongue, but the translation I read was atrocious. I promptly returned it to the library, shooting it soundly down the return bin with a force that it so richly deserved."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This book has one of the finest desriptions and analysis of literature one can find in any author on its highly desciptive work of the Buendia family and, so called, Mocondo.........but really, the nobel prize for literature for 400+ pages of such bore and repetitiveness. I have also read some of the reviews on this page and must conclude that either readers have terribly boring lives, that this kind of literature can be so compelling with the surreal and completely over exaggerated descriptive material. Nobel Prize..huh..make a good soap opera."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Oprah always has her finger on the pulse of popular tastes in fiction, and with this novel her prose becomes more melifluous than ever, reflecting the somewhat exotic, unusual subject matter she has chosen. Although I prefer Oprah's previous book, East of Eden, this one is pretty good too, with a very interesting narrative structure upon which Oprah must have worked long and hard. Fictionally speaking, is there anything Oprah can't do?"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I came back to read the Amazon reviews because, after reading half of this book, I've begun to wonder when/if it's going to get good. I hate to put down a book I've started- even if it bores me- so I wanted to be reminded of how great this one is supposed to be. Now I know I'm not alone in my confusion. This book came very highly recommended, but I've just been waiting and waiting to enjoy it. I think I've gone far enough and I can return it to the library. I'm really glad I didn't buy it."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"very bad paper quality. some of them torn on side. papers had different size!!! so some were popping out of book!!! not happy with my purchase."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Our bookclub read this book after Oprah announced it. It is a wonderful masterpiece and the author has a great gift for storytelling. I was so caught up in the setting and the vivid characters and their plights and perils. There are 100 reasons to read this story. Take your pick. ..."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I am an avid book reader, but I have never read anything like this book. It is definitely different. Reviews on Oprah's book club site stated how many people cried at the end. I didn't--I didn't really like any of the characters. I do not know if it was because of a cultural difference or what. Basically I think it was because I could not get over the way Marquez writes about women...and the incest. Let's just say I was totally amazed to find out the author was actually married. However, it is a real experience to read and discuss this book with just about anyone. And the ending is superb--one of the best I've ever read."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"the story is wonderful in its content and story telling methodit simply flows from future to past and comes back to present and so onsince each character in the story has thier own story and plot, i was wondering what happened to Colonail Orilano's son , who he had from Traiza .. the only thing i knew that he went to the war later on i felt that he disappeared from the story"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I had to read this book for my AP Spanish Literature class -- fortunately our teacher was kind enough to let us read it in English. Sure, that sounds like a cop-out but you all know how hard it was to read in English, and trust me... it's MUCH harder to read in Spanish if you're a native English speaker. But I am making it my goal this summer to go back through and read the entire thing in Spanish and I still love it as much as I did the first time. It gives me headaches to try and read it, but I know that it's totally worth it."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I read a lot of books and I read them quickly...classics, NY Times best sellers, etc. But this book pretty much stopped me in my tracks. It took an unprecidented MONTH to read and understand this book. I was constantly rereading pages because the characters are so numerous and their names so similiar that I could not keep track of them. I nearly quit reading the book a few times. Magical realism is definately an acquired taste which is why I had to read it twice before I decided I liked it. And I liked it A LOT! Definately read it once, everyone should. Then go ahead and read it again because it really takes two readings to figure out the many different plots and characters. I promise its worth it!Now I'm going to go and start reading Love in the Time of Cholera."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I am not what you can call the quintessential Classics aficionado, a couple of the books of that ilk I ventured into having bored me to death with their dreary dull plots, where 200 pages into the book you are still awaiting the drama to begin, and not having a clue of why on earth the man (or woman) in question does the things he is doing. Mostly the books I have enjoyed reading are the ones which had characters one could classify as human, earthy and realistic, the drama arising from the extraordinary situations they find themselves in. As such, the blurb on \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude\\" (OHYS) should have ensured a quick rebuff on my part, what with its mythical town of Macondo, and a profusion of complex characters bearing confounding names living (and dying) in most surreal situations. OHYS is all that I have laboriously stayed away from - Gypsies and flying carpets, ghosts walking in and out at their own random free will, a torrential downpour which lasts more than 4 years, men and women locking themselves up for years together into the confines of their rooms - just to mention a few among the plethora of [...] things Marquez throws at you in wonderland Macondo. But once you sift through these seemingly inane and outlandish curios, what reveals is an intricate story of raw humans. OHYS lives up to its reputation of \\"fecund, savage, irresistible ...characters rear up large and rippling with life..\\" I don't yet make a claim to have discerned the more profound matters dwelled upon by the author, sufficient justice having been done to these by significantly more qualified people, but what I read is something I enjoyed tremendously. If not for anything else, this book is recommended just for Marquez's irreverent and comical treatment of all that we hold as fundamentals of life itself."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I am an avid reader, and I don't mind a challenging read. I started reading this book at the suggestion of some colleagues, and a woman in my book club. I know it is considered a \\"modern classic\\", won the Nobel Prize, etc. - but I couldn't even pretend to like this book. To the author's credit, his imagery and descriptions are beautiful. I admired the magical world that was evoked by the style of storytelling. But the plot was next to nonexistent, and after about 100 pages, I really felt like I was on a road to nowhere. The story went off on tangent after tangent with no real, identifiable purpose. Reading this book gave me the feeling of being locked in a room with a very creative, yet nonsensical crazy person that won't shut up. After a while, it gets old."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I picked up this book to read it because several of my friends were reading in from the Oprah book club. It is a complex novel with many characters and a very mystical feel to it. The writing has a stream-of-consciousness style to it which makes you feel like you are listening to someone tell you a story with lots of side remarks. My issue with this novel was not the mystical feel or the writing style, though they do take some getting used to. My problem was that the whole thing just seemed to be about war and sex, and although both things have their place in life and literature, they weren't things that I wanted to read an enormous novel about. Also, this book is really quite tragic and I just prefer to read things with a more positive spin. I can see how this novel would appeal to some people because it is so complex and meaty....there is a lot to the stories in this book! It just wasn't for me."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I am not going to go easy in my criticism but frankness is the best option. I was forced to read this, literally, because it was for a required class, during summer break. Well, I thought that since the book was in a tropical setting, I might as enjoy myself. Well, did I get a cool breeze indeed! First of all, like all great families, this family described in particular like to name their children alike generation after generation. That's not the worst part: they even like to name them alike in the same generation, so I got lost by the middle of the book and had to constantly retrace the family tree.And of course, if you want to entrench yourself on such a reading journey, better be prepared for incest. Even though the book is mostly against it (with the superstitions etc.), the first generation mentioned is a fine example of it.The imagery is great, but I wouldn't know if that is the work of the original author as I, like many other Americans, read the translated version. It is a great book to build up vocab, because apparently the translator interpreted it as so. I was very glad to be done with it after 2 weeks (a usual novel with this length usually takes me less than a day to finish).Of course, it's not the worst book I ever read. Try Moby Dick or The Bluest Eye if you're looking for another different form of torture."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I enjoyed it mostly although it was hard going. I'm not sure what it was about except I think it was partly about how we can live very close to other people and still not understand each other at all. This was a group of people leading lives of solitude although they were supposed to be family and community. I grew to like the weirdness like the ghosts, and the bizarre happenings. I think the author was writing as if what goes on in your own head was actually real. The cover said it was enthralling - I did not think so. It also said it was supernatural, magical which it was."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This is without a doubt one of the top 20th century novels, and as such, very much has been written about it.Some clasify it as an epic, while others try and find all the symbolism and deep meaning behind the story of Macondo and the Buend&iacute;a family.Let me just say that more than a great novelist, Garc&iacute;a Marquez is a great observer. As a colombian, I can honestly say that the events depicted in this well written novel are not as far away from our reality as might seem at first. Things like the ones descibed here do happen in small &quot;conte&ntilde;o&quot; (from the coast) towns throughout Latinamerica in general.I am sure that for quite some time Gabo had a laugh at the expense of all who searched for the real and inner meaning of Cien A&ntilde;os de Soledad, and who wrote innumerable pages full of interpretations.This book is simply the story of a town as told by a grandmother to her grandson.You either love this book or you hate it, and if you hate it, it's because your world is too small and simple and you do not have the imagination it takes to understand this as an account of my &quot;bananero&quot; country's reality.Do not miss this book."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"During the summer of 1986 I visited DisneyWorld with my parents and, by a strange conicidence, ran across one of my father's very good friends from Puerto Rico. At that instant, I was carrying a book recommended by a friend of mine: One Hundred Years of Solitude. I had barely started to read it, and my father's friend told me that I would never read any book better than Garcia Marquez' initimate history of the Buendia family.And by golly, he was right. I heeded his advice and read the book in a harried daze while waiting in line for the rides at DisneyWorld and Epcot. And when I finished it, I was so amazed. I never knew that writing could be so dazzling, that a novel could be so endearing and challenging. In fact, this book made me fall in love with the delicate microcosms of novels, with the passion and power of words.And to this day, One Hundred Years of Solitude has been a steady and well-worn companion. I took the book with me to college, to law school, and even on trips to the Carribbean, South America and Mexico. In times of stress or hardship, I would read about Macondo and its generations of inhabitants, and suddenly be touched. I doubt if I will ever read a book again that has inspired, affected, even changed me as much as this book. The book and I are good friends; and as I sit and write this review, it sits there, on my bookshelf, its tattered and weatherbeaten spine enticing me once again: &quot;Read me, old friend. Read me once again."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I took this book up twice before I could go through with it. First time I got confused by the character names. Second time I couldn't really understand the plot at all, because it was so strange and fantastical and dropped it 100 pp in. The third time I could not put it down. I think you need to have a strange sort of patience and level of acceptance for things that can't be easily categorized or named. Strange things happen in this town and to this family. Yet, in all the strangeness you can see real history, sad as it is.This book is one of very few that changed my life, my view of people, families, life. I think you need to be ready for this book in some way or another and be accepting. I saw a few people complaining that the book is immoral because it depicts incest. How can a book be immoral? Incest may be immoral but it happens in life and the book doesn't promote it in any way."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"\\"Most critics don't understand a novel like One Hundred Years of Solitude is a bit of joke.--they take on the responsibility of decoding the book and risk making terrible fools of themselves.\\" - Gabriel Garcia Marquez. This is far from a difficult book as many here seem to think. All of the similar character names, did not confuse me but rather lent themselves well to the jocular & whimsical fast pace of the book. (The naming kind of reminded me of an old joke about Sam Frank & Frank Sam. The similar naming is deliberately confusing as the telling of the joke moves at a fast clip so that right at the point you're starting to say \\"what the hell?\\", you get hit with a punch line that makes you spit your cookies in laughter - if you recall it at all, the punch line was \\"I left my harp in Sam Frank's Disco\\".) To \\"get\\" this book, you have to sit back, relax and let it sweep you away. If you can manage that, it moves at a quick pace, is quite amusing and never confusing. Don't worry that you can't keep up with the character names. That's actually not important like it is in most novels. Though I don't profess to know the author's point in writing the book, the point I took away from it is that life is pretty much a crap-shoot and in the end, nothing really matters. So chill out and enjoy the ride as much as possible. This is now my favorite work of fiction, unseating my previous long-held favorite, To Kill a Mockingbird."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I knew I would hate the book. I can't stand magic, fantasy books or huge sprawling books. The short elegant novel is for me. But I thought I'd just try a few pages. A day later, my work copletely ignored, I emerged exhausted but exilerated. Yet, this is one of the greatest books I've ever read and I have reread it now several times, always amazed at the power and beauty of the writing."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I first read this 33 years ago, while in college, and was utterly wowed at the sweep of these stories, all interlinked yet standing on their own. I was studying the classics - and in particular, oral history - so this was doubly fascinating as a streaming narrative of magical realism.Having re-read it for the first time, I was again astonished at the life and complexity on every page: you laugh, you weep, you hope, and you judge. The details are woven in with the greatest mastery, and stick in the reader's mind long after the book is finished. My favorite image is the ice scene, which became a touchstone in my memory 33 years ago. The story throbs with life you can enter, while remaining unbelievable. It is as good as any mythology and so much of it remains unexplained.The structure of the narrative is essentially circles within circles: there is a powerful founder (who can pull a horse down by its ears) who founds a city; he is an inspired man and leader, who degenerates yet still controls or sets in motion everything that happens over the next 100 years. The variations in the family are fabulously well portrayed, as they superimpose themselves back on eachother in endless patterns of repetition - skill, intelligence, beauty, political conviction are not enough to break out of the essential pattern. The only thing that will precipitate an end is to reach the end of the largest circle, which is related to the Sanskrit manuscripts written by the greatest friend of the founder, a mysterious gypsy.What makes the whole thing work is the characters, who are wonderfully succinct and pass through a hundred years as naturally as the cycle of plants. While some readers hate this, I found it utterly charming and exotic, yet chillingly psychologically real. Even with ghosts and miracles.This is one of the best books I have ever read. The work is so rich and experimental that it is unclassifiable. It made me feel wonder all over again, even in middle age. I would posit that this is a work of genius. Warmly recommended."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"There has been renewed interest in the work of the Nobel Prize winning Columbian novelist Gabriel Garcia Marquez. The keystone of his work is \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude\\" originally published in 1967. A reissue edition of the novel published in 2003 by Harper Collins and translated by Gregory Rabassa tells the story of several generations of residents of the fictional town \\"Macondo.\\" Like the South American macondo tree, the people of the town have roots both in and above the earth. In simple declarative sentences, a style he learned from his mother's oral histories of her family, Marquez describes every aspect of the lives of the people from birth to death and beyond. Macondo lies in solitude between the mountains and the sea, and the several generations of characters mirror that solitude in their personal understanding of the world. Idiosyncracy and passion are common denominators in the diverse characters who are all full of life but respectful of death. The reader quickly enters the story by learning to abandon the traditional sense of time, space, and social structure. Then Marquez takes the believer on a marvelous conscious and unconscious journey through the human condition."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"By far, out of every great novel and bestseller and &quot;epic&quot; I have ever read (granted I am only 20) this is the book I compare all others to. The only other book to come close is Bellefleur, all other books wither and die and blow away compared to this one. Beware - after reading this you will be continuously disappointed with all other books you read. This book deserves a platinum, diamond encrusted shelf of it's own."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This novel is one that allows you to reflect on our place in life, and how small we are in this world, yet how big we are in terms of how we can use our lives to impact others. Such an awe inspiring novel that is written with such vivid emotions and warmth, yet leaves you feeling very cold and alone in the end. Extremely moving, and fantastically written. I could not think of a more appropriate title to this novel."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"But then, we expect nothing less from Marquez. I believe One Hundred Years of Solitude is his tour de force. The juxtaposition of humor, astute observation and metaphysics makes this a work that should survive far beyond Marquez and his avid readers. This one's the best of Marquez. A must read."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"...but I just couldn't. I've heard for years about what a master of the craft Gabriel Garcia Marquez is, so I finally gave him a try. I was disappointed, to say the least.To be sure, he has a way with prose, and he does an outstanding job of creating those first sentences that draw the reader in. After the first few pages, I was interested, hooked, and hopeful. I loved his descriptive language, his ability to paint a scene. It left me wishing I had a better grasp of Spanish so that I could appreciate the subtleties and beauty of the original language.But as I progressed through the book, it became pure drudgery. Characters came and went so quickly (and with names far too similar to each other) that I was unable to connect with them and care about their lives. I was often confused, flipping back to the family tree to try to figure out who was doing what and how they were related to everyone else. I could not like or identify with a single character.The fantastic elements felt random and sporadic. They weren't magical or mystical; they were simply odd and distracting.For the last 100 pages or so, I was reading just to finish it so I could move on to something else. I didn't care about how he would end it. (Incidentally, he seemed to just finish writing without resolving anything). And once I finished, I was left with the question: what was the point? What was he trying to say? Why did he write this book? I have no idea.Perhaps it means I know nothing about good literature - that is more than possible - but I couldn't find much to like about this book, and it makes me hesitant to try anything else by GGM."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"The first time I laid my eyes on the Sistine Chapel, something stirred. It was not a logical, mental analysis of the mastery of the ceiling, but a gut wrenching feeling of smallness and awe. I stayed there for maybe 2 hours before I could gather my wits and walk away. I've been there again. A few times. Every single time I haven't been able to stop staring at the ceiling until my neck hurts; however, that sense of awe is diminished.That happened the first time I read &quot;A hundred years of solitude&quot;. Since then I've read it at least 20 times, understanding a bit more with every reading and appreciating the magnitude of Garcia Marquez' masterpiece. However, nothing in the world compares to reading this book for the first time.I am envious of all the people who haven't read it. It is there for you to discover."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"It is impossible to describe this book in all of its facets, just in a few lines of text. It's too complex for that, it has too much depth. The magic-realistic style in which the book is written makes it difficult too penetrate to the deepest meanings that the writer put in it. I am sure that I missed much, so much that I want to read it again (but then in my native tongue Dutch), something I normally never do.It is also convenient to have some knowledge of the South American history, which has been woven throughout the whole book. I missed that knowledge, although the book makes a lot clearer about that history. De numerous civil wars have never led to something good, a leaning to power leads to isolation.Despite the lack of background knowledge, the book is definitely an absolute must for those who have the ability to pierce through the magic shell of sometimes absurd supernatural events and penetrate to the core of the story. Enervating was the speed of the story; from the first page it takes hold of you and drags you along with breathtaking velocity. On every page something happens, never does it become boring for a moment.What fascinated me the most was the deepening of the characters, who are described in a very crystallised, almost caricaturised way. Solitude, pride, hatred, love, fear, devotion and so on are enlarged, but still these qualities stay completely recognizable.M&aacute;rquez has, to my point of view, received completely rightly the Nobel Prize for literature, which was based mainly on this book. It is not an easy book, but who takes the trouble to read it will not remain untouched."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I was recommended this book years ago by a close friend, who considered it the best book she had ever read in her life. When I finally broke down and bought a copy, it took me forever to finish this. I believe that this was due in part to Marquez's annoying and often-confusing habit of giving every male in this three-generational family a derivative of the same name. (The family tree at the beginning of the novel became a favorite resting nook for my baby finger.)But while lengthy, this novel was never boring, as the author's prose were always poetic, lyrical and interesting. However, I kept wondering where these characters were going. The last chapter wrapped everything up nicely for me, causing me to more closely consider the meanderings of the characters who I had lived with for the last month. It made sense. Tragic, lyrical and memorable, but not the greatest novel I have ever read."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I have read this book many times, starting when I was fifteen years old.It was my first \\"cannot put it down\\" great literature book.I have become convinced that it is truly the best book ever written.I read it in Spanish (my first language) every time but once; it is an excellent translation but it is a translation.

I never made it beyond the first chapter. Then on a visit to Colombia I was determined to read this book. I kept at it. Before long I was totally absorbed into the story, which is truly fascinating and amazing. Now I don't know why I could not get into it on my earlier attempts. I'm so glad that I persisted. So, the book that I originally couldn't get into, finally became one of my favorite novels."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I had to read this book for my English class. I didn't know anything about it other than it's legendary status. As I read it, I enjoyed it. It took me time to get through it and for me, it was not the kind of book I could sit down and read a page or two during commercials of the TV show I was watching. But more than I enjoyed it while reading, I enjoyed it even more afterwards, as strange as it sounds.Since finishing the book over a month ago, I am constantly thinking about it and being reminded of it by daily life, which to me is the mark of a truly impressive novel. I really can't wait to go back and reread it, something I don't normally do, especially with books of this length.Garcia Marquez's writing style was something new for me, and I don't know exactly how to describe it. It's a great book to read for school because there is huge literary value. And even more than that it's a story that everyone can relate to in some ways. Maybe the thing about Garcia Marquez'z writing is that he doesn't come right out say everything, leaving a good portion of the meaning up to the reader's own interpretation. Sometimes I feel like authors try to do this to make their books seem deep, which just makes the book seem pretentious, but I did not feel that way at all from this book. I think every person who reads it will have a different interpretation of the subtleties. And I think your interpretation will change over time, which is why I'm excited to reread this in another 10 years and see what's changed.Bottom line: Very cool book and worth reading. Don't be intimidated by it's length and while some parts are slow, everything is integral. It's a beautiful piece of work that can only be fully appreciated if read cover to cover."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This is not your typical novel. It's difficult, confusing, strongly metaphorical, and far more concerned with history and message than any deep look at its characters. At the same time, it is sometimes lyrical, beautiful, inventive, and given to unexpected trips to the magical, just when it seems bogged down in a very harsh reality.It's the story of the town of Macondo and the family that help found the town, stretched over the hundred years of the title. It's clear, when you step back from the details of this work, that the entire work is a metaphor for what happened to Columbia, from its early run-in with the Spanish invaders through the exploitive actions of companies out to rip the riches from the country with no regard for the human cost of their endeavors, and on into to the modern day world of political corruption backed by barely sheathed threats of force.The family that the book follows is unique in many ways, peopled by characters both incredibly strong and driven by obsessions, and yet insular, separated from the real world by their own internal fantasies. Here we find the rebel hero and the dominating matron side by side with ghosts, the Wandering Jew, and highly mysterious gypsies. However, all of these characters are seen from a distance, even though we are privy to their internal thoughts and ideas, and it is difficult to get emotionally involved with any of them. Not helping in this regard is the extreme similarity of names through various generations of the family, and frequent references to the genealogical chart at the beginning of the book are necessary to try and keep everything straight.Stylistically, be prepared for page long sentences and sudden multi-page discourses not immediately connected to current happenings. Often this prose is quite beautiful, and at times very effective in painting pictures of some very horrible occurrences in ways that can sear into your brain. Also be fully prepared for the flights of magical realism, when you go from the mundane of everyday to things clearly impossible in ordinary life, items which often highlight by contrast the depth and trivialness of the ordinary.If you are looking for a straightforward story with normal people, this is not the place to look. If instead you are looking for something very much out of the ordinary, and willing to work to find the core of what's happening, this work can be quite rewarding. It's doubtful if a single reading of this work will expose all of its potential, there is too much buried meaning, symbolism, and metaphor here that needs careful inspection to yield its full treasure. Its themes are not uplifting; futility, the constant of man's inhumanity to others is stark, the repetitiveness of the actions and character types from one generation to the next leads one down the path of asking what purpose does anything have, and the pervasiveness of each individual's necessary isolation from others keeps a dark cloud over the entire work. This is a somber work, with its gold carefully buried, and the reader must be a diligent prospector.---Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I read this book a few weeks ago and was intrigued by the subject matter. Gabriel Garcia Marquez weaves a beautiful tale of mystery and wonder. The story center around the Buendias living in a fictional Central/South American town. We're lead through the lives of each person generation after generation, each person has different story and you would think that this would get redundant but with each new birth I am anxious, awaiting the next tale. There is a legacy that continues through each and everyone.It's uncoventional perhaps, there's no true \\"hero\\" or a central story line. But Marquez somehow effortlessly flows from one generation to the other without an annoying break in the story. He just simply begins one story and ends another simultaneously without leaving any questions or doubts. And you would also think that all of the similar names that jump around would get confusing but they surprisingly don't, that somehow is not a problem.I don't know how he does it but Marquez tells a simple tale with poetic grace and ease, never boring the reader and never losing ground or stalling. That is a true feat in itself. He blends without announcing it the fantasy world with reality, engaging the imagination and keeping you turning the pages. The anti-climax was breathtaking and the simple ending should have been boring, but it wasn't.I strongly recommend this read, it's a tale for the ages."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE is not an easy book to get through. But it's one of those cases where the cumulative experience of the journey is worth more than the steep-grade labor exherted along the way.What's confounding is that the first hundred pages or so are very interesting and engaging, whetting your appetite for a quick and easy telling of the saga of the Buendia family.But then Garcia Marquez subtlely shifts gears, and the more you get to know the multi-generational Buendia clan, the less you seem to know them. The more you long to sink your teeth into juicy character specificity, the more you're left with desiccated symbolism and generational templates.Garcia Marquez achieves greatness in this book by managining to tell the story of a family (and by extension, all families) without ever getting very close to any of the members that make up the family. The book's power comes from its hypnotic, fuzzy insistence that its hero is the family itself, and that you can know everything about it, without really knowing anything about it.It's a both frustrating and inspiring reading experience, not unlike trying to find the rainbow above a lawn sprinkler."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Just an interesting connection I found between my English and Spanish class:No hay mal que dure cien a&ntilde;os. (Literal: No evil shall last 100 years; English: Nothing bad lasts forever.)1. Writing Style/ Readability: The writing style is what truly makes this a five star book to me. Not the plot or the characters or even the depth of it. Granted, the original was written in Spanish, but I don't think that too much was lost in translation. If I ever become fluent in Spanish (and I'm crazy about this beautiful language!), I'll happily read the original as well. Marquez's style (or the translator's, however you want to view it) is very smooth and enchanting, and appeals to my childlike fascination with anything magical. Oh, and there's actually a lot of humor in the book if you're paying attention.2. Plot - lots of interesting stuff going on, but there's not one \\"true\\" storyline to follow, as it seems like a never ending list of random happenings. Basically, you're following the lives of a family from generation to generation, getting to know each family member's personal story, some more than others. People die mysteriously or go insane every chapter or so, and it's tough to predict what's going to happen next. Marquez's foreshadowing at the beginning of the book is clever; he sneaks in lines about the far future to make you do a double take (\\"years later, when Aureliano faced the firing squad...\\"). The mystery of Melquiades is the common fragment that frames the entire story. I actually wasn't that impressed by the ending, but to each his own.3. Characters - let me just tell you right off that they're almost entirely unrelatable. They lack any real personality and I felt no emotional connection to them, especially since they tend to come and go in the story. (the exception of this being Ursula) However, I think this could also be viewed as an intentional exaggeration by the author...The only two \\"real\\" emotions that the Buendias have are lust and loneliness, which, in my opinion, are two of the strongest emotions that a human being can have. Lust is such a primal desire and it's obvious how much it still has hold of us even in this modern world. Loneliness is a more complex emotion, but I think that anyone can empathize with the conflicting feelings of wanting to be with someone so much, yet also being afraid of rejection.4. Overall Originality: Yes yes yes. That's all I'm going to say about that.5. Value (was it thought provoking): For me, personally? Not really. The ending, though, was a tad depressing in that it left me with the message of \\"life is a cycle, we all die, everything you do is pointless\\" which is why I tend to avoid books about philosophy because sometimes thinking too much about the universe makes me think as if there's nothing that truly matters because mattering is nothing after all. And now I've made myself depressed. Moving on.6. Enjoyment - this book was entertaining because of all its intricacies and twists and turns. It also really inspired me to write, which usually only happens when a book is fantastic or awful.The Bottom Line: read it because it's different from anything else you'll ever read"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Gabriel Garcia Marquez's Nobel-Prize winning One Hundred Years of Solitude is a brilliant, world-renowned novel that recounts the history of the Buendia family over a century's time. Often considered the masterpiece of his writing career, One Hundred Years takes place in the fantastical town of Macondo, which was founded by the Buendia family's patriarch, Jose Arcadio Buendia. The story begins from the first generation of Buendias, that of Jose Arcadio Buendia, and then concludes at the seventh and final generation. In this widely recognized work, (also the next best-selling Spanish novel after Miguel de Cervantes' classic, Don Quijote) Garcia Marquez weaves a tale of love and heartbreak, happiness and rancor, humor and mystery; while largely incorporating elements of his mastered magical realism in every chapter.One Hundred Years of Solitude begins with the founding of Macondo, a small town in South America, by Jose Arcadio Buendia. He and his wife, Ursula, along with their family, leave their home in Riohacha, Colombia in the hopes of finding a better place to live. Upon arriving in the town that would soon be Macondo, the Buendia family sets up camp at a place in the woods and sleeps. That same night, Jose Arcadio Buendia dreams of Macondo as \\"a noisy city with houses having mirror walls\\" (39). (In this excerpt, Garcia Marquez toys with the magical realism idea of mirrors that Jorge Luis Borges incorporated in many of his poems.)After exploring, Jose Arcadio Buendia declares the land an \\"island\\" and from there, he seemingly invents a new world within Macondo, naming all sorts of things at his own whim; since \\"the world was so recent that many things lacked names\\" (42). After the official establishment of Macondo, it becomes a town often victimized by strange and supernatural events. (Some of these events are hard to understand if read or understood too literally--Mexican literary critic Luis Leal has said that \\"if you can explain it, then it isn't magical realism.\\") Garcia Marquez features ideas of magical realism, fused with other religious ideas, as well as unsettling but entertaining superstitions very much throughout the novel. To fully appreciate the Macondo that Garcia Marquez creates, you must let go of all pre-existing conventional, practical ideas regarding literature and fall into a new, fantastical version of \\"solitude.\\" It is very much worth it!One Hundred Years of Solitude, now translated into over 37 languages worldwide, is an important novel that any reader/writer should read. Gabriel Garcia Marquez has influenced many authors, mastering the genre of magical realism and putting Latin America on the literary map. One Hundred Years is entertainingly mystical, yet unsettlingly real--but above all, it is unforgettable."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"If you're a fan of magical realism and Latin American literature, you MUST read this book! Garcia Marquez is an incredible writer...an absolute genius...and the translator did an amazing job. If you are not familiar with magical realism, it would be wise to read about it before reading this book so you can enjoy the book for what it is and not read it too literally."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"One Hundred Years of Solitude tells the tale of the Buendia family and the town of Maconda, whose history is as enchanting as it is enthralling. It's the story of gypsies and scientists, banana plantations and dancing Italians. This is the birth of magical realism: a story that's entirely absurd and inventive, and at the same time entirely true.The writing is as magical as the story; it's easy to see why Marquez won a Nobel Prize. The book flows beautifully together, but at the same time the words can be so spectacular it's almost difficult to breathe.Do expect to be put off a little by the nature of the story. Some people may even be offended by the seemingly careless disregard of incest, suicide, and sexuality in the book. Some of the events are somewhat bizarre and disturbing, but they tend to take second place to the writing and overall emotion of the book.The only other issue readers may have with the book is that the actual plot is not always clear. Names tend to be used multiple times, making it difficult to follow the story. But often times, the sense of ambiguity actually enhances the experience of reading the novel.This is a book meant to be experienced more than it is meant to be read. You have to be prepared to abandon your sense of reality; over thinking can actually complicate things. It's easy to become frustrated with the seeming repetitiveness of the tale, but the minute you let your mind wander, everything, from the flying carpets to the ramblings of a gypsy, makes sense.At the same time, it's very easy to become emotionally attached to the story. The characters seem to effortlessly gain your trust one moment, only to abandon it the next. The choices they make seem to affect you as if you knew the characters personally. That's the magic of Marquez's writing. The characters may as well be alive; because everything they do changes the way you live.All in all, a simply extraordinary novel."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"\\"One Hundred Years of Solitude\\" is not for everyone. It is one of the most fantastical books ever written. In style it is somewhere between \\"Still Life with Woodpecker\\", \\"The Electric Kool Aid Acid Test\\", and \\"The Satanic Verses\\", but perhaps with even weirder events occurring. It is a book you will want to take your time with, re-reading a lot as you go so that you soak up the style; and going back to previous passages to review how the characters are changing as time passes."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This is a stunning literary masterpiece. It takes some patience to get into but once you are involved in the story, it is difficult to put down. God, after I finished reading the book it felt like I went into shock.

Will stay with me for the rest of my life."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I read it in Spanish since is my native language, and it's a beautiful book. I have read like three times. However if you are a native English speaker the traslation may not cause the same effect to you and might find it very difficult. It really is a challenge to read tis book."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"\\"Magical realism\\" doesn't begin to describe what Marquez does here. In a breathtaking feat of imagination, he creates a world that exists in a parallel universe--an alternate reality just out of our reach, but so close you feel that if you could just stretch our your fingers another fraction of an inch, you could actually touch it. I've read it twice, but not for the last time."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I'm one of those who found One Hundred Years of Solitude fascinating and enjoyable. The style definitely made it for me; Marquez's prose is misty and mythic in a beautifully descriptive way. I never lost interest in the story. It's told in an unusual manner, more like an oral history or legend than a written work. After reading it, I could see why Marquez is called the \\"South American Faulkner\\"; the style in One Hundred Years of Solitude can only be compared to a book likeThe Sound and the Fury. I have called it misty, but it's deeper than that. The haze over Macondo is analogous to the haze of memory itself. I was thoroughly satisfied and amazed by the book. For me to attempt further description of its marvelous intricacies would be to rob you of the full joy of reading it.I was disappointed, though, when I sampled some of Marquez's other works.In Evil Hourfailed to hold my attention at all, and the only novel that has even come close was Love in the Time of Cholera. Marquez was a good author and journalist, but he didn't have the consistency to maintain the style he achieved in One Hundred Years of Solitude. I would wholeheartedly recommend OHYoS to anyone interested in this book or this author, but I would simultaneously warn him or her not to expect to find another book like it. Perhaps it's best that way."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"A few writers in each generation are gifted with such writing talent that they create books that make you catch your breath. Gabriel Garcia Marquez is one of those writers. His gift with prose, the way he uses language, his storytelling ability is staggering. This is an engrossing read from the very first sentence. You will be captivated by the magical world that has been created and the all too human characters that populate the story.For reading pleasure, I would recommend the Harper Perennial Modern Classics edition of this book, which has those very convenient flaps on the front and back covers that make perfect bookmarks to save your page when you do manage to put the book down!"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Thank you Oprah for selecting this book. I absolutely loved it!I owned this novel for a few years before I actually sat down and read it. I often read the first page and felt it was dull - I was wrong. Solitude has become one of the best novels I've ever read. Garcia-Marquez not only includes vivid descriptions but also incorporates everything a novel should have from sibling rivalry, to war, loneliness, magic, humor, drama, incest, sex etc. Solitude is often mysterious and delves into all of our dark thoughts, while also showing our desires. I often found myself frustrated with the decisions the characters made yet understood why they made them.I cannot say enough about this wonderful novel, except I just regret waiting so long to enjoy it."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"As I read the first third of the book, I kept having to go back to try and figure out which of the Jose's (there are MANY - half of the characters have the same name, it seems) was being discussed in each section. It was extremely frustrating - but I kept on going.In the middle of the book I stopped trying to pay any attention to who was who and just read each anecdote as if it stood on it's own - congratulating myself when I recognized the character from previous events.At the last - I finally started to know and care about the characters and really appreciate the beautiful images and the intense feelings and situations that make up &quot;100 Years of Solitude&quot;. (By this time, I was also determined to finish it because my sister assured me that the ending was satisfying.)It was satisfying - to the point that the final chapters made me flip back to the beginning of the book and read parts over again. Still, I can't give this book the rave reviews that the critics and fans of Gabriel Garcia give it - there were just too many Jose's.I suppose that makes me a lazy reader, which is probably true. Still, the ending made me wistful that I had been half as involved with this long lived, passionate and magical family from the beginning."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"(...) This is a beautifully written book that manages, as successfully as any other book has, to capture the enormous wealth and breadth of the human experience -- from one family (and one town)'s point of view. No book could ever encompass the entire human experience; but this book does a hell of a job, beginning with the founding of Macondo to its eventual obliteration(guess how many years later). One reviewer states that reading the book feels like reading Genesis from the Bible, and I think that's about right.To those of you who dislike/have trouble with \\"magical realism,\\" just relax. Yes, you'll have problems if you think literally but what are books for? What is fiction for? Fiction is MADE UP. Good grief. Pretend you're at a movie, suspend your disbelief and get into the beautiful writing and wit and humor. It's a difficult book at times and the fact that everyone has similar names is very annoying, but what rewarding book isn't challenging?After you read the book, find Marquez's short stories, some of which are about Macondo and flesh out some things that the book leaves out (e.g. Big Mama's Funeral Carnival).I don't like or watch Oprah, and her choosing of this book is a little disturbing because now she's plowing into the territory of books I not only can't sneer at but absolutely love. Well, I suppose it had to happen sometime."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"One Hundred Years of Solitudeby Gabriel Garcia Marquez is an amazing and wonderful book. It displays magical realism at its best and weaves through the lives of the Buendia family and the town of Macondo which they have founded.One single sentence can give you the shivers and the wording and phrasing of this book is amazing! So deep and profound with such intense language then you end up loving and obsessing this book and lamenting that you can't write like Marquez.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes magical realism, Latin American literature, reading classics, or just being inspired and touched in a raw and unusual way. It's one of those books that you could read over and over again for the rest of your life and you would still be discovering something new and different each and every time.SUMMARY:Probably Garcia Marquez's finest and most famous work,One Hundred Years of Solitudetells the story of the rise and fall, birth and death of the mythical town of Macondo through the history of the Buendia family. Inventive, amusing, magnetic, sad, alive with unforgettable men adn women, and with a truth and understanding that strike the soul.One Hundred Years of Solitudeis a masterpiece of the art of fiction.RANDOM INFORMATION:Marquez won the Nobel Price for this, so I would also recommend you read his acceptance speech which you can find on the internet (but DO NOT read it until AFTER having read the book)."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Who is experiencing 100 years of solitude? The people who march off into the jungle and establish the village of Macondo, a town isolated for 100 years until its destruction. These people include 6 generations of the Buendia family. We meet pioneer Jose Arcadio Buendia who leads his people to the spot, and Colonel Aureliano Buendia who leads a left wing revolution in the outer world. We also meet a number of other Buendias named Jose Arcadio and Aureliano.The women are remarkable. Pioneer wife Ursula lives a supernaturally long life, from the superstitious wife of Jose Arcadio who fears that her children will be born with tails, to the Biblically old lady who is treated like a toy by the little children of the house.The book's biggest drawback for me is its sprawling confusion. Michener has done cross-generational books like Hawaii that are direct, serious, sensible. Where Michener's work could be compared to a lifelike painter like Titian, Marquez is more of a Picasso."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I've read other books by Gabriel Garcia Marquez and have enjoyed them. This one left me cold, however. The story was very muddled and Marquez wrote in such a matter-of-fact style that there were no ups and downs. It was like watching a heart monitoring machine. Whether someone was being executed, eating lunch, or anything else, Marquez just stated everything very matter of factly. Also, the names in the book were far too similar for the average reader. I just wonder if the people who give this book great reviews are doing it on its own merit or whether they are afraid to break from the pack. It reminds me of the Emperor's New Clothes where everyone was afraid to admit that they didn't know the emperor didn't have clothes on for fear of looking stupid. Of course, it could just be me. I look for things that have a real plot or a real end they're striving for. I didn't find it in this book. I also found the spiritualism hard to believe such as Remedios the Beauty ascending into the heavens. That's a bit much for even a romantic person."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This book is written with a meticulos particularity that is hard to grasp. Following the bloodline requires a geneology chart that was provided in the front cover of my copy.Gabriel Garcia Marquez captivated me with his realistic characters and the mystical events that shaped this area. Noticing a parrallel between the expansion of human beings from the beginning of civilization and the progress of the town of Macondo is essential to understanding the book's promise.The book is difficult and causes many people to put it down. However, after reading this book I placed it on the top of my bookshelf and admired its brillance. It is rewarding."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I read this book long time ago. I really liked the style, besides the story line, that is very good.

It is an intense read, and it is funny one."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This book was beautifully translated, there was nothing that was lost. Every generation blends together so well that it's amazing. I know others find it boring at times, but I found that there isn't a moment of boredom while reading it. I loved this book. It was so very well-written, and the characters truly shine and come alive. I think everyone should read this classic!"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I agree with my fellow reviewers who judged this one of the great masterpieces of 20th century fiction. It is one of most wonderful novels I have ever read. (And re-read.)The book is an epic, deliberately styled as a parody of grand 19th century Russian novels that trace the stately history of royal families over generations. The book deliberately means to confuse the reader in its use of family names, but always does so with a light-hearted wink at the reader. (Hence the indispensable family tree printed at the front of the book.) Yet, in parodying the epic genre and inserting astonishing and hilarious sequences of magic in the plot, the book reclaims grandeur on its own terms.The family characterizations themselves are deliberate parodies of courtliness and generational standing, with the principal characters climbing literally from the dust and mud to individual greatness, generation by generation. Each generation is conscious also of an overarching familial greatness, passed down from some remote and misty time almost back to the moment of creation.Finally, to jump far ahead here, we have the book's miraculous ending. Miraculous in style, pace, and content. How can one give sufficient praise to this ending? How does Marquez manage to create heart-stopping tension through a plot device so simple--the description of another geneologic chapter? Yet, this is what he accomplishes. At the end, the reader is pulled breathlessly along, finally to have confirmed what he or she already suspects--that preternatural forces are encapsulated in the very chromosomes of the Buendia clan.Of course, there is even more here. The writing and imagery are unfailingly beautiful, and good humor is never far from the surface. Pictures of rural life are vividly and lovingly drawn.Overall, this is an exceptionally great novel, one of the greatest of Marquez's books, and an astonishing triumph of fictional architecture."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":".Ive read this book two times in a space of a year. I can tell that the second time Ive read it, on the original language it was written, Ive liked the story better than the first one.then i went through the book with the impression that the author never lets the history gets down from the first paragraph to the last, wich I hadnt on the first time I\`ve read it. This usualy happens on many great writting at some point. But also with the impression that the charachters are not very personal... perhaps this impersonality, also present on the similarity of names, is a necessary condition of this particular narrative and not a fault of its own.I think the experience is rewarding the efford of going through this half a thousand pages twice. The first time one reads it, one might get entangled on the multitude of personages with similar names and the spam of time it ranges.But the author is very crafty and very often makes reference to former and future events relating them, so one never gets lost and always feels on the center of the story.this also gives the impression of unity that so many minute events would make rather etherogeneus, like the storyes of 1000 nights.I would like to suggest people to read it two times, and what would help but it is not absolute necessary, have a paper at hand and draw a genealogical line as the personages appears through the narative.also look for Mario Vargas Llosa's essay on this book. There one can get an account of many levels of interpretation of this tale wich is a fary tale, a cronic, a history study and a romance.."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"One of the greatest books ever written.

Couldn't put it down, then struggled with overwhelming gloom after finishing it. He pulls the reader into the tale; you smell, touch, feel, and live the moment. Unfortunately, the moment is a bad place to be. Not for the faint of heart."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Set in an untamed region during an Edenic time, this epic novel spans generations of somewhat bizarre characters whose lives take surreal turns. The writing in this novel is incredibly good, but the content is not for everyone. There are some sexual situations which are also quite surreal and taboo. Some people might read this book and be awed by the creativity, while others might find it strange or revolting. Marquez is a unique voice, no matter how any one reader sees him. For my part, I read it with a nonjudgmental stance on the content -- it is, after all, fiction -- and I think it is easily deserving of its Nobel Prize."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"...but it will be worth it.This is a tough read. The author uses many of the same names for characters through five generations of one family, the Buend&iacute;as. You'll find yourself flipping to the front of the book where the publisher conveniently provided a family tree so the reader can make sense of the characters and their genealogy.The story itself has a surreal element, an element of constant struggle and an element of solitude that each character inherits.The level of detail that M&aacute;rquez visits lures the reader in. At times, especially while reading right before bedtime, I felt like I was a townsperson in the story's fictional town, Macondo, observing the Buend&iacute;as. M&aacute;rquez is an artist, using written word as medium.I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"It would seemt that some fools don't understand that this isn't a review of the supplier of the books, or the shipping and handling, but the book itself.Marquez offers sterling prose that can't be given justice in any review. He's the father figure in a movement that'll surely be known as the revolution of Spanish literature. An absolute must read. His works should be required in every high school."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Marquez's work is full of magic, quirkiness, and sadness. His story cannot be contained by traditional conceptions of time, plausibility, or even reality. The characters are as rich and alive as the narrative and both are remarkably memorable. The family tree in the front helps with the many characters but don't worry if you have a little trouble differentiating them. Enjoy this book; it is truly delightful."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Marques is one of the most intriguing Latin American writers of his time. Even though I had to read this book for my Latin American Literature class and I was on a time restraint, I loved every moment I spent with the Buendia family. This book has everything from wonderful magical realism, to incest, to flooding and plagues. In many ways One Hundred Years of Solitude is a parallel to the story of Genesis, with occasional deviations. I loved Marquez's theory of circular time as well, because it contradicts how we think of it as proceeding in a linear fashion.I suggest that you do not give this book one chance. The first time around might be difficult, but the more you read, the easier it gets. This book is written so that it can and should be read over and over throughout your life. Once you get a taste for Marquez, you will be hooked."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This is absolutely the most wonderful book I've ever read. I read more than one book every week, so what can I say!! A must read, which you will not want to put down. There's so much to this than just the story.. Beautifully written and wonderously haphazard presentation!"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"As we end the millenium, and we as 'modern men' continue to replace 'solitude with sex' and by thus creating the same spiral cycle we cannot escape,we are all condemmed to one hundred years of solitude. As I turn forty this year, it has been 25 years ago when Gabo gave me his novel to read. I've read it every autumn since then.It's still a wonderous masterpiece!"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"The greatest and the most beautiful, moving, and spiritually uplifting book I have ever read."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I read &quot;100 Years&quot; as a seventh grader in 1973 - and have searched for a replacement (someone permanently borrowed my copy) since!

This is what a great piece of literture can do. This book has such unforgetable scenes, that one cannot differenciate between dream and reality that exists in the story, but takes over your mind and don't let go till you set aside the book. And even after, you will be captivated by the imagineray that has gone into this masterpiece."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Asking someone to rate this book as a work of fiction is like asking someone to rank Shakespeare as a playwright. What else can be said - this book is almost without peer. The only reason I am writing this at all is that I would like to respond to some of the other reader's comments about the ending.The ending to this novel is what earns it, not a ten, but a twelve! Perhaps one book in a thousand has a last page that brings the whole book together, knocking the wind out of you and making you feel as though you'd been hit by a bolt of lightning. Of those rare one in a thousand books, this is one of the best! Read it and see - you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I read this book 3 years ago, my first and best one, because of my parents. I fall in love with it and discoverd the world of novels. Three months later I had read 6 other titles of Garcia Marquez."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This is not a happy book as many other readers have said in their reviews. It is a novel of depression and introspection showing both the saddest and brighest sides of solitude. But the characters' solitude is not like me locking myself up in my room to read this book. It is deeper, describing something existential, a way of life that is disciplined in the joyous festivities and in the deep mourning. My lasting impression of this book is not that of beauty or wonder, but shock in the speaker's accurate description of the human condition."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"As close to literary perfection as any work of fiction I have ever read. What does one say? Reading it was like reading the revealed word of God. Upon completing the book, I just sat there knowing nothing else I could ever read would approach the perfection of this book."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Garcia Marquez is the best writer in Latin America. He show to the hole world our pains, our fantasies and our feelings and nobody can make the same like him. He is so sensibile like his own people but he have the great chance to tell things in beautifull and wonder words (I hope you can understand my english)"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I started reading One Hundred Years of Solitude when I was still in school. I didn't understand the book beyond 100 pages.Such intense writing, i though. And so elusive! I gave up half way through with a promise to myself that I woild return to it. I did return to it a couple of years later. in the meanwile, i read copiously about the book one of them being an essay by salman rushdie. i began to relate to the book. it was strange. soon i could imagine talking to marquez himself and to Melquiedes, the gypsy whose note in Sanskrit lay at the heart of the story. Being an Indian I had read a bit of the anciant language in school. It felt a if it was our book, a 400-page note from my village. Strange though it may sound, i was rolling in such intimate experince without having read--or as ithough at that time, \`understood' the book. it was with a mission to comprehend Marquez that i picked the novel again. I began reading and read it for a week...over food...in the bus i took to my college...in the canteen...everywhere. A week later it was changed man rereading the back flap of the novel. It was an epiphany, a divine realisation of a truth that had eluded me all my early youth. It was: you do not have to \`understand' a book like One Hundred Years of Solitude. Yes, one does not have to understand the Bible, does one? One does not have to understand any work of art. It was this realisation that has had the most profound impact on my subsequent life. I thank Marquez for having written the novel. I thank Joyce for being so difficult I thank Flaubert for not writing non-fiction I thank Dostoevsky for having written at allMy review of One Hundred Years od Solitude is: It had to be writen. Good that someone with Marquez's gift wrote it."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Why"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I approached this novel with reluctance. A friend recommended it but said it was best to read it in the original Spanish. I don't understand Spanish, but I decided to try the English translation. I was overwhelmed. For days I was in a trance. I could not and did not want to pull myself away from Macondo and the Buendia family. The words hypnotized me. The scenes evoked haunted me during the day and filled my dreams at night. Gabriel Garcia Marquez has created a masterpiece in any language."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Having read Chronicle of a Death Foretold, I knew of Garcia-Marquez's ability to narrate a story from the omnipotent viewpoint. However, after finishing the book, I realized that, much like Melquiades did, GGM had woven a delicate and pointed history of all of us. There were elements in each character that we could identify with, some more than others. But, the essence of life in Macondo is the same as the essence of life anywhere. What GGM has done should live on forever, being read by as many sets of eyes as possible. It's a shame that Macondo is not a place we could physically visit though, I think we'd all do well to spend some time there. Kudos and huzzah to you, my friend. I call you my friend because I feel like you already know me, and not just the good parts either. Then again, that's what makes life so interesting, the not so good parts. And that's what Macondo is full of."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Having heard a little too much about Garcia Marquez before reading the book, my expectations were not extremely high. However, the symbolism and magic-realism and beauty of this incredible history of a family swept me away. I encourage anyone that enjoys Latin American literature, or literature at all, to find this book, read it and pass it on."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"If you have read anything from Marquez, you know he is indeed a god with words. This book is at the usual Marquez level - absolutely fabulous!!"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Marquez is a GOD with language. I loved this epic. Few books have held me as tightly as this one did."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"From the opening sentence to the last paragraph, this book had the power to remove me from the present and lift me into the lives and times of the Buendia family. If the reader can suspend analytical thoughts and reactions and enter the world of magic realism created in the pages, he will be rewarded with an adventure and characters as vivid as any he could ask for. I am embarrassed at just how much of the deepest meaning of this book I don't understand, but am more than satisfied at having read what I consider to be a masterpiece of creativity. This is one of the few books which I purchased after having read it. I felt a need to own it -- so I could read and reread the last three pages, each time with tears in my eyes and my heart beating faster. I thank the friend who introduced me to Garcia-Marquez, storyteller extraordinaire."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I recommend that readers try to forget about all reviews they have read about this book before they start reading it. It can be a dissapointment if you expect to read a &quot;life-changing&quot; story, or be captivated by one character for the rest of your life. I don't think Marquez intended his characters to be captivating figures. They are ordinary people, like most of us; with their loves, hatreds, mistakes, and stupidities. What makes you admire Marquez is the way a hundred years of human life is displayed in this novel with such fluency and glow, and not so much the nature or ending of those stories. The book takes you through many faces of life: happiness, sadness, grief, annoyance, despair; but always keeps your heart warm. It leaves a sweet-bitter aftertaste in your palate; but that's it. Don't expect it to remain there to change your life."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Even now, as I write this review, tears gather in my eyes. It is a most unforgettable book. I am amazed at Marquez's sensitive genius. I will never tire of reading this book."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"As I opened this book, I thought to myself &quot;Wow! This seems like a great story!&quot; I found myself growing more depressed and disgusted with every page. Although the style and Marquez' technique are unquestionably wonderful, the overlaying themes of lust, lack of self-control, and immorality outweighed the good. The goal of nearly very character's life is the same; to please him or herself. Very few characters are in the least bit caring of self-sacrificing. The only way I could reconcile myself to reading this disapointing work was the fact that it is a lesson in man's depravity. I realized that every person, without God's intervention, is just as bad or worse than Marquez' perverse characters. The book is not without its high points- I loved the ending, the mystery of the Segundo twins, and Ursula's strength. There are some passages where the language is incredible. Marquez is a mastery of imagery! I only wish that there had been more positive images to remember...."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"The story line was very interesting and compelling but the family structure was very disturbing.The Buendia family are not very loving or emotional towards each other."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I have to read this book for a Great Books meeting in two weeks, but I don't think I can finish it. It took me six weeks to get halfway through it because it is so incredibly boring that I have a hard time motivating myself to pick it back up after putting it down.The characters range from unengaging to infuriating, their multitude and the fact that most of them have very similar names is confusing (especially since the story jumps back and forth in time), and their actions are often revolting (what a bunch of spineless, brainless women, and let's not even think about the macho men!).I find the book thoroughly unentertaining and pointless. What is the author trying to say? Is there a message somewhere? What kind of story is this supposed to be? Since it contains surreal things like flying carpets and quasi-immortal people, I'm guessing it's some sort of fairytale. If it is, all I can say is that the Brothers Grimm wrote better fairytales than this guy!"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I usually love anything that our girl Oprah says to love. But not this time. This book was good, but at some times it was hard to follow. This novel was difficult to keep straight. I probablly would have given it a extra star if everyone wasn't named Jose something or something Jose(sorry, I can't get the accent thing to work). This novel did run the gauntlet from comedy to tragedy and love to death to war and everything in between witch made it very emotional. This book was also a kind of history textbook witch is ok if history is in your blood (no pun intended) but it is not in mine. Irregardless it was emotionally satisfing. But it could have been improved if it could have been simplified."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This book won the NOBEL Prize?

Believe me, do not waste your money."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"My High school english teacher swore that this was God's gift to literature. I tend to disagree. I understand what Garcia Marquez is trying to get at with his symbolism, but the reptitious names and slow plot make a good book lag."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"It was a required reading in college in 1990. It was boring then as it is now. No wonder it was selected as an Oprah Book Selection. Most Oprah's book are boring but with HYPE.The story does not follow any logic even within the story itself. You will get confuse with the repeated combination of names that are used througout the story. I believe there are only 5 (Jose, Aurelio,Miguel, etc) Fiction does not follow logic I know but usually a story (even a work of fiction) sets boundaries within the story itself and are bounded by this limit. This story is a waste of paper on which it was written. Marquez is one of those overhyped writers with nothing to show for. I guess this is the result of some literary critic needing to sell some books to get a comission from the publishing house.Sorry if I was mean but I was forced to read it college and felt that it was a waste of time and money."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"What a horrible book; hard to read; too many characters; I never did figure out what the whole thing was about. I can't believe this won a Nobel Prize. Definitely a waste of time reading."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Yawn. 400 some pages of nothing but incest and death. Characters with the same name throughout the book. Non-linear time, too, it's very hard to follow. How could this &quot;book&quot; change your life? I have come to fear love, it's like your emotions are being dragged through the mud and everything you hold dear and ethical are just pushed away like its nothing. It was about incest, personally, maybe something was lost in the translation. It was so depressing and disturbing. I could not sleep without lights on after I finished reading it. I would never suggest this book to anybody who has a weak constitution or is easily emotionally disturbed. NOT good reading for a highschool student. Even Faulkner's The Bear was not about incest (it was bad too)."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Consider the following situation:A really old lady-bawd is trying to stall a policeman that has come to shut down her 'business', while her 'girls' escape through the back window.Her incoherent, unstructured, filth-prone, 400-page long gibberish-babbling whas then written down and served to you in the form of this book.

I did enjoy it."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This book would have been easier to read and understand if all the characters had not been named the same or been given similar names. If I didn't have to endure chapter after chapter of people sleeping with each other who shouldn't be, incest, rape, pillaging, death, destruction, more incest, then maybe this book would have been as great as everyone makes it out to be. I understand the last chapter was supposed to explain everything in the book and it does to a point but it doesn't excuse the fact that this is NOT the next best thing to GENESIS! We reviewed this book in our book club and out of 20 women, only 2 liked the book. I think this book is way over popularized due to Oprah giving it a thumbs up in her book club. Maybe it reads better in Spanish..maybe more than one chapter in the book was mistranslated (yes, there are 2 chapters that are mistranslated). I'm not sure. ... Disappointing and a waste of money."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This book is confusing, it jumps around to much, to many generations in the book. I could not understand this book at all."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I wanted to love this book because I'd heard so much about it. I somehow managed to avoid having it assigned to me in high school and college and finally this past summer got around to reading it. I don't know what the fuss is about. The novel doesn't present a bad story but it also doesn't tell a great one to justify its status as a modern classic. The opening line is truly brilliant but after that the plot goes off into a meandering pan-generational story about a family in a backward region of South America that didn't stimulate my interest very much. Maybe it illustrates how little truly goes on in this novel when I point out that my favorite part of this book came early on when a centuries-old Spanish helm was discovered in a creekbed. To say that a minor moment like that was the best one of an entire 120,000-word novel isn't that strong of an endorsement.I also have to say here, I hate it when \\"discussion questions\\" are printed in the back of a novel. Just something intellectually-exclusive and arrogant about the practice that peeves me.An okay book but not among the greats."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This novel is written in very interesting and compelling prose, but its characters are hardly worth the effort. The charaters are obsessive bores that can only be compared to day time soap opera characters. After reading through half of this novel, I was so numb from the constant tragedy and melodrama, that I simply did not care what happened to the characters anymore. To make matters worse, the plot is extremely complicated and very difficult to follow, with new characters added every chapter.The most amazing thing about this book is its popularity and that it helped its author win the nobel prize."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Yes, this is a good book and I had no trouble following it. I've read quite a few books in this genre. It is pleasant escapism, nothing more and nothing less. I think all \\"magical realism\\" is. It takes you into a completely different world for a while.But calling it \\"required reading for the human race\\" and a \\"literary masterpiece\\" is going a bit too far. It hardly ranks with the likes of Shakespeare.It is interesting reading if you enjoy this type of literature, so I recommend it."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This book came highly recommended by a friend.

YOu want to flip some pages and keep going. Usually people who want to sound very &quot;literate&quot; try to talk you into it... be aware, is not the &quot;flowing through the pages&quot; type of book. Some understanding of the culture behind the whole story would be a good idea even before purchasing the book."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I was expecting a consistent story or at least an engaging narrative that takes fantastical twists. Instead, so many characters are introduced (many have the same name) making it very difficult to care about any of them. Also, the struggles between the rebels and whoever it is they are fighting (and why, come to think of it) are vague and uninteresting. I can't imagine what about this book is so transfixing to so many people. Count me out, I guess."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I absolutely detested and despised this book. Some masochistic bent made me finish it, like some sort of martyr. I read well over one hundred books a year, so it's not like I'm some dodo right out of the beanfield who's never read a book before and can't judge its merits. There are certainly many instances when, even though a book may not be to my taste, I can see its artistic merits, and why people would like it. Not so in this case--I can find no redeeming value to this drivel.I found this book to be pseudo-intellectual psycho-babble. The style really annoyed me. If it was supposed to be \\"magical realism\\", then why were the magical parts thrown in like after-thoughts every 50 pages or so? For the most part, I forgot about the \\"magical\\" part until another reference came again from out the blue, with absolutely no connection to anything else, at least in my opinion.Worst of all, many of the characters have similar-sounding names. I tried keeping them straight, then realized that was a waste of time since I didn't give a damn about any one of them, no matter what they were called. First rule of writing: give the reader at least one character to care about. The writing was done in an \\"arms-length\\" style, which did not allow me to get emotionally involved in the least with any of these characters, or care one whit about anything that happened to them.I can't remember another book that was actually torture for me to get through, but this one definitely was.It must have been a VERY slow year for Nobel Prizes when this dreck won."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"It's fun to tell members of the overeducated elite that you didn't care for this novel.

If this is the best the world had to offer at the time (Pulitzer Prize winner), then I fear for this nation. It was confusing at the beginning (conflicting ideas presented - it speaks as if it were the beginning of the world, but the characters find ancient items). And the story line is jumbled.Personally, I found no enjoyment in the reading of it. The symbolizism that we were supposed to find was buried so deeply that I had to research it on the internet. I finally found a few things written on the symbolism, had to re-read most of the book to find it, and consummed quite a bit of headache medicine to get through it.It was far too long for what it had to say...which wasn't much. Never have I burned a book in my life. I took special joy in planning an overnight camping trip for the sole purpose of watching it burn."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I wanted to read this book because of the title.It really intrigued me.But during reading I could not find any solitude.Life of people in Macondo was overfilled by lonless, but everyones life is like that.The only character I like is Jose Arcadio Buendia because his way of isolation was very comical.It was funny when he sat over the tree and did exactly nothing.I enjoy making the gold fishes by his son,too.The end took by surprise on me.However, my feelings after reading was not very fast and I felt like did not get that, what I had expected.I think it needs a few rereading to understand it."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This is the novel that made the author succeed and it's obvious why. A story which seems it's never going to finish, has an incredible ending (I read the last page like a hundred times already). A personal advise would be to get a chart of the family tree, otherwise you may not enjoy it as I have"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Reading a Hundred Years of Solitude is a total experience that dominates one's existence while engaged in it. It was even better the second time I read it, and I rarely read a book twice. Garcia Marquez sets a standard for this genre of magical realism that authors, like Rushdie, try to match, but so far no one has come close. The evolution of Macondo and the Buendia family is so alive and captivating with it's tale of tragedy laced with humor as the modern world invades it. Melquiadez, the visiting gypsy also plays a major role, and one is haunted by his presence even after his death. If you haven't read this book, your missing a major work in 20th century literature. This book will become one of the great classics of all times. To read it in Spanish must be even more of an experience, but the English translation is excellent. Just writing this review makes me want to read it a third time, there's so much going on, the reader is never bored."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Iloved the sex parts."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"It took me a long time to finish this novel, but every step of the way was a joy.

I've read fiction books that are realistic and ones that intentionally aren't, I still dont know where this one lies. it truly is amusing.I think this is simply the best book I've read."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I read this book during a summer break because a close friend recommended it to me. \\"You may want to keep a chart,\\" he warned, referring to the daunting number of recurring names in the novel. Well, I didn't keep a chart, but I quickly realized it's easy to confuse specific characters with one another. It seems those who dislike this book are often people who read it for a class, where memory of precise details of plot and sequence is more important.One could argue that the confusion of names is an intended effect, and says something about the relationship between the characters, family, or maybe humankind in general. But regardless of all that, I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and not at all for the details of the plot. Rather, I enjoyed the novel for Garcia-Marquez's writing style and his incredible ability to create entertaining, intense, and provocative scenes and stories, which are cleverly interwoven to produce the novel's whole. I found I lost myself in all the small stories throughout the read, yet after I finished the book the connection between all of the scenes and characters and stories left me with an array of impressions that came together in an intense and beautiful way. So basically, the novel was an enjoyable and thought-provoking experience, even if I mixed up a name here and there."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"There is just so much in Gabriel Garcia Marquez's Pulitzer winning novel that it is difficult to just begin to review it. Macondo, a magical village where time does not exist in the real sense is the center of this novel. We follow the lives of the Buendia family from the beginning of their lives in Macondo to the very bitter end. Marquez uses magical realism to describe the characters, events and surroundings in this novel; it rains for five years, there are mystical gypsies that come and go, people are assigned superhuman powers, butterflies appear when characters arrive, there is even an ascension..and that's just the beginning. There is so much in this book that it tends to become confusing and laborious reading at times. I was fascinated by the characters they are rich and quirky but exhausted by the amount of events that took place. What is interesting to note is that many of the side stories in this book come from Marquez's own life and the history of Columbia. There are so many themes and statements that at times the reader is overwhelmed just thinking of all the implications. I loved the style of the writing and the thought of reading this classic, but when it came right down to it, it was a task that took alot of time and effort and in the end was only mildly satisfying."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I don't understand all the hype with this book. I bought the book and the companion spark notes prepared to read one of the world's greatest books. What a grind! Repetion and silly literary tricks. You'd do better to find another \\"classic\\" like Moby Dick, Don Quiote, some Faulkner, some Hemingway, Stegner, Steinbeck, etc.At least now I can brag that I read it. Unfortunatley I could have spent the time reading something more rewarding.If you want Spanish authors, try Jorge Borges. Now there's a great writer! Deep though. Be prpared to ponder the symbolism....but it's different than pondering Marquez' symbolism. Marquez has a style where things don't necessarily make sense so you think \\"he's a great writer so it must be symbolic -- otherwise he wouldn't have lead me down this path\\". Borges, on the other hand make the story interesting AND DEEP."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I read this book because Bill Clinton recommended it. I am a science-technology person and not knowing much about what constitutes good literature I rate books by how they 'feel' to me. This is an interesting book. I read it twice a couple of years apart and still don't 'understand' it. I do, however, like the 'feel' of it."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I read the english version in one week and am now reading it again. Its a fascinating book but I wish Garcia Marquez was my neighbor so I could ask him the millions of questions that I thought of when reading the book. The books captured my mind, soul and heart, I actually cried seeing colonel Aureliano, my second favorite character reduced to an old, solitary man. My questions are: What time periods does the story take place? Is this left unanswered so readres from any century can relate to it, since it is a story of humanity in every century? Does GGM really believe our lives are written in stone and untangible? This book makes you thgink about life and everything youve ever done in your life. It makes you think of your family and their similarities to characters in GGM book. I recommend it tro anyone who thinks they can handle sex, war, trauma, death, human decay, and every single human feeling."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"My youngest daughter - in college - seems very well pleased with this selection... like the professor gave her a choice, right?"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"As usual, the writing is excellent in this book. Good descriptions; it always draws you right into the setting and the story like you are really there. The only problem I have with it is that there is not much of a plot. I am on about page 100 out of 400, and I don't know where this story has any more room to grow. There are a lot of characters and sometimes the whole thing is a little thick and I struggle to keep up, much less have the will to."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"100 years of solitude is an extremely well-written novel. The town of Macondo is personified through the Buendia family. It was the Buendias who founded the town and their lineage that is followed in the story. The town (like the Buendia family) is a desolate and solitary place that rapidly matures until it is destroyed. From the founding of the town, to the installment of the banana company, to the town's destruction, Macondo is destined to remain in solitude. Like the Buendias, the town never really reaches its full potential. Although the novel is extremely graphic and somewhat depressing at parts, from a literary point of view, 100 years of solitude is a fantastic novel."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"An interesting book.

Why should I find it romantic that an adult male virgin has fallen in love with a prepubescent child? Yuck!"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"100 Years of Solitude is a dense, confusing novel that is seemingly endless. Most of the characters have the same name - either Jose Arcadio or Aureliano for the boys and Amaranta or Remedios for the girls. The chapters are long and have large amounts of action. Most of the chapters are very similar: incest occurs, a child is born, named Jose Arcadio, he studies Melquiades, fights with some people, has a mistress, several children, and then dies. I do not recommend this book for anyone that wants a quick/easy/interesting read. It is well written and conveys many themes and such, but is purely painful to read."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This is a great book!Now on Oprah's Bookclub list 2004!!!!"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Is the first thing that came to my mind when I saw the raving reviews here.

I didn't like the translation of the book. If the novel was written in Spanish and then translated into English, I would sit there and say to myself that I loved the descriptive, but not the flow of the sentence.

Fiction or not. Actually to make that up, speaks for it self as far as I am concerned. And Oprah of all people to recommend that in her book club. I clearly missed the point about a lot of things and that male characters shared names did not make it any easier. My husband read it as well and we felt the same about most passages.

While I believe LOVE IN THE TIME OF CHOLERA is Marquez' best novel, ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE is probably his most mesmerizing. From the very first, beautifully constructed sentence (my favorite book beginning of all time) the reader is immersed in the world of the Buend&iacute;a family and their town Macondo. Meandering, episodic, and always entertaining, this is a book to be consumed with childlike wonder as the narrative drifts through time, plot, and many confusingly named characters. There is an intentional blurring of character's names that can leave the reader confused. However, this is not a novel mainly about characters. It is about the passing of time, of the intractable mysteries of life, and about the tragedy of joy, and the joy that follows tragedy."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This novel is the best ever, no novel i have read caused me feel like i'm in a dream, so strong so penetrative, it keeps you wonder how a man can write such marvelious piece of art.So recommended."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Like many others, I had quite a hard time \\"getting into\\" this book.

It is also the only time I've ever shed a tear while reading a novel. Pure genius."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"As many reviewers have noted, it is not an easy ready but well worth the time and certainly the effort.There is love, intrigue, war, life, death, laughter and tears. All told in the classic Latin American Literature style. What more can a reader ask for?Pick it up, read it and dream about the characters for days."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"For those of you who have read Marquez before this book will not dissapoint you, in fact I think its one of Marquez best.For those of you who havent, this is a great way to start.This is the story of the Buendia family and how things happen through the years. It is full of memorable passages that will make you think that what happens to the family and the town can be related to different passages in world history.Dont worry if after the first couple of pages you are confused by the many names and vatriations of each. The characters and their story are so unique that the similarity in names will have little importance.I think Marquez tells a good and enjoyable story that can be enjoyed by everyone at anytime and you will find that after the first few pages it will be hard to put it down.Granted that I read this book in Spanish so I think it might feel a little different reading it in English and maybe some events will seem strange if you are not familiarized with the way families behave in Latin countries.Totally worth it though."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I bought this book in a second-hand bookstore and read it a whole long summer day from morning to late night... what a ride. the book is written with great style and rich detail and is funny, extremely inspired. i didn't find it hard to read, even though the family tree of the Buendias became really too complex to bear in mind as a whole... the effortless colorful style and its great span of storytelling that includes a long line of characters all connected by some mysterious bond, repeating a cycle, learning to bear some form of their own solitude - i think it is a great book that brilliantly mirrors not just a few people but the whole changing of generations. it is refreshing to think of ourselves in terms of long lines of families that come and go, have their own ways and ups and downs. a great book with excellent style that really stands out."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"What is it about a certain work of fiction that keeps us coming back to it, time and again, as if we're all ancient travellers on the same road of life? ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE is such a work; whenever I travel I take the book with me, dip into its pages, as if I'm skinny-dipping into familiar waters, revisit its characters and scenes, savor its language and wild flights of imagination. Gertrude Stein once said, \\"If a book is really true, you'll always need it again.\\" How could a work of fiction be this true, this powerful, this overwhelming in its understanding of the human condition? Damned if I know. And I write fiction all the time, with everything I've got, every muscle and bone in my body. Maybe it's got something to do with \\"magic realism,\\" with the way you tell a story, not conventionally in a straightforward narrative fashion, but rather, in a series of concentric circles, hovering around the characters, around the events of Macondo and the multigenerational families that occupy the landscape, that live it, breathe it, and make you, the reader, part of it."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This translation of Marquez's quintessential work does great justice to his remarkable prose. The clarity and depth of Hundred Years' symbolism and the excellent development of the Buendia characters send the reader back to an austere but complicated time - a time of exploration, political upheaval, and social transition. One criticism of this translation is the absence of footnotes to specific historical, cultural, or social elements of life in Colombia in the past two centuries.\\"Taciturn, silent, insensible to the new breath of vitality that was shaking the house, Colonel Aureliano Buendia could understand only that the secret of a good old age is simply an honorable pact with solitude\\" (p. 199).Overall, a great read!"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This book was written in Spanish and was translated into English by Gregory Rabassa, and I felt he tried to stick as closely to the Spanish language as possible.The sleeve of this book summarises the story of \\"the rise and fall, birth and death of the mythical town of Macondo through the history of the Buendia family\\". True, the writing is sometimes amusing and witty that I burst out laughing while reading it, like the feasting dual between Camila, 'the Elephant', and Aureliano Seguando. I also like how the author describe Ursula, the Matriah of the family, goes about as lucid as ever, even after she became blind, as she discovered every member of her family repeated the same path, same action and the same words at the same hour. It's only when they deviated from the meticulous routine did they run the risk of losing something. Quote: \\"The search for lost things is hindered by routine habits and that is why it is so difficult to find them.\\" How true!Some sub story on the different members of the 6 generation family is just so incredulous. Remedio the beauty not only captivated men and eventually killed them, but her secnt lingered on wherever she had been. Then there is the fluttering yellow butterflies to signal the appearence of Mauricio Babilonia, and Fernanda, whoes father sent her children gifts of saint statues every Christmas, and whoes last gift is of himself in a coffin.The book starts with the marriage of two cousins, Ursula and Jose Arcadio Buendia, who close boodline marriage was a constant source of worry, for it was believed that the offspring may be born with a pig's tail. Cleverly, it ended with the birth of a son with a pig's tail, the result of an affair between 2 cousins six generations later.The book was difficult to read because the names of the offspring were repeated as they were named after their fathers. So in the book, there were 19 Aurelianos and 3 Arcadios in 2 generations. Luckily there was a family tree diagramm for readers to constantly refer to in case they got lost. The use of pronouns 'he' and 'she' even after 2 subjects was discussed also lead to some confusion, as i had to figure out which subject the author was referrring to.It is a clever book and only a genius of a writer could clearly articulate the different characters that make up this 6 generation family and the detailed relationship between each one."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I recall reading, in Harold Bloom's analysis of OHYS, a phrase that sums the book up more solidly than any other of which I can think: \\"crammed full of life.\\" This is a novel so full of life that it seems to exude from the pages, dripping into your mind and creating a beautiful, complex tale.Garcia Marquez is a master. I make my allegiances clear and unabashed with that simple sentence; the reader of this review must take into account that I absolutely love Gabriel Garcia Marquez, and I have read almost everything he has written. This is the crowning point of it all; it is the book that made him famous, and for good reason. OHYS is full of vibrant characters and sometimes-fantastic events (such as the plague of insomnia in the beginning, or the invasion and disappearance of the banana company), cycling through generation after generation of the Buenia family and the town of Macondo at large.There is humour aplenty, moments of drama, moments of sorrow, and scenes that are representative of nigh every human emotion and feeling of which I can think. Some may be turned off the surrealism of the book at certain times; for instance, when a character floats up into the heavens and disappears. These strange events occur in the middle of the story, with almost no incredulous reaction from the other characters, and they are why Garcia Marquez is called a magic realist. Magic Realism isn't peculiar to Garcia Marquez, but he is probably the most well known writer within the loose genre, and contends with Jorge Luis Borges as the best. I recommend, if this style turns you off (if you love it, reading the following is even more necessary!), that you read a few works as sort of primers for it: \\"The Metamorphosis\\" by Franz Kafka, and any of the short stories of Borges--THE ALEPH and FICCIONES are the best two compendiums of his stories. Both authors are precursors of the magic realist genre that culminates in Garcia Marquez and his contemporaries, and, though they are actually significantly stranger, are somewhat more believable in the \\"realistic\\" sense of the word.Many have noted or complained about the characters names--this is a fair point. Many characters, over the some hundred and twenty years the book covers, share the same name or very similar names, and, especially for us English speakers, these names can be very difficult to keep track of. You will almost assuredly have to refer back to the family tree from time to time, so it is best to mark this page. I do not think this is a negative, as many families, could we see them in their generations, would have similar circumstances; it is simply a difficulty that requires more attention. Remember: this is a work of literature (and a great one at that), not a romance novel.Garcia Marquez is, along with Borges and Dostoevsky, tied for second place among my favourite prose authors; only Tolstoy ranks above them (this does not speak to their weakness, only to the latter's power!). OHYS is his best work, and sits alongside CRIME AND PUNISHMENT as my favourite novel besides WAR AND PEACE. Read it, and you will be infinitely rewarded."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This novel is deserving of all the praise and awards heaped on it. It's expertly written and narrated, it's politically explosive, it's imaginative, and it's blending of the real and surreal could only have been done by such a great writer. It's completely and utterly different from any of the &quot;classics&quot; you have ever read. It's modern and a relic at the same time. There surely are dozens of other reviews outlining the plots and characters of the novel, so let this one just recommend it as a must-read and one of the true masterpieces in all aspects of the word."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Wonderful, wonderful!

Inside were 422 sheets of parchment, handmade from Egyptian papyrus before Moses was plucked from the river and inked with the blood of 16 vestal virgins, caught leaving for the coast. On a cover sheet, printed in black and white on Hammermill bond in 12 point Arial type by an HP 4MP LaserJet printer, was the title, &quot;Cien Anos de Soledad&quot;, by Gabriel Garcia Marquez, translated by Gregory Rabassa.I started reading. The wonder and folly of modern civilization began dancing before my eyes.Just then it started raining. The ink ran and the parchment disintegrated. The band of gypsies wandered off playing &quot;Purple Haze&quot; and our picnic lunch was eaten by the ants."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Gabriel Garcia Marquez stands out as my favorite Latin American writer...well, favorite writer from anywhere. His masterpiece, One Hundred Years of Solitude served as an introduction to his work for me. I was blown away when I read this novel...just the way he thought when first encountering Kafka, I repeat his thoughts: &quot;I didn't know people could write like that...I didn't know it was allowed.&quot; I became completely caught up in the world of the Buendia family from the start and was not able to put down the work until I reached the last page where &quot;la ciudad de los espejos (o de los espejismos) seria arrasada por el viento y desterrada de la memoria de los hombres&quot;After my first encounter with his work, I was not able to stop myself and have now read more into his body of work. I thoroughly recommend &quot;El amor en los tiempos del colera&quot;, &quot;Del amor y otros demonios&quot; and &quot;El coronel no tiene quien le escriba.&quot; I am anxiously awaiting the publication of his memoirs as I know his millions of fans are doing.

Not only is the story of Macondo comic and tragic, but Marquez's description of the story, makes you go to another place.

You won't regret it."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Garcia-Marquez is my favorite autor and &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot; is a wonderful book, one that should be read by every intelligent reader.

It took me about 2 week to read it on the subway and every page kept me coming back for more. The way it is written and the way that the Buendia family keeps repeating history is fascinating and the last few pages of the book were breathtaking and sent chills up my spine. I will be sure to pick up Mr. Marquez's other masterpieces and adore those too."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Garcia Marquez creates a masterpiece in which a family's legacy and a town's history are documented in such magestic detail that ultimately connect and sympathize with the way everything breaks down. Apparently, things are made by man don't last forever, but this story definitely should. This is the type of book that many authors would sell crack to babies to write. It's so wonderfully crafted that it's one of the few books I've ever read where I'm totally fine with wasting hours in a day reading it. And i could easily read every single word from cover to cover again and again. 100 Years should be the book that you first recommend to anyone looking for great fiction, it's on an entirely other level."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"A fascinating, difficult read.

It is amazing that this writer can make you see so many lives in so many perspectives, so many stories intertwined with each other and it allows you to experience them from so many points of view. I loved this book, read it a few times and everytime you find something new, once you read this, you understand some more about Marquez' style.

But as the book went on I really began to enjoy it. I thought it was a very quick read, but not exactly an easy one. The repetition of names throughout the family really threw me off. Thankfully the book is equipped with a family tree right in the front. It got me through the entire book. There is a surprisingly amount of incest embedded throughout the book. But the theme of a journey, and destiny keep the book going strong.I think of all I liked Ursula. The mother of the family and the one to survive through everything, dying at around 120 years old. The family goes through enough turmoil and in the end reminds me of the Wizard of Oz.. Definitely a must read!!!"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"\\"The first of the line is tied to a tree and the last is being eaten by ants.\\" That is a gypsy's prophecy of the Buend&iacute;a family, the center of this tale. The story begins with Jos&eacute; Arcadia Buend&iacute;a, who makes a perilous journey across a great mountain range and starts a town and a family secluded from the rest of the world. The rest of the story follows this family through civil wars, rebellions, betrayal, births, deaths, and the tides of history. It's an epic tale, and there is so much covered in its 400+ pages that the whole thing feels like a prologue or an epilogue. I was waiting for the pace to slow down and focus on one character, but it never really does. Sometimes I liked this, sometimes I felt a little detached. And because many of the family members have the same names, it's hard to keep them straight. But the tales throughout the book are wonderful. I love the magical realism, M&aacute;rquez's writing is poetry, and when I finished I was surprised by how attached I had grown to both the family and the town."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Once you get past Gabriel Garcia Marquez's use of the same two names for the male descendants of the family who make up the main characters, you're drawn into the family's dramas and peculiarities even when you don't want to be. When you realize the meaning of the use of the two names in the latter part of the book, it helps with your understanding of the characters and their actions. As you're drawn into the story of this family, you'll begin to care, almost against your will, about what happens to them and want to tell them the secrets you know and they don't so they won't make the mistake you see them clearly making. Marquez's writing in One Hundred Years of Solitude will have you shaking your head in disbelief, laughing aloud, and smacking the pages in frustration at the actions of his characters. Still, you'll want to know more about them all the way to the last page!"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This is a very difficult book to review. It is universally regarded as a classic, probably deservedly, but that does not mean that I liked everything about it. Gabriel Garcia Marquez is a fantastic storyteller and writes some of the best prose that I have ever read (I'm referring to the English translation, of course; he is supposed to be even better in his native Spanish). I echo the views of another reviewer when I say that this is a tremendously rewarding book if you have a lot of time and energy to put into it. However, if you plan to stretch this book out over two weeks or so, the rewards will be significantly less. This is probably true with all literature, but especially so with this one, as it is easy to mix characters up and get lost in the many intricate personal stories that make up the book. The book traces the history of one Columbian village (Macondo), and one family (the Buendia family) within that village, over five generations. At the beginning, the town is almost like a tropical utopia cut off from the rest of the world. It is pointed out that nobody has ever died in the village. In reality, that is because the town was founded only a couple of years ago, but the irony is clear. Over time, however, the town's isolation is eroded by the intrusion of the state, the entrance of American investors, and the inevitable changes brought on by technological change. This was my favorite aspect of the book. The bulk of it, however, is less concerned with the tide of history and more concerned with the inner lives (solitude) of it's characters. This did not work quite as well for me, but that is just due to my personal preferences. Much of it, though, is that I did not really care for most of the characters. Indeed, many of them are downright detestable. About the only member of the Buendia family I could really sympathize with was the matriarch of the family, Ursula. And there are too many instances of characters doing things for no apparent reason. There are two separate occasions in the book in which a young woman shuts herself off from the world for the rest of her life after her husband/lover dies, although it is not clear from the book why she should choose such a drastic route. One of the most important characters spends the prime of his life fighting the government as a leftist guerilla, although he never once seems to voice any political opinion whatsoever. Most of the characters spend the majority of their time in quiet (surprise!) solitude, brooding in their rooms as their lives waste away. Marquez does have some good things to say about nostalgia and difficulty of recounting the past. And many of the stories in the book are delightful. In fact, most of the secondary characters, those outside of the Buendia family, are wonderful. I kept wishing that Marquez would talk more about them and less about his protagonists. In general, I highly recommend this book to anyone seeking a good story, and those who like reading about people's inner lives. If you a few free days to truly dedicate yourself to this book, you will not be able to forget it."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"100 Years of Solitude is by far the most exraordinary and profound pieces of literiture ever created. I strongly urge everyone who hasn't read it to do so. I must confess that I strongly dissaprove of &quot;A reader from Saint Louis&quot;'s review. Though I completely agree with him or her that 100 Years of Solitude is possibly &quot;the most important novel of the XXth Century,&quot; I beg that you do not follow his/her &quot;pointers.&quot; &quot;Don't keep track of the names. Its pointless...&quot; is a completely false statement. One must pay extremely close attention to names. Do names foreshadow ones fate? Are the twins who they were meant to be named after or have they been mixed up? &quot;You can start reading the book on any page...&quot; ie equally incorrect. Garcia-Marquez's genius is so well conveyed through 100 Years of Solitude that symbols whispered on the first page come into play in generations to come. Enjoy this literary masterpiece!"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"The many characters and the style of magic realism make this book a little difficult to understand. Also, it plays brilliantly with Latin American history, and many readers may not appreciate that. If you feel you don't really understand it, that may be natural, but I recommend reading the Cliffs Notes or something afterward, in order to fill in the gaps. The story is beautiful and emotional, a classic that deserves its status, although time has left it only a little less accessible. This is one of those books that may re-arrange your world, your sense of how to tell a story and what a story is, and how you think of yourself. If you're considering reading it, give it a try, and if it frustrates you, find something that will help you understand it. It's such a great book that there are lots of resources, new ones coming out all the time....Good luck! Enjoy this wonderful, beautiful story."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Garcia Marquez' work is often lost in translation, as I felt after reading 'News of a Kidnapping.' Yet this difficult read goes evedn further, causing a normally fast reader to take an unusually long amount of time to finish reading it. The repetitive names of characters that transcend generations and are all sleeping with one another, add to the confusion, and the reader reaches a point where the several Aurelianos and Jose Arcadios all start seeming like one another.But here in lies the magic of this brilliant piece of literature. The author's power to weave a poetic and magnificent story is incredible. The real yet magical, brutal yet romantic, hilarious but tragic nuances of this book only reinforce an understanding of the characters, and what the suffer through the pages of this book.One Hundred Years of Solitude is a book that leaves a reader pondering the very nature of humanity, family relationships, hopes, desires, ambitions, political beliefs and even the very course of nature. It is dense to get through, but the confusion and concentration it requires only adds to the brilliance of this piece."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This is my personal favorite. Even after 33 years of its translated publication, I was pleasantly surprised to find it in the shelves of the local supermarket with sparkling \\"Oprah\\" label on it. That did not affect my love towards the magical realism or the poetic writings of Nobel Prize winner Gabriel Garcia Marquez.The genealogy at the first page might appear out of place for the uninitiated; but later on, getting confused about the names of characters, you will come back to the page like the dead Prudencio Aguilar searching for water in Ursula's kitchen. Lot of images will stay in your mind for years to come: The Gypsy Melquiades writing the scripts in the daguerreotype laboratory, Rebecca in her rocking chair while her canvas bag making cloc-cloc-cloc sound with her parent's bones inside, Colonel Aureliano Buendia organizing the never-ending uprisings far away from the swamps of Macondo, Jose' Arcadio Buendia in the palm shelter tied to the chestnut tree in the rain with green froth from the mouth, (...) The best of all is the death of Jose' Arcadio, his blood trickling through the streets of Macondo, negotiating all the uneven terraces and streets to Ursula's kitchen where she was ready to crack thirty six eggs to make bread and further, to end in an unsuccessful \\"marinated\\" burial.The writing is just wizardry; mixing the potions of wit, realism and the absurdities of life to narrate the story of the little known natives of Macondo, the land alienated from the rest of the civilization in the swamp.

If you don't think you'll enjoy it... well, you're almost certainly right. It's not beach reading. But if you want to read it and are just intimidated, by all means don't be!To dispel some myths/common complaints: it's NOT particularly long--just the length of an average novel. And the repetition of names from one generation to the next is extremely easy to follow once you realize one simple thing: the name for an individual character is always used in EXACTLY the same form. So, Jos&eacute; Arcadio Buend&iacute;a is always Jos&eacute; Arcadio Buend&iacute;a, and Jos&eacute; Arcadio is always Jos&eacute; Arcadio, etc. No nicknames, no references by first name here and last name there. Just one very specific name per character--to me, actually easier to follow than most books, and certainly easier than a Russian novel where each character can go by one of a dozen different names and they're all used randomly.The one thing that's true is that it's not plot-driven. What it is is a wonderful, rich, rewarding text with lush language and imagery, and one I personally enjoy returning to.If you're interested in sampling Gabriel Garcia Marquez but looking for more of a story, try Love in the Time of Cholera.

If one ever needed to confirm the relationship between force and violence, love and lust, family and acquaintances, this is the book once has to cherish... In the background there is the violence that even today affects Colombia, with the parties still called by the same names and characterized by the same non-ideology. The violence is perfectly described in its horror, in its non - cause, in its lack of purpose. It is as it existed in Bolivar's times and as causeless, goal - less but as pervasive as Bolivar described it and lost hope on it. As Bolivar predicted it, the USA is very much in the horizon, as represented by the United Fruit banana plantations and its zero-tolerance for workers unions. Family life with its strengths and excesses is presented here as nowhere else. The beauty of the human being and its nakedness, the difference between cute-ness and attractiveness in women, the enormous ability of women to carry life, and men, in their shoulders, is shown here like nowhere else. This novel easily explains the Nobel Prize of the author, his being such a great prophet in the world more than in his own land, his being consistently denied a visa to the USA, and the almost addiction of the New York Times Book Review to this author and his books.

It is a beautiful account of a scion of the Buendia family.

Pick up a copy and read any passage: you fill find something strange and beautiful on every page. Many lines I think are comparable to the poetry of Lorca.I cannot imagine the effort it took to write this book, with so much beauty on each page (They say that in the 1-2 year period it took Marquez to write the book his family plunged from sustainability to abject poverty).This is perhaps the most enjoyable book I ever read. I seriously mean that. Usually, at some point, I begin counting pages and chapters and so on, but not with this book. Almost every page is like the first page. Marquez skillfully breaks open the world of his characters so you can feel their blood pulsing while you read.

I went back to it years later when I needed something to read. It actually took me two attempts to read it because the first chapter doesn't exactly draw you in.But I'm glad I gave it a second try because its one of the best books I ever read, folling only to Lord of the Rings, 1984 and perhaps The Unbearable Lightness of Being.One of the things I like about this book is that it doesn't seem to have an easily identifiable main character (which is similar to many of my favourite novels, for example Lord of the Rings and Isaac Asimov's Foundation novels). In other words its more plot than character driven. Its like the family itself is the main character in this one hundred year old story. Also like the two aforementioned novels there are so many characters sometiems its hard to keep track, but its worth it.

Gabriel Garcia Marquez is so adept at making the most tragic situations laughable I didn't notice the sadness of the characters.But the second time I did see the loneliness, yes, the solitude. I think that's why Gabo is so good. Unlike most writers he doesn't just show the realistic side of life, or the depressing side, or even the funny side. He shows it all.

I think he tells us how our remorse, scars, pride, fear, resignation and forgetfulness lead us to live and die in solitude, even in the sea of humanity, and that such lives are, in the end, as if not having been lived at all, for they will not be remembered.For all of the numerous people who populate the story, the character development is deep and wholly convincing of each joy and suffering, of which the ups and downs are considerable as the tale unfolds. The story is told with a mixture of honesty toward the brutality of Columbian national life, rich fables and superstitions of the locality, and Sr. Marquez's own twists of imagination that immensely enrich the experience. The underlining profound themes and the overarching sadness of the story is sprinkled with laugh-out-loud humors and brilliant observations of subtleties of life that reminded me of Milan Kundera, though the context is obviously a world apart.This is one of those stories that, having read, one feels rather exhausted from the emotional upheavals, and needs some time to let it ferment a little. After a while it starts to emit an aroma that challenges one's conscience with the relevance of what was said. It's a story-telling at its best from a Columbian national treasure. And the English translation is superb in capturing the tone."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I was supposed to read this book for an honors english course in college and I never finished it. I just picked it up again, determined to get the monkey off my back and I realized why I never got through it the first time.The symbolism of this book is in moments breathtaking. The characters of the patriarch Jose Arcadio or his friend Melquiades, the indomitable Ursula, you will fall in love with these and perhaps others. I will not argue against the craft of this novel, it's clearly brilliant and worth reading for its illuminating voice and surprising imagery.My issue is with the experience of reading the book. The characters you can really fall in love with show up early in the book and are all dead by about halfway through, replaced by their children and grandchildren who are at worst despicable and at best apparitions. By the end I was left feeling sort of hollow, lost and abandoned by both the story and the characters. Thematically, the book seems to evade making a decision about what it wants to say, or even more than that, it evades even the idea that it should be about something thematically. I'm sure many people will want to lop my head off for saying something like that, but in the end I felt like the book became too symbolic and lost its grounding in reality. The conclusion seemed to say that history at some point will find an end to its cycle and will no longer be doomed to repeat itself. That might be a beautiful ending, except that everything we have come to care about in the novel is at that point a wasteland.So I would say read this book to admire its literary brilliance and significance, but if you're looking for a nice weekend read be prepared that you may end up feeling something akin to desolation."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"this is the one. However, my recommendation comes with a caveot. Make sure you have enough time to sit and read it over three of four days. The longer it takes to read, the more of the story and the characters you will forget, the less the book will touch you.One of the toughest english teachers I encountered spoke of buying copies of this book and handing them out to strangers, just on the odd chance it would end up in the hands of someone who would truly appreciate it. The book draws you in with the amazing, intricate, thoughtful, magical history of one family. BUT --&gt; remember the caveot - if you put it down for a couple of days, it is difficult, borderline impossible to fully emmerse yourself in the story again."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"'One hundred Years of Solitude' is not an easy book, make no mistake about it. Or at least it is not an easy book to begin with. However, its mellifluous, dreamlike narrative, and touching appreciation of so many facets of human nature seep into the subconscious as the story of Macondo's existence unfolds, and I defy anyone to put it down if he or she is patient enough to read the first hundred pages or so.Gabriel Garcia Marquez has created a miniature world in which the inhabitants seem to be afflicted by all the horrors of human society at the same time. The novel is crammed full of so much magical imagery that at times it seems like there is nothing more that the author could have put in, yet the focus is incredibly narrow, concentrating almost exclusively on the fortunes of one incredible family.Ultimately, as Marquez doubtlessly intended, the reader emerges from the final pages as if from a slightly surreal, yet utterly fascinating dream; to adequately describe a century-worth of history in under 350 pages may seem like an impossible feat, but the author does just that and more at the denouement, by entirely subverting all that has gone before.This book is essential reading for anyone with even the slightest interest in mythology, history, sociology or just good old-fashioned story-telling."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE by Gabriel Garcia MarquezReading and finishing ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE by Nobel Prize winner Gabriel Garcia Marquez was a challenge and a chore. I found myself falling asleep at times, at others I wanted to chuck the book. But as I found myself reading more and more of this classic book, I wanted to finish it and wanted to be able to give an honest critique about one of the most important novels written in the 20th century.Why was this book a chore to read? Because Marquez chose to write this novel in the rambling style imitating his grandmother, who would tell him stories when he was a child. There are paragraphs that go on forever, and in fact, there is one sentence that went on for two pages. When I got past that 2-page sentence, I almost laughed out loud. Wow!Next thought comes to mind - was this book worth reading? Yes! The problem with this book is that one cannot just read the first 100 pages and decide \\"this is awful\\". Without getting to the end, one will not have the true satisfaction of what the book encompasses, will not understand what the book was about. When I got to that last page, I put the book down and realized I had just finished an epic novel by an author that obviously deserved the Nobel Prize for Literature. The book was indeed pure genius.To sum it up, ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE is an epic story in the birth, life and death of the small fictional town of Macondo in a South American country. It parallels several generations of Buendias. One of many themes that passed through the family was the fear of one of the descendants would be born with the tail of a pig. Incest is one of the themes that runs rampant throughout the book, one of the many funny elements that kept me reading. (Not to give it away, there is one child that is born with a tail. I'll leave it to the reader to find out!).Another theme I saw that was obvious by the time I ended the book was reality versus magic realism. While the earlier portions of the history of Macondo was rooted in magic brought to the town by the Gypsies, as one reads further into the story, one encounters realities of war, life and death, and other happenings that this town held as important. A major turning point was the start of the Banana Company and the arrival of the white man. And in turn the people of the town had to deal with unions, and workers benefits. What was so shocking was the cover up of an event that came about from a strike. The fact that the townspeople could believe in the lies the Banana company would say to cover up this event was shocking, yes the townspeople easily believed in flying magic carpets and other mystical happenings. It is true that people will believe what they want to believe, and not necessarily what is the truth.The members of the Buendias family were all larger than life. The Jose Arcadios and the Aureliano's were the two main male characters, each generation being named for someone in the previous one. Remedios and Amaranta were the common female names, all of them in their own right standing out as someone that was special and unique. Ursula and Jose Arcadios Buendias were the matriarch and patriarch of the family. Ghosts abound; magic is an every day occurrence. The novel is Gabriel Garcia Marquez's most famous novel and helped give credit to the genre known as Magic Realism (other good examples are HOUSE OF THE SPIRITS by Isabelle Allende and THE SECOND DEATH OF UNICA AVEYANO by Ernesto Mestre-Reed).This reader gives ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE a five star rating. It is not recommend to those who will not have the patience to read a rambling style of narrative. It is difficult, and often times frustrating. As seen by the many negative reviews on Amazon, mostly by Post-Oprah publication readers, please note that this book is not for everyone. But for those who can appreciate fine world literature, this if for you."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This novel grabbed me almost immediately, and I was sure it would not let go until I had finished it. Unfortunately, however, it did let go for a while, and even pushed me out sometimes.It begins beautifully with the founding of Macondo, and the visits of the gypsies to that small village. The introductory chapters are bright and uplifting. Unfortunately, near the middle of the book, it slows down tremendously and becomes largely mundane. Particularly when Marquez writes about the wars of Colonel Aureliano Buendia. During these parts, he seems to shift the tone of his writing, which is likely appropriate considering the shift in subject matter, but it just felt flat and dry compared to the beginning of the book. Fortunately, the rest of the novel after the accounts of the wars regains its earlier pace and style.My other complaint is that Marquez used his character names over and over again, and other than a small reference to the cycle of the family curse, there seemed to be little reason to burden the reader with so many Aureliano's and Jose Arcadio's. There was Jose Arcadio Buendia, (2)Jose Arcadio(s), Jose Arcadio Segundo, and Arcadio. Colonel Aureliano Buendia, Aureliano Jose, Aurelianos, Aureliano (x2), Aureliano Segundo, and even a reference to 17 of Colonel Aureliano Buendia's offspring all with the first name Aureliano, four of which are introduced as secondary characters. There is even a small amount of repetition in the female character's names. Whether this name game would have been plausible within the lives of the characters or not doesn't matter to me. I never felt that there was a compelling reason for Marquez to burden his readers with the trick.With those complaints aside, it is a great novel. Marquez conveys very well the loneliness felt by his characters. His characters are sometimes unaware of how lonely they are, but Marquez makes their solitude apparent to the reader. Several of the characters aren't fleshed out very well, but the book isn't as much about the characters as it is about the recurring theme of solitude that they experience.Definitely a novel worth reading to gain a feel for Marquez' mastery of written emotion, but be warned that it is easy to become frustratingly lost in the quagmire of repetitive names. (Fortunately, there is a simple family tree before the first chapter which helps to clear up some of the seemingly unnecessary confusion with the names.)"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This is an absolutely amazing book. The most outstanding and unique thing about it is the style--it's like the figurative speech and literary imagery that all writers use have suddenly become physically incarnate. When Marquez wants to make a point about a dead character's lingering presence, he doesn't just write some simile about the ghost of the family's patriarch, but has that ghost sit under a tree, visible to all, for years. You can read into all of the magic that occurs, or you can just appreciate it as a good story. If you want realistic fiction, this isn't for you, but for anyone with a taste for whimsy and even absurdity it's great. There's a sense of wonder and joy in the writing, even when the subject matter isn't very cheerful. It's refreshing, especially since it seems like so much modern English literature is jaded and depressing.This isn't a light book by any means, and maybe its scope is what makes people prefer Love in the Time of Cholera, which is a more narrow story. Personally, I was drawn in from the first page, and found the storytelling style engaging and interestingly nonlinear. It was exciting too--I was breathless when the civil war began. Yes, the names repeat a lot, but that serves a purpose, and as for the other repetitions, I couldn't help smiling every time the Arabs traded macaws. Homer repeated himself a lot too.To conclude, I'll just say that before reading this, I didn't have a favorite book. Now I do."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Gabriel Garcia Marquez' \\"One Hundred Years Of Solitude\\" is the literary equivalent of a magic carpet ride, your own magic genii come to life, and Shaharazade's 101 tales wrapped into one brilliant, multilayered epic novel. From page one you will voyage with the most remarkably original cast of characters, through worlds of vibrant color, where the sun shines almost always - when not obscured by a four year downpour. You will find yourself laughing out loud when you are not sobbing in sympathy with someone dying of heartbreak. I do not like to label Sr. Garcia Marquez' work \\"magical realism.\\" There is no label to accurately describe the writing that gifted us with \\"One Hundred Years Of Solitude.\\" This is a book that defies description. You must read it to experience the fantastically real world of Macondo, and the people who live there. Once you know them, they will be a part of your own world forever. Have you ever looked at a painting, walked into it and become a part of it? When you open this novel at page one, you are beckoned to enter.Macondo is a mythical South American town, founded, almost by accident, by Jose Arcadio Buendia, and populated primarily by his descendants. This is the story of one hundred years in the life of Macondo and its inhabitants - the story of the town's birth, development and death. Civil war and natural calamities plague this vital place whose populace fights to renew itself and survive. This is a huge narrative fiction that explores the history of a people caught up in the history of a place. And Marquez captures the range of human emotions and the reasons for experiencing them in this generational tale.There is much that is delightful and comical here. Surprises never cease, whether it be Remedios ascending, or a man whose presence is announced by clouds of butterflies. There is satire, sexuality and bawdiness galore. But there is also a pervading sadness and futility that permeates throughout. Cruelty is a reality in Marquez' world, as are failure, despair and senseless, sudden violence. The plot is filled with passion, poetry, romance, tragedy and the echoes of the history of Colombia and Latin America.I first read \\"One Hundred Years Of Solitude\\" in 1968, while living in Latin America. I have read it 2 or 3 times over the years, always picking up new pieces of wonder that I had previously missed. This is my favorite novel, and I am an avid reader. My favorite fictional character is Melquiades, the gypsy who foretells the future of the township and whose ghost accompanies the reader until there is no more to read. Having read this in Spanish and English, I must laud Gregory Rabassa's extraordinary translation which faithfully brings to life not only Marquez' story, but his lyrical prose. This is one of the 20th Century's best works of fiction. It is a masterpiece not to be missed.JANA"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"The best way for me to describe this book is that it's a very long folklore tale. That seems to be the simplest discription of Magical Realism. You can hear it in your head, being passed down between the generations. Each chapter feels like it represents one story that is told at one sitting; they compound on each other to make this wonderful story complete.The fantastic elements of this story take on mythic qualities; explaining those things in the world that seem to be unexplainable without the notion of some kind of spiritual intervention. The characters in the book, as well as the reader, must have faith that these explanations are true or else the story is nothing but a passionate fable.Be prepared when reading this book: GGM is a gifted writer. Every sentence is full of discription and information that must be savored in order the grasp its complexity. Not one idea is out of place; every word is deliberate. This translation is pain-stakingly good, as well.It may take a while to get into this book - give it time. The end is well worth the effort. Also, keep a flag on the Buendia Family Tree as the names and lineages will get a little confusing!"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I loved this book although I admit that I was confused a lot while reading it. I choose it for my book club and purchased an audio tape - I think I got it from amazon.com - that really helped me make sense of it. Everybody in my club hated it-several were forced to read it in college and didn't want to read it again. I was captivated by the magical realism and the idea of the perpetual cycle of life. I'm surprised Oprah selected it - it is really difficult. I also read Love in the Time of Cholera and thought it was much easier to read. Marquez is an author everyone who loves reading should attempt. If you can just stop insisting on instant gratification and keep on reading even it it doesn't make sense and even if you can't keep track of all the characters-just keep on reading and let the story get into your blood. It truly is magical."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I was surprised that Oprah picked this book. Perhaps she chose it to challenge her readers, but it is definitely not the spiritually uplifting material that I would associate with Oprah. The book is memorable to me because of its difference in style and because it is depressing. After this one, Oprah's readers will be yearning for something much more \\"light\\" in both style and heart."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This is a fun read, but the end lets the story dissolve, interstingly, but pointlessly. The book is also full of incest--deeply immoral."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"well I have, and this book has got to be one of the stupidest things I have ever tried to write about. It is basically about nothing, and I had to write about that for a school paper! you would hate it too if you had to write about it for a flippin' school paper! Really, need I say more? I bet the people who loved it never had to write an essay about Amaranta's repeated refusal of love, and in about a week! Just ask everyone who's a junior at my school! It is a torture manual! Far too beastly a book to be dealt with, even for most english majors and teachers!I give it two stars because it has more substance than the stuff Allende and Amado put out."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I wish I could have given this book &quot;no stars:&quot; it's a book that deserves every star that man, god or science has created, and nothing we can put here on the internet (or in any review in any medium) would do it the eternal justice it deserves. A dream of a book: I would pick it up the day after having read forty pages, start the next chapter, and wonder where it was I had left off the night before. A book that gives off narcotic fumes, that gives off disembowling violence, love, and indifference. A book that deserves more awards than humankind can bestow."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I have not yet read this book but am looking forward to doing so as I have heard from friends that it is wonderful story.

I understand the need to recycle but was not advised prior to purchase that this is the policy of Amazon..

Thank you."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"so mr marquez is supposed to have invented this whole new genre of writing with this book and other annoying ones like In Evil Hour. But no one seems to stop and say that the events of the story are ridiculous and embarrasing. who wants to read about an old lady who makes candy for her family for generations? no one. and the romance portrayed is nothing short of farcical. it's a wonder he's a star in the literary universe."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"doprah picks a book that should be ousted from the canon.

I can't believe I read the whole thing!"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"When I first picked up this book the mother in this novel reminded me of my Grandmother. In Ursula I could see my Grandmother's strength, the way she held our family together, and her ability to carry on through what would kill normal people. The vast amount of well drawn out characters and sheer beauty of Gabriel Garcia Marquez's masterpiece lets you feel as if you have drifted into these people's lives. You live through their joys and their sorrows.Marquez is so phenomenally talented in his writing. He makes it feel so natural to follow various characters through their escapades and the &quot;magical&quot; events that happen to them. The funny thing about this is that it took me almost a year to read this book. I'm not entirely sure why, it was almost as if I slowly absorbed the novel over time. When I finally closed the book for the last time I was almost sad that the whole adventure was over.This was a joy to read, I can't wait to read it again, hopefully I won't take a year to read it the next time around."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"&quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude,&quot; by Gabriel Garcia Marquez, is an undeniable landmark in Latin American literature. The book, which has been translated into English by Gregory Rabassa, is the multigenerational saga of the Buendia family and the town of Macondo. Garcia Marquez narrates decades of love, death, war, socio-economic activism, incest, and politics in the lives of a large cast of characters.I must admit, I didn't find &quot;100 Years&quot; to be as satisfying or as engaging as some of GGM's other works (in particular, the gripping &quot;Story of a Shipwrecked Sailor&quot; and the wonderful &quot;Of Love and Other Demons,&quot; both of which I recommend with great enthusiasm). I think &quot;100 Years&quot; is in some ways comparable to &quot;Paradiso,&quot; by Cuba's Jose Lezama Lima: I found both to be ambitious &quot;meganovels&quot; which, despite their many good points, were lacking in some way.But &quot;100 Years&quot; is well worth reading. The novel has many powerful and haunting scenes, and throughout is graced by touches of magic. There are many intriguing, and often tragic, characters: the gypsy Melquiades, the dirt-eating Rebeca, the matriarch Ursula, the seventeen Aurelianos, and the butterfly-heralded Mauricio Babilonia. An essential book for those with a serious interest in Latin American literature."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This was my second try after 30 years to read this book. First time I abandoned after some 20-25 pages, this time I got as far as page 150.And I got this far because I thought that maybe I'm missing something, it can't be that so many people praise this book and I am the only one who doesn't like it. But after 150 pages and three generations of Aureliano and Accadio, in which almost anything happens, in which you hear love stories and war stories and fantastic stories and so on,suddenly I didn't feel curious what's next.First time I abandoned this book because the magic realism wasn't my cup of tea at that time. This time I quit because the book wasn't catching me , didn't make me feel any emotions about the characters, didn't make me curious about their fate.Someone said about this book that you either love it or hate it, well, to be honest, it left me indifferent.In another 30 years I'll give it another try and I will let you know if my perspective changed..."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This book can be one of the most confusing and frustrating book that I have ever read. Even though I agree that Marques does earn the Nobel Prize, the structure of the book itself is still complicated. One of the pains during reading this book is to follow the history of the generations. Once you read the family tree in the front of the book, you&iexcl;ll realize that the entire Buendia family shares the same name, either Jose or Aureliano. Another Obstacle that I have to overcome with while reading this book is try to follow the generations. For example, the writer might be talking about the 2nd generation in the Buendia family, then suddenly jumps into the 1st family to talk about the history. By having the same names, it really did make me read this entire book two times to understand it.The book itself should be categorized into the magic realism category. When I first read this book, I couldn&iexcl;t understand how its magic realism is shown, but later on in the book, it still eventually made sense. The first part of the book is basically introducing the family of Buendia to the readers, then it goes on with how the Buendia family experiences events that they had never experienced. The ending of the book is quite miraculous through simple description. After reading this book, I would definitely encourage more people reading this award winning book."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"If you're immortal and have time to waste on junk, then go ahead and read this book. I'm not immortal and I just wasted too many of my limited hours on this Earth on this steaming pile of dung.A friend of mine gushed over this book and lent it to me to read, insisting it was one of the best books she's ever read. It was for her only that I trudged through this thing. I'm glad I did not pay for it.The Emperor's New Clothes indeed. There is absolutely no redeeming value to this thing whatsoever; and before I'm accused of being a racist, dejame decirte que yo soy Hispano, nacido en Puerto Plata de la Republica Dominicana. I'm also an avid reader and this book was not dificult for me to read. I could even follow along with the various Buendias with same names, until I just didn't care anymore.It started out ok, when I thought it was going to be a normal story. Even the magical elements added to it did not disturb me. The gypsies with their fabulous inventions. I actually found them charming.Then the war started and along with it came all the insanity. The Incest, the Pedophilia, the Bestiality, the brothers who shared a woman, the little girl forced to have sex with sixty men a night for profit, the characters with no humanity, no brains and no common sense... and I'm talking about the major characters of the story. Halfway through the book I no longer cared about anyone in the story and I desperately wanted one woman in particular to die so I wouldn't have to read about her anymore.If I sound angry it's because I am. Genesis?!? Are you kidding me?!? This was precious hours of my life wasted on putrid drivel intended for no useful purpose whatsoever. It doesn't educate. It doesn't enlighten. It doesn't excite. It doesn't sadden. It doesn't give joy. It just makes you wonder when it's all going to end so you can get on with your life. I'm angry at the fools who have elevated this pile of trash to high status and foisted it upon the unsuspecting masses as \\"literature.\\"If you enjoy a story with a moral or a purpose then stay away from this incredibly inane and insipid \\"work.\\"If, however, you have time to burn and are a masochist then go for it.Flaming comments will not be answered so store it.

I've tried to finish it twice and failed each time due to boredom.Perhaps it is better in Spanish. Is that why people love it? Personally, I can't understand why this is considered a classic."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Marquez' book takes the reader through the lives and times of what *may* be an atypical Colombian (?) family, covering from roughly the 1830s to the 1930s. It was fun in parts, but oddly repetitive, with a style that seemed half magic realism, half Freud. And, of course, the standard enervating anti-American diatribes were thrown in. I guess a Latin American author even in magic realism mode can't overcome his predilections.And speaking of predilections, Marquez, along with some other of intellectualdom's best and brightest, recently decided to weigh in on the Klinton-Lewinsky scandal (New York Times, Sep 26, 1998). I think this is entirely appropriate. When it comes to judging contemporary sexual mores, who better than Marquez to judge our beloved Bill?"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I guess it is different for a native Spanish speaker...

Every time it is different. Every time there is something new and enlighten."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"as i began reading this, i was surprised by the writing style. it is written in heavy prose, with very little dialogue. it looks daunting then, when you open up the book to any page and you see full paragraphs, as if it were one massive essay. i suppose it makes sense, considering that roughly one hundred years is being covered in less than 500 pages. its as if everything is written as a story being told.it is in fact a story of recollection, one that unfolds magically through the words of marquez in the city of macondo and the buendia family. the writing is mystical and poetic, with some of the most beautiful language, particularly in the last 30 pages or so. i had a difficult time finding my way into the story, but now that i'm done, i'm so glad i read it.one of the quotes on the back of the book stuck with me throughout the reading: \\"Mr. Garcia Marquez has done nothing less than to create in the reader a sense of all that is profound, meaningful, and meaningless in life.\\" ~William Kennedy, New York Timesi don't think it could be put any better.covering every facet of both the complexity and simplicity of love and solitude, i found myself reading and re-reading certain parts, finding the weight of the words in my own context. it was perfect."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"One Hundred Years of Solitude is said to be a work so wonderful, It should be required reading for the entire human race, and I must say I completely agree. The novel follows the progression of the Buenida family and Macondo, the town that grows along with the people in it. As I read I felt as if I was with the family and was experiencing the same things the town was going through. Garcia Marquez's magical realism and writing style make this novel one of a kind.My favorite thing through out the novel was the magical realism that was always evident. I think this gives the novel its own special touch. I also enjoyed Garcia Marquez's writing style and method. Seen in this novel, as in many other works of Latin American literature is the ever present circle of fate that exists within the lives of every one. If you don't respect and learn from history, it will come back and to get you, repeat itself, and normally have negative consequences.On thing I noticed throughout One Hundred Years of Solitude were the similarities between this novel and The House of the Spirits by Isabel Allende. Both follow generations of a family as they grow and change. They touch on the political situations of the time adding an interesting connection to reality.Overall, I feel that this novel is one of the best I have read so far. I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a life changing novel."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This book was good, but at some times it was hard to follow. This novel was difficult to keep straight. It run the gauntlet from comedy to tragedy and love to death to war and everything in between witch made it very emotional. This book was also a kind of history textbook witch is ok if history is in your blood but it is not in mine. Irregardless it was emotionally satisfing. But it could have been improved if it could have been simplified. When you finish the book, don't be surprised to find yourself stepping out of a dream and back into the real world. Only in the mind of the master can a wounded arm turn into a field of butterfiles. If you like this book, you might want to try Marquez's new autobiography."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Absolutely loved it. Vivid and full of creativity, if anyone wants to read a good book I definetly recommend it. Actually not a hard book to read, but it should not be read in a hurry either."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"A mythical town in South America (Macondo) is the setting for an intergenerational history, pervaded by pathos, sexuality, and the dark comedy of futility. This is the chronicle of the Aureliano dynasty: one hundred years of lust, continuity, and then, fatality - all clothed in surreal, symbolic language and images.The thematic of solitude underlies the tumult and calamities in the mundane events of this history - the solitude of that which will be forgotten. The characters are together in this isolated town; and yet, they are separated by their beauty, idiocy, or trauma. The silences and solitude which result are the glue that adheres this amazing story together. You can forget about involved plot and developed characterizations - they are secondary to the generational repetitions, the circular time flow, and the fantastically incredible events on these pages.This can be very dense reading at times - the symbolic wisdom, the fables and superstitions that give this narrative it's ferment and texture; but, the allegorical structure does completely mesmerize. There is a languid, compelling flow to the narration - time seems irrelevant while seemingly impossible events of the supernatural occur frequently, chronicled as if they were part of the everyday life in Macondo.Marquez, the consummate prose-poet, sits this narrative upon the twin pillars of passion and tragedy. After 40 years, this tale has aged well. Given its \\"legs\\", it will still be read by many future generations.Most highly recommended.Extracts: A Field Guide for IconoclastsThe Cloud Reckoner"},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Marquez book's have always amazed me, the way he has to transport you through the pages of the book to a world full of imaginative, mystery, laughs, its a book to read more than one time.

Perhaps the finest example of magic realism in the novel form, this book is filled with brilliant and wonderfully evocative events and ideas.

Feed your mind on some real, time-worthy literature."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This novel is an amazing work, which once I had started, I was unable to put it down. It is a long read, but definitely worth the time it takes. The author does an amazing job in his depiction of the characters, giving us the feeling that we are seeing all of humankind on the page in front of us. Macondo is a fictional town which goes through a metamorphoses in the space of 100 years, and in that time, we see a basic outline of all of human history. The book is rather ambiguous in many places, and the fact that five or six different characters have the same name can become confusing. But all in all, this is a wonderful book, which basically shows us a portrait of human reality."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I've read my share of books in my lifetime and I couldn't exactly say what the 10 greatest books I've ever read are. But I can say with certainty that \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude\\" is absolutely one of those books. I was fortunate that I knew nothing about this book before I started reading so I had no preconceived notions about it. What unfolded within those pages was a uniquely imaginative masterpiece that I never expected.100 years of the Buendia family in the mythical South American town of Macando told in a magical realism tale doesn't begin to explain the essence of magnificent novel. Magical realism is best not explained but experienced by reading \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude.\\" I would implore everyone who hasn't done so already to add this masterpiece to their repertoire of greatest novels read."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"One fascinating aspect that I just had to keep telling my husband about was the fact that the author would describe a scene that just could not be real (a magic carpet ride through a dusty town) as if it were real. These people are perfectly normal, intelligent, funny, interesting people set in a seemingly real town. They are amazed by dry ice. Things like this are totally believable. And then, wham, a magic carpet ride. It's amazing. It's presented so straightforwardly that you begin to wonder, could that be real, too?Like the ghost? Or the chaining up of father to the tree in the courtyard? All of these things have elements of reality to them, particularly having to pay a fee to ride on the carpet.It's an amazing book full of conflict, family war, bitterness, joy, strange bedfellows, love, babies, more babies, and babies who nobody knows who the daddy is.I read it and Oprah didn't tell me to read it either. If you want a good book, this is a good book. I would like to try it in Spanish some day."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I believe it's necessary to have some background in Spanish, Spanish American literature and Gabriel Garcia Marquez to truly comprehend the magnificence of this book. After reading the entire Don Quijote de la Mancha in Spanish for a college course, I actually thanked God that I decided to major in Spanish. I read Cien Anos de Soledad (One Hundred Years of Solitude) twenty years later and I had the same reaction. For me, it is the masterpiece of the twentieth century."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I think I experienced the ultimate reading sensation when approaching this book. I had just come back from Spain and my Spanish was pretty good, so I decided to read it in English and Spanish at the same time. Since there was no facing page edition (like Pinsky's Inferno translation of Dante which is the best of both possible worlds), I had to buy a Spanish copy and an English copy. For the first half, I read the English first and then the Spanish chapters, but for the latter half, I was warmed up enough to read the Spanish chapter first and then the English. The effort is well worth it in any language. Rabassa (a Dartmouth alum, my alma mater) is a great translator and does justice to this magnificant work. The reader who said that he dogeared the genealogy page is correct -- once you can keep the different generations straight, you are well on your way to being drawn into the magical world. Not only is it a great novel in its own right, it's mandatory reading because so many authors (and not just Latin American ones) use his magic realism style. Some of my personal favorite authors like Murakami and Jonathan Carroll borrow liberally from this style, sometimes not even consciously. Marquez paved the way for scores of Latin American writers, put Latin American literature on the map and influenced huge numbers of other writers as well. I loved every moment of the experience of reading this book -- the ending is so shockingly good that it's worth committing the last page to memory."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"If I could have chosen one gift to bring with me,. . . to sing like Sinatra, to dance like Astaire,to paint like Manet, or to putt like Tiger,it would have been,. . . to write like Gabriel Garcia Marquez."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"If you are into magic realism, actually South American surrealism - this book will captivate you.The best book I have ever read, and I did read some.The only problem is that you are going to become a Marquez addict in no time. Otherwise - you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This is a great work of fiction that is somewhat difficult to follow in the beginning but worth reading."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I really, really wanted to like this book, and was surprised that, with so many people saying how difficult it was to keep the characters straight, I breezed through the first 300 pages. The similar names was not a complication for me, though I can understand this might be a hindrance for most readers.The story revolves around multiple generations of one family. Because of the scope - 6 generations - it is impossible for the reader to come to know any one of the family members well. And this left me feeling that I really didn't care about the characters. However, I did find the way Garcia Marquez incorporated magical-realism into the story to be enchanting and somehow had no difficulty in finding that hard to believe.However, the story began to fall apart for me during the last 150 pages or so. The writing seemed to become sloggish, and either I was tired of reading it or Garcia Marquez was was tired of writing it. (Perhaps just me) What had been stories that were magical, interesting, and easy to read, became mired in language that was difficult to understand and follow. Many times I read passages several times, only to wonder what it was the author was trying to say, exactly. A book should not be this hard to read.All is revealed in the final 2 - 3 pages, however. And even though it is an interesting finish, it seemed rushed to me - almost forced. It was as if Garcia Marquez had been writing and writing and needed to find a way to end all of this, so he just devised something. It works, sort of, I guess.This book will appeal to some, but will be despised by most. It's just the way it is. I'm glad I read it, but it won't be among the best I've read. I didn't pick up any deep seated messages. I guess I'm just obtuse that way. If you consider yourself a \\"deep\\" reader, and willing to give yourself over to difficult challenges, you may wish to try this. Otherwise, don't frustrate yourself.

The title is almost ironic because the last hundred pages forced me into a delicious solitude as I was completely caught up in the characters' story. GGM's writing is fluid, artistic, mesmerizing and real.

A gorgeous story, painted simply and majestically."},{"Title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"I'm giving this book 5 stars simply because I really liked it. It got a bit slow in the middle, and a little confusing because many of the characters have the same name (because they are from the same family), but ultimately the book was insightful and intriguing.

If the rates in the book are fairly accurate, many of the hotels are accessible to most travelers or within reason for a splurge stay.

My experience with it has been significantly negative. The basic dietary premise that a diabetic should consume 50-60 percent of their daily diet from carbohydrates, just doesn't pass a sanity test. The very idea that I'm supposed to control my blood glucose by eating mostly foods that seriously elevate blood glucose is not eating away diabetes; it is eating your way into higher blood glucose. I had to abandon this eating plan early on, and have found a better solution.Look carefully at the glowing reviews; many were written by other \\"professionals.\\""},{"Title":"Eat Away Diabetes","review":"Eat Away Diabetes is extremely well researched and superbly written! Taking complex subject matter, the author uses practical explanations and analogies, thereby making diabetes much easier to understand. The information is current and extremely useful for people with Type 2 diabetes and those working to prevent this potentially devastating (but preventable) disease. Numerous charts and sidebars are used throughout which serve as excellent references in my practice as a registered dietitian. The author emphasizes the importance of exercise at length and explains the roles of fiber, fat, carbohydrates, protein, vitamin/mineral supplementation, and herbs.

Kris Napier has that gift, and in Eat Away Diabetes she makes excellent use of it. The opening chapters offer a clear appraisal of scientific thinking about nutrition, demolishing many fashionable ideas about what we should or shouldn't eat. She explains the concepts behind healthy eating and illustrates them with overall menu plans and 100 pages of delicious-sounding recipes. People newly diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes often complain that no one talks to them enough. This book provides the counseling that busy health care providers may not have time for, and does it with in the down-to-earth language of a knowledgeable friend offering advice and sharing favorite recipes over a cup of tea."},{"Title":"Eat Away Diabetes","review":"I am so thrilled to find a book that helps me understand diabetes, how food affects my blood sugars, and what to put on my plate each and every day.

Lifestyle changes, including diet and exercise, are necessary to prevent complications (heart disease, stroke, vascular disease, blindness) in those with Type 2 diabetes and prevent the disease from occurring in those at high risk.

Kristine Napier defines Type II diabetes and the steps needed to control this disease in a way that is easy to understand. She provides advice and examples to help the reader incorporate her guidelines into their everyday life. Her 28 day guide of menus will help those get started and as always, Kris's recipes are easy to follow and delicious.

There is no amount of insulin or oral medication that can help your body cope with this level of carbs and maintain normal BG level of 70 - 90 mg/dl instead you will have BG levels between 115 - 250 mg/dl or higher or have to cover with a huge amount of insulin either from your overworked pancreas or inject a massive dose - not a wise idea.

If you have been unfortunate enough to not visit this wonderful world filled with magic, wizards, and an occasional god then take the opportunity. The books don't need to be read in order but some of the characters make multiple appearances. You will fall in love with the place and the people. I find myself a little sad each time I finish a book. Pratchett has the ability to give you a well written story that mixes humor with drama and even an occasional love story. His books would fall under fantasy and can be read by teenagers as well as adults. I highly recommend this book as well as others."},{"Title":"Men At Arms (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Discworld Novels)","review":"This story was a bit slow at the beginning, but once it got started, it was an excellent read. Perhaps my second favorite Pratchett book behind Good Omens."},{"Title":"Men At Arms (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Discworld Novels)","review":"When last we left our intrepid Ankh-Morpork Night Watch, things were looking up. This is a nice change from the gutter's-eye-view we had at the beginning of Guards! Guards!. Things have changed in the time between books. The Watch has a new headquarters, much nicer than its old one, thanks to Lady Sibyl Ramkin, the fiance of Captain Sam Vimes. She comes from an ancient and respectable family, has more money than anyone else in the city, and loves Vimes despite his deep-seated curmudgeonliness, if that is a word.What's more, the Watch is taking on new recruits, as ordered by the Patrician. Ankh-Morpork is a city with a very diverse population, and the Patrician believes that the Watch should reflect that diversity. Now we have a Watch open to anyone - trolls, dwarfs, the undead, apes, women - who wants to join, or who doesn't want to get their heads beaten in. Carrot Ironfoundersson has become a beloved figure in the city - he knows everyone and everyone knows him. All in all, things are looking up.But there are those who are of a mind that things would be better if only Ankh-Morpork had a king....This is a recurring theme in the early Watch books - the irrational need for royalty. Although, that's not entirely accurate. Pratchett is a British writer, of course, and he's got the Queen to look up to, but she doesn't have all that much real power. Certain people in Ankh-Morpork are looking for a sovereign - not to wave at them and make a Hogswatch speech, but to actually take over their city. They hope, in their hearts, that a king will solve everything. In that way, this recurring theme is not so much about royalty versus populism, but rather the ability to control one's own life versus allowing someone else to control it for you. The idea that one has responsibility for one's own actions and well-being is dominant in the Guards books, no more so than in this one.There is a man named Edward d'Eath, and he has a vision. He is the last of an aristocratic line whose power has declined in this age of guilds and merchants. He looks to the past and sees it as better, brighter than the future. He knows that, if he can just do one little thing, Ankh-Morpork - and he - will be restored to glory. That one little thing, of course, is to put a king on the throne.Not just any king, of course. The fools who thought to use a dragon to set up a puppet king showed how ineffectual that would be. No, this would only work with a real king, a descendant of the ancient kings of Ankh-Morpork. Find him, put him on the throne, and everything will finally be set straight.Of course, that doesn't work out nearly as well as Edward hopes. He steals a mysterious artifact to set his plan in motion - a weapon of such power and danger that the Assassins refuse to use it, and keep it on display as a message: beware things such as this. It is the Gonne, and the man who wields it has the power to change the world.Like I said, this book is all about making choices in life. Vimes is engaged to be married to Sybil Ramkin, and thus his days as the Captain of the Watch are numbered. He may be in a better position than he was in the last book - having someone try to kill you is always refreshing, after all - but he knows that the life he's giving up, with all of its pain and trouble and heartache, is the life that he needs to live.Corporal Carrot needs to choose how best to serve the city of Ankh-Morpork. He is an excellent policeman, probably the only man on the Disc who could get in the middle of an incipient troll/dwarf race riot and shame them out of killing each other. People do what he says - he is, in his own words, \\"good at being obeyed.\\" If he wanted to, he could run the city and the city would be glad to let him do it. But is that the best thing for the city?The troll Detritus and the dwarf Cuddy both have choices - will they conform to the ancient animosity that stands between their two races, or will they overcome it for the common good?And then there's the Gonne itself. As a weapon, it is frighteningly powerful - much more so than the standard-issue crossbow - and as a firearm, however primitive, it represents a vast escalation in the way violence is done. What's more, since this is a fantasy novel, the Gonne has something of a mind of its own. Its wielders hear it talking to them, convincing them that the only thing standing between them and what they want are a few simple deaths - something the Gonne can easily provide. It even uses the old NRA saw verbatim - Gonnes don't kill people. People kill people.But people have a choice, perhaps more of a choice than the characters of these books do. The Gonne controls them, the trigger practically pulls itself, and when you're holding it, you can easily understand how a simple shot, one simple thing, could change the world. For the better, of course - always for the better.Pratchett's views on guns and their efficacy aside, it's a very gripping book. There's the mystery of it, of course - who has the Gonne, and why are they using it - but it's also a story about characters and the choices they make for themselves. My absolute favorites in this are Detritus and Cuddy. Trolls and dwarfs have a famous antagonism, stretching back to the ancient battle of Koom Valley (the only battle in the multiverse where both sides ambushed each other) and it would be very easy for them to fall into simple, culturally conditioned roles.While it may be a cliche to say that they found common ground, learned to look past their own prejudices and learned to respect - nay, to like one another, that's exactly what they did. It is due to Pratchett's skill as a writer and as a creator of characters that we come to deeply care for this relationship, investing a lot of hope in it. We know that if Cuddy and Detritus can become friends, then maybe there's hope for everyone. This emotional investment pays off, and Pratchett reaches deep into our hearts at the end, showing that just because you start with a cliche, it doesn't mean it can't have depth.Of course, if you're not quite as analytical as I am, you can still enjoy it as a good murder mystery. Watching Vimes and company piece together the crime is always fun, because there's always a twist somewhere that you never saw coming. And Vimes really is one of my favorite Discworld characters - he's cynical and world-weary, but he still has enough idealism within him to carry him through those times that look like they're trying to kill him.All in all, a great book and one that's highly recommended. The earlier Discworld books are largely stand-alone, so if you've never read any of the series before, don't worry - you can pick this one up and you won't really miss anything. You may, however, find yourself driving back to the bookstore to get as many other Discworld books as you can.

Like most of the Nightwatch stories in Pratchett's series, MEN AT ARMS is a great time for all; where we find the gruff and angry Vimes preparing to retire and then being thrust into what might prove to be his last investigation. This one has enough action, comedy and even the death of a copper to add a bit of pathos (Not too much however, as the deceased's responses to DEATH's inquiries are very funny) to satisfy any fan of the series."},{"Title":"Men At Arms (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Discworld Novels)","review":"I've been working my way through the Discworld series in the order of publication, and I must admit the City Watch novels are among my favorites. In \\"Men at Arms\\", Pratchett does a great job of transforming the rag-tag group of night watchmen into another Ankh-Morpork institution. I really enjoyed following Vimes and Carrot as they conducted their investigation, and the introduction of our new watch... people... promises more enjoyment in future installments.Above all, I enjoy Pratchett's ability to blend humorous fiction with poignant social commentary. Though some of these books are over a decade or two old, and perhaps written to juxtapose some then-current event or social dilemma, his novels have that lasting quality that makes them apt regardless of today's world issues. Even today we have problems with gun control and violence, and with this novel Pratchett does what he does best - pokes fun at everyone on all sides.This definitely ranks in my top 5 of the series to this point."},{"Title":"Men At Arms (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Discworld Novels)","review":"This is probably among the best Diskworld books Pratchett has written. It has it all: rich character development, an intriguing plot that actually kept throwing curves at me, some sarcastic social commentary, and of course, Pratchett's renound rapier-like wit. I'm still laughing at his concept of \\"retro-phrenology.\\"As with any Diskworld novel, this one is best enjoyed if you already have a grip on the setting, but if you're new to the series, you can start here with little problem -- though you'll get the sense you're not privy to a number of inside jokes.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Men At Arms (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Discworld Novels)","review":"So many discworld novels, so little time. I love them all, but my favorites, at the moment, are the Watch Novels. Anyone who enjoys humor in their life should read Terry Pratchett. Enough said."},{"Title":"Men At Arms (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Discworld Novels)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Of course, I've thoroughly enjoyed every Discworld book except the very first, so that wasn't very surprising. However, one thing that made this book especially enjoyable is that it is the introduction of one of my favorite recurring characters, Angua.Men at Arms is a Watch book, and I always particularly enjoy them because the Watch is full of such colorful characters. In this book we are also introduced to Detruis, the troll who's really smart when it's cold and really stupid when it's hot. Unfortunately, Ank-Morpork is almost always hot.As usual for Discworld novels, Men at Arms is full of satire, poking fun at everything from monarchy to violence to racism (or in this case, specism). The thought \\"Guns don't kill people; people kill people\\" is turned on its head when the gonne takes over the mind of it's wielder, making him kill people at random. It talks to whoever is holding it and even fires itself on occasion.The book starts out with new recruits to the watch being trained. Cuddy (a Dwarf), Detrius (a Troll), and Angua (both Werewolf and a woman) provide comic relief throughout the book as they attempt to adjust to the different procedures of the Night Watch.The real story, however, is the gonne that has gone missing just a day before Captain Vimes is scheduled to retire (he's marrying Lady Sibyl). Of course, Vimes has to find the gun and the culprit who is using it. Vetinari tells him not to, but that only makes him more determined. After all, he is a policeman; solving crimes is his job.As with all Discworld books, the best part of Men at Arms is the characters rather than the story. The story itself is all right, but it is the crazy character-extremely literal and valiant Carrot, hulking and slow Detrius, very odd but strangely loveable Nobby, Gaspode the talking dog, and stubborn and determined Vimes-that make the story. Without them, it wouldn't be nearly as funny or enjoyable.Pratchett has a knack for weaving stereotypes into believable, loveable characters, and it shows in this book. Carrot, the long lost king, is brave, valiant, noble, and honest. However, he's also managing to adapt to life in Ank-Morpork. While he doesn't lie, he doesn't ever tell the whole truth. Detrius is big and slow and stupid, but get him in cold weather and he's extremely smart. Every main character personifies a stereotype and then takes it further, turning it around and making it real and comical.This is definitely one of Pratchett's more amusing books. I would recommend it to anyone who's looking for a humorous read and all Pratchett fans."},{"Title":"Men At Arms (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Discworld Novels)","review":"I have all the Pratchett books, but this by far is the best of the bunch. Humourous, touching, clever, witty and highly readable this seems to be the peak of the discworld books. The Watch works well as a basis for the story, the members are developed into people, (or not as the case may be haha!) along with a few usual suspects, and the whole thing flows. After this i started to feel that the books were very same-ish, and lacked originality, but i have to say that Men at Arms will always be the one i recommend to people."},{"Title":"Men At Arms (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Discworld Novels)","review":"Unlike the Hitchhiker's Trilogy from the late Douglas Adams, Terry Pratchett's Discworld books have managed to stay fresh and original through not a mere five, but 27 installments. The reason for this, I think, is that Pratchett uses the format to its fullest potential, creating several groups of characters that he visits time and again, never having any single group act as the star of the entire series, and using it to tackle diverse subjects without ever repeating himself.\\"Men at Arms\\" is the second Discworld book to focus on Captain Vimes and the men -- um... humans... er... beings -- of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch (the first being \\"Guards! Guards!\\") and it has firmly cemented these characters as my favorite recurring heroes in the Discworld universe.Time is running out for Captain Sam Vimes -- because he's getting married. Furthermore, his beloved night watch is being tampered with by higher-ups calling for \\"greater diversity\\" in the hirings, forcing him to welcome trolls, dwarfs and women into the group. To make matters worse, someone has stolen a strange new weapon from the assassin's guild and is using it to kill people. Vimes, Carrot, Nobby and the gang have to find the murderer and save the day.Funny, yes, but also particularly poignant in light of recent events in the Washington D.C. area.
