It would take nearly 20 years to find out why and who was really at fault. All it took for a hundred people to die during a show by the hair metal band Great White was a sudden burst from two giant sparklers that ignited the acoustical foam lining the Station nightclub. But who was at fault? And who would pay? This being Rhode Island, the two questions wouldn't necessarily have the same answer. Within 24 hours the governor of Rhode Island and the local police commissioner were calling for criminal charges, although the investigation had barely begun, no real evidence had been gathered, and many of the victims hadn't been identified. Though many parties could be held responsible, fingers pointed quickly at the two brothers who owned the club. But were they really to blame? Bestselling author and three-time Emmy Award-winning reporter Scott James investigates all the central figures, including the band's manager and lead singer, the fire inspector, the maker of the acoustical foam, as well as the brothers. Drawing on firsthand accounts, interviews with many involved, and court documents, James explores the rush to judgment about what happened that left the victims and their families, whose stories he also tells, desperate for justice. Trial By Fire is the heart-wrenching story of the fire's aftermath because while the fire, one of America's deadliest, lasted fewer than two minutes, the search for the truth would take twenty years.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ECjQDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Common sense preaching","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Morals in Medicine","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SiW-xwEACAAJ&dq=Morals+in+Medicine&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Rancher and the Redhead (The Men of Double-C Ranch) (Silhouette Special Edition, No 1212)","description":"After Mallory Keegan's sister died in childbirth, the grieving doctor vowed to do one thing: find her niece's father.

Lights out","description":"How could General Electric--perhaps America's most iconic corporation--suffer such a swift and sudden fall from grace? This is the definitive history of General Electric's epic decline, as told by the two Wall Street Journal reporters who covered its fall. Since its founding in 1892, GE has been more than just a corporation. For generations, it was job security, a solidly safe investment, and an elite business education for top managers. GE electrified America, powering everything from lightbulbs to turbines, and became fully integrated into the American societal mindset as few companies ever had. And after two decades of leadership under legendary CEO Jack Welch, GE entered the twenty-first century as America's most valuable corporation. Yet, fewer than two decades later, the GE of old was gone. ?Lights Out examines how Welch's handpicked successor, Jeff Immelt, tried to fix flaws in Welch's profit machine, while stumbling headlong into mistakes of his own. In the end, GE's traditional win-at-all-costs driven culture seemed to lose its direction, which ultimately caused the company's decline on both a personal and organizational scale. Lights Out details how one of America's all-time great companies has been reduced to a cautionary tale for our times.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CCnNDwAAQBAJ&dq=...+Lights+out&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Psagent","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"I Feel Bad About My Neck: And Other Thoughts on Being a Woman","description":"A collection of essays offers a humorous look at the ups and downs of being a woman of a certain age, discussing the tribulations of maintenance and trying to stop the clock, menopause, and empty nests.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rbbw0rPr3EoC&dq=I+Feel+Bad+About+My+Neck:+And+Other+Thoughts+on+Being+a+Woman&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Church Dogmatics (14 Volume Set)","description":"Described by Pope Pius XII as the most important theologian since Thomas Aquinas, the Swiss pastor and theologian, Karl Barth, continues to be a major influence on students, scholars and preachers today.

Is it a love story? It's certainly romantic, but it is also quite definitely political. And it is also funny, though you couldn't really call it a comedy,\\" says Sally Potter about the movie she began writing immediately following 9/11 as a response to the demonization of the Arab world in the West and the simultaneous wave of hatred against America. The story: She (Joan Allen) is an Irish-American scientist who is being strangled by her marriage to Anthony. She begins an affair with He (Simon Abkarian), a Lebanese surgeon exiled in London, who is working as a cook. Sam Neill plays Anthony, the betrayed and betraying politician husband, and Shirley Henderson is a philosophical cleaner who witnesses the trail of heartbreak the lovers leave behind them, as they embark on a personal journey through several countriesfrom London and Belfast to Beirut and Havanawhich forces them to evaluate their beliefs and each other. To have her characters better express ideas which might be abstract or hard to digest, Potter chose to write their dialogue in verse, though such is the narrative drive and the strength of the performances that for much of the time this seems like just a more lyrical version of everyday speech. She says of her choice: \\"I read somewhere that in times of war the sales of poetry books go up. It's as though we need to use our most clear and rich tool, which is the tool of language, to express the subtleties and the nuances of our experience. And I think that verse is a kind of structure that allows us to explore language in a more interesting, more heightened way, than we tend to in everyday conversation.\\" In addition to the complete screenplay and filmmaker's notes, the book includes essays written exclusively for this edition by the acclaimed, literary figures John Berger and Pankaj Mishra. 20 color photos.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ip8cAQAAIAAJ&dq=Yes:+Screenplay+and+Notes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Maternal-Neonatal Nursing, with Disk [With 3 1/2 Computer Disk] (Springhouse Notes)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Z50wAQAAIAAJ&dq=Maternal-Neonatal+Nursing,+with+Disk+%5BWith+3+1/2+Computer+Disk%5D+(Springhouse+Notes)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Starting Up","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Hangin' with Bugs","description":"Discover what Bugs and the rest of his crew like to do to have fun.

Are love and life eternal? This exciting account presents provocative evidence that could upset everything that science has ever taught. Daring to risk his worldwide academic reputation, Dr. Gary E. Schwartz, along with his research partner Dr. Linda Russek, asked some of the most prominent mediums in America -- including John Edward, Suzane Northrup, and George Anderson -- to become part of a series of extraordinary experiments to prove, or disprove, the existence of an afterlife. THE AFTERLIFE EXPERIMENTS This riveting narrative, with its electrifying transcripts, puts the reader on the scene of a breakthrough scientific achievement: contact with the beyond under controlled laboratory conditions. In stringently monitored experiments, leading mediums attempted to contact dead friends and relatives of \\"sitters\\" who were masked from view and never spoke, depriving the mediums of any cues. The messages that came through stunned sitters and researchers alike. Here, as they unfolded in the laboratory setting, are uncanny revelations about a son's suicide, what a deceased father wanted to say about his last days in a coma, the transformation of a man's lifelong doubts about the afterlife, and, most amazing of all, a forecast of a beloved spouse's death. Dr. Schwartz was forced by the overwhelmingly positive data to abandon his skepticism, reaching some startling conclusions. Compelling from the first page to the last, The Afterlife Experiments is the amazing documentation of groundbreaking experiments you will never forget.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qRTZEDoL0r0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Daphnis and Chloe (Reprinted from the 1657 London ed)","description":"Given the variety and richness of the sixteenth- and seventeenth-century English 'songscape', it might seem unsurprising to suggest that early modern song needs to be considered as sung. When a reader encounters a song in a sonnet sequence, a romance, and even a masque or a play, however, the tendency is to engage with it as poem rather than as musical performance. Opening up the notion of song from a performance-based perspective The Matter of Song in Early Modern England considers the implications of reading song not simply as lyric text but as an embodied and gendered musical practice. Animating the traces of song preserved in physiological and philosophical commentaries, singing handbooks, poetic treatises, and literary texts ranging from Mary Sidney Herbert's Psalmes to John Milton's Comus, the book confronts song's ephemerality, its lexical and sonic capriciousness, and its airy substance. These features can resist critical analysis but were vital to song's affective workings in the early modern period. The volume foregrounds the need to attend much more closely to the embodied and musical dimensions of literary production and circulation in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century England. It also makes an important and timely contribution to our understanding of women's engagement with song as writers and as performers.

Tracing the development of Hobbes's moral doctrine from his early writings to his major work The Leviathan, Strauss explains contradictions in the body of Hobbes's work and discovers startling connections between Hobbes and the thought of Plato, Thucydides, Aristotle, Descartes, Spinoza, and Hegel.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=p5LeBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"MacBeth : For Kids (Shakespeare Can Be Fun series)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The man","description":"This book is for males who never gave much thought to the question of manhood . . . . . . for males who falsely claim to be men, for males who would like to be men, for aging males who need to be more interested in complete manhood, and for all younger males who have no idea what a man is and can't find a resource for clarification, simplicity, and guidance.

Is there something more to being a Christian than to being human? Just what does it mean to be a Christian, especially in today's modern world? Hans K ng, one of the greatest theologians of this century, ponders these questions and, from a lifetime of study, suggests the answers. He looks carefully at the evidence in the Bible, at the challenges of modern humanisms and of the world-religions, at the questions concerning death, at the local and the universal church, at the individual's own personal decisions, and at the freedom that Christianity brings, including the freedom to serve. On Being a Christian is a vital and important statement about what it means to be a Christian. Hans K ng has himself said of the book, which he regards as his magnum opus, that it intends to \\"clarify and challenge Christian faith and life at a time when the churches have unfortunately lost rather than gained in credibility. It seeks to bring to light for this present time the original Christian message and particularly the figure of Jesus of Nazareth.\\" The book continues to offer a strong message to today's Christians. As K ng says in the closing of the book, \\"By following Jesus Christ, people in the world today can live, act, suffer and die in a truly human way; in happiness and unhappiness, life and death, sustained by God and helpful to fellow men and women.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iOJ5PwAACAAJ&dq=On+Being+a+Christian&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Historical Atlas of Louisiana","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Lambourn Valley Railway, (Locomotion papers)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Doctor from Lhasa","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Heroic Life of Al Capsella","description":"Al Capsella wants to be cool, to fit in with the other teenagers in his neighbourhood.

Cuban efforts to diversify the economy through expanded rice production were met with keen resistance by U.S. rice producers, who were as reliant on the Cuban market as sugar growers were on the U.S. market. U.S. growers prepared to retaliate by cutting the sugar quota in a struggle to control Cuban rice markets. Perez's chronicle culminates in the 1950s, a period of deepening revolutionary tensions on the island, as U.S. rice producers and their allies in Congress clashed with Cuban producers supported by the government of Fulgencio Batista. U.S. interests prevailed a success, Perez argues, that contributed to undermining Batista's capacity to govern. Cuba's inability to develop self-sufficiency in rice production persists long after the triumph of the Cuban revolution. Cuba continues to import rice, but, in the face of the U.S. embargo, mainly from Asia. U.S. rice growers wait impatiently to recover the Cuban market.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GjaPDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"El Medico (Spanish Edition)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Larousse de Poche: Dictionnaire Des Noms Communs/Nom Propres (French Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=h7xBAQAAIAAJ&dq=Larousse+de+Poche:+Dictionnaire+Des+Noms+Communs/Nom+Propres+(French+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Upgrading and Repairing PCs (14th Edition)","description":"Provides information on how to upgrade, maintain, and troubleshoot the hardware of personal computers, discussing the differences among them was well as their various configuration options.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=E1p2FDL7P5QC&dq=Upgrading+and+Repairing+PCs+(14th+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Linda Goodmans Sun Signs","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Medical-Surgical Nursing (Book with Diskette)","description":"Medical-Surgical Nursing E-Book","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=d61tEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kid Cooperation: How to Stop Yelling, Nagging, and Pleading and Get Kids to Cooperate","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Understanding The Lord of the Rings (Understanding Great Literature)","description":"Selected essays on Tolkien's trilogy include W.

They believed they would live forever. So begins Mira Ptacin s haunting account of the women of Camp Etna an otherworldly community in the woods of Maine that has, since 1876, played host to generations of Spiritualists and mediums dedicated to preserving the links between the mortal realm and the afterlife. Beginning her narrative in 1848 with two sisters who claimed they could speak to the dead, Ptacin reveals how Spiritualism first blossomed into a national practice during the Civil War, yet continues even thrives to this very day. Immersing herself in this community and its practices from ghost hunting to releasing trapped spirits to water witching  Ptacin sheds new light on our ongoing struggle with faith, uncertainty, and mortality. Blending memoir, ethnography, and investigative reportage, The In-Betweens offers a vital portrait of Camp Etna and its enduring hold on a modern culture that remains as starved for a deeper sense of connection and otherworldliness as ever.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3wOLDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Faith That Works","description":"This daily devotional book explores the kingdom of grace and and how to fight the fight of faith.

Simpson, Invisible Darkness is the story of one of the more bizarre cases in recent memory killings so sensational that they prompted the Canadian government, in the interests of justice, to silence its national press and to lock foreign journalists out of the courts. To all appearances, Paul and Karla Bernardo had a fairytale marriage: beautiful working-class girl weds bright upper-middle-class guy and they buy a fashionable dream house in the suburbs. But, bored with his straight, prestigious accounting job, Paul soon went freelance as an international smuggler. He also revealed his boredom with conventional sex enough so that, one Christmas Eve, he persuaded his wife to drug her own sister and engage in a menage a trois, during which the sister died (a bungling coroner ruled her death accidental). The couple then upped the ante, kidnapping and imprisoning several high school girls for sexual marathons, which they videotaped before savagely murdering their captives. When the girls  bodies were found, the police were stymied (although Paul had been accused of rape and given a DNA test that vanished for two years and only recently was linked to some fifty sexual-assault cases) until Karla tried to have her husband arrested for wife beating. During questioning, she confessed to the crimes and is now serving two concurrent twelve-year sentences for manslaughter in exchange for testifying against her husband, who was jailed for life.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bBBBt1qBBesC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"1 Microsoft Way: A Cookbook To Breaking Bill Gates Windows Monopoly Without Breaking Windows (with Linux CD Operating System)","description":"The book that reveals how today s most successful leaders turn vision into reality featuring profiles of Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Steve Jobs, Reed Hastings, Mike Lawrie, and more.

Was Tamar killed because she claimed to have found a lost Leonardo drawing? Because she was playing with drugs? Or had she discovered someone's nasty secret? Mama's best friend won't say why she kicked Tamar out of her home and Simona's philandering ex-husband swears he was only a friend. Then there's Prince Maffeo who gave Tamar a home in his dilapidated palazzo. And the American owner of the art school who took the student under his wing.

But he is secretive about his recent past (mid-1990s) with revolutionaries in Chiapas, Mexico. His attitude also alienates Matty from Ramon, the homicide detective she is dating. In Matty's work as a housekeeper in a cul-de-sac in Costa Dorada, she interacts with her five clients: The Chinese-American family is remodeling its home; Miguel, working in construction there when not in college, has argued with a fellow worker, African-American Jarod. When Jarod is killed, Miguel is the main suspect. In the novelist's household, Matty learns that teenage Laneesha has suspicious ties to Jarod. She also discovers that the boys in the neighborhood play secret, dangerous games. The Latina lawyer client sets a positive example for Matty; a socialite client, a negative one. Professor Dorn, father of one of the boys, may be a neo-Nazi. While Matty works for these people, she studies at night school she doesn't want to be a housekeeper forever and explores her Latina roots. Though resourceful at solving other people's problems, she sometimes has trouble coping with her own. Occasionally her temper and defensiveness get in her way. Casting herself in the role of detective, Matty has developed the habit of snooping (as Ramon calls it) in her clients' homes when she deems it necessary. In this way she discovers incriminating evidence that leads to the clearing of her son's name. And though she is sure that computers hate her, as do the cats she is temporarily boarding, both these foes, ironically, help her solve the mystery and find the real culprit. Romance ebbs and flows and finally blooms with Ramon, and Matty eventually discovers that her cul-de-sac is not a blind alley, but an opportunity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Og-2wAEACAAJ&dq=Love+and+Death+in+the+Valley&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"MBA Survival Kit","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Propaganda,","description":"With politics taking centre stage due to the US presidential election, the time is perfect for a reprint of this classic work from Edward Bernays, the father of public relations and political spin and the man who designed the ad campaign that got the United States involved in World War I.

Her navy was practically destroyed, her armies soundly beaten, her offensive power temporarily reduced to zero, her treasury exhausted, her pride laid in the dust. If the greatness of a nation consisted in the number and size of its battleships, in the capacity of its fighting men, or in its financial prosperity, Russia would be an object of pity. But in America it is wholesome to remember that the real greatness of a nation consists in none of these things, but rather in its intellectual splendour, in the number and importance of the ideas it gives to the world, in its contributions to literature and art, and to all things that count in humanity's intellectual advance. When we Americans swell with pride over our industrial prosperity, we might profitably reflect for a moment on the comparative value of America's and Russia's contributions to literature and music. At the start, we notice a rather curious fact, which sharply differentiates Russian literature from the literature of England, France, Spain, Italy, and even from that of Germany. Russia is old; her literature is new. Russian history goes back to the ninth century; Russian literature, so far as it interests the world, begins in the nineteenth. Russian literature and American literature are twins. But there is this strong contrast, caused partly by the difference in the age of the two nations. In the early years of the nineteenth century, American literature sounds like a child learning to talk, and then aping its elders; Russian literature is the voice of a giant, waking from a long sleep, and becoming articulate. It is as though the world had watched this giant's deep slumber for a long time, wondering what he would say when he awakened. And what he has said has been well worth the thousand years of waiting. To an educated native Slav, or to a professor of the Russian language, twenty or thirty Russian authors would no doubt seem important; but the general foreign reading public is quite properly mainly interested in only five standard writers, although contemporary novelists like Gorki, Artsybashev, Andreev, and others are at this moment deservedly attracting wide attention. The great five, whose place in the world's literature seems absolutely secure, are Pushkin, Gogol, Turgenev, Dostoevsky, and Tolstoy. The man who killed Pushkin in a duel survived till 1895, and Tolstoy died in 1910. These figures show in how short a time Russian literature has had its origin, development, and full fruition....","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KmVRvgAACAAJ&dq=Essays+on+Russian+novelists&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Prussian officer and other stories","description":"The Prussian Officer and Other Stories is a collection of 12 stories by D.H.

Yet we know very little about the local and transnational processes that characterize this new migration. Transnational Adoption is a unique ethnographic study of China/U.S. adoption, the largest contemporary intercountry adoption program. Sara K. Dorow begins by situating the popularity of the China/U.S. adoption process within a broader history of immigration and adoption. She then follows the path of the adoption process: the institutions and bureaucracies in both China and the United States that prepare children and parents for each other; the stories and practices that legitimate them coming together as transnational families; the strains placed upon our common notions of what motherhood means; and ways in which parents then construct the cultural and racial identities of adopted children. Based on rich ethnographic evidence, including interviews with and observation of people on both sides of the Pacific from orphanages, government officials, and adoption agencies to advocacy groups and adoptive families themselves this is a fascinating look at the latest chapter in Chinese-American migration.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5_ETCgAAQBAJ&dq=Hitler%27s+Priestess:+Savitri+Devi,+the+Hindu-Aryan+Myth+and+Neo-Nazism.+(Reviews:+general+and+international).+(book+review):+An+article+from:+Canadian+Journal+of+History&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (Classics Illustrated - Featuring Stories by the World's Greatest Authors., 47)","description":"The year 1866 was signalised by a remarkable incident, a mysterious and puzzling phenomenon, which doubtless no one has yet forgotten. Not to mention rumours which agitated the maritime population and excited the public mind, even in the interior of continents, seafaring men were particularly excited. Merchants, common sailors, captains of vessels, skippers, both of Europe and America, naval officers of all countries, and the Governments of several States on the two continents, were deeply interested in the matter. For some time past vessels had been met by \\"an enormous thing,\\" a long object, spindle-shaped, occasionally phosphorescent, and infinitely larger and more rapid in its movements than a whale. The facts relating to this apparition (entered in various log-books) agreed in most respects as to the shape of the object or creature in question, the untiring rapidity of its movements, its surprising power of locomotion, and the peculiar life with which it seemed endowed. If it was a whale, it surpassed in size all those hitherto classified in science. Taking into consideration the mean of observations made at divers times rejecting the timid estimate of those who assigned to this object a length of two hundred feet, equally with the exaggerated opinions which set it down as a mile in width and three in length we might fairly conclude that this mysterious being surpassed greatly all dimensions admitted by the learned ones of the day, if it existed at all. And that it DID exist was an undeniable fact; and, with that tendency which disposes the human mind in favour of the marvellous, we can understand the excitement produced in the entire world by this supernatural apparition. As to classing it in the list of fables, the idea was out of the question. On the 20th of July, 1866, the steamer Governor Higginson, of the Calcutta and Burnach Steam Navigation Company, had met this moving mass five miles off the east coast of Australia. Captain Baker thought at first that he was in the presence of an unknown sandbank; he even prepared to determine its exact position when two columns of water, projected by the mysterious object, shot with a hissing noise a hundred and fifty feet up into the air. Now, unless the sandbank had been submitted to the intermittent eruption of a geyser, the Governor Higginson had to do neither more nor less than with an aquatic mammal, unknown till then, which threw up from its blow-holes columns of water mixed with air and vapour. Similar facts were observed on the 23rd of July in the same year, in the Pacific Ocean, by the Columbus, of the West India and Pacific Steam Navigation Company. But this extraordinary creature could transport itself from one place to another with surprising velocity; as, in an interval of three days, the Governor Higginson and the Columbus had observed it at two different points of the chart, separated by a distance of more than seven hundred nautical leagues.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LGIiDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tantric Sex: The Tantric Art of Sensual Loving","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FrR1cgAACAAJ&dq=Tantric+Sex:+The+Tantric+Art+of+Sensual+Loving&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Elizabeth Appleton 1ST Edition","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Writing with Purpose and Passion: A Writer's Guide to Language and Style","description":"Written with a love for writing that transcends to its readers, this book helps users develop their writing skills and learn how to read even the most basic of forms by combining an overview of the five most commonly used modes of rhetoric with a similar overview of the most common elements of grammar, punctuation, style and usage.

For three decades, from the end of World War II well into the Watergate era, internationally renowned newspaper and magazine columnist Stewart Alsop was a fixture on the Washington, DC, political landscape. In 1971, the respected journalist was diagnosed with a rare form of leukemia, marking the beginning of his courageous three-year battle with the terrible cancer that ravaged his body but could not damage his spirit or slow his facile and brilliantly incisive mind. A passionate social critic and peerless political analyst who hobnobbed with presidents from FDR to Nixon, and enjoyed the respectful fellowship of such notable figures as Winston Churchill, Alice Roosevelt Longworth, and Henry Kissinger, Alsop insightfully chronicles the course of his medical history without a trace of maudlin self-pity while celebrating his family, friends, colleagues, and an extraordinary life well lived. Stay of Execution is Stewart Alsop s moving, powerful, and inspiring memoir of his terminal illness and his life before an unforgettable true story of courage and accomplishment, trials and tragedy from one of the most revered American journalists of the twentieth century.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QIcADAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"St. Paul's Journeys to Greece and Cyprus","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rz4etwAACAAJ&dq=St.+Paul%27s+Journeys+to+Greece+and+Cyprus&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Pocket Pep Talk","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Trek: The Encyclopedia","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Dead Ringer (A Laura Fleming Mystery)","description":"A puzzling corpse stirs up trouble for a Boston woman visiting her Southern hometown in this cozy mystery by a New York Timesbestselling author.

A failure in the entrance examination for the Stieglitz School did not stop Chagall from later joining that famous school founded by the Imperial Society for the Encouragement of the Arts and directed by Nicholas Roerich. Chagall moved to Paris in 1910. The city was his  second Vitebsk . At first, isolated in the little room on the Impasse du Maine at La Ruche, Chagall soon found numerous compatriots also attracted by the prestige of Paris: Lipchitz, Zadkine, Archipenko and Soutine, all of whom were to maintain the  smell  of his native land. From his very arrival Chagall wanted to  discover everything . And to his dazzled eyes painting did indeed reveal itself. Even the most attentive and partial observer is at times unable to distinguish the  Parisian , Chagall from the  Vitebskian . The artist was not full of contradictions, nor was he a split personality, but he always remained different; he looked around and within himself and at the surrounding world, and he used his present thoughts and recollections. He had an utterly poetical mode of thought that enabled him to pursue such a complex course. Chagall was endowed with a sort of stylistic immunity: he enriched himself without destroying anything of his own inner structure. Admiring the works of others he studied them ingenuously, ridding himself of his youthful awkwardness, yet never losing his authenticity for a moment. At times Chagall seemed to look at the world through magic crystal  overloaded with artistic experimentation  of the Ecole de Paris. In such cases he would embark on a subtle and serious play with the various discoveries of the turn of the century and turned his prophetic gaze like that of a biblical youth, to look at himself ironically and thoughtfully in the mirror. Naturally, it totally and uneclectically reflected the painterly discoveries of C zanne, the delicate inspiration of Modigliani, and the complex surface rhythms recalling the experiments of the early Cubists (See-Portrait at the Easel, 1914). Despite the analyses which nowadays illuminate the painter s Judaeo-Russian sources, inherited or borrowed but always sublime, and his formal relationships, there is always some share of mystery in Chagall s art. The mystery perhaps lies in the very nature of his art, in which he uses his experiences and memories. Painting truly is life, and perhaps life is painting.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ABbLQBMBvEQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Skywater","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Sally Goes to the Vet","description":"Huneck's irrepressible canine star, Sally the Black Labrador, returns in an adventure that leads her, unfortunately, to the vet's office.

In fact, many Americans thought of the KJV as the foundational text of the Republic, rather than a cultural inheritance from Anglican Britain. In the nineteenth century, however, as new editions of the Greek New Testament appeared, scholars increasingly recognized significant errors and inconsistencies in the KJV. This soon 1ed to the Bible revision movement, whose goal was the uniting of all English-speaking Protestants behind one new, improved version of the Bible. Ironically, as Peter Thuesen shows in this fascinating history, the revision movement in fact resulted in a vast proliferation of English scripture editions and an enduring polarization of American Christians over versions of Holy Writ. The recurrent controversies over Bible translations, he argues, tell us less about the linguistic issues dividing conservatives and liberals than about the theological assumptions they have long held in common.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Parz1Sxd8BsC&dq=In+Discordance+with+the+Scriptures:+American+Protestant+Battles+Over+Translating+the+Bible+(Religion+in+America)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The rifleman,: A novel","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Something to Declare","description":" Julia Alvarez has suitcases full of history (public and private), trunks full of insights into what it means to be a Latina in the United States, bags full of literary wisdom.

The twenty-four confessional, evocative essays that make up Something to Declare are divided into two parts.  Customs  includes Alvarez s memories of her family s life in the Dominican Republic, fleeing from Trujillo s dictatorship, and arriving in America when she was ten years old. She examines the effects of exile--surviving the shock of New York City life; yearning to fit in; training her tongue (and her mind) to speak English; and watching the Miss America pageant for clues about American-style beauty. The second half,  Declarations,  celebrates her passion for words and the writing life. She lets us watch as she struggles with her art--searching for a subject for her next novel, confronting her characters, facing her family s anger when she invades their privacy, reflecting on the writers who influenced her, and continually honing her craft. The winner of the National Medal of Arts for her extraordinary storytelling, Julia Alvarez here offers essays that are an inspiring gift to readers and writers everywhere.  This beautiful collection of essays . . . traces a process of personal reconciliation with insight, humor, and quiet power.

Some days Nora Nolan thinks that she and her husband, Charlie, lead a charmed life except when there s a crisis at work, a leak in the roof at home, or a problem with their twins at college.

The owners watch one another s children grow up. They use the same handyman. They trade gossip and gripes, and they maneuver for the ultimate status symbol: a spot in the block s small parking lot. Then one morning, Nora returns from her run to discover that a terrible incident has shaken the neighborhood, and the enviable dead-end block turns into a potent symbol of a divided city.

It represents a major contribution to the field.' - Arnold C. Cooper, Purdue University, US 'Professor Scott Shane provides a deep and comprehensive discussion of the individual-opportunity nexus in entrepreneurship. Eschewing the usual approaches of either focusing exclusively on the individuals and their motivations and actions or focusing exclusively, almost always ex-post, on the economic potential of opportunities, Scott Shane fixes his gaze squarely on the nexus of the individual and the opportunity. It is this nexus that I believe is the building block for a better understanding of the entrepreneurial phenomenon.' - from the foreword by Sankaran Venkataraman In the first exhaustive treatment of the field in 20 years, Scott Shane extends the analysis of entrepreneurship by offering an overarching conceptual framework that explains the different parts of the entrepreneurial process - the opportunities, the people who pursue them, the skills and strategies used to organize and exploit opportunities, and the environmental conditions favorable to them - in a coherent way.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8v8QnwEACAAJ&dq=A+General+Theory+of+Entrepreneurship:+The+Individual-Opportunity+Nexus+(New+Horizons+in+Entrepreneurship+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Under the Red Sea sun","description":"A Navy admiral s firsthand account of the Allied salvage operation that played a key role in recovering North Africa from the Nazis during World War II. By 1942, Mussolini s forces were on the run in East Africa. In order to slow the Allied advance, the Italians used audacious tactics including making ports inoperable, leaving the Allies without the infrastructure necessary to continue the war effort. At Massawa, Eritrea, the fleeing Italians left the largest mass wreck in the world, turning a vital port into a tangle of shattered ships, cranes, sunken dry docks, and dangerous booby traps. In order to continue the war effort and push back the Axis powers in Africa, the Allies enlisted a naval salvage expert known as Commander Ellsberg. Ellsberg, a veteran miracle worker in raising sunken ships, was given his toughest assignment yet: Reopen the port with no budget, no men, and no tools. The British had claimed the task was impossible Massawa couldn t be cleared. But a determined Ellsberg navigated complicated American and British bureaucracies to build a ragtag group of international civilians and pull off a historic feat of engineering. This is his account of that crucial operation the largest of its kind the world had ever seen accomplished in the searing heat of Eritrea.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Pcu1AwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Practical Problem Solving in HPLC","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"History of philosophy,","description":" A witty, learned, authoritative survey of philosophical thought.

While the book is my attempt to capture Mac's remarkably and improbably wonderful story before it fades to past, it's also in many ways my story, too.Because Mackie and I were happily and deliriously, joined-at-the-paw.Amazing, I think, that I could learn so much from a guy that never said a word.Paw Prints in My Heart is Mac's story. I think of it as my gift to our family and all of his friends, two and four-legged, that had the pleasure and the privilege of knowing and being loved by this magnificent old Labrador retriever. It's my best attempt to capture and chronicle a remarkable life, the pain and sadness of his passing, but most of all, his joyful impact upon us over what truly was a most improbable life of fourteen years and a day. A reverent and grateful tribute to a gentle and pure spirit that for me will always be a living reminder of a loving friend in the very truest sense. In every way, for me this book was a labor of love and joy to write. Parts will make you laugh, and others may bring you to tears, so a tissue at times may be advised. But I have the highest hopes that you'll read it, enjoy it, and connect in ways that only you can understand. Maybe even share it with friends that might understand and pass it along, as a comfort for a true friend they've lost, and for what they've experienced, and a way for them to remember the laughter and happy times through their tears.I hope that dog lovers everywhere read this book and see a bit of their dog in Mac.I hope that the non-dog lovers amongst us read this book and reconsider. I hope that everyone has at least one dog of their life in their life.My first novel Rush to Dawn, was, in many ways a love letter to my wife, Lynne.This book, I'd like to believe, is a love letter from Mac to all of us.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Nll8oAEACAAJ&dq=Pawprints+On+My+Heart&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ladies in the Parlor","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ttAWnQEACAAJ&dq=Ladies+in+the+Parlor&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Investing in Nature: Case Studies of Land Conservation in Collaboration with Business","description":"In 2004, U.S. consumers spent $5.2 billion purchasing bottled water while the government only invested 5 percent of that amount to purchase critical watersheds, parks, and wildlife refuges-systems vital to clean water and healthy environments. How can we reverse the direction of such powerful economic forces? A group of dedicated business-people-turned-environmental-entrepreneurs is pioneering a new set of tools for land conservation deals and other market-based strategies. These pragmatic visionaries have already used these methods to protect millions of acres of land and to transform the practices of entire industries. They are transforming the very nature of conservation by making it profitable. Drawing on his vast experience in both business and land conservation at The Nature Conservancy (TNC), William Ginn offers a practical guide to these innovative methods and a road map to the most effective way to implement them. From conservation investment banking, to emerging markets for nature's goods and services, to new tax incentives that encourage companies to do the \\"right\\" thing, Ginn goes beyond the theories to present real-world applications and strategies. And, just as importantly, he looks at the lessons learned from what has not worked, including his own failed efforts in Papua New Guinea and TNC's controversial compatible development approach in Virginia. In an era of dwindling public resources and scarce charitable dollars, these tools reveal a new, and perhaps the only, pathway to achieving biodiversity goals and protecting our lands. Conservation professionals, students of land conservation, and entrepreneurs interested in green business will find Ginn's tales of high-finance deals involving vast tracts of pristine land both informative and exciting. More than just talk, Investing in Nature will teach you how to think big about land conservation.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=odiAFJT7s9sC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Faith Enough to Finish","description":"Following the example of Jeremiah, Jill Briscoe examines what it takes to keep faith strong in spite of life's trials and distractions.

Fred Alford asks what we can learn about this concept, and about ourselves, by examining a society where it is unknown where language contains no word that equates to the English term \\"evil.\\" Does such a society look upon human nature more benignly? Do its members view the world through rose-colored glasses? Korea offers a fascinating starting point, and Alford begins his search for answers there. In conversations with hundreds of Koreans from diverse religions and walks of life students, politicians, teachers, Buddhist monks, Confucian scholars, Catholic priests, housewives, psychiatrists, and farmers Alford found remarkable agreement about the nonexistence of evil. Koreans regard evil not as a moral category but as an intellectual one, the result of erroneous Western thinking. For them, evil results from the creation of dualisms, oppositions between people and ideas. Alford's interviews often led to discussions about imported ways of thinking and the impact of globalization upon society at large. In particular, he was struck by how Koreans' responses to globalization matched Westerners' views about evil. In much of the world, he argues, globalization is the ultimate dualism attractive for the enlightenment and freedom it brings, terrifying for the great social and personal upheaval it can cause.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SiJ0DwAAQBAJ&dq=Think+No+Evil:+Korean+Values+in+the+Age+of+Globalization&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Secrets of the Mummies (Eyewitness Readers)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"El Fantasma de Canterville y Otros Cuentos (Spanish Edition)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Maxfield Parrish: The man behind the make-believe","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bbtDHAAACAAJ&dq=Maxfield+Parrish:+The+man+behind+the+make-believe&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mail-Order Brides: Women for Sale","description":"Women who are Looking for a Better Life in a More Developed Country are Usually the Ones who tend to Seek this Type of Arranged Situation.

The instructions were simple, but the results were extraordinary. \\"You are invited to anonymously contribute a secret to a group art project. Your secret can be a regret, fear, betrayal, desire, confession, or childhood humiliation. Reveal anything -- as long as it is true and you have never shared it with anyone before. Be brief. Be legible. Be creative.\\" It all began with an idea Frank Warren had for a community art project. He began handing out postcards to strangers and leaving them in public places -- asking people to write down a secret they had never told anyone and mail it to him, anonymously. The response was overwhelming. The secrets were both provocative and profound, and the cards themselves were works of art -- carefully and creatively constructed by hand. Addictively compelling, the cards reveal our deepest fears, desires, regrets, and obsessions. Frank calls them \\"graphic haiku,\\" beautiful, elegant, and small in structure but powerfully emotional. As Frank began posting the cards on his website, PostSecret took on a life of its own, becoming much more than a simple art project. It has grown into a global phenomenon, exposing our individual aspirations, fantasies, and frailties -- our common humanity. Every day dozens of postcards still make their way to Frank, with postmarks from around the world, touching on every aspect of human experience. This extraordinary collection brings together the most powerful, personal, and beautifully intimate secrets Frank Warren has received -- and brilliantly illuminates that human emotions can be unique and universal at the same time.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Mft-Ms1C1zsC&dq=Exposed+(Postcard+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pensamientos","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lUMgQwAACAAJ&dq=Pensamientos&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"All About Me","description":"The young reader may fill in the appropriate personal data to complete his \\"very own\\" autobiography.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6Bt1JonSpzwC&dq=All+About+Me&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What Little Girls Are Made Of: Sugar, Spice, and Everything Nice","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Soft!","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Set of Wheels","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jdjZAAAACAAJ&dq=Set+of+Wheels&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Staffing the Contemporary Organization : A Guide to Planning, Recruiting, and Selecting for Human Resource Professionals Second Edition","description":"This thoroughly revised edition provides a comprehensive treatment of staffing procedures, policies, techniques, and problems.

Far from being close-ended and self-contained, the novels and plays in which these characters first appeared were treated by many as merely a starting point, a collective reference perpetually inviting augmentation through an astonishing wealth of unauthorized sequels. Characters became an inexhaustible form of common property, despite their patent authorship. Readers endowed them with value, knowing all the while that others were doing the same and so were collectively forging a new mode of virtual community. By tracing these practices, David A. Brewer shows how the literary canon emerged as much \\"from below\\" as out of any of the institutions that have been credited with their invention. Indeed, he reveals the astonishing degree to which authors had to cajole readers into granting them authority over their own creations, authority that seems self-evident to a modern audience. In its innovative methodology and its unprecedented attention to the productive interplay between the audience, the book as a material artifact, and the text as an immaterial entity, The Afterlife of Character, 1726-1825 offers a compelling new approach to eighteenth-century studies, the history of the book, and the very idea of character itself.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AKfIEswuE2UC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Under two dictators;","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Zen Eye: A Collection of Zen Talks","description":"A collection of talks by Sokei-an (1882-1945), the first Zen master to settle in America.

Goldstein spent time in prisons from Warsaw to Siberia, took part in the Russian Revolution and was a respected organizer within the vibrant labor movement in independent Poland.  In 1939, with the Nazi invasion of Poland and establishment of the Jewish Ghetto, Goldstein and the Bund went underground organizing housing, food and clothing within the ghetto; communicating with the West for support; and developing a secret armed force. Smuggled out of the ghetto just before the Jewish militia s heroic last stand, Goldstein assisted in procuring guns to aid those within the ghetto s walls and aided in the fight to free Warsaw. After the liberation of Poland, Goldstein emigrated to America, where he penned this account of his five-and-a-half years within the Warsaw ghetto and his brave comrades who resisted to the end. His surprisingly modest and frank depiction of a community under siege at a time when the world chose not to intervene is enlightening, devastating and ultimately inspiring. -Print ed.  His active leadership before the war and his position in the Jewish underground during it qualify him as the chronicler of the last hours of Warsaw s Jews.

Although Tarleton fled the battlefield to avoid capture, the American victory effectively destroyed the light corps of the British army in the South. Stung by the loss, Cornwallis ordered a deliberate and dogged chase of the American rebels, a campaign that meandered through the wilderness and small communities of the Carolinas. After months of retreating, the Continental army under the command of Nathanael Greene, a Rhode Island Quaker, chose to confront the British army near Guilford Courthouse, North Carolina. Although they fought with tenacity, the Americans were forced to retreat, but Cornwallis's army had suffered casualties too heavy to pursue the Continentals and instead fell back to the port city of Wilmington. Discouraged by the guerrilla tactics, Cornwallis moved north, to his final defeat at Yorktown. In The Cowpens-Guilford Courthouse Campaign, Burke Davis provides an engaging account of the key battles in the American South, demonstrating that it was here that the strength of the Continental army's resistance to superior British forces laid the foundations for the final American victory.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ez_v0wCpQ9cC&dq=The+Cowpens-Guilford+Courthouse+campaign+(Great+battles+of+history)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THe Virginian","description":"The Virginian is a 1902 novel set in the Wild West by the American author Owen Wister.

She quickly learned that there are approximately 15 million people in this country practicing yoga, and fully 50-60 percent of them say they come from a church background. In fact, many churches, Christian retreats, and denominational conventions are incorporating yoga as one creative approach to cultivating a quiet, receptive spirit and deep prayer life.

New York City, 1911. As the workday was about to end, a fire broke out in the Triangle shirtwaist factory of Greenwich Village. Within minutes it consumed the building s upper three stories. Firemen were powerless to rescue those trapped inside: their ladders simply weren t tall enough. People on the street watched in horror as desperate workers jumped to their deaths. Triangle is both a harrowing chronicle of the Triangle shirtwaist fire and a vibrant portrait of an era. It follows the waves of Jewish and Italian immigration that supplied New York City s garment factories with cheap, mostly female labor. It portrays the Dickensian work conditions that led to a massive waist-worker s strike in which an unlikely coalition of socialists, socialites, and suffragettes took on bosses, police, and magistrates. And it shows how a public outcry over the fire led to an unprecedented alliance between labor reformers and Tammany Hall politicians. With a memorable cast of characters, including J.P. Morgan s blue-blooded activist daughter Anne, and political king maker Charles F. Murphy, as well as the many workers who lost their lives in the fire, Triangle presents a dramatic account of early 20th century New York and the events that gave rise to urban liberalism.

At a time when archaeoloy generally is experiencing a surge of popularity, our understanding of medieval settlement, artefacts, environment, buildings and landscapes has been revolutionised. Medieval archaeology is now taught widely throughout Europe and has secured a place in higer education's teaching across many disciplines. In this book Gerrard examines the long and rich intellectual heritage of later medieval archaeology in England, Scotland and Wales and summarises its current position. Written in three parts, the author first discusses the origins of antiquarian, Victorian and later studies and explores the pervasive influence of the Romantic Movement and the Gothic Revival. The ideas and achievements of the 1930s are singled out as a springboard for later methodological and conceptual developments. Part II examines the emergence of medieval archaeology as a more coherent academic subject in the post-war years, appraising major projects and explaining the impact of processual archaeology and the rescue movement in the period up to the mid-1980s. Finally the book shows the extent to which the philosophies of preservation and post-processual theoretical advances have begun to make themselves felt. Recent developments in key areas such as finds, settlements and buildings are all considered as well as practice, funding and institutional roles. Medieval Archaeology is a crucial work for students of medieval archaeology to read and will be of interest to archaeologists, historians and all who study or visit the monuments of the Middle Ages.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zOCAAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Codemaster: Secrets Of Making And Breaking Codes","description":"Ever since humans first began to communicate, we ve had secrets to keep   secrets of state, war, business, or the heart. From the moment the first secret message was sent, others were busy trying to decipher it. By rearranging, substituting, or transposing symbols, any message can be encoded or decoded   if you know how. Secrets of Making and Breaking Codes is a practical field manual designed to teach you the basic mechanics of enciphering and deciphering communications. The author has used his extensive knowledge of and experience in electronic communications and languages   as well as his decades of fascination with secret codes   to demystify the field of cryptology. Hamilton Nickels uses plain, uncomplicated English and simple, workable systems that rely on neither advanced mathematics, nor on ethereal philosophies. This is the only hands-on guide to both the simplest cipher schemes   that need little more than scratch paper and a pencil to crack   as well as more sophisticated codes that use one-time code books, pocket calculators, and the most advanced computer-based systems used by the military and diplomatic corps of most governments. Letting the wrong eyes see a secret message can often make the difference between victory and defeat, success and failure, life and death.

The revolution was over. But freedom beckoned in the form of a small footbridge at Andau, on the Austrian border.

And Cordingly has unearthed stories of a number of young women who dressed in men s clothes and worked alongside sailors for months, sometimes years, without ever revealing their gender. His tremendous research shows that there was indeed a thriving female population from pirates to the sirens of myth and legend on and around the high seas.

Surveying the judicial and public policy issues central to the identification - and protection - of women's rights, Susan Mezey traces the developing legal parameters of gender equality.

Before colonization, the Huron and Montagnais tribes lived in gender-egalitarian societies. The domination of women by men was only one effect of French \\"civilization\\"--along with warfare, disease, famine and Jesuit proselytization--which combined to destroy Indian culture and sexual equality.

Four unrelated accusers including a down-and-out hack writer and a lady poet with a penchant for nude sunbathing have been fleecing bestselling authors, claiming the authors have stolen their work and ingeniously planting evidence to back up their claims. But when punctuation gives way to puncture, Wolfe knows this is no simple case of extortion.

In Empire of Conspiracy, Melley explores the recent growth of anxieties about thought-control, assassination, political indoctrination, stalking, surveillance, and corporate and government plots. At the heart of these developments, he believes, lies a widespread sense of crisis in the way Americans think about human autonomy and individuality. Nothing reveals this crisis more than the remarkably consistent form of expression that Melley calls \\"agency panic\\" an intense fear that individuals can be shaped or controlled by powerful external forces. Drawing on a broad range of forms that manifest this fear including fiction, film, television, sociology, political writing, self-help literature, and cultural theory Melley provides a new understanding of the relation between postwar American literature, popular culture, and cultural theory. Empire of Conspiracy offers insightful new readings of texts ranging from Joseph Heller's Catch-22 to the Unabomber Manifesto, from Vance Packard's Hidden Persuaders to recent addiction discourse, and from the \\"stalker\\" novels of Margaret Atwood and Diane Johnson to the conspiracy fictions of Thomas Pynchon, William Burroughs, Don DeLillo, and Kathy Acker. Throughout, Melley finds recurrent anxieties about the power of large organizations to control human beings. These fears, he contends, indicate the continuing appeal of a form of individualism that is no longer wholly accurate or useful, but that still underpins a national fantasy of freedom from social control.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fbV2DwAAQBAJ&dq=Empire+of+Conspiracy:+The+Culture+of+Paranoia+in+Postwar+American&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Shadow of the Shadow (Crime, Penguin)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"BizTalk: Implementing Business-to-Business E-commerce","description":"The key feature of this book will be its focus on planning, design, implementation, and deployment of applications that involve Microsoft's Biztalk Server e-commerce product, MSN BizTalk e-marketplac services, and BizTalk.org schema repository.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2F15QgAACAAJ&dq=BizTalk:+Implementing+Business-to-Business+E-commerce&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Parachute Badges and Insignia of the World: In Colour","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Slap and Pop Bass","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Toothpaste for Dinner","description":"Filled with edgy humor, this bitterly funny take on the life of a \\"wage slave\\" vents the frustrations of anyone trapped in a dead-end job.

Tabo played a pivotal role in the history of Buddhism in the tenth and eleventh centuries, when Tibetan monks and Indian pandits studied together and translated scripture from Sanskrit into Tibetan.

A Lifetime Ago follows the nostalgic adventures and poignant childhood of Jerry Joyell, an average kid of the 1940s and 1950s. Born in 1942 in Waterbury, Connecticut, Joyell grew up in an era of profound change in post-World War II America. The son of working class parents, he learned the importance of family and came to appreciate the modest yet abundant life his mother and father provided for him and his brother.

He drove his kingdom to the brink of civil war a dozen times in less than twenty years. He allowed his male lovers to rule the kingdom. He led a great army to the most ignominious military defeat in English history. His wife took a lover and invaded his kingdom, and he ended his reign wandering around Wales with a handful of followers, pursued by an army. He was the first king of England forced to abdicate his throne. Popular legend has it that he died screaming impaled on a red-hot poker, but in fact the time and place of his death are shrouded in mystery. His life reads like an Elizabethan tragedy, full of passionate doomed love, bloody revenge, jealousy, hatred, vindictiveness and obsession. He was Edward II, and this book tells his story. The focus here is on his relationships with his male 'favourites' and his disaffected wife, on his unorthodox lifestyle and hobbies, and on the mystery surrounding his death. Using almost exclusively fourteenth-century sources and Edward s own letters and speeches wherever possible, Kathryn Warner strips away the myths which have been created about him over the centuries, and provides a far more accurate and vivid picture of him than has previously been seen.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-YsFBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Style of the Kitab-i-Aqdas: Aspects of the Sublime","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3mbYAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Style+of+the+Kitab-i-Aqdas:+Aspects+of+the+Sublime&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The way we were","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Special Street","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=p6n3HNUfXngC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fall","description":"Traces the labor movement from the end of the Civil War to the 1920s, and looks at the relationships between workers of different ethnic backgrounds","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kmCI6l0o-6AC&dq=Fall&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Child of the Owl (Golden Mountain Chronicles)","description":"Twelve-year-old Casey is waiting for the day that Barney, her father, hits it big -- 'cause when that horse comes in, he tells her, it's the penthouse suite.

Ethan Allen Hawley, the protagonist of Steinbeck s last novel, works as a clerk in a grocery store that his family once owned. With Ethan no longer a member of Long Island s aristocratic class, his wife is restless, and his teenage children are hungry for the tantalizing material comforts he cannot provide. Then one day, in a moment of moral crisis, Ethan decides to take a holiday from his own scrupulous standards. Set in Steinbeck s contemporary 1960 America, the novel explores the tenuous line between private and public honesty, and today ranks alongside his most acclaimed works of penetrating insight into the American condition.

Following this model, there would have been one religion known as Judaism before the birth of Christ, which then took on a hybrid identity. Even before its subsequent division, certain beliefs and practices of this composite would have been identifiable as Christian or Jewish.In Border Lines, however, Daniel Boyarin makes a striking case for a very different way of thinking about the historical development that is the partition of Judaeo-Christianity. There were no characteristics or features that could be described as uniquely Jewish or Christian in late antiquity, Boyarin argues. Rather, Jesus-following Jews and Jews who did not follow Jesus lived on a cultural map in which beliefs, such as that in a second divine being, and practices, such as keeping kosher or maintaining the Sabbath, were widely and variably distributed. The ultimate distinctions between Judaism and Christianity were imposed from above by \\"border-makers,\\" heresiologists anxious to construct a discrete identity for Christianity. By defining some beliefs and practices as Christian and others as Jewish or heretical, they moved ideas, behaviors, and people to one side or another of an artificial border and, Boyarin significantly contends, invented the very notion of religion.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=432ycMoPB-QC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Maps of the Oregon Trail","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5QoHtAEACAAJ&dq=Maps+of+the+Oregon+Trail&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Death of a Soldier","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Talk to Me (Insomniacs)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Kobe Hotel","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Absence in the Palms of My Hands: & Other Poems","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tlxaAAAAMAAJ&dq=Absence+in+the+Palms+of+My+Hands:&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ms. Means Myself","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WMUHywAACAAJ&dq=Ms.+Means+Myself&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Three Artists (Three Women): Modernism and the Art of Hesse, Krasner, and O'Keeffe (Ahmanson-Murphy Fine Arts Book)","description":"Art historian Wagner looks at the imagery and careers of three important figures in the history of twentieth-century art: Eva Hesse, Lee Krasner, and Georgia O'Keeffe, relating their work to three decisive moments in the history of American modernism: the avant-garde of the 1920s, the New York School of the 1940s and 1950s, and the modernist redefinition undertaken in the 1960s.

Monarchies are either hereditary ones, in which the rulers have been for many years of the same family, or else they are those of recent foundation. The newly founded ones are either entirely new, as was Milan to Francesco Sforza, or else they are, as it were, new members grafted on to the hereditary possessions of the prince that annexes them, as is the kingdom of Naples to the King of Spain. The dominions thus acquired have either been previously accustomed to the rule of another prince, or else have been free states, and they are annexed either by force of arms of the prince, or of others, or else fall to him by good fortune or merit. I will not here speak of republics, having already treated of them fully in another place. I will deal only with monarchies, and will show how the various kinds described above can be governed and maintained. In the first place, in hereditary states accustomed to the reigning family the difficulty of maintaining them is far less than in new monarchies; for it is sufficient not to exceed the ancestral usages, and to accommodate one's self to accidental circumstances; in this way such a prince, if of ordinary ability, will always be able to maintain his position, unless some very exceptional and excessive force deprives him of it; and even if he be thus deprived of it, on the slightest misfortune happening to the new occupier, he will be able to regain it. We have in Italy the example of the Duke of Ferrara, who was able to withstand the assaults of the Venetians in the year '84, and of Pope Julius in the year '10, for no other reason than because of the antiquity of his family in that dominion. In as much as the legitimate prince has less cause and less necessity to give offence, it is only natural that he should be more loved; and, if no extraordinary vices make him hated, it is only reasonable for his subjects to be naturally attached to him, the memories and causes of innovations being forgotten in the long period over which his rule has existed; whereas one change always leaves the way prepared for the introduction of another.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Hjd8zQEACAAJ&dq=The+Short+History+of+a+Prince+:+A+Novel+(Random+House+Large+Print)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Paw Prints Through The Years","description":"Paw Prints through the Ages traces the adventures of a truly remarkable cat.

Relying on his vast experience--twenty-plus years in the airline industry and more than thirty years in aviation--Kaps seeks not only to prepare students for careers in the aviation field but also to evoke in these students an excitement about the business. Specifically, he shows students how airlines, airports, and aviation are financed. Each chapter contains examples and illustrations and ends with suggested readings and references. Following his discussion of financial management and accounting procedures, Kaps turns to financial management and sources of financial information. Here he discusses types of business organizations, corporate goals, business ethics, maximizing share price, and sources of financial information. Kaps also covers debt markets, financial statements, air transport sector revenue generation, and air transport operating cost management, including cost administration and labor costs, fuel, and landing fees and rentals. He describes in depth air transport yield management systems and airport financing, including revenues, ownership, operations, revenue generation, funding, allocation of Air Improvement Program funds, bonds, and passenger facility charges. Kaps concludes with a discussion of the preparation of a business plan, which includes advice about starting and running a business. He also provides two typical business plan outlines. While the elements of fiscal management in aviation follow generally accepted accounting principles, many nuances are germane only to the airline industry. Kaps provides a basic understanding of the principles that are applicable throughout the airline industry.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=STmdHEA8i6wC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Child Care Professional, Student Text","description":"Children are already learning at birth, and they develop and learn at a rapid pace in their early years. This provides a critical foundation for lifelong progress, and the adults who provide for the care and the education of young children bear a great responsibility for their health, development, and learning. Despite the fact that they share the same objective - to nurture young children and secure their future success - the various practitioners who contribute to the care and the education of children from birth through age 8 are not acknowledged as a workforce unified by the common knowledge and competencies needed to do their jobs well. Transforming the Workforce for Children Birth Through Age 8 explores the science of child development, particularly looking at implications for the professionals who work with children. This report examines the current capacities and practices of the workforce, the settings in which they work, the policies and infrastructure that set qualifications and provide professional learning, and the government agencies and other funders who support and oversee these systems. This book then makes recommendations to improve the quality of professional practice and the practice environment for care and education professionals. These detailed recommendations create a blueprint for action that builds on a unifying foundation of child development and early learning, shared knowledge and competencies for care and education professionals, and principles for effective professional learning. Young children thrive and learn best when they have secure, positive relationships with adults who are knowledgeable about how to support their development and learning and are responsive to their individual progress. Transforming the Workforce for Children Birth Through Age 8 offers guidance on system changes to improve the quality of professional practice, specific actions to improve professional learning systems and workforce development, and research to continue to build the knowledge base in ways that will directly advance and inform future actions. The recommendations of this book provide an opportunity to improve the quality of the care and the education that children receive, and ultimately improve outcomes for children.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VEdmCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The character of Jesus","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Song of the Hermit Thrush: An Iroquois Legend (Native American Lore and Legends)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Understanding Capitalism: Critical Analysis from Karl Marx to Amartya Sen","description":"Essays by seven leading economists, including Robin Hahnel and John Bellamy Foster, that assess how economic theory has become capitalist ideology.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MuXtAAAAMAAJ&dq=Understanding+Capitalism:+Critical+Analysis+from+Karl+Marx+to+Amartya+Sen&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Taiga's True Views: The Language of Landscape Painting in Eighteenth-Century Japan","description":"This lavishly illustrated book on one of Japan's preeminent painters focuses on the relationship between topography and the language of visual symbols a painter manipulates, or must invent, to suggest specific places.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EHCFrp68l_4C&dq=Taiga%27s+True+Views:+The+Language+of+Landscape+Painting+in+Eighteenth-Century+Japan&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Art of Eric Stanton: For the Man Who Knows His Place (Photo & Sexy Books) (German Edition)","description":"Pulp art at its finest: A Stanton retrospective  A woman has to be strong.

His imaginative, detailed full-color comic strip narratives picture buxom, leggy femmes fatales having their way with tied-up, handcuffed, or simply awestruck men. Stanton's imagery is either an empowerment of female sexuality or a caricature of female-domination fantasy depending on whom you ask but there is no doubt that in Stanton's world, women rule the land. This retrospective volume covers Stanton's work from the late 1940s until the 1990s, including over 500 comic strips, single illustrations, and magazine covers.

The Native peoples of the American Southwest are a unique group, for while the arrival of Europeans forced many Native Americans to leave their land behind, those who lived in the Southwest held their ground. Many still reside in their ancestral homes, and their oral histories, social practices, and material artifacts provide revelatory insight into the history of the region and the country as a whole. Trudy Griffin-Pierce incorporates her lifelong passion for the people of the Southwest, especially the Navajo, into an absorbing narrative of pre- and postcontact Native experiences. She finds that, even though the policies of the U.S. government were meant to promote assimilation, Native peoples formed their own response to outside pressures, choosing to adapt rather than submit to external change. Griffin-Pierce provides a chronology of instances that have shaped present-day conditions in the region, as well as an extensive glossary of significant people, places, and events. Setting a precedent for ethical scholarship, she describes different methods for researching the Southwest and cites sources for further archaeological and comparative study. Completing the volume is a selection of key primary documents, literary works, films, Internet resources, and contact information for each Native community, enabling a more thorough investigation into specific tribes and nations.

The Caesars Palace Grand Prix then culminated in an unholy alliance of the world capital of gambling, the mob, and the international czar of Formula One. During its four-year run of successive Formula One and CART IndyCar events, the race hosted the biggest names in motorsport--Mario Andretti, Bernie Ecclestone, Roger Penske, Chris Pook, Alan Jones, Nelson Piquet, Niki Lauda, Danny Sullivan, Bobby Rahal and Al Unser among them.

The Confederates had won the First Battle of Bull Run in July, and there had not been any major battles in the West, but the Union had also pushed the Confederates out of West Virginia and George McClellan was about to organize the Army of the Potomac for an offensive against Richmond. Months before then, Confederate President Jefferson Davis had sent out diplomatic agents to Europe in attempts to win recognition among major European powers, and to place even further pressure on the status quo, Southern merchants actually refused to export cotton, hoping the sheer weight of economics would compel them to help. As historian Charles Hubbard pointed out, \\"Davis left foreign policy to others in government and, rather than developing an aggressive diplomatic effort, tended to expect events to accomplish diplomatic objectives. The new president was committed to the notion that cotton would secure recognition and legitimacy from the powers of Europe. One of the Confederacy's strongest hopes at the time was the belief that the British, fearing a devastating impact on their textile mills, would recognize the Confederate States and break the Union blockade. The men Davis selected as secretary of state and emissaries to Europe were chosen for political and personal reasons - not for their diplomatic potential. This was due, in part, to the belief that cotton could accomplish the Confederate objectives with little help from Confederate diplomats.\\" As it turned out, the Confederates were almost delivered a master stroke of good fortune when the USS San Jacinto seized the RMS Trent to pull two Southern diplomats, James Mason and John Slidell, off the British boat as contraband of war, sparking an international crisis that infuriated the British and put the North in hot water. Although the British furor provoked the Northern public and inflamed tensions, Union leaders sought to defuse the crisis as Britain demanded the release of the diplomats and a formal apology. For several tense weeks, both sides were on high alert, and the British bolstered their armed forces in the region (including in Canada), but the crisis was eventually resolved with the release of the two Confederates and a public disavowal of the USS San Jacinto's actions. Britain did not receive a formal apology, and the Confederate diplomats eventually made their way across the Atlantic to push for recognition, but they would ultimately fail in the goal, dealing a considerable blow to the South's chances. The Trent Affair chronicles the Civil War's most famous diplomatic crisis and analyzes its effects. Along with pictures of important people, places, and events, you will learn about the Trent Affair like never before, in no time at all.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RsOjtAEACAAJ&dq=The+Trent+affair:+A+diplomatic+crisis&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Vast and Ancient Wilderness","description":"Presents photographs portraying the wilderness area stretching from Oregon to Mexico, accompanied by a historical and social overview","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=D6w9AQAAIAAJ&dq=Vast+and+Ancient+Wilderness&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An Introduction to Christian Ethics","description":"An introductory text explaining the nature, relevancy, coherency, and structure of the moral law as revealed throughout the Bible, with discussion of the Ten Commandments as a moral rubric and a subsequent application of each commandment to Christian living.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nhpkAgAAQBAJ&dq=An+Introduction+to+Christian+Ethics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rouse Up O Young Men of the New Age!","description":"Winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature, among many other awards.

The Somali Court Interpreter is therefore intended to be used as a quick, on-the-feet, in-front-of-the judge/magistrate reference by the English-Somali everyday court interpreters in the U.S., U.K., Canada, and Australia. In the compilation of the glossary part of the book, great lengths have been gone to select the regularly used legal lingo and phrases in order to anticipate and offset any legal terminology challenge that can cause the court interpreter (s) to scratch their heads, feel helpless and embarrassed, bring the proceedings to a standstill, or worse and most perilous guess and interpret according to the context. The other parts of the book give the interpreters a simple and succinct idea on how they must conduct themselves while interpreting in courts, depositions, prison facilities, police interrogations, etc.; what are acceptable and what are not; and how must they react to the emergence of certain situations. The book is the first and only of its kind and this - among its other qualities - is what makes The Somali Court Interpreter a Must-have for every Somali Court Interpreter in the United States of America, United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aK-wa5tXwncC&dq=The+Somali+Court+Interpreter:+A+Must-Have+Book+for+Every+Somali+Court+Interpreter+in+the+U.S.,+U.K.,+Canada,+and+Australia.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Private Property (Schirmer Visual Library)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Clinical Practice of Neurological & Neurosurgical Nursing","description":"The new Seventh Edition of the award-winning classic prepares its users to deliver expert care in this challenging nursing specialty.

As your desire is, so is your will. As your will is, so is your deed. As your deed is, so is your destiny. - Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (IV.4.5) Over two thousand years ago, the sages of India embarked on an extraordinary experiment. While others were exploring the external world, they turned inward - to explore consciousness itself. In the changing flow of human thought, they asked, is there anything that remains the same? They found that there is indeed a changeless Reality underlying the ebb and flow of life. Their discoveries are an expression of what Aldous Huxley called the Perennial Philosophy, the wellspring of all religious faith that assures us that God-realization is within human reach. The Upanishads are the sages' wisdom, given in intense sessions of spiritual instruction in ashrams, in family gatherings, in a royal court, in the kingdom of Death himself. And Easwaran shows how these teachings are just as relevant to us now as they ever were centuries ago.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rFQyA7SbPVsC&dq=THE+UPANISHADS&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Love @ First Site: A Novel","description":"In his debut novel, YouTube personality and author of We Should Hang Out Sometime Josh Sundquist explores the nature of love, trust, and romantic attraction.

High school can only go up from here, right? As Will starts to find his footing, he develops a crush on a charming, quiet girl named Cecily. Then an unprecedented opportunity arises: an experimental surgery that could give Will eyesight for the first time in his life. But learning to see is more difficult than Will ever imagined, and he soon discovers that the sighted world has been keeping secrets. It turns out Cecily doesn't meet traditional definitions of beauty--in fact, everything he'd heard about her appearance was a lie engineered by their so-called friends to get the two of them together. Does it matter what Cecily looks like? No, not really. But then why does Will feel so betrayed?

The tiny island of Run is an insignificant speck in the Indonesian archipelago. Just two miles long and half a mile wide, it is remote, tranquil, and, these days, largely ignored. Yet 370 years ago, Run's harvest of nutmeg (a pound of which yielded a 3,200 percent profit by the time it arrived in England) turned it into the most lucrative of the Spice Islands, precipitating a battle between the all-powerful Dutch East India Company and the British Crown. The outcome of the fighting was one of the most spectacular deals in history: Britain ceded Run to Holland but in return was given Manhattan. This led not only to the birth of New York but also to the beginning of the British Empire. Such a deal was due to the persistence of one man. Nathaniel Courthope and his small band of adventurers were sent to Run in October 1616, and for four years held off the massive Dutch navy. Nathaniel's Nutmeg centers on the remarkable showdown between Courthope and the Dutch Governor General Jan Coen, and the brutal fate of the mariners racing to Run-and the other corners of the globe-to reap the huge profits of the spice trade. Written with the flair of a historical sea novel but based on rigorous research, Giles Milton's Nathaniel's Nutmeg is a brilliant adventure story by a writer who has been hailed as the \\"new Bruce Chatwin\\" (Mail on Sunday).","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=T87doQEACAAJ&dq=Nathaniel%27s+Nutmeg:+Or,+the+True+and+Incredible+Adventures+of+the+Spice+Trader+Who+Changed+the+Course+of+History&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Techniques of Sitar: The Prince Among All Musical Instruments of India","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SbkFnwEACAAJ&dq=Techniques+of+Sitar:+The+Prince+Among+All+Musical+Instruments+of+India&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Car Accident Secrets, Vol. 1","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Belligerence and Debauchery: The Tucker Max Stories","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Desert Lake : The Story of Nevada's Pyramid Lake","description":"Distributed by the University of Nebraska Press for Caxton Press The story of Pyramid Lake contains more than 70 excellent illustrations.

It happens the moment the organization's values, tools, objectives and hopes are internalized in a way that enables people to work tirelessly toward a goal. Common purpose is rarely achieved. But Kurtzman has observed that when a leader is able to bring it about, the results are outsized, measurable and inspiring. Based on Kurtzman's all-new interviews with more than 50 leaders, including Ron Sargent, Ilene Lang, Micky Arison, Simon Cooper, Joel Klein, Janet Field, Steve Wynn, Shivan Subramaniam, Michael Dell, Richard Boyatzis, Tom Kelley, Michael Milken, and Warren Bennis Contains research on leadership Kurtzman has conducted during his years at The New York Times, the Harvard Business Review, Booz & Company, as well as with PricewaterhouseCoopers, Mercer, and Korn/Ferry Based on all new interviews with some of the most dynamic, successful, and enduring leaders, Common Purpose sheds new light on the meaning of leadership, the crucial qualities of leaders, and most importantly, how to lead.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=isHUSlFd2IEC&dq=Common+Purpose&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"China: Understanding Its Past","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Jeanne Calment: From Van Gogh's Time to Ours, 122 Extraordinary Years","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Maths: A Student's Survival Guide: A Self-Help Workbook for Science and Engineering Students","description":"This self-help workbook covers mathematics essential to first-year undergraduate scientists and engineers.

He demonstrates that high levels of cooperation are found where people have to band together to fight off a common enemy, and that this kind of cooperation led to the formation of the Roman and Russian empires, and the United States. But as empires grow, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, conflict replaces cooperation, and dissolution inevitably follows.

In a stunning reappraisal of the sacred texts of antiquity, Ian Lawton uncovers what he believes is the key to deciphering the true origins of our antediluvian ancestors. The comparative history community has for some years argued over who this forgotten race may be and high-profile books such as Graham Hancock's Fingerprints of the Gods and Andrew Collins' Gateway to Atlantis have found a huge audience who are prepared to look beyond the orthodoxy. Lawton argues that the evolution of the modern human race received its most supreme cultural impetus around 100,000 years ago, when the first advanced souls incarnated in human form - giving a philosophical interpretation of the universal stories of fallen angels. With chapters on mythology, evolution, archaeology, geology and science, this scholarly work bravely combines history and philosophy to spectacular effect. The result is is a groundbreaking book that will change not only the way we look at the past, but even more so the future.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nrevGQAACAAJ&dq=Genesis+Unveiled:+The+Lost+Wisdom+of+Our+Forgotten+Ancestors&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Far and Deadly Cry","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Roots and Wings: Affirming Culture in Early Childhood Programs","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Defining Moments (The Prodigal Husband Series #2)","description":"A year after fleeing her home on the South Carolina coast to escape her growing feelings for her married business partner, Jake, Sheila Moore returns to Charleston in the hope of coming to terms with the past, her relationship with Jake, and her quest to find peace, joy, and love in her life.

Contract law, intellectual property, company law, tax law, international trade, and customs law are of fundamental importance in defining this new field of law that is gradually taking shape. This volume focuses on the new frontiers of fashion law, taking into account the various fields that have recently emerged as being of great interest for the entire fashion world: from sustainable fashion to wearable technologies, from new remedies to cultural appropriation to the regulation of model weight, from advertising law on the digital market to the impact of new technologies on product distribution. The purpose is to stimulate discussion on contemporary problems that have the potential to define new boundaries of fashion law, such as the impact of the heightened ethical sensitivity of consumers (who increasingly require effective solutions), that a comparative law perspective renders more interesting. The volume seeks to sketch out the new legal fields in which the fashion industry is getting involved, identifying the new boundaries of fashion law that existing literature has not dealt with in a comprehensive manner.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=37UTEAAAQBAJ&dq=Nadja+on+My+Way+Glb&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Idiot (Vintage Classics)","description":"Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky s masterful translation of The Idiot is destined to stand with their versions of Crime and Punishment, The Brothers Karamazov, and Demons as the definitive Dostoevsky in English.

Even before he reaches home he meets the dark Rogozhin, a rich merchant s son whose obsession with the beautiful Nastasya Filippovna eventually draws all three of them into a tragic denouement.

Does my life matter? How can I make a difference when some days I can't even find my keys?'' asks award-winning author Leslie Parrott. ''I've never been accused of being methodical, orderly, or linear. So when it came to considering my years on this planet, I did so without a sharpened pencil and a pad of paper. Instead, I walked along Discovery Beach, just a few minutes from our home in Seattle. Strange, though. All I seemed to ever bring home from my walks on the beach were little pieces of sea glass. Finding these random pieces eventually became a fixation. And, strangely, with each piece I collected, I felt a sense of calm. What could this mean? What was I to discover from this unintentional collection?''In this poignant and vulnerable book, Leslie shows you how each hodgepodge piece of your life, no matter how haphazard, represents a part of what you do and who you are. While on the surface, none of these pieces may seem to make a terribly dramatic impact, Leslie will show you how they are your life and how when they are collected into a jar - a loving human heart - they become a treasure.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FdAPCB1BZHEC&dq=You+Matter+More+Than+You+Think:+What+a+Woman+Needs+to+Know+About+the+Difference+She+Makes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Book of Genesis","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"MPLS and VPN Architectures, Volume II","description":"Master the latest MPLS VPN solutions to design, deploy, and troubleshoot advanced or large-scale networks With MPLS and VPN Architectures, Volume II, you'll learn: How to integrate various remote access technologies into the backbone providing VPN service to many different types of customers The new PE-CE routing options as well as other advanced features, including per-VPN Network Address Translation (PE-NAT) How VRFs can be extended into a customer site to provide separation inside the customer network The latest MPLS VPN security features and designs aimed at protecting the MPLS VPN backbone How to carry customer multicast traffic inside a VPN The latest inter-carrier enhancements to allow for easier and more scalable deployment of inter-carrier MPLS VPN services Advanced troubleshooting techniques including router outputs to ensure high availability MPLS and VPN Architectures, Volume II, builds on the best-selling MPLS and VPN Architectures, Volume I (1-58705-002-1), from Cisco Press.

Ferrari and Jaguar raced to stake claims as the foremost manufacturers of high-performance cars. Mercedes-Benz came back from war-ravaged Germany and again set the standards in race-car engineering. Aston Martin finally won at its 20th attempt. Enormous crowds - approaching half a million people - saw the first rear-engined saloons to compete at Le Mans, and the first mid-engined sports-racing cars, and the first diesels. On-track performance soared. In 1949 the fastest car hit 135mph on the unique Mulsanne straight. Before the end of the 1950s, top speeds exceeded 180mph. This fascinating book tells the stories of these increasingly potent racing cars and conveys the punishing nature of an incomparable event - the ultimate test of the mental and physical abilities of the fragile individuals who make up racing teams, be they drivers, engineers, strategists or mechanics. Highly detailed year-by-year coverage of the decade's ten races, giving over 30 pages of information and photographs for each year. - Official status provides a number of unique features, including the reproduction of the full-color race poster artwork for each year and photographs from the ACO's archives. - The images include rare color, and the emphasis is on photographs that enthusiasts will not have seen before. - The story of each race is told through photographs and an accompanying commentary. - Complete data for each year includes technical regulations, entry list, circuit changes (with diagram), lap chart, full results and category awards. - The whole work is beautifully designed and presented. - The 1950s was a decade of post-war recovery, with defeated Germany providing only one of the period's race winners - Mercedes-Benz in 1952.

The Amy Fisher case became an international obsession; in the United States, she was the subject of three major TV movies, a musical, books and even trading cards.

It is concerned with the simple joys, the timelessness and perspective found in a way of life which is close to the past. I have heard the singing in many places, but I seem to hear it best in the wilderness lake country of the Quetico-Superior, where travel is still by pack and canoe over the ancient trails of the Indians and voyageurs.\\" Thus the author sets the theme and tone of this enthralling book of discovery about one of the few great primitive areas in our country which have withstood the pressures of civilization. Acute natural perceptivity and a profound knowledge of the relationships to be found in nature combine here in vivid evocations of the sights, the sounds, the vast stillnesses, and the events of the wilderness as the seasons succeed each other. But Mr. Olson is not content merely to \\"describe; he probes for meanings that will lead the reader to a different and more revealing way of looking at the out-of-doors and to a deeper sense of its eternal values. In each of the thirty-four chapters of The Singing Wilderness he has sought to capture an essential quality of our magnificent lake and forest heritage. He shows us what can be read from the rocks of the great Canadian Shield; he offers a delightful essay on the virtues of pine knots as fuel; he writes of the ways of a canoe, of flashing trout in the pools of the Isabella, of tamarack bogs, caribou moss, the flight of wild geese, timber wolves, and the birds of the ski trails.

Hollingdale in Penguin Classics. Nietzsche was one of the most revolutionary and subversive thinkers in Western philosophy, and Thus Spoke Zarathustra remains his most famous and influential work. It describes how the ancient Persian prophet Zarathustra descends from his solitude in the mountains to tell the world that God is dead and that the Superman, the human embodiment of divinity, is his successor. Nietzsche's utterance 'God is dead', his insistence that the meaning of life is to be found in purely human terms, and his doctrine of the Superman and the will to power were all later seized upon and unrecognisably twisted by, among others, Nazi intellectuals. With blazing intensity and poetic brilliance, Nietzsche argues that the meaning of existence is not to be found in religious pieties or meek submission to authority, but in an all-powerful life force: passionate, chaotic and free. Frederich Nietzsche (1844-1900) became the chair of classical philology at Basel University at the age of 24 until his bad health forced him to retire in 1879. He divorced himself from society until his final collapse in 1899 when he became insane. A powerfully original thinker, Nietzsche's influence on subsequent writers, such as George Bernard Shaw, D.H. Lawrence, Thomas Mann and Jean-Paul Sartre, was considerable. If you enjoyed Thus Spoke Zarathustra you might like Nietzsche's Beyond Good and Evil, also available in Penguin Classics. 'Enigmatic, vatic, emphatic, passionate, often breathtakingly insightful, his works together make a unique statement in the literature of European ideas' A. C.

Revisiting and rewriting the book has been a pleasure from beginning to end. With its new elements, the book comes alive in a whole new way. Looking back over more than three decades to the moment of its conception, I can now see how writing this book changed my life in every way. I first wrote it as an act of love, to share an experience that feels as if it's still transforming me in my very cells. It was my hope that telling about the experience could inspire the same profound life-changes in others. The many thousands of letters, emails and spoken appreciations I've received since then let me know that my hope came true. The experience described in the book revealed the living mystery of love to me, allowing me to feel its sweet power for the first time. Because I suddenly knew what real love felt like, I was able to break free of my pattern of painful relationships with women. Ultimately it helped me find my way to Kathlyn, the love of my life and my wife for the past quarter-century. The new edition is ideal for giving to loved ones (including yourself!) who are on the journey to forgiving, accepting and loving themselves. It tells you how I came to an acceptance and unconditional love of even the most difficult-to-love parts of myself. My fondest wish is that you use it for exactly the same purpose, with exactly the same result.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=I5FbzgAACAAJ&dq=Learning+to+love+ourselves+(Learning+to+love,+book+2)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beloved Emma: The Life of Emma, Lady Hamilton","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Great Nasa Flu (Cyber Kdz)","description":"While spending his summer at the Kennedy Space Center, where his father is working on an artificial intelligence program for shuttle launches, Deeder and his fellow computer sleuths must eradicate a deadly virus that made the entire system go completely bonkers.

Up till now these developments have been primarily in numericalcomputation and graphical display, but equal steps forward are now being made in the area of symbolic computing, or in other words the use of computer languages and procedures to manipulate expressions. This allows researchers to compute an algebraic expression, rather than evaluate the expressionnumerically over a given range. This book summarizes a decade of research into the use of symbolic computation applied to statistical inference problems. It shows the considerable potential of the subject to automate statistical calculation, leaving researchers free to concentrate on new concepts.Starting with the development of algorithms applied to standard undergraduate problems, the book then goes on to develop increasingly more powerful tools. Later chapters then discuss the application of these algorithms to different areas of statistical methodology.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2COCnwSALZAC&dq=Symbolic+Computation+for+Statistical+Inference&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Country Cookies","description":"Old-Fashioned Country Cookies Cookbook is filled with melt-in-your-mouth recipes, traditions, memories, tips and ideas...everything cookies!

While in Chicago for his first northern campaign against poverty and inequality, King encounters Chaym Smith, whose startling physical resemblance to King wins him the job of official stand-in.

Francis A. Schaeffer says that the biblical emphasis is quite different. With God there are no little people! This book contains sixteen sermons that explore the weakness and significance of humanity in relationship to the infinite and personal God. Each was preached by Schaeffer at L' Abri Fellowship in Switzerland to the community that gathered there to work, learn, and worship together. The focus of this collection is the lasting truth of the Bible, the faithfulness of God, the sufficiency of the work of Christ, and the reality of God's Spirit in history.

Known as the home of the Big Beef Steer, these rugged hills have produced exemplary cowboys both the ranch and rodeo varieties whose hard work has given them plenty of material for equally good stories. Jim Hoy grew up in the Flint Hills on a ranch at Cassoday that's been in his family for five generations and boasts roots \\"as deep as those of bluestem grass in black-soil bottomland.\\" He now draws on this area's rich cowboy lore as well as on his own experience working cattle, breaking horses, and rodeoing to write a folk history of the Flint Hills spanning a century and a half. Hoy blends history, folklore, and memoir to conjure for readers the tallgrass prairies of his boyhood in a book that richly recalls the ranching life and the people who lived it. Here are cowboys and outlaws, rodeo stars and runaway horses, ordinary folks and the stuff of legends. Hoy introduces readers to the likes of Lou Hart, a top hand with the Crocker Brothers from 1906 to1910, whose poetic paean to ranch life circulated orally for fifty years before seeing print. And he tracks down the legend of Bud Gillette, considered by his neighbors the world's fastest man until he fell in with an unscrupulous promoter. He even unravels the mystery of a lone grave supposed to be that of the first cowboy in the Flint Hills. Hoy also explains why a good horse makes up for having to work with exasperating cattle and why not all horses are created (or trained) equal. And he traces Flint Hills cattle culture from the days of the trail drive through the railroad years to today's trucking era, with most railroad stockyards torn down and only one section house left standing. Writes Hoy, \\"I feed on the stories of the Hills and the characters who tell them as the cattle feed on the grasses.\\" His love of the land shines throughout a book so real that readers will swear they hear the click of horseshoes on flint rock with every turn of the page.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bgTGSAAACAAJ&dq=Cowboys+and+Kansas:+Stories+from+the+Tallgrass+Prairie&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mister Rogers' Songbook (Songs for Kids)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Teaching of Buddha","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"From the Caves and Jungles of Hindostan","description":"In addition to founding the Theosophical Society and playing an influential role in the New Thought movement, the controversial and idiosyncratic figure Madame Blavatsky was a tireless world traveler.

Social reform combatted poverty, crime, and ignorance through new institutions offering nonauthoritarian forms of social control.

He is celebrated for his unique ability to blend strikingly contemporary elements with the traditional design vernacular. He has worked in ultramodern urban hotels and in some of Japan's most famous classic gardens. In each project, his work as a designer of landscape architecture is inseparable from his Buddhist practice. Each becomes a Zen garden, \\"a special spiritual place where the mind dwells.\\" This beautiful book, illustrated with more than 400 drawings and color photographs, is the first complete retrospective of Masuno's work to be published in English. It presents 37 major gardens around the world in a wide variety of types and settings: traditional and contemporary, urban and rural, public spaces and private residences, and including temple, office, hotel and campus venues. Masuno achieved fame for his work in Japan, but he is becoming increasingly known internationally, and in 2011 completed his first commission in the United States which is shown here. Zen Gardens, divided into three chapters, covers: \\"Traditional Zen Gardens,\\" \\"Contemporary Zen Gardens\\" and \\"Zen Gardens outside Japan.\\" Illustrated with photographs and architectural plans or sketches, each Zen garden design is described and analyzed by author Mira Locher, herself an architect and a scholar well versed in Japanese culture. Celebrating the accomplishments of a major, world-class designer, Zen Gardens also serves as something of a master class in Japanese garden design and appreciation: how to perceive a Japanese garden, how to understand one, even how to make one yourself. Like one of Masuno's gardens, the book can be a place for contemplation and mindful repose.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FhjRAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Christ Crucified: Lutheran Sermons by Chad L.

Christianity in this region has been part of the process of conquest and domination, through the association usually made between civilizing and converting. While Catholic missions have emphasized the 'civilizing' process, teaching the Indians the skills which they were expected to exercise within the context of a new societal model, the Protestants have centered their work on promoting a deep internal change, or 'conversion', based on the recognition of God's existence. Various ethnologists and scholars of indigenous societies have focused their interest on understanding the nature of the transformations produced by the adoption of Christianity. The contributors in this volume take native thought as the starting point, looking at the need to relativize these transformations. Each author examines different ethnographic cases throughout the Americas, both historical and contemporary, enabling the reader to understand the indigenous points of view in the processes of adoption and transformation of new practices, objects, ideas and values.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IyCSlSgdycAC&dq=Chamal:+The+Shamanic+Way+of+the+Heart:+Traditional+Teachings+from+the+Andes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Farmhouse Christmas Cookbook (Seasonal Cookbook Collection)","description":"A collection of well-loved recipes, holiday trimmings, heartfelt memories & homespun gifts to give","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9twSMQAACAAJ&dq=Farmhouse+Christmas+Cookbook+(Seasonal+Cookbook+Collection)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Standard English-SerboCroatian, SerboCroatian-English Dictionary: A Dictionary of Bosnian, Croatian, and Serbian Standards","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=u834SAAACAAJ&dq=Standard+English-SerboCroatian,+SerboCroatian-English+Dictionary:+A+Dictionary+of+Bosnian,+Croatian,+and+Serbian+Standards&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Asterix and the great crossing","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Habib and Me: The Strange But True Story of a Jewish-Palestinian Romance","description":"A compelling memoir about a romance between a a middle-aged American Jewish woman and a much-younger diaspora Palestinian (with close emotional ties to Yasser Araft's inner circle, that takes on many unique twists and turns that point her toward the alter and him towards terrorism.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JxVYLLDdCc8C&dq=Habib+and+Me:+The+Strange+But+True+Story+of+a+Jewish-Palestinian+Romance&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A History of Jewellery 1100-1870","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Successful Sitcom Writing: How To Write And Sell For TV's Hottest Format","description":"Sitcoms have never been hotter in Hollywood, and the demand for writers has never been greater.

This critical biography of their collaboration, from 1890 to Martin Ross's death in 1915, studies the self-conscious artistry of the creators of the finest novel of the nineteenth century The Real Charlotte (1894). It considers the influence of both popular culture and high art in the treatment of the volatile Irish landscape and looks for the first time at the contexts of the immensely popular Irish R M stories and Edith Somerville's accompanying illustrations. The writers' sly send-ups of romantic notions of Irishness are revealed, while using certain expectations of a picturesque countryside to their own advantage. The book recontextualizes the writers' fiction and illustrations through inter-disciplinary and cross-cultural methods by considering the influence of the visual arts, theatrical production, antiquarian study, and literature derived from Irish, British, and European sources. In addition to Somerville and Ross's interest in popular and elite art forms, the book stresses the writers' all-consuming interest in land politics, suffragism, the Irish character and the Irish language, the workings of the law in the Irish countryside, and - above all - money and its lack in the small farms and cottages of Ireland.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eIllAAAAMAAJ&dq=Irish+Scene&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eyes Behind the Lines: L Company Rangers in Vietnam, 1969","description":"In mid-December 1968, after recovering from wounds susatined in a murderous mission, Gary Linderer returned to Phu Bai to comlpete his tour of duty as a LRP.

It is the famous Wharton Tract which the state of New Jersey purchased in 1954 for a watershed, game preserve, and park. Many people know and love these wooded acres. Each year, people by the thousands visit Batsto Village, once the center of the iron industry that thrived on the tract more than a century ago. With warmth and accuracy, Arthur D. Pierce tells the story of the years when iron was king, and around it rose a rustic feudal economy. There were glass factories, paper mills, cotton mills, and brickmaking establishments. Here, too, were men who made those years exciting: Benedict Arnold and his first step toward treason; Chrales Read, who dreamed of an empire and died in exile; Revolutionary heroes and heroines, privateers, and rogues. The author's vivid pictures of day-to-day life in the old iron communities are based upon careful research.

Lewis recounts how, in 2000, the United Nations Millennium Summit in New York introduced eight Millennium Development Goals, which focused on fundamental issues such as education, health, and cutting poverty in half by 2015. In audacious prose, alive with anecdotes ranging from maddening to hilarious to heartbreaking, Lewis shows why and how the international community is falling desperately short of these goals.This edition includes an afterword by Lewis, covering events after the lectures were delivered in fall 2005.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=03-ongEACAAJ&dq=Race+Against+Time+(CBC+Massey+Lectures+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Dragon and the Cross: The Rise and Fall of the Ku Klux Klan in Middle America","description":"Describes the history and influence of the Ku Klux Klan in Indiana, and recounts how the imprisonment of Grand Dragon David C.

You'll visit Tobago on a warm summer evening, and Venice at twilight. This isn't a travel book in the usual sense, but it does explore interesting landscapes of the mind and heart. It talks about dancing naked in the morning and being late for work, and visits divorce and the accompanying sorrows and joys. It introduces you to a homeless woman named Joan, and tells about the death of a basset hound named Rufus. It takes you through a \\"near-love\\" experience, and gives instructions on what to do with an extra half-hour you find lying on the ground. And in the end, it's about how beautiful we all are, despite our stumbling, bumbling ways, and what a joy it is to be part of this marvelous, exclusive club we call -- being human.

Until one day the Saint George puppet disappears, and the angry Magician hurls the Boy into the strange Land of Story to find Saint George.

In the wake of the stock market crash and the dawn of the Great Depression, a ray of light emerged from the world of sports in the summer of 1930. Bobby Jones, an amateur golfer who had already won nine of the seventeen major championships he'd entered during the last seven years, mounted his final campaign against the record books. In four months, he conquered the British Amateur Championship, the British Open, the United States Open, and finally the United States Amateur Championship, an achievement so extraordinary that writers dubbed it the Grand Slam. A natural, self-taught player, Jones made his debut at the U.S. Amateur Championship at the age of 14. But for the next seven years, Jones struggled in major championships, and not until he turned 21 in 1923 would he harness his immense talent. What the world didn't know was that throughout his playing career the intensely private Jones had longed to retreat from fame's glaring spotlight. While the press referred to him as \\"a golfing machine,\\" the strain of competition exacted a ferocious toll on his physical and emotional well-being. During the season of the Slam he constantly battled exhaustion, nearly lost his life twice, and came perilously close to a total collapse. By the time he completed his unprecedented feat, Bobby Jones was the most famous man not only in golf, but in the history of American sports. Jones followed his crowning achievement with a shocking announcement: his retirement from the game at the age of 28. His abrupt disappearance from the public eye into a closely guarded private life helped create a mythological image of this hero from the Golden Age of sports that endures to this day.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fTWZAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What a Mother Would Do","description":"When a mother kills her child, we call her a bad mother, but, as this book shows, even mothers who intend to do their children harm are not easily categorized as  mad  or  bad.  Maternal love is a complex emotion rich with contradictory impulses and desires, and motherhood is a conflicted state in which women constantly renegotiate the needs mother and child, the self and the other. Applying care ethics philosophy and the work of Emmanuel Levinas, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and Simone de Beauvoir to real-world experiences of motherhood, Sarah LaChance Adams throws the inherent tensions of motherhood into sharp relief, drawing a more nuanced portrait of the mother and child relationship than previously conceived. The maternal example is particularly instructive for ethical theory, highlighting the dynamics of human interdependence while also affirming separate interests. LaChance Adams particularly focuses on maternal ambivalence and its morally productive role in reinforcing the divergence between oneself and others, helping to recognize the particularities of situation, and negotiating the difference between one?s own needs and the desires of others. She ultimately argues maternal filicide is a social problem requiring a collective solution that ethical philosophy and philosophies of care can inform.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rj8ZBQAAQBAJ&dq=What+a+Mother+Would+Do&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Age of Reason (Being an Investigation of True and Fabulous Theology)","description":"Published in two parts between 1794 and 1795, this controversial tract on religion is the work of a revolutionary freethinker.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=finV86pqiOUC&dq=The+Age+of+Reason+(Being+an+Investigation+of+True+and+Fabulous+Theology)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ireland for Beginners","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Jesus years: A chronological study of the life of Christ","description":"The Jesus Years focus' on putting the four Gospels in a harmonious chronology.

While regarded by foreigners and the Moroccan government as a brigand, some Moroccans considered him a heroic figure, fighting a repressive, corrupt government, while others considered him a thief. Historian David S. Woolman referred to Raisuni as \\"a combination Robin Hood, feudal baron and tyrannical bandit.\\" He was considered by many as \\"The last of the Barbary Pirates\\". Mulai Ahmed er Raisuni was born ... in the late 1860s ... Due to this and his reportedly handsome visage, one of his other nicknames was \\"the Eagle of Zinat.\\" He was the son of a prominent Caid, and began following in his father's footsteps. However, Raisuni eventually drifted into crime, stealing cattle and sheep and earning the ire of Moroccan authorities. He was also widely known as a womanizer. By most accounts, the formative event in Raisuni's life was his arrest and imprisonment by Abd-el-Rahman Abd el-Saduk, the Pasha of Tangier, who was Raisuli's cousin and foster brother. The Pasha had invited Raisuni to dinner in his home in Tangier, only for his men to capture and brutalize Raisuni when he arrived. He was sent to the dungeon of Mogador and chained to a wall for four years; fortunately, his friends were allowed to bring him food, and he managed to survive. Raisuni was released from prison as a general clemency early in the reign of Sultan Abdelaziz - ironically, soon to become Raisuni's greatest enemy\\"--Wikipedia.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0WcbAAAAIAAJ&dq=El+Raisuni+:+the+sultan+of+the+mountains+%3B:+His+life+story+as+told+to+Rosita+Forbes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eleven Hungry Cats","description":"Eleven hungry cats are determined to catch the big fish that sometimes sings lullabies to himself.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nKORAAAACAAJ&dq=Eleven+Hungry+Cats&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Diccionario del Estudiante de la Lengua Espanola (Spanish Edition)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Fragments: Memories of a Wartime Childhood","description":"A memoir of the Holocaust recounts the experiences of a small boy whose father is killed in front of him, is separated from his family, and is sent to the Majdanek death camp, surrounded by bewildering terrors of life","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=btlSrvr4jc0C&dq=Fragments:+Memories+of+a+Wartime+Childhood&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Love That Keeps Us Sane: Living the Little Way of St. Therese of Lisieux (Illuminationbooks)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Conflict of interests: The Gene Wirges story","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GxAfGQAACAAJ&dq=Conflict+of+interests:+The+Gene+Wirges+story&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Crown Guides: Unique Places in San Francisco","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=z43SNHU5qDsC&dq=Crown+Guides:+Unique+Places+in+San+Francisco&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Bible Promise Book: One Thousand Promises from God's Word (New International Version)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Reading Dante's Stars","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"American & Country Music Tune Book: Songbook","description":"Standup comic, actor and fan favorite from HBO's Silicon Valley and the film Crazy Rich Asians shares his memoir of growing up as a Chinese immigrant in California and making it in Hollywood. \\"I turned down a job in finance to pursue a career in stand-up comedy.

It is in a constant state of change and redefinition. In his highly-acclaimed history of experimental film, A.L. Rees tracks the movement of the film avant-garde between the cinema and modern art (with its postmodern coda). But he also reconstitutes the film avant-garde as an independent form of art practice with its own internal logic and aesthetic discourse. In this revised and updated edition, Rees introduces experimental film and video to new readers interested in the wider cinema, as well as offering a guide to enthusiasts of avant-garde film and new media arts. Ranging from C zanne and Dada, via Cocteau, Brakhage and Le Grice, to the new wave of British film and video artists from the 1990s to the present day, this expansive study situates avant-garde film between the cinema and the gallery, with many links to sonic as well as visual arts. The new edition includes a review of current scholarship in avant-garde film history and includes updated reading and viewing lists. It also features a new introduction and concluding chapter, which assess the rise of video projection in the gallery since the millennium, and describe new work by the latest generation of experimental film-makers.

Written when Joyce Carol Oates was in her early twenties, and first published in 1964, With Shuddering Fall is her powerful debut novel, the first of five new Oates reprints from Ecco. Following the turbulent story of two lovers who discover themselves mortal enemies, the author explores the struggle for dominance in erotic relationships that has become a predominant theme in her work, as well as the perils of patriarchal inheritance, and the ripple-effects of emotional loss in adolescence. The result is an unsentimental yet sympathetic rendering of a disastrous love affair in which hatred is nearly as powerful as love, and a yearning for destruction is an abiding and insatiable passion. Discover what prompted the New York Times to compare this young writer s debut to Shirley Jackson s famous short story,  The Lottery.  Readers looking for a place to start in Joyce Carol Oates s vast catalogue will be intrigued by the sheer narrative force of the young author, and her willingness to anatomize the darkest recesses of humanity in a search for redemption and resolution.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FIUnDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Assignment Siberia 1917-1919 Russian Railway Service Corps, World War I","description":"This is the gripping story of a forgotten Russia in turmoil, when the line between government and organized crime blurred into a chaotic continuum of kleptocracy, vengeance and sadism. It tells the tale of how, in the last days of 1917, a fugitive Cossack captain brashly led seven cohorts into a mutinous garrison at Manchuli, a squalid bordertown on Russia's frontier with Manchuria. The garrison had gone Red, revolted against its officers, and become a dangerous, ill-disciplined mob. Nevertheless, Cossack Captain Grigori Semionov cleverly harangued the garrison into laying down its arms and boarding a train that carried it back into the Bolsheviks' tenuous territory. Through such bold action, Semionov and a handful of young Cossack brethren established themselves as the warlords of Eastern Siberia and Russia's Pacific maritime provinces during the next bloody year. Like inland pirates, they menaced the Trans-Siberian Railroad with fleets of armoured trains, Cossack cavalry, mercenaries and pressgang cannon fodder. They undermined Admiral Kolchak's White armies, ruthlessly liquidated all Reds, terrorized the population, sold out to the Japanese, and antagonized the American Expeditionary Force and Czech Legion in a frenzied orchestration of the Russian Empire's gotterdammerung. Historians have long recognized that Ataman Semionov and Company were a nasty lot. This book details precisely how nasty they were.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=28iPAgAAQBAJ&dq=Assignment+Siberia+1917-1919+Russian+Railway+Service+Corps,+World+War+I&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Totem & Taboo.

In recent years they have become more widely studied than ever, stimulating intensely contested interpretations, due to their relevance to central contemporary issues such as English, national identities and gender roles. Interpretations of the history plays have been transformed since the 1980s by new theoretically-informed critical approaches. Movements such as New Historicism and cultural materialism, as well as psychoanalytical and post-colonial approaches, have swept away the humanist consensus of the mid-twentieth century with its largely conservative view of the plays. The last decade has seen an emergence of feminist and gender-based readings of plays which were once thought overwhelmingly masculine in their concerns. This book provides an up-to-date critical anthology representing the best work from each of the modern theoretical perspectives. The introduction outlines the changing debate in an area which is now one of the liveliest in Shakespearean criticism.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rlvJAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Crafting Short Screenplays That Connect","description":"Crafting Short Screenplays That Connect, Fifth Edition, stands alone among screenwriting books by emphasizing that human connection, though often overlooked, is as essential to writing effective screenplays as conflict.

And only one is calling him with a desperate request to meet in secret. First Lady Lindsay Barrett is carrying an anonymous e-mail that contains the makings of an ugly rumor about her husband, the man about to run for higher office---perhaps even the highest office. Someone says they have evidence that Jack Barrett killed his high school sweetheart. Lindsay says it's an outright lie, but the truth lies buried decades in the past in the small town where the governor grew up. Of course, Mac, who's richer than he needs to be and always has plenty of time on his hands, is in the business of handling such matters for his friends. So he packs up and drives straight into the governor's past with the brilliantly conceived plan to poke around and see if he can stir up a little information. He's soon got goons of all sorts poking him back, including a nasty little group of political movers and shakers who aren't above kidnapping and murder to protect their interests. It's clear that his little plan has stirred up nothing but trouble. With no choice but to stick to it, he continues shifting through a complex web of interlocking secrets and lies, some decades old and some rooted violently in the present day. It's up to Mac to sort truth from untruth before a vicious rumor becomes a political nightmare---or worse, before the \\"outright lie\\" is proved a solid, irrefutable fact.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IKgfSuEbeVMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mademoiselle de Scuderi (Hesperus Classics)","description":"As Paris is shaken by a spate of murderous robberies, the aristocratic Mademoiselle de Scuderi pens a poem to poke fun at the cowardly lovers who now fear to go out at night to see their mistresses.

In turn, France, Great Britain, the United States, Spain, and Mexico sought to placate and exploit this fiercely independent people. Eventually forced to remove from their historic homeland to territory west of the Mississippi River, the Kickapoos carried their battle to the plains of the Southwest. Here not only did they wage active and imaginative war, but certain bands became area merchants, acting as middlemen between the Comanche and Kiowa Indians and the United States government. They developed a flourishing trade in plunder and stolen livestock, but their most lucrative \\"goods\\" were the white captives whom they obtained from the Comanches and others. In 1873, after several profitable years of raiding in Texas for the Mexican Republic, the Kickapoos reluctantly settled on a reservation in Indian Territory. Corrupt politicians, land swindlers, gamblers, and whisky peddlers preyed on the tribe, and it was not until the twentieth century that the Kickapoos received just treatment at the hands of the United States government.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QDUiWKyyF4AC&dq=The+Kickapoos:+Lords+of+the+Middle+Border&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"High Theory/Low Culture","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=N8tZAAAAMAAJ&dq=High+Theory/Low+Culture&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Heirloom","description":"A mysterious antique that can summon the devil.

Unlike most studies of immigrant groups, these essays concentrate on cultural practices and expressions of everyday life rather than on the political issues that dominate today's headlines. The authors emphasize the cultural strength and creativity of communities that draw upon Islamic symbols and practices to define \\"Muslim space\\" against the background of a non-Muslim environment. The range of perspectives is broad, encompassing middle-class professionals, mosque congregations, factory workers in France and the north of England, itinerant African traders, and prison inmates in New York. The truism that \\"Islam is a religion of the word\\" takes on concrete meaning as these disparate communities find ways to elaborate word-centered ritual and to have the visual and aural presence of sacred words in the spaces they inhabit. The volume includes 46 black-and-white photographs that illustrate Muslim populations in Edmonton, Philadelphia, the Green Haven Correction Facility, Manhattan, Marseilles, Berlin, and London, among other places. The focus on space directs attention to the new kinds of boundaries and consciousness that exist not only for these Muslim populations, but for people from all backgrounds in today's ever more integrated world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=d_iCDsJdQj0C&dq=The+Islamic+Space&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Drums of Tonkin An Adventure in Indonesia","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=N2M9AAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Drums+of+Tonkin+An+Adventure+in+Indonesia&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The United States marshals of New Mexico & Arizona territories, 1846-1912","description":"This classic history of frontier violence and law enforcement presents a thoroughly researched, well-documented, and entertaining account of the United States marshals in tumultuous territorial New Mexico and Arizona.

Apparently not. After more than 200 years of shared history and interests, the U.S.-France marriage looks as if it's ending in an acrimonious divorce. Here is the shocking insider account. In the wake of French behavior at the United Nations, where Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin systematically undermined the efforts of Secretary of State Colin Powell to convince the Security Council to authorize force against Iraq, Americans have at best come to suspect our ally of double dealing, and at worst come to view them as the enemy. Almost daily over the past year, new stories have emerged of how the government of French President Jacques Chirac has sought to undermine the U.S. war on terror, publicly sniping at America and inciting other countries to do the same. What's wrong with France? What's behind their recent perfidy? According to bestselling author Kenneth R. Timmerman, the American public doesn't know half the story. After they read The French Betrayal of America, American anger at France will turn to outrage. Timmerman, who worked as a journalist in France for eighteen years and knows the players on both sides, lifts the veil of Jacques Chirac's scandalous love affair with Saddam Hussein, beginning in 1975, when he took him on a tour of top-secret French nuclear facilities. The French attitude toward the dictator, which seemed to baffle American politicians, was in fact entirely predictable. Put bluntly, it was all about money, oil, and guns. Chirac needed Saddam's oil and Saddam's money, and Saddam needed French weapons and French nuclear technology. Despite this, the relationship between France and America was not only amicable but at times very mutually beneficial. That was until the most recent war on Iraq, where France turned the tables, engaging in dirty diplomacy and helping to sway other European countries to their side. French war coverage was not merely one-sided: It was viciously inaccurate, skewed, and openly anti-American. Timmerman also presents incredible new evidence of France's duplicity, including the fact that the French stood to gain $100 billion from secret oil contracts they had concluded with Saddam Hussein. The French Betrayal of America raises questions of whether the nuclear cooperation agreements still in force with the French today should be canceled in light of France's behavior. Our security interests no longer converge, and our economic systems increasingly appear to be at loggerheads. The war in Iraq harshly exposed French treachery and their desire to do business with the worst of international tyrants, putting their economy, their international standing, and their relationship with a 200-year-old friend in severe jeopardy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9dn_odQALagC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What Every American Should Know About Who's Really Running the World","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The wealth of nations","description":"Provides a description and analysis of the inner workings of a market economy, presenting the fundamental principles of a capitalist system.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cZsdAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+wealth+of+nations&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mischief","description":"The riveting true story of decadence, deception, and murder among British aristocrats in colonial Kenya In 1941, with London burning in the Blitz, a group of hedonistic English nobles partied shamelessly in Kenya. Far removed from falling bombs, the wealthy elites of  Happy Valley  indulged in morphine, alcohol, and unrestricted sex, often with their friends  spouses. But the party turned sinister in the early hours of a January morning for Josslyn Hay, Lord Erroll, who had been enjoying the favors of the beautiful young wife of a middle-aged neighbor. Hay was found dead, a bullet in his brain. The murder shocked the close-knit community of wealthy expatriates in Nairobi and shined a harsh light on their louche lifestyle. Three decades later, author James Fox researched the slaying of Lord Erroll, an unsolved crime still sheathed in a thick cloud of rumor and innuendo. What he discovered was both unsettling and luridly compelling. White Mischief is a spellbinding true-crime classic, a tale of privileged excess and the wages of sin, and an account of one writer s determined effort to crack a cold and craven killing.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3cdcAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Book of Revelation: An Exposition of the First Eleven Chapters Originally Published Under the Title \\"the Spiritual Kingdom\\" (Geneva Series of Commentaries)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Preventing and Remediating Reading Difficulties: Bringing Science to Scale","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Anti-Catholicism in America: The Last Acceptable Prejudice","description":"The program director for Fordham University's Center for American Catholic Studies analyzes the ongoing bias against Catholics in America, using the recent priest sex abuse scandal to trace a contemporary rush to judgment that has tainted coverage of the events and may point to a resurgence in anti-Catholicism.

His thirst for adventure was formed by his boyhood visits to remote Scottish lighthouses, and he spent much of his life fleeing the rigours of cold climates and social orthodoxy. Along the way he canoed through Belgium and France, booked passage to and across America, and finally famously settled in Samoa in the South Seas. The walking trip that Stevenson describes in Travels with a Donkey in the Cevennes (1879) was taken when the nascent author was still in his twenties and pining for a lost love. Accompanied by Modestine, the eponymous donkey he hired to carry his camping gear, the journey proved both challenging and charming. The book is infused with all of the qualities that make Stevenson the most popular of writers: humour and humanity, poetry and perspicacity, ebullience and intelligence.\\"--Publisher's description.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FNrNrQEACAAJ&dq=Travels+with+a+donkey+in+the+Cevennes,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Suffragette (My Story)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"American jurisprudence, 1870-1970: A history","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=O1GzzQEACAAJ&dq=American+jurisprudence,+1870-1970:+A+history&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nadi on Fencing","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Certain Trumpets: The Call of Leaders (Cassette)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Stone Cats: Includes Instructions for Creating Your Own Stone Cats","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Bewitched","description":"The Bewitched Continuum is a fun insider's look at the classic television show's overall continuity that will have you appreciating Samantha, Darrin, and their circle of impish witches and manic mortals in a whole new way.Adam-Michael James zaps up the same magnifying glass he uses on scripts for Hollywood studios and his columns at soapcentral.com to explore the consistencies and inconsistencies of Bewitched, comparing and contrasting all 254 episodes like never before.

Primarily intended to serve Sailors (from seamen to admirals), this book has long been used by potential recruits, Navy buffs, and a cadre of dedicated collectors.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=w9NzrgEACAAJ&dq=The+Bluejackets%27+Manual&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Practical Linux","description":"A guide for nonspecialists covers working with KDE and the Gnome interface, getting help, system maintenance, connecting to the Web, e-mail, printing, adding peripherals, networking, and troubleshooting","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HiiLQgAACAAJ&dq=Practical+Linux&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"To the Left of Inspiration: Adventures in Living with Disabilities","description":"When is the last time you've read an honest, funny book about living with disabilities? To the Left of Inspiration: Adventures in Living with Disabilities is just such a book. Fifty-four million Americans have chronic illnesses or disabilities requiring them to make accommodations in the ways they live their lives. You may have students, customers, and clients with disabilities and want to interact with them knowledgeably and sensitively. Or perhaps you are adjusting to a new illness or disability and have accepted that it's a whole new world you are entering. You'll learn from a woman blind from birth about activities of daily life, like talking to children about disabilities, traveling, going to church, and working. Kathie's life experiences highlight the warmth and humor in everyone's struggles to be humane with each other, whether we are temporarily able-bodied or disabled. Disabilities can be more than adjusted to; they can be mined for pearls and Kathie shares some of hers with you. Kathie is a guide, familiar with the territory, who will walk beside you as you negotiate your new world. You won't learn how to overcome your disability, but you will laugh in recognition and hope as you read To the Left of Inspiration. Come along with Kathie and her Seeing EyeT dog on their adventures; your life will be enriched. Katherine Schneider has been blind since her premature birth in 1949 and has had fibromyalgia for over ten years. She was the first blind student to graduate from the Kalamazoo, Michigan public school system in 1967 and was a valedictorian as well as a National Merit scholar. Three years later she graduated with honors from Michigan State University with a BS in psychology. After receiving her PhD in clinical psychology from Purdue University, she has worked at four universities: three of them public and one private. She has taught psychology courses from freshman psychology to the graduate level and has counseled, supervised, and administered university counseling services. Kathie has presented papers at national professional meetings and authored articles and book chapters on such topics as counseling people with disabilities and religion and visual impairment. She has won awards for her professional work from the Courage Center, the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire, and the University of Wisconsin System Regents, among others. Katherine has recently retired and is enjoying serving on seven state and local boards (at least she's never bored), reading novels, and trying to live the Red Hat(r) philosophy. She is proud to have been a Seeing EyeT dog user for the past thirty years.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aWK53u47CFAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Oxford Book of English Detective Stories","description":"Essential reading for all armchair detectives, this collection of 33 classic whodunits is the cream of crime writing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jFK7QgAACAAJ&dq=The+Oxford+Book+of+English+Detective+Stories&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Case in Point: Complete Case Interview Preparation, Fourth Edition","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"One Thing That's True","description":"When her family starts acting strangely, thirteen-year-old Roxanne Jacob learns that her older brother Joel is adopted, but that it had been kept secret all these years because of family trouble.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=D-IBAAAACAAJ&dq=One+Thing+That%27s+True&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Gentle Order of Girls and Boys: Stories","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Adobe InDesign CS2 Revealed","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=64LUoQEACAAJ&dq=Adobe+InDesign+CS2+Revealed&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"History of Colquitt County [Georgia]","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Bird Alphabet Book (Jerry Pallotta's Alphabet Books)","description":"Ready to go birding?

The White Rose. Gabriele Fontana.","description":"A groundbreaking look at marriage, one of the most basic and universal of all human institutions, which reveals the emotional, physical, economic, and sexual benefits that marriage brings to individuals and society as a whole. The Case for Marriage is a critically important intervention in the national debate about the future of family. Based on the authoritative research of family sociologist Linda J. Waite, journalist Maggie Gallagher, and a number of other scholars, this book s findings dramatically contradict the anti-marriage myths that have become the common sense of most Americans. Today a broad consensus holds that marriage is a bad deal for women, that divorce is better for children when parents are unhappy, and that marriage is essentially a private choice, not a public institution. Waite and Gallagher flatly contradict these assumptions, arguing instead that by a broad range of indices, marriage is actually better for you than being single or divorced physically, materially, and spiritually. They contend that married people live longer, have better health, earn more money, accumulate more wealth, feel more fulfillment in their lives, enjoy more satisfying sexual relationships, and have happier and more successful children than those who remain single, cohabit, or get divorced. The Case for Marriage combines clearheaded analysis, penetrating cultural criticism, and practical advice for strengthening the institution of marriage, and provides clear, essential guidelines for reestablishing marriage as the foundation for a healthy and happy society.  A compelling defense of a sacred union. The Case for Marriage is well written and well argued, empirically rigorous and learned, practical and commonsensical.  -- William J. Bennett, author of The Book of Virtues  Makes the absolutely critical point that marriage has been misrepresented and misunderstood.  -- The Wall Street Journal www.broadwaybooks.com","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tUJ55tuDMXEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gallimaufry: A Hodgepodge of our Vanishing Vocabulary","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Using SPSS for Windows: Data Analysis and Graphics","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Worth Fighting 4","description":"Shuntell Alston continues her compelling story of cancer, war, and marriage in this book as she digs deeper and exposes the blood, sweat, and tears she endured along this never-ending journey of the fight of her life.

At Corinth, the Mobile and Ohio Railroad crossed the Memphis and Charleston Railroad, creating a crucial nexus for the transport of supplies, material, and men throughout the western Confederacy. Following the battle of Shiloh, a vast Federal army under Gen. Henry Halleck captured the town after an extended siege. But by summer, Confederate forces began a broad offensive. In the East, Gen. Robert E. Lee invaded Maryland, while in the West, Gen. Braxton Bragg led an incursion into Kentucky. In support of Bragg, Generals Earl Van Dorn and Sterling Price were ordered to drive back the Union forces under Generals Ulysses S. Grant and William S. Rosecrans and seize control of northern Mississippi. The action began in earnest in September, as Price fought Rosecrans to a bloody standoff at Iuka, Mississippi. Price then combined his forces with Van Dorn, who, in early October turned his attention to the effort of regaining Corinth. The campaign for Corinth reached a crescendo in one the Civil War's most violent and bloody assaults, setting the stage for Grant's Vicksburg campaign and ultimately deciding the fate of the Confederacy in the Mississippi Valley.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tJx3AAAAMAAJ&dq=Campaign+for+Corinth:+Blood+in+Mississippi+(Civil+War+Campaigns&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In the Cage (Hesperus Classics)","description":"","infoLink":""}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:L},data(){return{visibleCount:6,booksData:S,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visibleBooks(){return this.booksData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMoreBooks(){return this.visibleCount<this.booksData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},P=["disabled"],E={key:0},I={key:1};function x(s,i,t,u,r,n){const g=f("PoemCard");return e(),o("section",null,[i[1]||(i[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your Books 📚")])],-1)),a("div",M,[(e(!0),o(m,null,y(n.visibleBooks,(l,p)=>(e(),b(g,{key:p,poem:l},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),n.hasMoreBooks?(e(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:i[0]||(i[0]=(...l)=>n.loadMore&&n.loadMore(...l))},[r.isLoading?(e(),o("span",I,"Loading...")):(e(),o("span",E,"See more"))],8,P)):c("",!0)])}const W=d(B,[["render",x],["__scopeId","data-v-937f5e8c"]]),J=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/54.md","filePath":"drive/54.md"}'),H={name:"drive/54.md"},R=Object.assign(H,{setup(s){return(i,t)=>(e(),o("div",null,[w(W)]))}});export{J as __pageData,R as default};
