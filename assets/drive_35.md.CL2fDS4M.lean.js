USA Today Longlisted for the 2022 Booker Prize From the Man Booker finalist and bestselling author of We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves comes an epic and intimate novel about the family behind one of the most infamous figures in American history: John Wilkes Booth. In 1822, a secret family moves into a secret cabin some thirty miles northeast of Baltimore, to farm, to hide, and to bear ten children over the course of the next sixteen years. Junius Booth breadwinner, celebrated Shakespearean actor, and master of the house in more ways than one is at once a mesmerizing talent and a man of terrifying instability. One by one the children arrive, as year by year, the country draws frighteningly closer to the boiling point of secession and civil war. As the tenor of the world shifts, the Booths emerge from their hidden lives to cement their place as one of the country s leading theatrical families. But behind the curtains of the many stages they have graced, multiple scandals, family triumphs, and criminal disasters begin to take their toll, and the solemn siblings of John Wilkes Booth are left to reckon with the truth behind the destructively specious promise of an early prophecy.

Jerry Dennis s sparkling prose and Glenn Wolff s captivating illustrations transport us to a world we recognize from childhood: a place of limitless range and possibility, shimmering with life, where the very next cast will be the one that hooks something enormous and wonderful. PRAISE:  A Place on the Water is a collection of lyrical, haunting essays, set in northern Michigan. Many are about fishing, but that does not necessarily mean they are to be enjoyed strictly by anglers. Hemingway s Big Two-Hearted River was about fishing, too, but can be read for pleasure if you have never wet a line Dennis covers a lot of ground, then; but there is throughout the book a kind of constant tone, as sharp and precise as the scent of cedar.

The author, Vincent Arthur Smith, was an Irish-born historian and antiquary who served in the Indian Civil Service before turning to full-time research and scholarship. After assuming the throne while still a youth, Akbar succeeded in consolidating and enlarging the Mughal Empire. He instituted reforms of the tax structure, the organization and control of the military, and the religious establishment and its relationship to the state. He was also a patron of culture and the arts, and he had a keen interest in religion and the possible sources of religious knowledge. The book traces Akbar's ancestry and early years; his accession to the throne and his regency under Bayram Khan; his many conquests, including Bihar, the Afghan kingdom of Bengal, Malwa, Gujarat, Kashmir, Sind, parts of Orissa, and parts of the Deccan Plateau; and his annexation of other territories through diplomacy, including Baluchistan and Kandahar. The book devotes considerable attention to Akbar's religious beliefs and interests. On several occasions Akbar requested that the Portuguese authorities in Goa send priests to his court to teach him about Christianity, and the book recounts the stories of the three Jesuit missions organized in response to these requests. By origin a Sunni Muslim, Akbar also sought to learn from Shi?ite scholars, Sufi mystics, and Hindus, Jains, and Parsis. The last four chapters of the book are not chronological but deal with the Akbar's personal characteristics, civil and military institutions in the empire, the social and economic conditions of the people, and literature and art. The book contains a detailed chronology of the life and reign of Akbar and an annotated bibliography. Also included are maps and illustrations. Maps of India in 1561 and India in 1605 show the extent of Akbar's conquests, and sketch maps illustrate his main military campaigns.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PUfRAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fundamentalism: Hazards and Heartbreaks","description":"Fundamentalism is a world-shaking force.

Charles Glass renowned journalist and author of the critically acclaimed Americans in Paris: Life and Death Under Nazi Occupation delves deep into army archives, personal diaries, court-martial records, and self-published memoirs to produce this dramatic and heartbreaking portrait of men overlooked by their commanders and ignored by history. Surveying the 150,000 American and British soldiers known to have deserted in the European Theater, The Deserters: A Hidden History of World War II tells the life stories of three soldiers who abandoned their posts in France, Italy, and Africa. Their deeds form the backbone of Glass s arresting portrait of soldiers pushed to the breaking point, a sweeping reexamination of the conditions for ordinary soldiers. With the grace and pace of a novel, The Deserters moves beyond the false extremes of courage and cowardice to reveal the true experience of the frontline soldier. Glass shares the story of men like Private Alfred Whitehead, a Tennessee farm boy who earned Silver and Bronze Stars for bravery in Normandy yet became a gangster in liberated Paris, robbing Allied supply depots along with ordinary citizens. Here also is the story of British men like Private John Bain, who deserted three times but never fled from combat and who endured battles in North Africa and northern France before German machine guns cut his legs from under him. The heart of The Deserters resides with men like Private Steve Weiss, an idealistic teenage volunteer from Brooklyn who forced his father a disillusioned First World War veteran to sign his enlistment papers because he was not yet eighteen. On the Anzio beachhead and in the Ardennes forest, as an infantryman with the 36th Division and as an accidental partisan in the French Resistance, Weiss lost his illusions about the nobility of conflict and the infallibility of American commanders. Far from the bright picture found in propaganda and nostalgia, the Second World War was a grim and brutal affair, a long and lonely effort that has never been fully reported to the detriment of those who served and the danger of those nurtured on false tales today. Revealing the true costs of conflict on those forced to fight, The Deserters is an elegant and unforgettable story of ordinary men desperately struggling in extraordinary times.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pYxsZ0Y9iZwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Handbook of Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests with Nursing Implications (4th Edition)","description":"Nursing-focused and easy-to-read, this full-color manual delivers all the information you need to understand how tests work, interpret their results, and provide quality patient care pre-test, intra-test, and post-test.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9DInEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Strength, Speed & Power: More Than 100 Exercises to Help You Run Faster, Jump Higher, and Throw Harder","description":"In training speed, the most elusive athletic quality, what really works, and what doesn't?

At once heartbreaking, mesmerizing, and nostalgic, Chicurel shows us that no matter how beautiful some dreams are, there comes a time when we must let them go.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3xl0AwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Vegetarian Soups for All Seasons","description":"Presents a collection of more than 120 recipes of soups and stews.

Lawrence H. Fuchs searches for answers to this question by examining the historical patterns of American ethnicity and the ways in which a national political culture has evolved to accommodate ethnic diversity. Fuchs looks first at white European immigrants, showing how most of them and especially their children became part of a unifying political culture. He also describes the ways in which systems of coercive pluralism kept persons of color from fully participating in the civic culture. He documents the dismantling of those systems and the emergence of a more inclusive and stronger civic culture in which voluntary pluralism flourishes. In comparing past patterns of ethnicity in America with those of today, Fuchs finds reasons for optimism. Diversity itself has become a unifying principle, and Americans now celebrate ethnicity. One encouraging result is the acculturation of recent immigrants from Third World countries. But Fuchs also examines the tough issues of racial and ethnic conflict and the problems of the ethno-underclass, the new outsiders. The American Kaleidoscope ends with a searching analysis of public policies that protect individual rights and enable ethnic diversity to prosper. Because of his lifelong involvement with issues of race relations and ethnicity, Lawrence H. Fuchs is singularly qualified to write on a grand scale about the interdependence in the United States of the unum and the pluribus. His book helps to clarify some difficult issues that policymakers will surely face in the future, such as those dealing with immigration, language, and affirmative action.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gjvHBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sparrows don't drop candy wrappers","description":"Discusses the do's and don'ts for everyone interested in stopping the spread of pollution.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IYzpAAAACAAJ&dq=Sparrows+don%27t+drop+candy+wrappers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Boundless Frontier: America From Christopher Columbus to Abraham Lincoln","description":"The Boundless Frontier follows the major events of American History from the pre-Columbian Indians through the Civil War.

Though the first edition was published in 1855, Whitman spent his entire life writing and re-writing Leaves of Grass, revising it in several editions until his death. This resulted in vastly different editions over four decades the first a small book of twelve poems and the last a compilation of over 400 poems.The poems of Leaves of Grass are loosely connected and each represents Whitman's celebration of his philosophy of life and humanity. This book is notable for its discussion of delight in sensual pleasures during a time when such candid displays were considered immoral. Where much previous poetry, especially English, relied on symbolism, allegory, and meditation on the religious and spiritual, Leaves of Grass (particularly the first edition) exalted the body and the material world. Influenced by Ralph Waldo Emerson and the Transcendentalist movement, itself an offshoot of Romanticism, Whitman's poetry praises nature and the individual human's role in it. However, much like Emerson, Whitman does not diminish the role of the mind or the spirit; rather, he elevates the human form and the human mind, deeming both worthy of poetic praise.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_27qoQEACAAJ&dq=Leaves+of+grass,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Seducing Sybilla (Zebra Regency Romance)","description":"Sybilla Smethwick cannot help but feel protective of her older sister, Honoria, who upon the tragic death of her husband was left alone to raise their son.

In February 1972, Richard Nixon, the first American president ever to visit China, and Mao Tse-tung, the enigmatic Communist dictator, met for an hour in Beijing. Their meeting changed the course of history and ultimately laid the groundwork for the complex relationship between China and the United States that we see today. That monumental meeting in 1972during what Nixon called  the week that changed the world could have been brought about only by powerful leaders: Nixon himself, a great strategist and a flawed human being, and Mao, willful and ruthless. They were assisted by two brilliant and complex statesmen, Henry Kissinger and Chou En-lai. Surrounding them were fascinating people with unusual roles to play, including the enormously disciplined and unhappy Pat Nixon and a small-time Shanghai actress turned monstrous empress, Jiang Qing. And behind all of them lay the complex history of two countries, two great and equally confident civilizations: China, ancient and contemptuous yet fearful of barbarians beyond the Middle Kingdom, and the United States, forward-looking and confident, seeing itself as the beacon for the world. Nixon thought China could help him get out of Vietnam. Mao needed American technology and expertise to repair the damage of the Cultural Revolution. Both men wanted an ally against an aggressive Soviet Union. Did they get what they wanted? Did Mao betray his own revolutionary ideals? How did the people of China react to this apparent change in attitude toward the imperialist Americans? Did Nixon make a mistake in coming to China as a supplicant? And what has been the impact of the visit on the United States ever since? Weaving together fascinating anecdotes and insights, an understanding of Chinese and American history, and the momentous events of an extraordinary time, this brilliantly written book looks at one of the transformative moments of the twentieth century and casts new light on a key relationship for the world of the twenty-first century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xJ3YR-Y5ANwC&dq=The+Week+That+Changed+the+World&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The city","description":"A gifted musician relates the events of 1967 that impacted his family and friends, from his indomitable \\"piano man\\" grandfather and struggling singer single mother to the everyday saints and sinners who shaped his life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=awKPDQAAQBAJ&dq=The+city&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jonah & the Big Fish","description":"A reasonably priced, quality black hardcover pew and ministry Bible featuring a large 12-point font.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rbQ4MAEACAAJ&dq=Jonah&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Akiko and the Alpha Centauri 5000 (Akiko)","description":"Akiko and her crewSpuckler Boach, Mr. Beeba, Poog, and Gaxare competing in an intergalactic race from one side of the universe to the other.

My personal experience leading to Skull Hill known as Golgotha outlines the events which have led me to become involved with efforts to save Golgotha. Many years ago I experienced a dream about the Crucifixion. I saw the bodies of Jesus and the two thieves as they were being carried away from the cross. A band of angels sang a mournful dirge: \\"Oh Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who stonest the Prophets, Jerusalem, who crucified My Son.\\" I saw the carpenter remove the nails, one of which he handed to me. I woke up seeing the blood of Jesus on my hands. I cried like a baby with the realization that He died for me. After having this vision, I had a deep desire to visit Israel. During my first trip to Jerusalem, I made three visits to Golgotha. I was concerned with the condition of this site. It was choked with the sounds, smells, and appearance of the Jerusalem bus station. On the east side there was new construction of a mosque with two minarets. My heart burned with a desire to do something to restore this Christian holy site. Subsequent trips led me to meet with representatives of major branches of Israeli government. One of many of our goals is the repair and or replacement of the Stone Face which was destroyed during a recent storm. I believe that we must concentrate our efforts on worldwide education to reverse the desecration of this holy site. The Golgotha Foundation is continuing our efforts to \\"open the eyes of the world\\" to see the place of our Savior's death. We will be blessed and our faith increased when we look upon the place where Jesus the Christ, Yeshua ha Machiach, was crucified.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Xn8uEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Place+of+the+Skull&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"History of the Chaplain Corps United States Navy, Volume VIII: United States Navy Chaplains 1972 - 1981 (Biographical and Service Record Sketches of Chaplains on Active Duty During The Period 1 January 1972 - 31 December 1981, Volume 8)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4xKZGN0u9foC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blood On Their Hands","description":"This book reevaluates the Bush Administration, transferring the blame for eight years of failures and atrocities squarely to the American voters.

These controversies have generally revolved around three areas of dispute: ? The division of the weeks ? The starting date of the Seventy Weeks ? The number of  anointed  individuals mentioned in the text and/or his/their identification. In agreement with the Masoretic accents and textual indicators (e.g. verse 26), Jewish commentators divide the time period into three periods: seven weeks, sixty-two weeks, and one week. The last week culminates with the destruction of the Temple, but with an addendum giving hope for the future. Christian renderings of Daniel generally follow the present-day King James Version s division into two periods of weeks (sixty-nine weeks consisting of seven weeks plus sixty-two weeks and one week). This is also the position maintained by most Christian commentators in explaining this passage. What is the overall purpose of the Seventy Weeks passage? Is this passage messianic? Who are the two anointed individuals mentioned in this passage? How does its description of things to come and eventual fulfillment centuries later give proof of the eventual fulfillment of all God s promises to Israel? What message does it hold for Jewish history past and future? Does it refer to Christian eschatological beliefs? Does this passage refer in any way to Jesus? To investigate these questions is the purpose of this volume.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KIfPAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Feminist Thought: A Comprehensive Introduction","description":"A classic resource on feminist theory, Feminist Thought offers a clear, comprehensive, and incisive introduction to the major traditions of feminist theory, from liberal feminism, radical feminism, and Marxist and socialist feminism to care-focused feminism, psychoanalytic feminism, and ecofeminism.

It serves two purposes for the researcher: it annotates the principal sources worldwide for Holocaust information and explains the rudimentary steps necessary for accessing that material. The author, a noted Jewish genealogist, followed his own advice during a 15-year search for members of his extended family. This publication, the result of that investigation, is written for the beginning researcher. The major difference between this work and other books on the Holocaust is that it focuses on individuals, not events. Much of the information will be useful also to students researching the Holocaust era and those looking for material with which to refute the claims of revisionists. The book notes the various types of documents that contain needed information and tells where they are and how to get them. Mokotoff gives readers advice on the best ways to request data from international sources, points out what types of documents might hold the most relevant information, and lists agencies that deal with survivors. The section on museums, libraries, and other institutions with Holocaust collections will be useful for all types of research. The illustrations of pages from documents are those that Mokotoff obtained for his own research. Appendixes include a current bibliography with books on generic genealogical searching, statistics about Jewish victims, lists of towns that published memorial books to commemorate victims, more than 4,000 European towns for which there is documentation at Yad Vashem in Israel, Holocaust resource centers, and a list of members of the Mokotoff family murdered during the Holocaust. The author's conversational writing style and easy-to-follow directions make this an appropriate handbook for the uninitiated. Public libraries might want to include it in genealogy collections, but it should be made accessible to all patrons interested in Holocaust information.--BL 11/01/1995.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RwNnAAAAMAAJ&dq=How+to+Document+Victims+and+Locate+Survivors+of+the+Holocaust:+Documenting+Victims,+Locating+Survivors+(Avotaynu+Monograph)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"KING SOLOMONS RING.","description":"Solomon, the legend goes, had a magic ring which enabled him to speak to the animals in their own language.

King Solomon's Ring, the book which brought him worldwide recognition, is a delightful treasury of observations and insights into the lives of all sorts of creatures, from jackdaws and water-shrews to dogs, cats and even wolves.

For a given invariant measure, and a class of observables, the correlation functions tell whether (and how fast) the system ?mixes?, i.e. ?forgets? its initial conditions.This book, addressed to mathematicians and mathematical (or mathematically inclined) physicists, shows how the powerful technology of transfer operators, imported from statistical physics, has been used recently to construct relevant invariant measures, and to study the speed of decay of their correlation functions, for many chaotic systems.

In a revelatory work praised as  excellent and timely  (New York Times Book Review, front page), Adam Winkler, author of Gunfight, once again makes sense of our fraught constitutional history in this incisive portrait of how American businesses seized political power, won  equal rights,  and transformed the Constitution to serve big business. Uncovering the deep roots of Citizens United, he repositions that controversial 2010 Supreme Court decision as the capstone of a centuries-old battle for corporate personhood.  Tackling a topic that ought to be at the heart of political debate  (Economist), Winkler surveys more than four hundred years of diverse cases and the contributions of such legendary legal figures as Daniel Webster, Roger Taney, Lewis Powell, and even Thurgood Marshall to reveal that  the history of corporate rights is replete with ironies  (Wall Street Journal).

Not to mention rumours which agitated the maritime population and excited the public mind, even in the interior of continents, seafaring men were particularly excited. Merchants, common sailors, captains of vessels, skippers, both of Europe and America, naval officers of all countries, and the Governments of several States on the two continents, were deeply interested in the matter. For some time past vessels had been met by \\"an enormous thing,\\" a long object, spindle-shaped, occasionally phosphorescent, and infinitely larger and more rapid in its movements than a whale. The facts relating to this apparition (entered in various log-books) agreed in most respects as to the shape of the object or creature in question, the untiring rapidity of its movements, its surprising power of locomotion, and the peculiar life with which it seemed endowed. If it was a whale, it surpassed in size all those hitherto classified in science. Taking into consideration the mean of observations made at divers times rejecting the timid estimate of those who assigned to this object a length of two hundred feet, equally with the exaggerated opinions which set it down as a mile in width and three in length we might fairly conclude that this mysterious being surpassed greatly all dimensions admitted by the learned ones of the day, if it existed at all. And that it DID exist was an undeniable fact; and, with that tendency which disposes the human mind in favour of the marvellous, we can understand the excitement produced in the entire world by this supernatural apparition. As to classing it in the list of fables, the idea was out of the question. On the 20th of July, 1866, the steamer Governor Higginson, of the Calcutta and Burnach Steam Navigation Company, had met this moving mass five miles off the east coast of Australia. Captain Baker thought at first that he was in the presence of an unknown sandbank; he even prepared to determine its exact position when two columns of water, projected by the mysterious object, shot with a hissing noise a hundred and fifty feet up into the air. Now, unless the sandbank had been submitted to the intermittent eruption of a geyser, the Governor Higginson had to do neither more nor less than with an aquatic mammal, unknown till then, which threw up from its blow-holes columns of water mixed with air and vapour. Similar facts were observed on the 23rd of July in the same year, in the Pacific Ocean, by the Columbus, of the West India and Pacific Steam Navigation Company. But this extraordinary creature could transport itself from one place to another with surprising velocity; as, in an interval of three days, the Governor Higginson and the Columbus had observed it at two different points of the chart, separated by a distance of more than seven hundred nautical leagues.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LGIiDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rescue Your Love Life, Workbook","description":"\\"Beginning with self-examination and setting realistic expectations, the authors explore how couples can nurture and master healthy communication, build trust, and enhance the romance in their marriage\\"--Provided by publisher.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CF2iWwIbrGUC&dq=Rescue+Your+Love+Life,+Workbook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hotspot Networks : WiFi for Public Access Locations (Professional Telecom)","description":"The first-to-market, detailed guide to hotspots--the \\"killer app for 802.11\\"--provides need to know information on these open-to-the-public wireless networks that are springing up in hotels, airports, cafes, and even parks.

By A.D. 1050 the population of its capital city, Cahokia, was larger than that of London. Without the use of the wheel, beasts of burden, or metallurgy, its technology was of the Stone Age, yet its culture fostered widespread commerce, refined artistic expression, and monumental architecture. The model for this urbane world was nothing less than the cosmos itself. The climax of their ritual center was a four-tiered pyramid covering fourteen acre rising a hundred feet into the sky the tallest structure in the United States until 1867. This beautifully illustrated book traces the history of this six-square-mile area in the central Mississippi Valley from the Big Bang to the present. Chappell seeks to answer fundamental questions about this unique, yet still relatively unknown space, which was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1982. How did this swampy land become so amenable to human life? Who were the remarkable people who lived here before the Europeans came? Why did the whole civilization disappear so rapidly? What became of the land in the centuries after the Mississippians abandoned it? And finally, what can we learn about ourselves as we look into the changing meaning of Cahokia through the ages? To explore these questions, Chappell probes a wide range of sources, including the work of astronomers, geographers, geologists, anthropologists, and archaeologists. Archival photographs and newspaper accounts, as well as interviews with those who work at the site and Native Americans on their annual pilgrimage to the site, bring the story up to the present. Tying together these many threads, Chappell weaves a rich tale of how different people conferred their values on the same piece of land and how the transformed landscape, in turn, inspired different values in them-cultural, spiritual, agricultural, economic, and humanistic.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0O8EhmmyayoC&dq=Cahokia:+Mirror+of+the+Cosmos&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Prelude or Growth of a Poet's Mind by William Wordsworth","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=taHUBC4cJBUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Beatles (People Who Made History)","description":"A collection of articles discuss the history and influence of the group, covering such topics as the Beatles' tour of Australia and New Zealand, the impact of their film \\"A Hard Day's Night,\\" and the rumor of Paul McCartney's death.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IZAZAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+Beatles+(People+Who+Made+History)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Children of Darkness","description":"The Children of Light and the Children of Darkness, first published in 1944, is considered one of the most profound and relevant works by the influential theologian Reinhold Niebuhr, and certainly the fullest statement of his political philosophy. Written and first read during the prolonged, tragic world war between totalitarian and democratic forces, Niebuhr s book took up the timely question of how democracy as a political system could best be defended. Most proponents of democracy, Niebuhr claimed, were  children of light,  who had optimistic but na?ve ideas about how society could be rid of evil and governed by enlightened reason. They needed, he believed, to absorb some of the wisdom and strength of the  children of darkness,  whose ruthless cynicism and corrupt, anti-democratic politics should otherwise be repudiated. He argued for a prudent, liberal understanding of human society that took the measure of every group s self-interest and was chastened by a realistic understanding of the limits of power. It is in the foreword to this book that he wrote,  Man s capacity for justice makes democracy possible; but man s inclination to injustice makes democracy necessary.  This edition includes a new introduction by the theologian and Niebuhr scholar Gary Dorrien in which he elucidates the work s significance and places it firmly into the arc of Niebuhr s career.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uU828XNGUuAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"George C.

The new politics repudiated lesbian feminist ideas and celebrated 'manhood' as a goal for gay men. Practices which construct this 'manhood', such as sadomasochism, cutting and piercing, female-to-male transsexual surgery, and which are promoted in queer politics, need to be understood as forms of self-harm which result from the oppression of lesbians and gay men. The political agenda of queer politics is damaging to the interests of lesbians, women in general, and to marginalized and vulnerable constituencies of gay men. The book concludes by arguing that precisely the commitment to equality in relationships and sex that has been so important to lesbian feminists, and so excoriated in much of queer theory, should form the basis of a social transformation. In this way lesbians should be seen as the vanguard of social change.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=48OwLpQkgB0C&dq=UNPACKING+QUEER+POLITICS&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Her Ideal Husband (Harlequin Romance, No 3652)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5mxYAAAAMAAJ&dq=Her+Ideal+Husband+(Harlequin+Romance,+No+3652)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Mother's Love","description":"When you are fast asleep, the angel in your family is hard at work to make your home a joyful and happy place.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lgVtzQEACAAJ&dq=A+Mother%27s+Love&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Paul,: A man who changed the world","description":"A biography of the German monk who led the Protestant Reformation in Europe from its beginning in 1517 until his death in 1546.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=N8YhOAAACAAJ&dq=Paul,:+A+man+who+changed+the+world&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Piano playing, with Piano questions answered","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=T5g7AQAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chopper Ops 3: Shuttle Down","description":"After the U.S. space shuttle captures a secret spy satellite, it makes a forced landing in China.

When James Bond lands in hospital as the result of a nasty facial burn - while lighting a bird s cigarette, his hair pomade explodes -- Jane Bond, his lesbian twin sister and occasional impersonator, once again dons suit and scars to masquerade as her infamous brother. Her destination: the annual spy convention in the glamorous Las Vegas of the Rat Pack era. Her assignment: to keep her brother s reputation intact through a carefully plotted program of gambling, boozing, and womanising. Along for the ride are British Secret Service Agent Cedric Pumpernickel, Jane s only ally in the male spy world, and glamorous girlfriend, and G.E.O.R.G.I.E. agent, Bridget St Claire, who finds herself the unwilling love interest of a scrawny lounge singer who, along with his pack of friends, begins a campaign to bed her.The relatively ordinary convention - featuring the latest in jet pack transportation and stylish decoder rings - becomes the scene for murder when someone tosses an Estonian secret agent off the observation deck of Hoover Dam. Days spent at the blackjack table - and nights in the arms of her beautiful girlfriend - come to an abrupt end as Jane uncovers a nefarious plot to eliminate all the best spies of the western world. Complicating the plot is a romance gone sour: an affair between Agent Pumpernickel and musical sensation Liberace has ended badly, and when Pumpernickel takes to his bed with a box of chocolates and a copy of Queen magazine, Jane must become England s top-action man and stop the killer before he stops her.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-BW4_cub0UUC&dq=The+Girl+with+the+Golden+Bouffant:+An+Original+Jane+Bond+Parody&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sappho: A New Translation","description":"Diane Rayor's graceful translations and Andr  Lardinois's thorough introduction and notes present the best combination of intelligibility, information, and poetry.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=spLfAwAAQBAJ&dq=Sappho:+A+New+Translation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Indonesian Accents: Architecture, Interior Design, Art","description":"Indonesia is one of the culturally richest regions of the world.

The extent to which water remains a scientific mystery is extraordinary, despite its prevalence and central importance on Earth. Whether one considers its role in biology, its place in the physical world (where it refuses to obey the usual rules of liquids) or its deceptively simple structure, there is still no complete answer to the question: what is water? Philip Ball's book explains what, exactly, we do and do not know about the strange character of this most essential and ubiquitous of substances. H20 begins by transporting its readers back to the Big Bang and the formation of galaxies to witness the birth of water's constituent elements: hydrogen and oxygen. It then explains how the primeval oceans were formed four billion years ago; where water is to be found on other planets; why ice floats when most solids sink; why, despite being highly corrosive, water is good for us; why there are at least fifteen kinds of ice and perhaps two kinds of liquid water; how scientists have consistently misunderstood water for centuries; and why wars have been waged over it. Philip Ball's gloriously offbeat and intelligent book conducts us on a journey through the history of science, folklore, the wilder scientific fringes, cutting-edge physics, biology and ecology, to give a fascinating new perspective on life and the substance that sustains it. After reading this book, drinking a glass of water will never be the same again.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pCaAAQAACAAJ&dq=H2o+a+Biography+of+Water&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Immensee (German Language)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dhhKAAAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Gentile Comes to Cache Valley","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=06AkywAACAAJ&dq=The+Gentile+Comes+to+Cache+Valley&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rural Growth in Western States: Economic Development and Environmental Protection","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HyFFAAAAYAAJ&dq=Rural+Growth+in+Western+States:+Economic+Development+and+Environmental+Protection&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Lone Ranger Volume 2","description":"\\"Rated T+, suggested for teens and up\\"--Vol. 1, cover.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XcfjLG94xswC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Men for the Mountains","description":"As a park warden in the national parks of Canada's Rocky Mountains, Sid Marty came to know that beautiful and treacherous landscape as few men or women do.

This is an updated version of the 1994 edition, to be released on November 2, 2013 - many updates since last printing. Amber has a PhD.,L.Ac., LMSW and has been a healer all her life. After graduating with special honors from the Universities of Chicago and Iowa, she went on to study at the Traditional Acupuncture Institute in Columbia/Laurel, Maryland. Just as her psychotherapy experience alerted her to the value of acupuncture, Amber's acupuncture experience led her to Bee Venom Therapy (BVT) or Bee-Acupuncture. Amber believes that the bee sting was the first acupuncture needle. She feels that modern day acupuncture is an attempt to recreate the bee sting: the needle being the stinger and the use of moxibustion being the heat or burning sensation from the venom. In this unique book, Amber shares her discovery of the healing miracles available with honeybees and all their products.This approach to healing is unlike anything you've ever seen before. It is a synthesis of her experience with psychotherapy, acupuncture, spirituality, and the remarkable healing power of honeybees. This book is the Bible of Bee-Acupuncture. It has already become a classic! In the last few years there have been several double blind studies with injectable venom examining the healing components of bee venom for MS, HIV/AIDS, and cancer. There are even studies using \\"nanobees,\\" tiny particles delivering cell-killing bee toxin to cancer cells, while leaving healthy cells intact. This is very exciting but not surprising to Dr. Rose. Amber, who uses live honeybees, has known for a long time that bee venom helps the body heal itself.The original version of \\"Bee In Balance\\" was written in 1994, less than a year after Amber began her healing journey with the bees. It has been out of print for many years. This brand new updated 4th edition to be released in November 2013 includes over 20 years of experiences and anecdotes, bee-acupuncture for humans and animals, as well her keynote speech in Vancouver, B.C., Canada on HIV/AIDS research that she conducted herself with live bee stings from 1994-97. If you know anyone who has an auto-immune disease, a chronic illness, or chronic pain, this book is a MUST READ!","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PEsbnwEACAAJ&dq=Bee+in+Balance:+A+Guide+to+Healing+the+Whole+Person+With+Honeybees,+Oriental+Medicine+and+Commonsense&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"90 Days To Japanese Language Book 1","description":"The second volume of the best selling Speak Japanese in 90 Days is here!

Lalleman then fleshes out by applying them to three difficult topics in Old Testament law - food laws, the cancellation of debts, and warfare. At the heart of this celebration of the law, she contends, is the wholeness, holiness, and integrity of God himself.

Sherman's efforts were undertaken as his former commander, Ulysses S. Grant, set out on a similar mission to destroy Robert E. Lee or drive him back to Richmond. These struggles were the millstones that Grant intended to use to grind the Confederacy's strength into dust. By fall, Sherman's success in Georgia had assured the re-election of Abraham Lincoln and determined that the federal government would never acquiesce in the independence of the Confederacy. Richard M. McMurry examines the Atlanta campaign as a political and military unity in the context of the greater struggle of the war itself. Richard M.

This terrible war overshadows Algeria's long and complex history and its prominence on the world economic stage second in size among African nations, Algeria has the longest Mediterranean coastline and contains the world's fifth-largest natural gas reserves. Algeria, 1830-2000 is a comprehensive narrative history of the country.

Mainly enslaved prisoners of war, they transformed the quality of life in the Roman Empire beyond recognition. In this anthology the author offers a complete collection of Greek and Latin sources in an English translation which deal with the great slave rebellions in the second and first centuries B.C. In a postscript Zvi Yavetz surveys the controversy on slaves and slavery from the French Revolution to our own days, with an emphasis on the debate between Marxists and non-Marxists. The book is intended for specialists and generalists alike, including those who have had no previous classical education, but could after delving in sources concern themselves with one of the most intriguing problems in world history. Zvi Yavetz holds the Lessing Chair of Roman History at Tel Aviv University, Israel, and is distinguished visiting professor at Queens College of the City University of New York. He is the author of many books in Hebrew, French and German on Roman history among which are Julius Caesar and His Public Image and Plebs and Princips.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=V3w3dqCYyT0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thinking with Type: A Critical Guide for Designers, Writers, Editors, & Students (Design Briefs).","description":"Our all-time best selling book is now available in a revised and expanded second edition.

Before he became a novelist, Michael Connelly was a crime reporter, covering the detectives who worked the homicide beat in Florida and Los Angeles. In vivid, hard-hitting articles, Connelly leads the reader past the yellow police tape as he follows the investigators, the victims, their families and friends--and, of course, the killers--to tell the real stories of murder and its aftermath. Connelly's firsthand observations would lend inspiration to his novels, from The Black Echo, which was drawn from a real-life bank heist, to Trunk Music, based on an unsolved case of a man found in the trunk of his Rolls Royce. And the vital details of his best-known characters, both heroes and villains, would be drawn from the cops and killers he reported on: from loner detective Harry Bosch to the manipulative serial killer the Poet. Stranger than fiction and every bit as gripping, these pieces show once again that Michael Connelly is not only a master of his craft, but also one of the great American writers in any form.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_c6WQA6LSCAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chasing Moore's Law: Information Technology Policy in the United States","description":"Information Technology has become a key factor in industry and society in the post-war world and continues to evolve, re-shaping the local and global economy and reorienting comparative and competitive advantages.

But God's Word makes it clear that not everything that glitters is gold. False teaching is at every turn, and the temptation to embrace it is great. As God's people we are called to sift through the overwhelming number of traditions and trends and use the truth of Scripture to determine which are the true treasures-and which are \\"fool's gold.\\" General editor John MacArthur and the contributors of this uncompromising book define the principles of biblical discernment and use them to address several contemporary Christian issues. They provide straightforward, biblical critiques of some popular but unfortunate Christian trends, such as watered-down preaching and doctrinally questionable best-selling books. Dr. MacArthur ends with a practical plan for cultivating discernment in the Christian life. It is the duty of every Christian-not just pastors and elders-to follow the biblical command to cling to what is good and to reject what is not. This book will equip you with a foundation for biblical discernment that will enable you to make careful distinctions in your thinking about truth.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Zzl1Wyz1nEcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pulsation of Love","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uJ8kygEACAAJ&dq=Pulsation+of+Love&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Almost a Woman","description":"Following the enchanting story recounted in When I Was Puerto Rican of the author s emergence from the barrios of Brooklyn to the prestigious Performing Arts High School in Manhattan, Esmeralda Santiago delivers the tale of her young adulthood, where she continually strives to find a balance between becoming American and staying Puerto Rican.

Sullivan (Irish in the Civil War)","description":"No soldier went off to the Civil War with quicker step than 17-year-old James Patrick Sullivan. A hired man on a farm in Juneau County, Wisconsin, he was among the first to anwer Lincoln's call for volunteers in 1861. Sullivan fought in a score of major battles, was wounded five times, and was the only soldier of his regiment to enlist on three separate occasions. An Irishman in the Iron Brigade is a collection of Sullivan's writings about his hard days in President Lincoln's Army. Using war diaries and letters, the Irish immigrant composed nearly a dozen revealing accounts about the battles of his brigage-Brawner Farm, Second Bull Run, South Mountain, Chancellorsville and Gettysburg as well as the fighting of 1864. Using his old camp name, \\"Mickey of Company K,\\" Sullivan wrote not so much for family or for history, but to entertain his comrades of the old Iron Brigade. His stories-overlooked and forgotten for more than a century- are delightful accounts of rough-hewn \\"Western\\" soldiers in the Eastern Army of the Potomac. His Gettysburg account, for example, is one of the best recollections of that epic battle by a soldier in the ranks. He also left a from-the-ranks view of some of the Union's major soldiers such as George McClellan, Irvin McDowell, John Pope, and Ambrose Burnside. An Irishman in the Iron Brigade is in part the story of the great veterans' movement which shaped the nation's politics before the turn-of-the-century. Troubled by economic hardship, advancing age, and old war injuries, Sullivan turned to old comrades, his memories, and writing, to put the great experiences of his life in perspective.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5hOnswEACAAJ&dq=An+Irishman+in+the+Iron+Brigade:+The+Civil+War+Memoirs+of+James+P.+Sullivan+(Irish+in+the+Civil+War)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Introduction to Criminal Justice","description":"This student-friendly introductory text describes the criminal justice process outlining the decisions, practices, people, and issues involved.

This book is also for anyone broadly interested in Japan, for it is impossible to fully understand Japan without learning what basic economics has to say about it, which is much. To know Japan - or any country for that matter - is more than an ability to recite a litany of facts about its history, geography, institutions, and culture. Disciplined thinking is needed to organize the disparate facts into a coherent system that can be grasped whole. Modern economics is the academic discipline underlying this book. The book uses economics and explains it, but without presuming the reader has any prior knowledge of it. The main object of interest is Japan. It starts with Japan's economic history since the late sixteenth century through the twentieth century. It then addresses contemporary topics in Japan's economy, beginning with ones that require an economy - wide perspective - economic growth and the business cycle, exchange rates, and the balance of trade. The discussion then moves on to sectors of the economy: the public sector, industry and trade, the financial system, the labor market, and more. The chapters can be read in any order, but four threads run through all the chapters and link them: Japan's economic growth and development, Japan's integration with the world economy, government policies and their effects, and peculiar economic institutions and practices.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-GtvEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Forex for Small Speculators","description":"Explains Foreign Currency Exchange.

Financial institutions have had to develop efficient and sophisticated tools for controlling the granting and monitoring of such credit. These tools are based on statistical and operational research techniques, and represent some of the most successful applications of statistical theory. Still, the area has yet to be recognized in modern statistical textbooks. This work brings together academics and practitioners to consider developments in the subject. The papers discuss how new statistical techniques can be applied in credit scoring, as well as expanding the areas where such scoring techniques are proving useful. The problems in implementing scoring systems and how they were overcome are discussed, as well as the changes in the objectives of such systems. Practitioners and researchers in statistics, operations research, and financial and business theory will find the book a valuable source of current information.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=che_AAAAIAAJ&dq=Credit+Scoring+and+Credit+Control+(Institute+of+Mathematics+and+Its+Applications+Conference+Series+New+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Man for Me","description":" A book about the complexities of combat that's just as applicable for dealing with the complexities of business and our personal lives.

Reminding us of the classic warnings against militarism from George Washington's farewell address to Dwight Eisenhower's denunciation of the military-industrial complex Johnson uncovers its roots deep in our past. Turning to the present, he maps America's expanding empire of military bases and the vast web of services that supports them. He offers a vivid look at the new caste of professional warriors who have infiltrated multiple branches of government, who classify as \\"secret\\" everything they do, and for whom the manipulation of the military budget is of vital interest. Among Johnson's provocative conclusions is that American militarism is putting an end to the age of globalization and bankrupting the United States, even as it creates the conditions for a new century of virulent blowback. The Sorrows of Empire suggests that the former American republic has already crossed its Rubicon with the Pentagon leading the way.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MrV7dCG5S0YC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Knights Templars and the Complete History of Masonic Knighthood from the Origin of the Orders to the Present Time","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JwFKAQAACAAJ&dq=Knights+Templars+and+the+Complete+History+of+Masonic+Knighthood+from+the+Origin+of+the+Orders+to+the+Present+Time&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"All in One Piece","description":"Synopsis coming soon.......","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_EQgMQAACAAJ&dq=All+in+One+Piece&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Writer's Resources: From Paragraph to Essay","description":"The Instructor's Annotated Edition contains marginal notes on teaching suggestions, activity expansions, and answers to exercises in the text.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wCzKvNTgvM4C&dq=Writer%27s+Resources:+From+Paragraph+to+Essay&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Feathers, Flaps, and Flops: Fabulous Early Fliers","description":"An introduction to the history of aeronautics includes the inventors of the hot-air balloon, the first flight across America, and the first to cross the Atlantic from east to west.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=J0KnsVV3gksC&dq=Feathers,+Flaps,+and+Flops:+Fabulous+Early+Fliers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Momentary Lapse","description":" Who would have believed that a simple, working man in a small village in Scotland would have been disabled or even murdered by the outrageous corruption, lies and demonic activity of American politicians and biotech industries?

The French impressionists opened the door to creative freedoms never before experienced, and a community rich in artistic and intellectual talent coalesced to forever change the direction of art. This book documents more than 150 artists who worked, studied, and exhibited in Paris between 1890 and 1950. Many of them have been completely overlooked by scholars and art historians. Their work encompasses the La Belle Epoque, Postimpressionist, Cubist, and School of Paris movements. More than 375 color images of their paintings document this fabulous cultural explosion, and also present a visual time capsule, showing the populace at work and at play in bars, cabarets, and jazz clubs, even scenes of the artists' own studios. This book has been a labor of love; many years in the making. Collectors, curators, and historians will find it an invaluable tool for understanding the art of this period.

He also locates  Roadrunner  at the intersection of car culture, industrialization, consumption, mobility, and politics.

Doriel, a European expatriate living in New York, suffers from a profound sense of desperation and loss. His mother, a member of the Resistance, survived World War II only to die in an accident, together with his father, soon after. Doriel was a child during the war, and his knowledge of the Holocaust is largely limited to what he finds in movies, newsreels, and books but it is enough. Doriel s parents and their secrets haunt him, leaving him filled with longing but unable to experience the most basic joys in life. He plunges into an intense study of Judaism, but instead of finding solace, he comes to believe that he is possessed by a dybbuk. Surrounded by ghosts, spurred on by demons, Doriel finally turns to Dr. Th r se Goldschmidt, a psychoanalyst who finds herself particularly intrigued by her patient. The two enter into an uneasy relationship based on exchange: of dreams, histories, and secrets. Despite Doriel s initial resistance, Dr. Goldschmidt helps to bring him to a crossroads and to a shocking denouement. In Doriel s journey into the darkest regions of the soul, Elie Wiesel has written one of his most profoundly moving works of fiction, grounded always by his unparalleled moral compass.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4W_nDjEnJmAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The image of the invisible God: Essays on the influence of Jewish mysticism on early Christology (Novum testamentum et orbis antiquus)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FVARAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+image+of+the+invisible+God:+Essays+on+the+influence+of+Jewish+mysticism+on+early+Christology+(Novum+testamentum+et+orbis+antiquus)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Residential Architecture: Continuing Dialogue","description":"Architecture for Residential Care and Ageing Communities confronts urgent architectural design challenges within residential innovation, ageing communities and healthcare environments.

Writing in the sweeping tradition of Patrick O'Brian and C. S. Forester, acclaimed author Julian Stockwin continues the saga of Seaman Thomas Paine Kydd as he moves up the ranks of the Napoleonic-era British navy. The year is 1794. Kydd and the other shipwrecked sailors have returned to England for the court-martial of the sole surviving officer of Her Majesty's frigate Artemis. Kydd was on duty the thirteenth of April as quartermaster of the starboard watch. He knows what happened that dreadful night. His evidence can destroy an officer's career. Kydd is devastated by the loss of his ship, and he's shocked when he's not allowed to tell the court his story. Instead, Kydd and his good friend Nicholas Renzi are forcibly shipped off to the Caribbean. After many lonely months at sea, they don't even have a chance to go ashore to see family and friends. New adventures await, however, as both Kydd, a man of humble origins gradually rising through the ranks, and Renzi, whose exalted family heritage remains a tantalizing mystery, discover the pleasures and hazards of a lush new land. The journey will take Kydd from a dockyard in Antigua to a life-and-death struggle on the high seas aboard the plucky naval cutter Seaflower. While war between England and Revolution-torn France escalates, Kydd's mettle under fire -- as a sailor and a man -- receives the ultimate test. Set at the dawn of a new century, Seaflower gives us the primal forces of nature at sea where they are at their most untamed and exhilarating.

Early Pauline writings contain such expressions of faith as: We believe that Jesus died and rose (1 Th 4:14). If Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain and your faith is in vain (1 Cor 15:14). If you confess with your lips that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved (Rom 10:9). In short, without the message of the resurrection there would be no gospel, no belief, no church and no worship. Present-day controversy surrounds the resurrection and the authentic Christian understanding of the affirmation that Jesus has been raised from the dead. The thorny problem of the empty tomb of Jesus is closely connected with the discussion of the resurrection and bears upon one's understanding of Jesus' being raised from the dead. Hans Grass outlines the situation well when he writes: The question of the empty tomb belongs to the most difficult and debated problems of investigation and theology about the Eastern events. It is a key problem with which is closely bound the understanding of the corporality of the risen one, the nature of the appearances and thus the ophthe, indeed finally the whole eastern event.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RUsOAQAAIAAJ&dq=First+Easter+Morning:+The+Gospel+Accounts+of+the+Women%27s+Visit+to+the+Tomb+of+Jesus&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An Ascension Handbook: Material Channeled from Serapis","description":"Filled with exercises and techniques, \\"An Ascension Handbook\\" is a practical \\"how to\\" manual for ascending Lightworkers.

Remembering that only a few years ago men, women, and even children, were imprisoned, tortured and burned, for having expressed in an exceedingly mild and gentle way, the ideas entertained by me, I congratulate myself that calumny is now the pulpit's last resort. The old instruments of torture are kept only to gratify curiosity; the chains are rusting away, and the demolition of time has allowed even the dungeons of the Inquisition to be visited by light. The church, impotent and malicious, regrets, not the abuse, but the loss of her power, and seeks to hold by falsehood what she gained by cruelty and force, by fire and fear. Christianity cannot live in peace with any other form of faith. If that religion be true, there is but one savior, one inspired book, and but one little narrow grass-grown path that leads to heaven. Such a religion is necessarily uncompromising, unreasoning, aggressive and insolent. Christianity has held all other creeds and forms in infinite contempt, divided the world into enemies and friends, and verified the awful declaration of its founder -- a declaration that wet with blood the sword he came to bring, and made the horizon of a thousand years lurid with the fagots' flames.....Robert Green Ingersoll","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=A2XMc331CXMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Shy Tulip Murders","description":"While fixing up a cabin in California's San Joaquin Valley, Claire Sharples is drawn into the work of a group of environmental activists and their battle against local loggers and the U.S. Forest Service, a struggle that turns deadly when Claire stumblesu","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uQd6HAAACAAJ&dq=The+Shy+Tulip+Murders&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The plain people of the Confederacy","description":"In this comprehensive history, R. Douglas Hurt traces the decline and fall of agriculture in the Confederate States of America. The backbone of the southern economy, agriculture was a source of power that southerners believed would ensure their independence. But, season by season and year by year, Hurt convincingly shows how the disintegration of southern agriculture led to the decline of the Confederacy's military, economic, and political power. He examines regional variations in the Eastern and Western Confederacy, linking the fates of individual crops and different modes of farming and planting to the wider story. After a dismal harvest in late 1864, southerners--faced with hunger and privation throughout the region--ransacked farms in the Shenandoah Valley and pillaged plantations in the Carolinas and the Mississippi Delta, they finally realized that their agricultural power, and their government itself, had failed. Hurt shows how this ultimate lost harvest had repercussions that lasted well beyond the end of the Civil War. Assessing agriculture in its economic, political, social, and environmental contexts, Hurt sheds new light on the fate of the Confederacy from the optimism of secession to the reality of collapse.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UXNpBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Germanicus Mosaic","description":"Book one in Rosemary Rowe's Libertus series: 'A cracking tale with a fast-moving plot' CONN IGGULDEN.

Its purpose is to guide the reader in exploring contemporary approximation theory. The emphasis is on multi-variable approximation theory, i.e., the approximation of functions in several variables, as opposed to the classical theory of functions in one variable. Most of the topics in the book, heretofore accessible only through research papers, are treated here from the basics to the currently active research, often motivated by practical problems arising in diverse applications such as science, engineering, geophysics, and business and economics. Among these topics are projections, interpolation paradigms, positive definite functions, interpolation theorems of Schoenberg and Micchelli, tomography, artificial neural networks, wavelets, thin-plate splines, box splines, ridge functions, and convolutions. An important and valuable feature of the book is the bibliography of almost 600 items directing the reader to important books and research papers.

Will our love last? Men and women in love are haunted by these questions. Love -- especially why it blossoms in relationships and why it later dies -- is a mystery to them. Will Our Love Last? A Couple's Road Map solves this mystery by giving readers a new understanding of love -- an understanding they can actually use to evaluate the soundness of their relationships and to answer confidently the crucial questions that mystified them before. Based on hundreds of cases in his twenty-four years as a marital therapist and twenty-nine years in his own happy marriage, Sam R. Hamburg, Ph.D., explains how compatibility is the key to lasting love. He shows how compatibility on three major dimensions -- the Practical Dimension, the Sexual Dimension, and the Wavelength Dimension -- is essential to the mutual understanding and affirmation that keep love alive, and he leads readers through a simple but systematic procedure for assessing their compatibility with a romantic partner in these crucial relationship areas. Dr. Hamburg introduces a new technique, The Hand Rotation Exercise, to help readers express their degree of compatibility and then convey that visually to their partner. In addition, he presents two new original techniques for working through relationship conflicts and coming to agreement on difficult issues: His Way/Her Way and The Long Conversation. Written in a clear, direct style that is free of jargon, Will Our Love Last? empowers readers to make important relationship decisions that are intellectually and emotionally informed. Will Our Love Last? will help couples trying to decide if they should take the next step to a more committed relationship. It will aid individuals embarking on a new relationship, or who are between relationships, to evaluate the rightness of a new or prospective partner. And it will assist people who are already in committed relationships to make an honest assessment of their prospects for happiness with their current partner. People have it in their power to make sure that they truly are with the right person. Will Our Love Last? shows the way.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YU_f5TY7fwoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I Dare You!","description":"In 2012, I Dare you! was included in the \\"10 Best Self-Help Books of All-Time\\" list by the Christian Science Monitor.

Twenty-six-year-old Lienhard Bergel's contract was terminated, allegedly because of lack of funding, but in fact Bergel's politics clashed with department chair Friedrich J. Hauptmann's pro-Nazi views. Bergel's departure from Rutgers occurred amid a flurry of controversy that polarized students and administrators alike. Alan Silver, who had been a student activist in 1935, republicized the Bergel incident in 1985, prompting this volume. The authors, all Rutgers history faculty, here offer a chronicle of the school as well as re-create the political climate of those earlier times. However, a larger story never emerges from their assembled details. Vital matters, such as freedom of speech, the politics of academia and the activities of student peace groups, are obscured by a long roster of names and dates. Bergel's involvement with the FBI (he gave the agency information on Hauptmann's Nazi activities) is considered only in passing. Hauptmann's collaboration with the Nazis, a fascinating story, and his eventual repatriation during the war to Germany, is told too briefly. Though perhaps a document useful to Rutgers academics, the book is unlikely to command widespread attention.

Mary Ward Brown is a storyteller in the tradition of such powerful 20th-century writers as William Faulkner, Harper Lee, Flannery O'Connor, and Eudora Welty-writers who have explored and dramatized the tension between the inherited social structure of the South and its contemporary dissolution. With Tongues of Flame, her first collection of short stories, Brown bares the awkward, sometimes hopeful, and often tragic suffering of people caught in changing times within a timeless setting. Here we meet such memorable characters as a dying black woman who seeks the advice of a now-alcoholic white doctor whom she knew in better years; a young woman, jilted at the altar, driven crazy by an illuminated cross erected by the church opposite her house; and a 95-year-old woman buying a tombstone for her long-deceased husband only to discover that he had been adulterous throughout their marriage. Brown constructs her characters in a disarmingly plain style while breathing life into them with compassion and honesty as they confront the large moments of their lives. First published by E. P. Dutton in 1986 to immediate critical acclaim, Tongues of Flame won the 1987 PEN/Ernest Hemingway Foundation Award. The judges commended Brown for \\"seeing life whole, without prejudice, without sentimentality, without histrionics. Her voice may be quiet-sometimes she speaks in a whisper-but her words are, nevertheless, always forceful, clear, and ultimately lasting.\\" With this new publication of Tongues of Flame and its inclusion in the University of Alabama Press's Deep South Books series, a whole new generation of readers may once more discover Mary Ward Brown's profound stories of pain, loss, and hope.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IUKPNKiVHEEC&dq=Tongues+of+Flame+(Deep+South+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Prophets of the Dark Side (Star Wars: Jedi Prince, Book 6)","description":"Having tempted the young Jedi Prince Ken into revealing the location of the Lost City of the Jedi, the Supreme Imperial Prophet Kadann plans to steal ancient knowledge and rule over a new tyrannical empire.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=c98MAAAACAAJ&dq=Prophets+of+the+Dark+Side+(Star+Wars:+Jedi+Prince,+Book+6)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Say Goodnight, Grace Notes: New and Corrected Poems","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4BbpAAAACAAJ&dq=Say+Goodnight,+Grace+Notes:+New+and+Corrected+Poems&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chronicles of the Canongate (Waverley Novels)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1fzsAQAACAAJ&dq=Chronicles+of+the+Canongate+(Waverley+Novels)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Latecomers","description":"A novel about the 50-year friendship of two dissimilar German refugees brought over to England as children from Nazi Germany.

Here Habermas picks up some of the central themes of Between Facts and Norms and elaborates them in relation to current political debates. One of the distinctive features of Habermas's work has been its approach to the problem of political legitimacy through a sustained reflection on the dual legitimating and regulating function of modern legal systems. Extending his discourse theory of normative validity to the legal-political domain, Habermas has defended a proceduralist conception of deliberative democracy in which the burden of legitimating state power is borne by informal and legally institutionalized processes of political deliberation. Its guiding intuition is the radical democratic idea that there is an internal relation between the rule of law and popular sovereignty. In these essays he brings this discursive and proceduralist analysis of political legitimacy to bear on such urgent contemporary issues as the enduring legacy of the welfare state, the future of the nation state, and the prospects of a global politics of human rights. This book will be essential reading for students and academics in sociology and social theory, politics and political theory, philosophy and the social sciences generally.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-qoJQQAACAAJ&dq=The+Inclusion+of+the+Other:+Studies+in+Political+Theory+(Studies+in+Contemporary+German+Social+Thought)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Critical Look At Performance Management Systems - Why Don't They Work?","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nHqKtXdVPiIC&dq=A+Critical+Look+At+Performance+Management+Systems+-+Why+Don%27t+They+Work%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"DK Classics: Aladdin","description":"Enter Aladdin's fantastical world, full of enchantment and adventures - and discover the secret of his wonderful lamp!","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=spqBPwAACAAJ&dq=DK+Classics:+Aladdin&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The old Reformation and the new (The Cato lecture)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4-w8swEACAAJ&dq=The+old+Reformation+and+the+new+(The+Cato+lecture)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Come to Dust (Keith Moody Mystery)","description":"Offers biographical sketches of 320 writers' lives and works, including novelists, playwrights, poets, historians, biographers, critics, and philosophers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cWoYAAAAIAAJ&dq=Come+to+Dust+(Keith+Moody+Mystery)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stories from the Bible","description":"Features the stories of notable women from the Bible, including Eve, Rebekah, Naomi, Ruth, and Esther, and includes discussion questions related to each woman's plight.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fW95Sr7mmUAC&dq=Stories+from+the+Bible&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tarawa;: The story of a battle","description":"In the summer of 1943, at the height of World War II, battles were exploding all throughout the Pacific theater. In mid-November of that year, the United States waged a bloody campaign on Betio Island in the Tarawa Atoll, the most heavily fortified Japanese territory in the entire Pacific. They were fighting to wrest control of the island to stage the next big push toward Japan and one journalist was there to chronicle the horror.

Follow the story of the U.S. Army 27th Infantry Division as nearly 35,000 troops take on less than 5,000 Japanese defenders in one of the most savage engagements of the war.

This story, a must for any history buff, tells the ins and outs of life alongside the U.S. Marines in this lesser-known battle of World War II.

After James's friend falls into a canal and drowns, James becomes increasingly withdrawn. As bags of rubbish pile up and rats move in, James finds solace in his friendships with Kenny, an odd boy who loves animals, and Margaret Anne, a teenage misfit. Annette Kuhn's study of the film, the first to offer an overarching account of Ramsay's work, considers the director's background and Ratcatcher alongside her earlier films. Kuhn traces the film's production history in the context of Scottish media and literary cultures, and its cinematic influences, while acknowledging the distinctiveness of Ramsay's poetic, visionary style. Kuhn draws on interviews with Ramsay and others involved in the film's production, and combines this with a close reading of selected passages to provide an in-depth and illuminating analysis of the film's poetic style and its aesthetics, including an examination of its construction of a child's world through a highly distinctive organisation of cinematic space.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=G7jdDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Contemporary Urban Sociology (Contemporary Sociology)","description":"This volume demonstrates a fresh approach to urban studies as well as a new way of looking at contemporary Japan which links economy and society in an innovative way.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tt2leztLm5EC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Praying the Psalms with St. Padre Pio","description":"The Psalms? poetry St. Pio's perspective Your personal transformation It's a book like no other.

It covers both the broad beam transmission mode (TEM; transmission electron microscopy) and the scanning transmission mode (STEM; scanning transmission electron microscopy). The book is structured in three parts. The first part introduces the basics of conventional atomic-resolution electron microscopy imaging in TEM and STEM modes. This part also describes limits of conventional electron microscopes and possible artefacts which are caused by the intrinsic lens aberrations that are unavoidable in such instruments. The second part introduces fundamental electron optical concepts and thus provides a brief introduction to electron optics. Based on the first and second parts of the book, the third part focuses on aberration correction; it describes the various aberrations in electron microscopy and introduces the concepts of spherical aberration correctors and advanced aberration correctors, including correctors for chromatic aberration. This part also provides guidelines on how to optimize the imaging conditions for atomic-resolution STEM and TEM imaging.

For the most knowledge-intensive entities of all, research universities, profound IT-related challenges and opportunities will emerge in the next decade or so. Yet, there is a sense that some of the most significant issues are not well understood by academic administrators, faculty, and those who support or depend on the institutiona?s activities. This study identifies those information technologies likely to evolve in the near term (a decade or less) that could ultimately have a major impact on the research university. It also examines the possible implications of these technologies for the research universitya\\"its activities (learning, research, outreach) and its organization, management, and financinga\\"and for the broader higher education enterprise. The authoring committee urges research universities and their constituents to develop new strategies to ensure that they survive and thrive in the digital age.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bBSdAgAAQBAJ&dq=Introduction+to+Technology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Contacts: Langue et culture franaises 8th edition","description":"Following the organization of the main text, this essential resource provides additional out-of-class practice, with four parts to each unit.

The Father certainly doesn't need our praise, yet He prescribes worship as a daily activity. Why? Because, as pastor Jack Hayford clearly shows us, God graces His people with worship as a gift, not a demand. Worship liberates all of God's people to discover genuine wholeness, but only as they recognize and acknowledge the holiness of God. Hayford examines the lives of more than a dozen biblical figures to illuminate the fulfilling effects of worship -- including seven truths Jesus revealed about the blessings of praise. God's grace fills everything He gives -- and everything He calls us to do.

And yet so appealing is her character, and so witty and seductive her narrative voice, that we will follow her hypnotically as she unloads the intellectual baggage of a lifetime in a series of irreverent meditations on everything and everybody from Brahms to sex to Heidegger to Helen of Troy. And as she contemplates aspects of the troubled past which have brought her to her present state--obviously a metaphor for ultimate loneliness--so too will her drama become one of the few certifiably original fictions of our time. \\"The novel I liked best this year,\\" said the Washington Times upon the book's publication; \\"one dizzying, delightful, funny passage after another . . .

It follows a set of six friends from childhood to middle age as they experience the world around them and explore who they are and what itmeans to be alive. As the contours of their lives are revealed, a unique novel is slowly unveiled. Enfolded within Woolf's lyrical and mysterious language, the mundane takes on a startling new significance while distant pasts are no less in play than the clamorous sounds and kaleidoscopic sights ofthe modern city. Yet precisely where the alluringly enigmatic pages of The Waves are leading, and what deeper meanings are held within its undulant chapters and shimmering interludes, are questions that have never ceased to enthral readers and critics alike.In this new edition David Bradshaw considers the spellbinding oddness and originality of The Waves, helping the reader to negotiate a way though this most poetic and haunting of novels.ABOUT THE SERIES: For over 100 years Oxford World's Classics has made available the widest range of literature from around the globe.

In this study, James C. Dobbins, a leading scholar of Pure Land Buddhism, has made creative use of these letters to shed new light on life and religion in medieval Japan. He provides a complete translation of the letters and an explication of them that reveals the character and flavor of early Shin Buddhism. Readers will come away with a new perspective on Pure Land scholarship and a vivid image of Eshinni and the world in which she lived. After situating the ideas and practices of Pure Land Buddhism in the context of the actual living conditions of thirteenth-century Japan, Dobbins examines the portrayal of women in Pure Land Buddhism, the great range of lifestyles found among medieval women and nuns, and how they constructed a meaningful religious life amid negative stereotypes. He goes on to analyze aspects of medieval religion that have been omitted in our modern-day account of Pure Land and tries to reconstruct the religious assumptions of Eshinni and Shinran in their own day. A prevailing theme that runs throughout the book is the need to look beyond idealized images of Buddhism found in doctrine to discover the religion as it was lived and practiced. Scholars and students of Buddhism, Japanese history, women s studies, and religious studies will find much in this engaging work that is thought-provoking and insightful.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wU1D8yGg7xgC&dq=Letters+of+the+Nun+Eshinni:+Images+of+Pure+Land+Buddhism+in+Medieval+Japan&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Healing Ground: A Visionary Union of Earth and Spirit","description":"After escaping the Los Angeles corporate world in 1993, Trish Tuley picked up a camera and walked thousands of miles, capturing her communions with the American wilderness on film.

It thus covers a broad range of rather recent models for economic time series, such as non linear models, autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic regressions, and cointegrated vector autoregressive models.

Although the first recorded Egyptian Pharaoh Narmer, unifer of Upper and Lower Egypt, is know only from the Narmer Palette, now ensconced at the Egyptian Museum, King Narmer emerges fully fleshed in this novel. Told by Heb, Pharoah's servant, the many facets of Ancient Egypt come to life in narrative you'll eagerly devour to the last line! Heb's story is at once an adventure story set alongside the mighty river's bank and a love story of passion, loss, and spiritual regeneration. Avoiding the devices of sensationalistic Egyptian novels which seem more modern than ancient, more Hollywood than authentic, ALONG THE NILE breathes with accuracy of a time period never before explored in any other novel. Researched with faithful precision, ALONG THE NILE is a must-read for anyone who has ever been fascinated by ancient Egypt. The author's three prolonged stays in Egypt resulted in a life-changing, transformative experience, leading to further extensive investigation, knowledge, and a personal relationship with the goddesses Hathor and Sekhmet. The narrative reflects her intimate exploration of Egypt's archaeological sites, especially the religious center at Dendera, and her study of and participation in Egyptian religious rites and traditions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=X8rOwAEACAAJ&dq=Voices+from+Appalachia&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans ..

He went to school in Dulwich, and then in 1801 to Harrow. In 1805 he went up to Trinity College, Cambridge, later gaining a reputation in London for his startling good looks and extravagant behaviour. His first collection of poems, Hours of Idleness (1807), was not well received, but with the publication of the first two cantos of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage (1812) he became famous overnight and increased this fame with a series of wildly popular 'Eastern Tales'. In 1815 he married the heiress Annabella Milbanke, but they were separated after a year. Byron shocked society by the rumoured relationship with his half-sister, Augusta, and in 1816 he left England for ever. He eventually settled in Italy, where he lived for some time with Teresa, Contessa Guiccioli. He supported Italian revolutionary movements and in 1823 he left for Greece to fight in its struggle for independence, but he contracted a fever and died at Missolonghi in 1824.\\" \\"Byron's contemporary popularity was based first on Childe Harold and the 'Tales', and then on Don Juan (1819-24), his most sophisticated and accomplished writing. He was one of the strongest exemplars of the Romantic movement, and the Byronic hero was a prototype widely imitated in European and American literature.\\"--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

When Prohibition took effect in 1919, three months after one of the greatest California grape harvests of all time, violence and chaos descended on Northern California. Federal agents spilled thousands of gallons of wine in the rivers and creeks, gun battles erupted on dark country roads, and local law enforcement officers, sympathetic to their winemaking neighbors, found ways to run circles around the intruding authorities. For the state's winemaking families--many of them immigrants from Italy--surviving Prohibition meant facing impossible decisions, whether to give up the idyllic way of life their families had known for generations, or break the law to enable their wine businesses and their livelihood to survive. Including moments of both desperation and joy, Sosnowski tells the inspiring story of how ordinary people fought to protect to a beautiful and timeless culture in the lovely hills and valleys of now-celebrated wine country.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vqFxq6nv4rEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Complete Australian Cattle Dog","description":"hardcover, 160 to 208 pages, 7.25 x 9.6 inches, 80 to 150 photos","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tRYBAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Complete+Australian+Cattle+Dog&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Pigs' Wedding (A Margaret K.

In Dvor k to Duke Ellington, Peress begins by recounting the music's formative years: Dvor k's three year residency as Director of the National Conservatory of Music in New York (1892-1895), and his students, in particular Will Marion Cook and Rubin Goldmark, who would in turn become the teachers of Ellington, Gershwin, and Copland. We follow Dvor k to the famed Chicago World's Fair of 1893, where he directed a concert of his music for Bohemian Honor Day. Peress brings to light the little known African American presence at the Fair: the piano professors, about-to-be-ragtimers; and the gifted young artists Paul Dunbar, Harry T. Burleigh, and Cook, who gathered at the Haitian Pavilion with its director, Frederick Douglass, to organize their own gala concert for Colored Persons Day. Peress, a distinguished conductor, is himself a part of this story; working with Duke Ellington on the Suite from Black, Brown and Beige and his \\"opera comique,\\" Queenie Pie; conducting the world premiere of Leonard Bernstein's Mass; and reconstructing landmark American concerts at which George Antheil's Ballet Mecanique, George Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue, James Reese Europe's Clef Club (the first all-black concert at Carnegie Hall), and Ellington's Black, Brown and Beige, were first presented. Concluding with an astounding look at Ellington and his music, Dvor k to Duke Ellington offers an engrossing, elegant portrait of the Dvor k legacy, America's music, and the inestimable African-American influence upon it.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yYI1mfvuH2sC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Little Miss Magic (Mr. Men and Little Miss)","description":"Mr. Happy asks little Miss Magic to help stop Mr. Tickle from tickling everyone so often.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2xhgEAAAQBAJ&dq=Little+Miss+Magic+(Mr.+Men+and+Little+Miss)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Al-Qa'ida: Unholy Dogs of War","description":"We all know bin Laden.

An unflinchingly honest memoir of her experience as a M tis woman in Canada, Maria Campbell's Halfbreed depicts the realities that she endured and, above all, overcame. Maria was born in Northern Saskatchewan, her father the grandson of a Scottish businessman and M tis woman--a niece of Gabriel Dumont whose family fought alongside Riel and Dumont in the 1885 Rebellion; her mother the daughter of a Cree woman and French-American man. This extraordinary account, originally published in 1973, bravely explores the poverty, oppression, alcoholism, addiction, and tragedy Maria endured throughout her childhood and into her early adult life, underscored by living in the margins of a country pervaded by hatred, discrimination, and mistrust. Laced with spare moments of love and joy, this is a memoir of family ties and finding an identity in a heritage that is neither wholly Indigenous or Anglo; of strength and resilience; of indominatable spirit. This edition of Halfbreed includes a new introduction written by Indigenous (M tis) scholar Dr. Kim Anderson detailing the extraordinary work that Maria has been doing since its original publication 46 years ago, and an afterword by the author looking at what has changed, and also what has not, for Indigenous people in Canada today. Restored are the recently discovered missing pages from the original text of this groundbreaking and significant work.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vTGLDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tyrant of the Badlands (The Accidental Detectives Series #4)","description":"Summary: Twelve-year-old Ricky goes undercover in Alberta, Canada, to infiltrate the gang of thugs that are thought to be vandalizing his great-aunt's mobile home park.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jx91j-jfhlQC&dq=Tyrant+of+the+Badlands+(The+Accidental+Detectives+Series&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dharma Beads: Making and Using Your Own Buddhist Malas","description":"\\"Dharma Beads\\" looks beyond just the hip aspect of wearing Buddhist malas and presents a clear and concise introduction to the Buddhist spiritual tradition.

In this game there s no second place, only the quick and the dead.  In Vietnam, Mobile Guerrilla Force conducted unconventional operations against the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese Army. Armed with silencer-equipped MK-II British Sten guns, M-16s, M-79s, and M-60 machine guns, the men of the Mobile Guerrilla Force operated in the steamy, triple-canopy jungle owned by the NVA and VC, destroying base camps, ambushing patrols, and gathering the intelligence that General Westmoreland desperately needed. In 1967, James Donahue was a Special Forces medic and assistant platoon leader assigned to the Mobile Guerrilla Force and their fiercely anti-Communist Cambodian freedom fighters. Their mission: to locate the 271st Main Force Viet Cong Regiment so they could be engaged and destroyed by the 1st Infantry Division. Now, with the brutal, unflinching honesty only an eye witness could possess, Donahue relives the adrenaline rush of firefights, air strikes, human wave attacks, ambushes, and attacks on enemy base camps. Following the operation the surviving Special Forces members of the Mobile Guerrilla Force were decorated by Major General John Hay, Commanding General, 1st Infantry Division.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cuI9R7_ga5sC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What A Time It Was","description":"SEVENY SEVEN Seveny-Seven was what the Disc Jockeys, slovenly, called the year of seventy seven, the year after the heat wave and the year before 'New Wave'.

It examines both conservative and liberal forms of capitalism; it compares Economic Democracy to other models of socialism; and it considers the transition to Economic Democracy from advanced capitalist societies, from economies built on the Soviet model, and from conditions of underdevelopment. The book concludes with some unconventional reflections on historical materialism, ideal communism, and the future of Marxism.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=y75aDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Surgeon's Mate","description":"Ordered home by dispatch vessel, Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin find their ship pursued by two privateers through the fog of the Grand Banks","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IqQINfZ3sM4C&dq=The+Surgeon%27s+Mate&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"8 Habits of an Effective Youth Worker","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SCjEz3bT5zoC&dq=8+Habits+of+an+Effective+Youth+Worker&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Santa Maria Del Monte: The Presence of the Past in a Spanish Village","description":"This study of a northern Spanish community shows how the residents of Santa Mar a del Monte have acted together at critical times to ensure the survival of their traditional forms of social organization.

Mick Jones' licks on songs such as  Hate and War  were heavily influenced by classic American rock and roll, and the cover of Junior Murvin's reggae hit  Police and Thieves  showed that the band's musical influences were already wide-ranging. Later albums such as Sandinista! and Combat Rock saw them experimenting with a huge range of musical genres, lyrical themes and visual aesthetics. The Clash Takes on the World explores the transnational aspects of The Clash's music, lyrics and politics, and it does so from a truly transnational perspective. It brings together literary scholars, historians, media theorists, musicologists, social activists and geographers from Europe and the US, and applies a range of critical approaches to The Clash's work in order to tackle a number of key questions: How should we interpret their negotiations with reggae music and culture? How did The Clash respond to the specific socio-political issues of their time, such as the economic recession, the Reagan-Thatcher era and burgeoning neoliberalism, and international conflicts in Nicaragua and the Falkland Islands? How did they reconcile their anti-capitalist stance with their own success and status as a global commodity? And how did their avowedly inclusive, multicultural stance, reflected in their musical diversity, square with the experience of watching the band in performance? The Clash Takes on the World is essential reading for scholars, students and general readers interested in a band whose popularity endures.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TfhsDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hurry Sundown","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EwtnZkGj1bkC&dq=Hurry+Sundown&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"If I Were A Frog","description":"How far could you hop?

During that time, some of these poems appeared in various journals and on Web sites, including The Poetry Daily site, which ran thirty of Lehman's poems in as many days throughout the month of April 1998. For The Daily Mirror, Lehman has selected the best of these \\"daily poems\\" -- each tied to a specific occasion or situation -- and telescoped two years into one. Spontaneous and immediate, but always finely crafted and spiced with Lehman's signature irony and wit, the poems are akin to journal entries charting the passing of time, the deaths of great men and women, the news of the day. Jazz, Sinatra, the weather, love, poetry and poets, movies, and New York City are among their recurring themes. A departure from Lehman's previous work, this unique volume provides the intimacy of a diary, full of passion, sound, and fury, but with all the aesthetic pleasure of poetry. More a party of poems than a standard collection, The Daily Mirror presents an exciting new way to think about poetry.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=63c3cCAABlQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Echoes (Star Trek Voyager, No 15)","description":"The U.S.S.

So when Joe sees a little white goat amidst the singing birds, salted herrings and hokey-pokey ices of a Whitechapel market he has to have him. He knows it's just a matter of time before the tiny bump on the unicorn's head becomes the magic horn to grant his every wish. For in the embattled working-class community of 1950s East End London, there are plenty of people in need of good fortune. The only thing Mr Kandinsky wants is a steam press for his shop; his assistant Shmule, a wrestler, just needs to buy a ring for his girl; and all Joe and his mother wish for, more than anything, is to join his father in Africa.

It stands in the centre of a small bay, and upon a gentle acclivity, which, on one side, slopes towards the sea, and on the other rises into an eminence crowned by dark woods. The situation is admirably beautiful and picturesque, and the ruins have an air of ancient grandeur, which, contrasted with the present solitude of the scene, impresses the traveller with awe and curiosity. During my travels abroad I visited this spot. As I walked over the loose fragments of stone, which lay scattered through the immense area of the fabrick, and surveyed the sublimity and grandeur of the ruins, I recurred, by a natural association of ideas, to the times when these walls stood proudly in their original splendour, when the halls were the scenes of hospitality and festive magnificence, and when they resounded with the voices of those whom death had long since swept from the earth. 'Thus,' said I, 'shall the present generation he who now sinks in misery and he who now swims in pleasure, alike pass away and be forgotten.' My heart swelled with the reflection; and, as I turned from the scene with a sigh, I fixed my eyes upon a friar, whose venerable figure, gently bending towards the earth, formed no uninteresting object in the picture. He observed my emotion; and, as my eye met his, shook his head and pointed to the ruin. 'These walls,' said he, 'were once the seat of luxury and vice. They exhibited a singular instance of the retribution of Heaven, and were from that period forsaken, and abandoned to decay.' His words excited my curiosity, and I enquired further concerning their meaning. 'A solemn history belongs to this castle, said he, 'which is too long and intricate for me to relate. It is, however, contained in a manuscript in our library, of which I could, perhaps, procure you a sight. A brother of our order, a descendant of the noble house of Mazzini, collected and recorded the most striking incidents relating to his family, and the history thus formed, he left as a legacy to our convent. If you please, we will walk thither.' I accompanied him to the convent, and the friar introduced me to his superior, a man of an intelligent mind and benevolent heart, with whom I passed some hours in interesting conversation. I believe my sentiments pleased him; for, by his indulgence, I was permitted to take abstracts of the history before me, which, with some further particulars obtained in conversation with the abate, I have arranged in the following pages.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xz6kDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Y Chromosome","description":"It's obvious why only men develop prostate cancer and why only women get ovarian cancer. But it is not obvious why women are more likely to recover language ability after a stroke than men or why women are more apt to develop autoimmune diseases such as lupus. Sex differences in health throughout the lifespan have been documented. Exploring the Biological Contributions to Human Health begins to snap the pieces of the puzzle into place so that this knowledge can be used to improve health for both sexes. From behavior and cognition to metabolism and response to chemicals and infectious organisms, this book explores the health impact of sex (being male or female, according to reproductive organs and chromosomes) and gender (one's sense of self as male or female in society). Exploring the Biological Contributions to Human Health discusses basic biochemical differences in the cells of males and females and health variability between the sexes from conception throughout life. The book identifies key research needs and opportunities and addresses barriers to research. Exploring the Biological Contributions to Human Health will be important to health policy makers, basic, applied, and clinical researchers, educators, providers, and journalists-while being very accessible to interested lay readers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cucGKcGkB9sC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Man from Enterprise: The Biography of John Amos","description":"In celebration of the 100th anniversary of the first Coca-Cola bottling plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, former Coca-Cola ad man Mike Cheatham has compiled a fond look back at the Georgia's bottlers and the impact they made on their communities, then and now. Beginning with an exploration of Benjamin Thomas and Joseph Whitehead of Chattanooga, who in 1899 secured the first bottling rights from Coca-Cola Company founder Asa Candler, Cheatham goes on to examine several key Georgia bottlers: -- The Montgomery Family of Atlanta and the parallel rise of their bottling company and the city during the 1950s and '60s; -- The Barron Family of Rome and their substantial nurturing of and investment in local institutions, such as Berry College, Darlington School and Shorter College; -- The Roberts of Columbus, who contributed greatly to Baptist institutions of higher learning, such as Mercer University; -- The Samses of Athens and for the real sense of family they imparted to their employees; - The Haley Family of Athens, and their successful divestiture of bottling profits into the Albany community; and -- The Cobbs of LaGrange-West Point, known throughout the industry for their marketing innovations and throughout the community for their plant tours for schoolchildren. Also discussed in depth is Delony Sledge, the Coca-Cola advertising director whose classic campaigns (including Things Go Better With Coke) defined the drink's golden age of advertising and who mobilized the bottlers behind his work. Your Friendly Neighbor concludes with an examination of the bottlers as a whole and the foundations they founded and The Coca-Cola Company leaders who inspired them to leave mark upon their respective communities.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hgxm3ri5JsIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Goldmine Records & Prices: A Concise Digest with Over 30,000 Listings (Goldmine Records and Prices)","description":"Just like you, Goldmine is passionate about vinyl.

Wireless networks can easily be reconfigured, are very mobile, allow for potentially nonstop exposure, and require the level of security be scrutinized even more than for wired networks. This includes inherent security flaws in various wireless architectures that result in additional risks to otherwise secure converged wired networks. An even worse scenario is one where an insecure wireless network is connected to a weakly secured or insecure wired network and the wireless subnet is not separated from the wired subnet. There are approximately a dozen popular books that cover components of the architecture, design, theory, issues, challenges, and recommended policies for wireless security, none of which address them in a practical, operationally-oriented and comprehensive way. Wireless Operational Security bridges this gap. *Presents a new \\"WISDOM\\" model for Wireless Security Infrastructures *Acts as a critical guide to implementing \\"Converged Networks\\" wired/wireless with all necessary security considerations *Rittinghouse's Cybersecurity Operations Handbook is the only security book recommended by the FCC","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IcYFTPPbgEgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Taming the Wild Field: Colonization and Empire on the Russian Steppe","description":"Stretching from the tributaries of the Danube to the Urals and from the Russian forests to the Black and Caspian seas, the vast European steppe has for centuries played very different roles in the Russian imagination. To the Grand Princes of Kiev and Muscovy, it was the \\"wild field,\\" a region inhabited by nomadic Turko-Mongolic peoples who repeatedly threatened the fragile Slavic settlements to the north. For the emperors and empresses of imperial Russia, it was a land of boundless economic promise and a marker of national cultural prowess. By the mid-nineteenth century the steppe, once so alien and threatening, had emerged as an essential, if complicated, symbol of Russia itself. Traversing a thousand years of the region's history, Willard Sunderland recounts the complex process of Russian expansion and colonization, stressing the way outsider settlement at once created the steppe as a region of empire and was itself constantly changing. The story is populated by a colorful array of administrators, Cossack adventurers, Orthodox missionaries, geographers, foreign entrepreneurs, peasants, and (by the late nineteenth century) tourists and conservationists. Sunderland's approach to history is comparative throughout, and his comparisons of the steppe with the North American case are especially telling.

In the discussion of architecture, there is a prevailing sentiment that, since 1968, cultural production in its traditional sense can no longer be understood to rise spontaneously, as a matter of social course, but must now be constructed through ever more self-conscious theoretical procedures. The development of interpretive modes of various stripes post-structuralist, Marxian, phenomenological, psychoanalytic, as well as others dissenting or eccentric has given scholars a range of tools for rethinking architecture in relation to other fields and for reasserting architectures general importance in intellectual discourse. This anthology presents forty-seven of the primary texts of architecture theory, introducing each with an explication of the concepts and categories necessary for its understanding and evaluation. It also presents twelve documents of projects or events that had major theoretical repercussions for the period. Several of the essays appear here in English for the first time.

Schultz's historic saga about the settlement and growth of one of America's great cities. You'll follow the adventures of Jack and Kevin, two spunky Irish orphans just off the boat and determined to make their fortunes in America. They arrive in Kansas City when it is a rugged town built along mountainous gullies carved in the mud along the Missouri River--thus earning it the name \\"Gully Town.\\" For Kevin, early Kansas City affords the opportunity to fulfill his ambitions to be a newspaper reporter and to pursue his avid interest in women--until the captivating Mary, herself and Irish immigrant, steals his heart. Jack settles into the business community and his life takes a completely different turn as he helps create the Boss System of politics that continues to dominate the city for half a century. Red is a young man who witnesses the horror of Quantrill's famous raid on Lawrence, Kansas, in the early days of the Civil War and later participates in the Battle of Westport. Red finds the woman of his dreams in the beautiful Melissa--only to lose her when she learns of his past and flees, taking with her the secret that could save Red from a life of crime. Adam, schoolteacher, historian, state senator and newspaper columnist, chronicles the lives of his friends and the growth of Kansas City in the journal he faithfully keeps through the years. Through him, we learn about the turbulent political system that puts Jack on top--and frequently threatens his life. We experience such history making events as the great Centennial celebration in 1900, and the St. Louis World's Fair in 1904. As the next generation comes of age in a more civilized Kansas City it faces its own challenges. Michael, a product of Gully town's Little Italy, grows up in violence and becomes chief of the Kansas City underworld. Michael falls in love with the beautiful Beth, and must face the inevitability of his career in organized crime destroying the life they have built together.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9-j_Sw72bekC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Let Me Make it Good: A Chronicle of My Life With Borderline Personality Disorder","description":"This book explores the world of a person diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder and the havoc it has wreaked on her, her family and her friends.

LSU s only Heisman Trophy winner, Cannon led the Tigers to a national championship in 1958, igniting a love of the game in Louisiana and establishing a tradition of greatness at LSU. But like many stories of lionized athletes who rise to the status of legend, there was a fall and in the case of Billy Cannon, also redemption. For the first time, Charles N. deGravelles reveals in full the thrilling highs and unexpected lows of Cannon s life, in Billy Cannon: A Long, Long Run. Through conversations with Cannon, deGravelles follows the athlete-turned-reformer from his boyhood in a working-class Baton Rouge neighborhood to his sudden rush of fame as the leading high school running back in the country. Personal and previously unpublished stories about Cannon s glory days at LSU and his stellar but controversial career in the pros, as well as details of his indictment for counterfeiting and his post-release work as staff dentist at Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola, unfold in a riveting biography characterized by uncanny success, deep internal struggles, and a champion s spirit that pushed through it all.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MHw-CgAAQBAJ&dq=From+Cannon+to+Campbell:+An+Illustrated+History+of+The+Houston+Oilers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Newspaper Days: 1899-1906","description":"It has been said that If you can read a recipe, you can cook. The sad truth is that many cooks today do not know enough of the basics of foods and cooking to translate recipes to cook with confidence, let alone creatively. My Cooking Coach is a 500 page cornucopia of cooking knowledge that provides, as its slogan states, Cooking Knowledge at Your Fingertips. All of this cooking knowledge comes from a revised version of The Essential Cook, by Charles Delmar, winner of the prestigious Writings award from the International Assn. of Culinary Professionals (IACP). This new edition has been re-named and re-formatted in bite-sized pieces so it can be read as a quick reference from its Glossary/Index of more than 1,000 cooking terms, an important consideration for today's cooks who don't seem to have the time or the patience to read a textbook. Of course, it can also be read as a book that one reviewer for the first edition described as A really good, and informative, read. From Part One, First You Steal a Chicken: How to Plan, Select, Store, Prepare, Cook, Flavor and Serve most foods, through Part Three: How to Set a Dining Table and Other Facts of Life, with How Good Cooks Do It: Basic Cooking Methods and Techniques in between, My Cooking Coach uses clear, direct language and more than 400 informative illustrations, along with Master Recipes, to explain the basic Whats, Whys and How-tos of foods and cooking. There are no conventional recipes in My Cooking Coach. Rather, the author uses what he calls Master Recipes that provide step-by-step instructions for cooking almost any food you can think of by any of the basic cooking methods usually used to cook that food: Dry Heat, Liquids, and Fats, i.e. Frying. Master recipes are the themes, of which recipes are but individual variations, says author Delmar.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HAZbAAAAMAAJ&dq=Newspaper+Days:+1899-1906&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"See!","description":"Value-stream maps are the blueprints for lean transformations and Learning to See is an easy-to-read, step-by-step instruction manual that teaches this valuable tool to anyone, regardless of his or her background.This groundbreaking workbook, which has introduced the value-stream mapping tool to thousands of people around the world, breaks down the important concepts of value-stream mapping into an easily grasped format. The workbook, a Shingo Research Prize recipient in 1999, is filled with actual maps, as well as engaging diagrams and illustrations.The value-stream map is a paper-and-pencil representation of every process in the material and information flow, along with key data. It differs significantly from tools such as process mapping or layout diagrams because it includes information flow as well as material flow. Value-stream mapping is an overarching tool that gives managers and executives a picture of the entire production process, both value and non value-creating activities. Rather than taking a haphazard approach to lean implementation, value-stream mapping establishes a direction for the company.To encourage you to become actively involved in the learning process, Learning to See contains a case study based on a fictional company, Acme Stamping. You begin by mapping the current state of the value stream, looking for all the sources of waste. After identifying the waste, you draw a map of a leaner future state and a value-stream plan to guide implementation and review progress regularly.Written by two experts with practical experience, Mike Rother and John Shook, the workbook makes complicated concepts simple. It teaches you the reasons for introducing a mapping program and how it fits into a lean conversion.With this easy-to-use product, a company gets the tool it needs to understand and use value-stream mapping so it can eliminate waste in production processes.

Self-trained survivalists, the outlaws eluded the most sophisticated law enforcement technology on the planet and a pursuit force that represented more than seventy-five local, state, and federal police agencies with dozens of swat teams, U.S. Army Special Forces, and more than five hundred officers from across the country. Dead Run is the first in-depth account of this sensational case, replete with overbearing local sheriffs, Native American trackers, posses on horseback, suspicion of vigilante justice and police cover-ups, and the blunders of the nation's most exalted crime-fighters pursuing outlaws into territory in which only they could survive.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0s4s2RlNUcMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The story of mankind","description":"Chronicles the history of man and civilization from primitive beginnings to the current day.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MiRCAgAAQBAJ&dq=The+story+of+mankind&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Some Kind Of Hero (Silhouette Intimate Moments No. 1246)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6aJYAAAAMAAJ&dq=Some+Kind+Of+Hero+(Silhouette+Intimate+Moments+No.+1246)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The new world of philosophy (A Vintage book)","description":"Self-help gurus, life coaches and business consultants love to tell us that we must strive for constant self-improvement to realize our full potential and become truly happy. But it doesn't seem to work - for many of us, life still seems hollow and meaningless. So focused are we on personal development and material possessions that we've overlooked the things that make life truly fulfilling and worthwhile. So how do we figure out what's really worth striving for? In this compelling follow-up to his bestselling book Stand Firm, Danish philosopher and psychologist Svend Brinkmann shows us that the important things in life are those with intrinsic value, like goodness, freedom, truth and love. We should stop asking 'what's in it for me?', and turn our attention outwards to our friends, families and communities. By putting others first and embracing these unconditional principles, or standpoints, he argues, we can find a more meaningful and sustainable way of living.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mRJSDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Professional Verification: A Guide to Advanced Functional Verification (IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vMjfAAAAMAAJ&dq=Professional+Verification:+A+Guide+to+Advanced+Functional+Verification+(IFIP+Advances+in+Information+and+Communication+Technology)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Case of the Golddigger's Purse; Died in the Wool; Pearls Before Swine (Detective Book Club)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cTpXAAAAYAAJ&dq=The+Case+of+the+Golddigger%27s+Purse%3B+Died+in+the+Wool%3B+Pearls+Before+Swine+(Detective+Book+Club)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Math Gene: How Mathematical Thinking Evolved and Why Numbers Are Like Gossip","description":"Why is math so hard?

Why, then, can't we do math as well as we can speak?

The American Revolution: A World War provides a fuller story of a war that involved international interest and conflict. From acts of resistance like the Boston Tea Party to the \\"shot heard 'round the world,\\" the struggle for liberty and independence still resonates; this book offers new insight into the involvement of other nations and the colonists' desire for a country that symbolized their values and the pursuit of the American way of life. Spain, France, and the Dutch Republic joined the colonists' fight against the British not because they supported American independence but because they wanted to protect their own interests. These nations offered essential financial and military support to the revolutionaries, without which the colonists may not have been able to withstand British military supremacy on land and on the seas. The colonists also benefitted from a fortunate tactical advantage: distraction. Great Britain, working to protect its lucrative colonial interests in the Caribbean and India from the other European superpowers, turned its attention away from the American front, enabling colonists to make unexpected gains in the war.

If heaven is perfect, why do rewards even matter? His answers are immensely practical.

A profound novel about the claims of identity, history, family, and the burdens of a broken world.   Maureen Corrigan, NPR s  Fresh Air  In the book of Genesis, when God calls out,  Abraham!  before ordering him to sacrifice his son, Isaac, Abraham responds,  Here I am.  Later, when Isaac calls out,  My father!  before asking him why there is no animal to slaughter, Abraham responds,  Here I am.  How do we fulfill our conflicting duties as father, husband, and son; wife and mother; child and adult? Jew and American? How can we claim our own identities when our lives are linked so closely to others ? These are the questions at the heart of Jonathan Safran Foer s first novel in eleven years a work of extraordinary scope and heartbreaking intimacy. Unfolding over four tumultuous weeks in present-day Washington, D.C., Here I Am is the story of a fracturing family in a moment of crisis. As Jacob and Julia Bloch and their three sons are forced to confront the distances between the lives they think they want and the lives they are living, a catastrophic earthquake sets in motion a quickly escalating conflict in the Middle East. At stake is the meaning of home and the fundamental question of how much aliveness one can bear. Showcasing the same high-energy inventiveness, hilarious irreverence, and emotional urgency that readers loved in his earlier work, Here I Am is Foer s most searching, hard-hitting, and grandly entertaining novel yet. It not only confirms Foer s stature as a dazzling literary talent but reveals a novelist who has fully come into his own as one of our most important writers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=q5iTCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cooking Light Annual Recipes 2004","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NVq1vgEACAAJ&dq=Cooking+Light+Annual+Recipes+2004&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Masters of Time: Cosmology at the End of Innocence","description":"Masters of Time chronicles the sudden unraveling of modern cosmology from its heyday in the early 1980s, when the ultimate secret of the origin of the universe seemed all but in hand, to the confused scientific picture of the 1990s.

Robert Oppenheimer: And the American Century","description":"\\"David Cassidy has done it again. Employing the insight and skill that made his Heisenberg biography so widely read and honored, Cassidy' s new book breaks new ground, by explaining Oppenheimer' s rise and fall as an important part of the social, cultural, and political turmoil of America' s twentieth-century.\\" --Gerald Holton, Mallinckrodt Research Professor of Physics and Research Professor of the History of Science, Harvard University \\"Cassidy presents a comprehensive and engaging account of the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a pivotal figure in twentieth-century physics. An excellent work of biography, scientific narrative, and historical perspective. This book is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand the deep relationships between science, politics, and culture in the United States.\\" --Fred Adams, University of Michigan, author of \\"Our Living Multiverse and \\"The Five Ages of the Universe \\"A most impressive achievement. Cassidy presents an informative, thoughtful, and very readable biography of this important, complex individual. In addition he has succeeded in giving an insightful, convincing account of Oppenheimer' s actions by placing his life and work in the context of the scientific militarism that was to provide the United States with some of the means to guarantee its security--a militarism that Oppenheimer helped shape and that eventually crushed him. This book is an important work that sets new standards for scientific biography.\\" --Silvan S. Schweber, Professor of Physics and Koret Professor of the History of Ideas, Emeritus, Brandeis University, and Senior Research Associate, History of Recent Science and Technology, Dibner Institute, MIT \\"A ' must read' for anyone interested in the development of the modern era of ' big science.' Cassidy skillfully brings to us a deep understanding of the character of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the leader of the Manhattan Project and one of the most complex and seemingly contradictory individuals of the twentieth-century.\\" --Gregory Tarle, Professor of Physics, University of Michigan J. Robert Oppenheimer, the man who led the Manhattan Project that built the atomic bomb and ended World War II, forged the alliance between science and government that made the American Century possible. David C. Cassidy' s much anticipated, richly detailed, magisterial biography is not merely the life story of a brilliant physicist, it tells the hidden story of the political and social forces shaping the world in our time: the rise of American science. In 1941, before Germany failed to build an atomic weapon, and the United States succeeded, \\"Life published Henry R. Luce' s essay \\"The American Century.\\" It proclaimed that America was not at war simply to defeat the Axis powers. The United States must \\"exert upon the world the full impact of our influence, for such purpose as we see fit and by such means as we see fit.\\" Cassidy reveals such confidence, and the success of the Manhattan Project itself, were essentially by products of the rise of American science driven by burgeoning industrial prosperity and a kind of national devotion to the pursuit of knowledge. While Cassidy illuminates Oppenheimer' s genius for inspiring his students and colleagues to attack and ultimately solve the hardest scientific problems of the age, he also takes thereader to the 1954 Atomic Energy Commission Security review that disgraced Oppenheimer, stripped him of his security clearance for alleged \\"red ties,\\" and captured headlines across the nation. Documents that have only recently come to light regarding those ties are thoroughly and conclusively examined. Oppenheimer, the eldest son of an aristocratic Jewish family living on the Upper West Side of New York City, attended the secular, progressive, and elite Ethical Culture School. Cassidy, building his narrative on previously untapped primary documents, shows the importance and character of Oppenheimer' s early education. The liberal values he absorbed there ran counter to the culture he found at Harvard, whose president sought to foster a future managerial elite, the rulers of the new American society. These formative contrasts in values explain Oppenheimer' s many seeming contradictions. Why did the scientist who correctly theorized black holes turn his back on cutting edge research? How did a gentle liberal humanist become responsible for the creation of the first real weapon of mass destruction? How could a brilliant mind like his virtually found \\"scientific militarism\\" and then let it destroy him? Cassidy opens up a life story that is emblematic of the transformation of America over the last three generations. It offers, as the best history can, an insight into the future technological and moral progress of a nation.(c) Copyright Pearson Education.

Actions against convoys and E-boats, often under the shadows of French cliffs, an impossible sortie against Scharnhorst and Gneisenau as they ran the gauntlet through the Straits in February 1942, the attack on St Nazaire, and the defensive and offensive roles taken on by MTBs during the D-Day landings are just some of the events covered in the book.The bravery of the crews of these small ships became legendary and the casualties that were suffered during brief and fierce encounters were horrific. As the War dragged on Motor Torpedo Boats became household words, and their activities, often described, perhaps a little luridly in the press, helped to raise the morale of the nation in much the same way that the fighter aircraft had done in the Battle of Britain in September 1940.

Encompassing the entire continent, Renaissance Architecture examines the rich variety of buildings that emerged during these seminal centuries of European history. Although marked by the rise of powerful individuals, both patrons and architects, the Renaissance was equally a time of growing group identities and communities - and architecture provided the public face to these new identities . Religious reforms in northern Europe, spurred on by Martin Luther, rejected traditional church function and decoration, and proposed new models. Political ambitions required new buildings to satisfy court rituals. Territory, nature, and art intersected to shape new landscapes and building types. Classicism came to be the international language of an educated architect and an ambitious patron, drawing on the legacy of ancient Rome. Yet the richness of the medieval tradition continued to be used throughout Europe, often alongside classical buildings. Examining each of these areas by turn, this book offers a broad cultural history of the period as well as a completely new approach to the history of Renaissance architecture. The work of well-known architects such as Michelangelo and Andrea Palladio is examined alongside lesser known though no less innovative designers such as Juan Guas in Portugal and Benedikt Ried in Prague and Eastern Europe. Drawing on the latest research, it also covers more recent areas of interest such as the story of women as patrons and the emotional effect of Renaissance buildings, as well as the impact of architectural publications and travel on the emerging new architectural culture across Europe. As such, it provides a compelling introduction to the subject for all those interested in the history of architecture, society, and culture in the Renaissance, and European culture in general.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FW2qw0q5li8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Australians and the Gold Rush","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kbZ0py8qiO8C&dq=Australians+and+the+Gold+Rush&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blizzard Pass","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7unP4a8iW_0C&dq=Blizzard+Pass&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Faro's daughter","description":"A sparkling Regency romance from the queen of the genre Beautiful Deborah Grantham, mistress of her aunt's elegant gaming house, must find a way to restore herself and her aunt to respectability, preferably without accepting either of two repugnant offers.

We all want to know how to find inner peace but seldom realize the answer lies within us. No one can help you but yourself. Only you can achieve inner peace by truly understanding yourself, your world and being honest with yourself. They say writing about your feelings, your understanding about yourself is therapeutic and the first step in achieving inner peace. This is exactly what this interactive journal \\"How to Find Inner Peace within Yourself\\" is all about. It asks you a series of questions that you need to answer honestly after careful thought. No need to write elaborate answers. Just simple answers will do as long as it is honest. As you write, you will feel a sense of understanding and find something in yourself that you may have not experienced before. To be honest, these questions are something that I had to ask myself when I myself was struggling to find inner peace and after writing down everything I did experience some sense of tranquility. I would not say I have complete inner peace within myself at the moment but at least I understand myself better and what is standing in the way to feel true bliss. I hope this journal helps anyone reading it as much as it helped me and do not worry if certain questions cannot be answered right away. You may need to revisit some of the questions but in the end, it will be your personal journey to finding inner peace within yourself.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NG86vgAACAAJ&dq=In+Careful+Thought&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Caring for Our Forests (Caring for Our Earth)","description":"It is our planet, and our future.

Women remain caught between feminism and femininity, between self-affirmation and an endless quest for self-improvement, between playing an injured party and claiming independence. Rather than blaming the usual suspects men, the media Kipnis takes a hard look at culprits closer to home, namely women themselves. Kipnis serves up the gory details of the mutual displeasure between men and women in painfully hilarious detail. Is anatomy destiny after all? An ambitious and original reassessment of feminism and women s ambivalence about it, The Female Thing breathes provocative new life into that age-old question.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LRViIikhVTMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The History of Britain: An Aerial View","description":"Britain's history has made a clear imprint on the landscape, and aerial photography demonstrated this in a particularly vivid way.

First-rate history grounded in scholarship and brought to life by a critically acclaimed author. From breathless hagiographies to scandal-mongering expos s, no family has generated more bestselling books than the Kennedys. None of them, however, has focused on the watershed period of World War II, when the course of the family and its individual members changed utterly. Now, in an engaging narrative grounded in impeccable scholarship, Edward J. Renehan, Jr., provides a dramatic portrait of years marked by family tensions, heartbreaks, and heroics. It was during this time that tragedy began to haunt the familyJoe Jr. s death, the untimely widowhood of Kathleen (a.k.a.  Kick ), Rosemary s lobotomy. But it was also the time in which John F. Kennedy rose above the strictures of the clan and became his own man. In the late 1930s, the Kennedys settled in London, where Joseph Kennedy, Sr., was serving as ambassador. A virulent anti-Semite and isolationist, Kennedy relentlessly and ruthlessly fought to keep America out of the war in Europe. His behavior as patriarch in many ways mirrored his public style. Though he was devoted to the family, he was also manipulative and autocratic. In re-creating the intense and tension-filled interactions among the family, Renehan offers riveting, often revisionist views of Joseph Sr.; heir apparent Joe Jr.; Kick, the beautiful socialite; and Jack, the complex charmer. He demonstrates that Joe Jr., although much like his father in opinion and character, was driven to volunteer for a deadly mission in large part because of his fury at Jack s seemingly easy successes. Renehan also delves into why Kick, a good Catholic girl, chose to abandon her religion for the chance to enter the fairytale world of the British aristocracy, only to suffer a horrendous tragedy. It is Renehan s reassessment of Jack, however, that is particularly striking. In subtly breaking away from his domineering father over the issue of World War II, Renehan argues, Jack began to forge the character that would eventually take him to the Oval Office. Going behind the familiar (and accurate) image of JFK as a reckless playboy, Renehan shows us a young man of great intelligence, moral courage, and truly astonishing physical bravery.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7ineSPsErHYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Cabin","description":"A New York Times Bestseller!

Usually this involves doing what other people have overlooked, as well as avoiding what is unproductive. He identifies five talents as essential to effectiveness, and these can be learned; in fact, they must be learned just as scales must be mastered by every piano student regardless of his natural gifts. Intelligence, imagination and knowledge may all be wasted in an executive job without the acquired habits of mind that convert these into results. One of the talents is the management of time. Another is choosing what to contribute to the particular organization. A third is knowing where and how to apply your strength to best effect. Fourth is setting up the right priorities. And all of them must be knitted together by effective decision-making. How these can be developed forms the main body of the book. The author ranges widely through the annals of business and government to demonstrate the distinctive skill of the executive. He turns familiar experience upside down to see it in new perspective. The book is full of surprises, with its fresh insights into old and seemingly trite situations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=THhQDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Effective+Executive&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Complete Basenji","description":"The definitive list of breed books, written by internationally-famed experts for serious dog people.

Out of this skirmish arose a stirring tale of war, which was recorded in the oldest extant epic poem in French. The Song of Roland, written by an unknown poet, tells of Charlemagne s warrior nephew, Lord of the Breton Marches, who valiantly leads his men into battle against the Saracens, but dies in the massacre, defiant to the end. In majestic verses, the battle becomes a symbolic struggle between Christianity and paganism, while Roland s last stand is the ultimate expression of honour and feudal values of twelfth-century France.

Together with a few others, he was present at the cradle of Leuven sociology in the middle of the 1960s. He participated in the construction of the necessary administrative, logistic, and academic structures as well as in the establishment of the research and educational domains in which Leuven sociology would specialize. Very soon there developed a unique sociological prespective that is known as the Leuven triangle: the integration of sociological theory, methodology, and social policy. Within this framework, the name of Wilfried Dumon is inextricably bound up with the sociology of the family, or more broadly, with the family sciences. Without doubt, he was the standard bearer of Flemish family sociology. Hundreds of students profited from his unusual - others would use much more colorful adjectives - form of teaching, in both form and content. He was directly or indirectly responsible for virtually all the courses in Leuven family sociology, also outside of his own Faculty. And those whose licentiate or doctoral thesis dealt with a theme that was in any way related to subjects like marriage, the family, or sexuality, were invariably confronted with his critical analysis and unique vocabulary. Wilfried Dumon also took on many policy positions such as editorial secretary or editor-in-chief of journals, director or manager of all sorts of institutions, and member, director or chairman of several commissions and associations. And all of this both nationally and internationally. Indeed, Wilfried Dumon had and has an extensive and tightly knit network of warm academic contacts the world over.

Here, Dr. Mortimer tells a tale of how he came across his second and most challenging case ever. In 1890, the young Dr. Mortimer is numb with grief over the death of his wife and decides to close his own practice and begin a new life for himself. He winds up in London and is asked to fill in for another doctor with an emergency. Dr. Mortimer agrees and his last call of the day brings him to an address in Aldgate where he meets the captivating Lavinia Nancarrow. Intrigued and worried by the overbearing solicitude of the girl's guardian who keeps her a virtual prisoner, Mortimer determines to discover the reasons behind Lavinia's confinement. A retired Calcutta merchant with a guilty secret, a decadent fin-de-siecle artist who frequents an anarchist caf  in Whitechapel and a seemingly impossible murder are the key pieces in the puzzle, which Mortimer soon finds himself trying to solve, in Gerard Williams's Dr. Mortimer and the Aldgate Mystery. Engagingly absent-minded but incessantly curious and observant, Mortimer is aided in his effort by his formidable consort, the liberated Dr. Violet Branscombe. Together they unravel a mystery as dark and sinister as the East End Alleys of Victorian London.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=diA4AwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fireworks 3 Bible (with CD-ROM)","description":"From vector drawing to bit map editing to animations, Fireworks 3 puts all the Web graphics tools you need into a single, cohesive package.

The book, like the series, deals with the trials and triumphs of a group of Americans whose roots in the American soil are deeper than those of the Puritans who arrived on the celebrated  Mayflower  a year after a  Dutch man of war  deposited twenty Negroes at Jamestown. This is a history of  the other Americans  and how they came to North America and what happened to them when they got here. The story begins in Africa with the great empires of the Sudan and Nile Valley and ends with the Second Reconstruction which Martin Luther King, Jr., and the  sit-in  generation are fashioning in the North and South. The story deals with the rise and growth of slavery and segregation and the continuing efforts of Negro Americans to answer the question of the Jewish poet of captivity:  How shall we sing the Lord s song in a strange land?  This history is founded on the work of scholars and specialists and is designed for the average reader. It is not, strictly speaking, a book for scholars; but it is as scholarly as fourteen months of research could make it. Readers who would like to follow the story in greater detail are urged to read each chapter in connection with the outline of Negro history in the appendix.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cDBpDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Brentwood (Grace Livingston Hill #18)","description":"Marjorie Wetherill grew up in a loving family among the wealthy and privileged but she always knew she was adopted.

With a genius for apt analogy the author shows how our obsession with fighting and winning set-piece battles causes us to overlook an enemy s true vulnerabilities.

Combining scientific rigor with a highly approachable and readable style of writing to create a practical and unique book, this volume provides a comprehensive overview of the increasingly important topic of child and adolescent social skills. A wide variety of tables, figures, and practical step-by-step guides enhance the material presented, making it particularly useful for practitioners while offering an extensive array of recent research and models of interest to researchers. The authors present a solid foundation of scientific knowledge written in a manner accessible to nonscientists and having ample practical implications and examples for educational and clinical practice. The book is divided into two parts--the first features a foundation for conceptualizing and assessing child and adolescent social skills, whereas the second focuses on the arena of intervention. An up-to-date and unique addition to the literature, this volume will be of interest to professionals who work with or study children across several disciplines including school and clinical child psychology, special education, counseling, and social work. Although many books and other professional materials on the social competence of children and adolescents are presently available, the knowledge regarding these social skills is expanding rapidly, and there is a tremendous need to keep it current. This book helps meet this need by not only synthesizing a great deal of recent work in the field, but also by providing new information and evidence that has not yet been published. It also bridges an important gap that sometimes exists between research and practice. For instance, some books on child and adolescent social skills are clearly written for the academician or researcher, and may have little apparent application for the clinician or practitioner. Other materials are written as practical assessment or intervention guides for the clinician/practitioner, yet sometimes lack supporting evidence and rationale. This book is aimed at both arenas.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FSABAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Maximum Volume","description":"Maximum Volume offers a glimpse into the mind, the music, and the man behind the sound of the Beatles. George Martin's working-class childhood and musical influences profoundly shaped his early career as head of the EMI Group's Parlophone Records.

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, and Abbey Road. The first book of two, Maximum Volume traces Martin's early years as a scratch pianist, his life in the Fleet Air Arm during the Second World War, and his groundbreaking work as the head of Parlophone Records, when Martin saved the company from ruin after making his name as a producer of comedy recordings. In its most dramatic moments, Maximum Volume narrates the story of Martin's unlikely discovery of the Beatles and his painstaking efforts to prepare their newfangled sound for the British music marketplace. As the story unfolds, Martin and the band craft numerous number-one hits, progressing towards the landmark album Rubber Soul all of which bear Martin's unmistakable musical signature.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Z6nGDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Crochet Coats","description":"Each of the four coat designs featured in this book is designed to flatter the body with special attention given to gentle shaping, fluidity, and drape. \\"Swinging Single\\" is a classic A-line that is crocheted from the top down using simple half-double and slip stitches to create texture, \\"Textured Topper\\" is crocheted side-to-side with attached sleeves and slash pockets, \\"Chill Chaser\\" uses a variety of extended single crochet stitches and front-and-back loop stitches, and \\"Cable Car\\" is crocheted from the bottom up using easy treble crochet cables adorning an extended single crochet background.

The efficiency is achieved by the use of recursive formulations of the equations of motion, i.e. formulations in which the equations of motion are expressed implicitly in terms of recurrence relations between the quantities describing the system. The use of recursive formulations in dynamics is fairly new, 50 the principles of their operation and reasons for their efficiency are explained. Three main algorithms are described: the recursIve Newton-Euler formulation for inverse dynamics (the calculation of the forces given the accelerations), and the composite-rigid-body and articulated-body methods for forward dynamics (the calculation of the accelerations given the forces). These algorithms are initially described in terms of an un-branched, open loop kinematic chain -- a typical serial robot mechanism. This is done to keep the descriptions of the algorithms simple, and is in line with descriptions appearing in the literature. Once the basic algorithms have been introduced, the restrictions on the mechanism are lifted and the algorithms are extended to cope with kinematic trees and loops, and general constraints at the joints. The problem of simulating the effect of contact between a robot and its environment is also considered. Some consideration is given to the details and practical problems of implementing these algori?hms on a computer.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UjWbvqWaf6gC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shanken's Cigar Handbook: A Connoisseur's Guide To Smoking Pleasure","description":"The ideal reference for the novice cigar fancier, with guidelines for selecting a cigar, cutting, lighting, and ashing.

The past few centuries have seen the great social and technological advances that are the hallmark of Aquarius, but they have been accompanied by cultural decay and a loss of symbolic meaning and true individuality. Instead we see a near obsession with superficial forms of self-expression (the lower side of Leo), which may be a reaction to the increasing uniformity and pervasive organization of Aquarius. Other cultures react against the impersonal, secular modernity of Aquarius with a fervent religious fundamentalism or blind loyalty to an undemocratic Leo-like leader; but in either case, resolving this dichotomy between Aquarius and Leo, society and the individual, is one of the keys to civilization's future.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oYSymAEACAAJ&dq=Pounding+Down...One+Day+at+a+Time&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Collage of Dreams: The Writings of Anais Nin","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=488fAQAAIAAJ&dq=Collage+of+Dreams:+The+Writings+of+Anais+Nin&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Book of Kells:: Growing Up in an Ego Void","description":"As a five-year-old girl, the author is baffled by parents who are such dedicatedexamples of the gospels they never reveal who they really are.

Why this abiding interest in exit lines? Perhaps because these final words spoken in hope or fear, joy or sorrow provide a view from the border between this world and the next. As this provocative and sometimes amusing collection illustrates, those who have gone before leave us with much more than helpful epigrams or witticisms. Paul Thigpen points out that their final words can actually \\"point us to fundamental realities to the very heart of God.\\" Even those sinners and strays who failed to live their faith may reveal much about the final shape of things to come. From comforting to sobering, these selections provide food for thought regarding the nature of Christian hope and the promise of eternal life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rhPYAAAACAAJ&dq=Last+Words:+Final+Thoughts+of+Catholic+Saints+and+Sinners&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Karma: A Life","description":"Life is Karma. As life unfolds day after day, we are confronted with circumstances, good and bad, and we wonder why things are happening the way they are. Is it luck, chance, serendipity or is it God instructing what should happen in our lives? It is none of these. It is Karma. Karma is a Law of Action, a Law of Action and Reaction, which is based on the principle,  as you sow, so shall you reap.  Everything that is happening in our life is unfolding as per Karma. But we don't realize that it is twin Karma, one, the Karma of the past which we cannot change and second, the Karma of the present which depends on our free will, our choice of action that we choose based on our intellect. But it is not as simple as this. Everything that we do in life creates Karma. And even after we die, our Karma continues with our Mind and Ego, ME that takes rebirth on earth along with its karma. This book 'Life is Karma' explains everything about Karma, and beyond, how we can be liberated from Karma and be united with the Divine.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9AJTEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Threads of Time, Vol. 1","description":"Moon Bin Kim dreams of living in a different time.

In Holding Fast to Dreams, 2018 American Council on Education (ACE) Lifetime Achievement Award winner Freeman Hrabowski recounts his journey as an educator, a university president, and a pioneer in developing successful, holistic programs for high-achieving students of all races. When Hrabowski was twelve years old, a civil rights leader visited his Birmingham, Alabama, church and spoke about a children s march for civil rights and opportunity. That leader was the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., and that march changed Hrabowski s life. Until then, Freeman was a kid who loved school and solving math problems. Although his family had always stressed the importance of education, he never expected that the world might change and that black and white students would one day study together. But hearing King speak changed everything for Hrabowski, who convinced his parents that he needed to answer King s call to stand up for equality. While participating in the famed Children s Crusade, he spent five terrifying nights in jail during which Freeman became a leader for the younger kids, as he learned about the risk and sacrifice that it would take to fight for justice. Hrabowski went on to fuse his passion for education and for equality, as he made his life s work inspiring high academic achievement among students of all races in science and engineering. It also brought him from Birmingham to Baltimore, where he has been president of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County for more than two decades. While at UMBC, he co-founded the Meyerhoff Scholars Program, which has been one of the most successful programs for educating African Americans who go on to earn doctorates in the STEM disciplines.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bgRoBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gentrification","description":"This first textbook on the topic of gentrification is written for upper-level undergraduates in geography, sociology, and planning.

Tsvetaeva's work of the time also reflects her knowledge of (and pride in) her native culture, especially the centrality of Moscow as the ultimate destination of all Russians. Throughout the verse she opens up to the sensual wonders of nature--sky, forest, wind, and not least her beloved daughter Alya, who would come to figure greatly in the work and legacy of her mother. Milestones lays out a sensual feast of moods, themes, styles, and rhythms--all the ingredients that would in time reveal Tsvetaeva as one of the most daring and original poets of her time.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-1OAAAAAIAAJ&dq=Milestones:+A+Bilingual+Edition+(European+Poetry+Classics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"SUN DANCING: LIFE IN A MEDIEVAL IRISH MONASTERY AND HOW CELTIC SPIRITUALITY INFLUENCED THE WORLD","description":"A fictionalized history of fourth-century Irish monks describes their spirituality and their influence on other areas of the world","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lyG_uHrG4DkC&dq=SUN+DANCING:+LIFE+IN+A+MEDIEVAL+IRISH+MONASTERY+AND+HOW+CELTIC+SPIRITUALITY+INFLUENCED+THE+WORLD&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Free, Fearless Female: Wild Thoughts on Womanhood","description":"Free, fearless, independent: These words describe the modern woman.

In Colossians she finds an overarching narrative of the Bible's grand creation-redemption story and an important emphasis on the relationship between creation and Christology, while her exploration of Philemon casts brighter light on the significance of Paul's familial metaphors for the church and the meaning of new humanity in Christ. Throughout her work on these two epistles, Thompson continually connects her insights to theological concerns, making this volume an excellent addition to the Two Horizons series.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hynAxYW4SjAC&dq=Colossians+and+Philemon+(Two+Horizons+New+Testament+Commentary)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ladies on Hold","description":"Bvlgari s new high jewelry collection pays tribute to the pioneering visions of indomitable women who blazed their own paths, broke boundaries, or shattered cultural norms.

Patriots wave it. Politicians of all kinds try to wrap themselves in it. It is saluted at baseball games, in parades, and on the most solemn of commemorative occasions. It was salvaged in the first hours following the dreadful events of September 11, and it stands outstretched just above the surface of the moon. It is, of course, the American flag, and there are few symbols as potent. With all the reverence and sacrifice and emotion it inspires, it is easy to lose sight of the fact that it is ultimately just a symbol. Why is it so powerful? Why does a piece of cloth resonate so loudly for so many? Why a flag, and why this flag, these stripes, those stars? In For Which It Stands, his timely, comprehensive, and engaging \\"biography\\" of the American flag, Michael Corcoran examines those questions and more as he explores the evolution of our most cherished emblem, from the days preceding the Revolution through the nationwide resurgence of patriotism in the aftermath of September 11. Corcoran traces the entire life of the colors, holding forth on a number of engrossing topics, including: ? The fluid design of the flag, the subject of much contentious debate on the part of the founding fathers, and until fairly recently, not officially codified. ? The various alternative flags ingrained in the national consciousness, among them the defiant, rattlesnake-adorned \\"Don't Tread on Me\\" banner and the \\"Stars and Bars\\" of the Confederacy. ? The role of the colors in war, from how to start a fight with England (raising a flag declaring indepen-dence, high enough for the British Army in Boston to see it, ought to do the trick) to the question of whether to remove from the banner the stars emblematic of the states that seceded during the Civil War, to the giddy ubiquity of the flag following World War II. Corcoran addresses all these matters and more (including the particularly vexing questions raised by flag burning: Is it such an affront that it warrants a constitutional amendment outlawing that method of protest, or is it perhaps the single most potent expression of our right to free speech, and therefore profoundly American?) as he delves into the wind-tangled history of \\"Old Glory,\\" an entertaining jumble of much-loved myth and obscure facts. Thoughtful, droll, and fast-paced, For Which It Stands definitively tells the story of America's most recognizable icon, from Bunker Hill to Iwo Jima to Tranquillity Base -- and beyond.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MxgZkW7zinQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Class Actions and Other Multi-Party Litigation: Cases and Materials","description":"This casebook focuses on one of the most important & dynamic areas of modern federal civil practice -- aggregate-party litigation, particularly class actions.

It is also the work that best conveys the ethical and aesthetic core of his thought. Broad in scope, it examines a variety of manifestations of romanticism and presents a typology of the imaginative inclinations of that movement Rousseau is analyzed as paradigmatic of the ethical and aesthetic sensibility that is replacing the classical and Christian outlook in the Western world. For Babbitt, works of imagination are integral to human life in general. He explores romanticism with a view to its implications for Western civilization. Babbitt identifies serious ethical, religious, aesthetic, and philosophical problems in the modern world, but he also shows how remedies to those problems must incorporate the best insights of modernity. First published in 1919, the book is strikingly relevant to today's discussion of the crisis of American and Western culture and education. Babbitt anticipated and analyzed dangerous cultural trends whose consequences are now widely bemoaned. He applies to these phenomena an intellectual breadth and depth rare today. At the end of the twentieth century his prescriptions for dealing with the central problems of Western civilization have acquired an acute urgency. At a time of much renewed interest in Rousseau, Babbitt's book offers a penetrating commentary that challenges widely held beliefs and interpretations. Graced with a lengthy and wide-ranging new introduction by Claes G. Ryn, Rousseau and Romanticism is simultaneously a work of literary history, criticism, and a theory of civilization. In addressing its special subject, this classic study reflects the main themes of Babbitt's thought, making it representative of his work as a whole. Ryn explicates and critically assesses Babbitt's central ideas, refutes widely circulating misinterpretations, and demonstrates the relevance of his writing in the intellectual and cultural circumstances of today.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CTTqtAEACAAJ&dq=Rousseau+and+romanticism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gypsy Cante: Deep Song of the Caves (Spanish and English Edition)","description":"\\"Over the course of centuries, Andalusian Gypsies developed cante jondo, or deep song, an art that grew out of the experience of exile and marginalization. The striking imagery and emotional purity of cante lyrics were inspiration for Federico Garcia Lorca and his generation of Spanish poets.\\" \\"Like American blues, cante is a brilliant cultural legacy long kept alive and aflame by unlettered geniuses. Although flamenco music enjoys wide popularity today, the words of the songs are often lost in the passion of the performance, or because they are sung in dialect. This volume brings together a bilingual sampling of lyrics and brief remarks about them by notable flamenco aficionados.\\"--Jacket.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KJ1dAAAAMAAJ&dq=Gypsy+Cante:+Deep+Song+of+the+Caves+(Spanish+and+English+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rites and Religions of the Anglo-Saxons","description":"This book traces the development of religious beliefs in Anglo-Saxon engliand, an dthe influence of religion upon everyday life.

Does it have to attract conscious attention in order to transmit a  Unique Selling Proposition ? Or does it insinuate emotional associations into the subconscious mind? Or is it just about being famous... or maybe something else? In Paul Feldwick s radical new view, all theories of how advertising works have their uses  and all are dangerous if they are taken too literally as the truth. The Anatomy of Humbug deftly and entertainingly picks apart the historical roots of our common  and often contradictory  beliefs about advertising, in order to create space for a more flexible, creative and effective approach to this fascinating and complex field of human communication. Drawing on insights ranging from the nineteenth-century showman P.T. Barnum to the twentieth-century communications theorist Paul Watzlawick, as well as influential admen such as Bernbach, Reeves and Ogilvy, Feldwick argues that the advertising industry will only be able to deal with increasingly rapid change in the media landscape if it both understands its past and is able to criticise its most entrenched habits of thought. The Anatomy of Humbug is an accessible business book that will help advertising and marketing professionals create better campaigns.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=x_dCBgAAQBAJ&dq=Humbug&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Language of Color","description":"In this beautiful and thorough investigation, The Secret Language of Color celebrates and illuminates the countless ways in which color colors our world. Why is the sky blue, the grass green, a rose red?

Between these chapters, authors Joann Eckstut and Ariele Eckstut turn their attention to the individual hues of the visible spectrum?red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet?presenting each in fascinating, in-depth detail. Including hundreds of stunning photographs and dozens of informative, often entertaining graphics, every page is a breathtaking demonstration of color and its role in the world around us.

In the first novella, Gass redefines Descartes' philosophy. God is a writer in a constant state of fumble. Mind is represented by a housewife who is a modern-day Cassandra. And Matter is, what (and who) else but the helpless and confused husband of Mind. In the novella that follows, the concept of salvation is explored through material possessions--a collection of kitsch--as a traveling businessman is slowly lost in the sheer surfeit of matter in a small Illinois town. In another, Gass explores the mind's ability to escape. A young woman growing up in ruralIowa finds herself losing touch with the physical world as she loses herself in the poetry of Elizabeth Bishop. And in \\"The Master of Secret Revenges,\\" God appears in the form of Descartes' evil demon, Lucifer, as Gass chronicles the life of a young man named Luther and his development from his devilish youth to his demonic adulthood. A profound exploration of good and evil, philosophy and action, filled with the wit and style that have defined the work of William Gass.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tZwTAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Contemplations on the historical passages of the Old and New Testaments","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UDUJAAAAQAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"McGuffey's newly revised eclectic primer: With pictorial illustrations (Eclectic educational series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=U3xitAEACAAJ&dq=McGuffey%27s+newly+revised+eclectic+primer:+With+pictorial+illustrations+(Eclectic+educational+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Preparing for Battle: A Spiritual Warfare Workbook","description":"Don't let Satan have victory in your life.

Kate Stone was twenty when the war began, living with her widowed mother, five brothers, and younger sister at Brokenburn, their plantation home in northeastern Louisiana. When Grant moved against Vicksburg, the family fled before the invading armies, eventually found refuge in Texas, and finally returned to a devastated home. Kate began her journal in May, 1861, and made regular entries up to November, 1865. She included briefer sketches in 1867 and 1868. In chronicling her everyday activities, Kate reveals much about a way of life that is no more: books read, plantation management and crops, maintaining slaves in the antebellum period, the attitude and conduct of slaves during the war, the fate of refugees, and civilian morale. Without pretense and with almost photographic clarity, she portrays the South during its darkest hours.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kfiCyYcF0HoC&dq=Brokenburn:+The+Journal+of+Kate+Stone,+1861-1868&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Cathedral","description":"In this wise and inspiring book, social entrepreneur Bill Shore shows us how to make the most of life and do something that counts.

Over the years, business executives and academics from the industrialized world seldom paid serious attention to South America for its market potential. The ratification in 1994 of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) among the United States, Canada, and Mexico awakened them to look to the south of the US border. Then exactly one year later, on January 1, 1995, MERCOSUR (Mercado Com n del Sur) went into effect among the four countries in the Southern Cone region of South America - Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Subsequently, in June 1996, Chile and Bolivia agreed to join MERCOSUR, extending the frontiers of the South American trading bloc. Chile's participation took effect on October 1 1996, and Bolivia's formal association with MERCOSUR began on January 1, 1997. Indeed, MERCOSUR's goal is to incorporate all South American countries by 2005 before linking up with NAFTA.

More than one hundred and fifty years following the original publication of Moby-Dick, Kish began illustrating Herman Melville s classic, creating an image a day over the next eighteen months based on text selected from every page of the 552-page Signet Classics paperback edition. Completely self-taught, Kish refused to set any boundaries for the artwork and employed a deliberately low-tech approach in response to the increasing popularity of born-digital art and literature. He used found pages torn from old, discarded books, as well as a variety of mediums, including ballpoint pen, marker, paint, crayon, ink, and watercolor. By layering images on top of existing words and images, Kish has crafted a visual masterpiece that echoes the layers of meaning in Melville s narrative.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PHmz1VInl2YC&dq=Frank+Stella%27s+Moby-Dick:+Words+and+Shapes.(Book+Review):+An+article+from:+Leviathan&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Saints","description":"Book of SaintsWho are the saints, why are the lives of saints important for children, and what can children learn from lives and actions?

They soon separate, Lucy (guidebook in hand) in quest of authentic cultural experience on the mainland while Conrad searches a tourist island for an infamous brothel. From the outset, both expeditions are in danger of devolving into farce. Conrad, torn between his staid, paternal nature and his desire to play the libertine in this tropical setting, finds himself caught in a strange vortex of sexual and power politics, stumbling upon \\"authentic\\" experiences he'd sought to avoid. At the same time, Lucy's internal compass sends her on adventures quite beyond the parameters of her carefully plotted itinerary, forcing her to confront realities at odds with the romantic portrait promoted by her guidebook.

That magic and wonder are vividly depicted in this marvelous collection of authentic folktales. For the Hopis, the spoken or sung word can have a magical effect on others. Witchcraft?the wielding of magic for selfish purposes by a powaqa, or sorcerer?has long been a powerful, malevolent force. Sorcerers are said to have the ability to change into animals such as a crow, a coyote, a bat, or a skeleton fly, and hold their meetings in a two-tiered kiva to the northeast of Hopi territory. Shamanism, the more benevolent but equally powerful use of magic for healing, was once commonplace but is no longer practiced among the Hopis. Shamans, or povosyaqam, often used animal familiars and quartz crystals to help them to see, diagnose, and cure illnesses. Spun through these tales are supernatural beings, otherworldly landscapes, magical devices and medicines, and shamans and witches. One story tells about a man who follows his wife one night and discovers that she is a witch, while another relates how a jealous woman uses the guise of an owl to make a rival woman's baby sick. Other tales include the account of a boy who is killed by kachinas and then resurrected as a medicine man and the story of a huge rattlesnake, a giant bear, and a mountain lion that forever guard the entrance to Maski, the Land of the Dead.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dZAhJVoyRFUC&dq=Hopi+Stories+of+Witchcraft,+Shamanism,+and+Magic&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hanaialii","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=82_xAAAAMAAJ&dq=Hanaialii&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Studio Collotype: Continuous Tone Printing for the Artist, Printmaker and Photographer","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=idZTAAAAMAAJ&dq=Studio+Collotype:+Continuous+Tone+Printing+for+the+Artist,+Printmaker+and+Photographer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hilary Knight's the Twelve Days of Christmas","description":"A young bear's true love brings more and more gifts on each of the twelve days of Christmas.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UShaAAAAYAAJ&dq=Hilary+Knight%27s+the+Twelve+Days+of+Christmas&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mine Enemy","description":"Reassessing the history of the Civil War, a leading historian chronicles the path to war in the Great Valley spanning Pennsylvania and Virginia, capturing the experience of war in this borderland in the lives of both everyday people and the individuals who changed the course of American history.

Annemarie Colbin, author of Food and Healing The promise and mystery of Chinese medicine has intrigued and fascinated Westerners ever since the  Bamboo Curtain  was lifted in the early 1970s. Now, in Between Heaven and Earth, two of the foremost American educators and healers in the Chinese medical profession demystify this centuries-old approach to health. Harriet Beinfeld and Efrem Korngold, pioneers in the practice of acupuncture and herbal medicine in the United States for over eighteen years, explain the philosophy behind Chinese medicine, how it works and what it can do. Combining Eastern traditions with Western sensibilities in a unique blend that is relevant today, Between Heaven and Earth addresses three vital areas of Chinese medicine theory, therapy, and types to present a comprehensive, yet understandable guide to this ancient system. Whether you are a patient with an aggravating complaint or a curious intellectual seeker, Between Heaven and Earth opens the door to a vast storehouse of knowledge that bridges the gap between mind and body, theory and practice, professional and self-care, East and West.

In Jefferson's Secrets Andrew Burstein focuses on Jefferson's last days to create an emotionally powerful portrait of the uncensored private citizen who was also a giant of a man. Drawing on sources previous biographers have glossed over or missed entirely, Burstein uncovers, first and foremost, how Jefferson confronted his own mortality; and in doing so, he reveals how he viewed his sexual choices. Delving into Jefferson's soul, Burstein lays bare the president's thoughts about his own legacy, his predictions for American democracy, and his feelings regarding women and religion. The result is a moving and surprising work of history that sets a new standard, post-DNA, for the next generation's reassessment of the most evocative and provocative of this country's founders.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=w63e2XlWuw4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The German campaigns in the Balkans (spring, 1941) (CMH pub)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NymFacfYFaAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"If you can't be good (The Perennial Library mystery series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PMzpAAAACAAJ&dq=If+you+can%27t+be+good+(The+Perennial+Library+mystery+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Secrets of Ten Great Geniuses","description":"From the bestselling author of Thinkertoys, this follow up brings innovative creative thinking techniques within reach, giving you the tools to tackle everyday challenges in new ways.

Among the central themes is the seeming contradiction between the second law of thermodynamics and the high degree of order and complexity produced by living systems. This paradox has its resolution in the information content of the Gibbs free energy that enters the biosphere from outside sources, as the author will show. The role of information in human cultural evolution is another focus of the book. The first edition of Information Theory and Evolution made a strong impact on thought in the field by bringing together results from many disciplines. The new second edition offers updated results based on reports of important new research in several areas, including exciting new studies of the human mitochondrial and Y-chromosomal DNA. Another extensive discussion featured in the second edition is contained in a new appendix devoted to the relationship of entropy and Gibbs free energy to economics. This appendix includes a review of the ideas of Alfred Lotka, Frederick Soddy, Nicholas Georgiescu-Roegen and Herman E. Daly, and discusses the relevance of these ideas to the current economic crisis. The new edition discusses current research on the origin of life, the distinction between thermodynamic information and cybernetic information, new DNA research and human prehistory, developments in current information technology, and the relationship between entropy and economics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XbqwAam_2y4C&dq=Information+Theory+and+Evolution&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Life of Michelangelo","description":"The fame and influence of Michelangelo Buonarroti (14751564) were as immediate as they were unprecedented. It is not surprising, therefore, that he was the only living artist Giorgio Vasari included in the first edition of Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors and Architects, published in 1550. Revised and expanded in 1568, Vasari s monumental work comprises more than two hundred biographies; for centuries it has been recognized as a seminal text in art history and one of the most important sources on the Italian Renaissance. Vasari s biography of Michelangelo, the longest in his Lives, presents Michelangelo s oeuvre as the culminating achievement of Renaissance painting, sculpture, and architecture. He tells the grand story of the artist s expansive career, profiling his working habits; describing the creation of countless masterpieces, from the David to the Sistine Chapel ceiling; and illuminating his relationships with popes and other illustrious patrons. A lifelong friend, Vasari also quotes generously from the correspondence between the two men; the narrative is further enhanced by an abundance of colorful anecdotes. The volume s forty-two illustrations convey the range and richness of Michelangelo s art. An introduction by the scholar David Hemsoll traces the textual development of Vasari s Lives and situates his biography of Michelangelo in the broader context of Renaissance art history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4PI9DwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Life+of+Michelangelo&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rubens Drawings: 44 Plates (Dover Fine Art, History of Art)","description":"A generous selection of Rubens' best drawings, chiefly portraits and religious and mythical scenes, that fully reveal his supreme artistic gifts.

In such a situation, the mission of evangelism cannot succeed with an attitude of -business as usual.- This volume builds a theology of evangelism that has its focus on the church itself. Darrell Guder shows that the church's missionary calling requires that the theology and practice of evangelism be fundamentally rethought and redirected, focused on the continuing evangelization of the church so that it can carry out its witness faithfully in today's world. In Part 1 Guder explores how, under the influence of reductionism and individualism, the church has historically moved away from a biblical theology of evangelism. Part 2 presents contemporary challenges to the church's evangelical ministry, especially those challenges that illustrate the church's need for continuing conversion. Part 3 discusses what a truly missional theology would mean for the church, including sweeping changes in its institutional structures and practices. Written for teachers, church leaders, and students of evangelism, this volume is vital reading for everyone engaged in mission work.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=X8uABQJQ0ukC&dq=The+conversion+of+the+church,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I Do!

While The Lord of the Rings took the world by storm, Fritz Leiber s fantastic but thoroughly flawed antiheroes, Fafhrd and Gray Mouser, adventured and stumbled deep within the caves of Inner Earth as well. They wondered and wandered to the edges of the Outer Sea, across the Land of Nehwon, and throughout every nook and cranny of gothic Lankhmar, Nehwon s grandest and most mystically corrupt city. Lankhmar, is Leiber s fully realized, vivid incarnation of urban decay and civilization s corroding effect on the human psyche. Fafhrd and Mouse are not innocents; their world is no land of honor and righteousness. It is a world of human complexities and violent action, of discovery and mystery, of swords and sorcery. Swords Against Death, the second volume in the Lankhmar series, finds Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser beginning their real journey. Their hearts altered by the loss of first true love, they embark on a long and winding path of drunken debauchery and womanizing until crossing paths with two cross wizards, Sheelba of the Eyeless Face and Ningauble of the Seven Eyes. A most violent of clashes ensues. Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser descend into Thieves House to discover the exacting skill of the united backstabbing Thieves of Lankhmar and their rival guild, the Slayer s Brotherhood, the city s unionized killers. They would wander along the Bleak Shore to a howling tower to show how fear is not the product of murder but the cause. Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser must resume their plundering and drunken debauchery until once again darkness had taken the balance for its favor and then a change would come. These are just a few of the encounters our swindling swordsmen will willingly endure in ridding their hearts of their first true loves. But did they know it would make them indentured swordsman servants to their former foes, the formidable Sheelba and Ningauble?","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MOgoAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"GROWING WINGS TO OVERCOME GRAVITY","description":"Writers of novels, plays, and poems use their imagination with an evident freedom; by contrast, makers of Christian doctrine seem to impose limits, reducing the open-ended meaning of images to exact concepts and summing up the loose ends of stories in one unified Story. But the author of this study sets out to show how images and stories in literature can actually help the theologian to make doctrinal statements, while at the same time careful theological thinking can assist the critical reading of literary texts. Such a dialogue is worked out in studies of the poetry, of William Blake and Gerard Manley Hopkins, and the novels of D. H. Lawrence, Iris Murdoch, and William Going. Here the tension between the freedom of imagination and the limits of doctrine is seen to be only a part of more far-reaching tensions of freedom in human life, which account for a sense of 'fallenness', and which a dialogue between literature and Christian doctrine can do much to illuminate. In all this, the relationship between imagination and revelation is never far from the center of the discussion.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=t-9YAAAAMAAJ&dq=GROWING+WINGS+TO+OVERCOME+GRAVITY&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Measuring the Impact of Your Web Site","description":"Adeptly address today s business challenges with this powerful new book from web analytics thought leader Avinash Kaushik.

Beard","description":"Charles A. Beard (1874-1948) was one of America's most influential historians and political scientists. He played a major role in founding the disciplines of history and political science, helped shape the teaching of social studies in the nation's public schools, and was one the nation's most popular public intellectuals. Yet in the second half of the twentieth century, Beard's reputation has been eroded by relentless criticism. Clyde W. Barrow argues that Beard's work has renewed relevance in light of recent theoretical debates about the new institutionalism, the crisis of the welfare state, and American foreign policy messianism. Barrow's takes Beard seriously as a political theorist, while challenging many misconceptions. For example, Beard's method of economic interpretation has been dismissed as Marxist, but Barrow carefully reconstructs the sources of Beard's thinking to demonstrate that his method owes more to historical and institutional economics and that his concept of state-society relations was in fact derived from Madison's Tenth Federalist. Barrow reconstructs Beard's theory of American political development using his concept of realistic dialectics, which viewed the clash between democracy (Jeffersonianism) and capitalism (Hamiltonianism) as the engine of American political development. During the 1930s, Beard suggested that the United States was making the transition to a higher form of social and industrial democracy that would supersede the contradiction of American political development. Notably, Beard was a critic of the New Deal and the liberal welfare state, because they failed to reconstruct the economic relations that reproduce inequalities of income, status, and power.Beard went on to voice his concern that at crucial junctures in American history, class struggle is diverted into international conflicts as popular leaders back down from a direct confrontation with the dominant capitalist elite. He analyzes American foreign policy as an extension of domestic economic policy and, in particular, a result of the failures of domestic economic policy. Beard's conception of American history plays itself out in a tragic cycle of imperialism and diversion that left him a disenchanted realist. This incisive study will be of interest to those intrested in the evolution of historical thinking.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fSFWDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Chinese Looking Glass.","description":"The author interweaves his personal experiences in China with a discussion of the history, culture, and present situation of the Chinese people and the factors that have formed the Chinese character","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PTViZGaNecwC&dq=The+Chinese+Looking+Glass.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Trouble Becomes Her","description":"Getting ready to testify as the key witness in a sensational Hollywood murder trial, Sally Harrington, who has just obtained her dream job at DBS News in New York, is upset when her new boss pressures her to use her \\"in\\" to produce a special news series--an assignment that plunges her into a world of trouble.

Neumann was one of the only early Frankfurt School thinkers to examine seriously the problem of political institutions. After the rise of the Nazis to power, his emphasis shifted to an analysis of economic power, and then after the war to political psychology. But his contributions in Behemoth were groundbreaking: that the Nazi organization of society involved the collapse of traditional ideas of the state, of ideology, of law, and even of any underlying rationality. The book must be studied, not simply read, Raul Hilberg wrote. The most experienced researchers will tell us that the scarcest commodity in academic life is an original idea.

Across four sections it explores the relevance and responsibility of art to the real world ? to the significant teaching and learning, performance and practice, theory and economies that not only expand the discussion of literature and theatre, but also open the gates of engagement between the life of the mind and lived experience. The collection draws from noted scholars, writers and practitioners from around the globe to assert the power of art to question, disrupt and re-invigorate both the ties that bind and the barriers that divide us. A series of interviews with theatre practitioners and scholars opens the volume, establishing an initial portfolio of areas for research, exploration, and change. In Section 2 'The Practice of Shakespeare and Social Justice' contributors examine Shakespeare's place and possibilities in intervening on issues of race, class, gender and sexuality. Section 3 'The Performance of Shakespeare and Social Justice' traces Shakespeare and social justice in multiple global contexts; engaging productions grounded in the politics of Mexico, India, South Africa, China and aspects of Asian politics broadly, this section illuminates the burgeoning field of global production while keeping as a priority the political structures that make advocacy and resistance possible. The last section on 'Economies of Shakespeare' describes socio-economic and community issues that come to light in Shakespeare, and their potential to catalyse ongoing discussion and change in respect to wealth, distribution, equity, and humanity. An annotated bibliography provides further guidance to those researching the subject.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IIMEEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The inside of the cup,","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"God Lives Next Door (IlluminationBook)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8R3wDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gettin' Old Ain't For Wimps","description":"Speaker and author Karen O'Connor urges her post-fifty friends to \\"laugh and love all the way home to the Father's house.\\" With humor and wisdom, Karen shares personal and gathered stories about the blessings of surviving and surpassing middle-age.

John D. Caputo undertakes a passionate, poetic, and satiric search for the basis of an ethics in the postmodern situation. Restaging Kierkegaard s Fear and Trembling, Caputo defends the notion of obligation without ethics, of responsibility without the support of ethical foundations. Retelling the story of Abraham and Isaac, he strikes the pose of a postmodern-day Johannes de Silentio, accompanied by communications from such startling figures as Johanna de Silentio, Felix Sineculpa, and Magdalena de la Cruz. In dialogue with the thought of Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Derrida, and Lyotard, Caputo forges a challenging, original account of what is possible and what is not possible for a continentalist ethics today.  Against Ethics is a bold work. . . . A counterethics whose multiple voices will be heard long after the trivializing arguments of many analytic ethicists have vanished and the arcane formulations of many postmoderns have been jettisoned.

Set in the American West, the Gunslinger, his talking horse Claude L vi-Strauss, a saloon madam named Lil, and the narrator called  I  set out in search of the billionaire Howard Hughes. As they travel along the Rio Grande to Truth or Consequences, New Mexico, and finally on to Colorado, they are joined by a whole host of colorful characters: Dr. Jean Flamboyant, Kool Everything, and Taco Desoxin and his partner Tonto Pronto. During their adventures and hijinks, as captured in Dorn s multilayered, absurd, and postmodern voice, they joke and smoke their way through debates about the meaning of existence. Put simply, Gunslinger is an American classic. In a new foreword Marjorie Perloff discusses Gunslinger's continued relevance to contemporary politics. This new edition also includes a critical essay by Michael Davidson and Charles Olson s idiosyncratic  Bibliography on America for Ed Dorn,  which he wrote to provide guidance for Dorn's study of, and writing about, the American West.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BS5qDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Testing Client/Server Systems (Client/Serving Computing)","description":"\\"By incorporating systematic controls throughout the development process, the methods in Client-Server Software Testing on the Desktop and the Web can help any organization save time and money while building in quality for distributed systems.\\"--BOOK JACKET.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SGstAQAAMAAJ&dq=Testing+Client/Server+Systems+(Client/Serving+Computing)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Film Scriptwriting: A Practical Manual","description":"This second edition of the widely acclaimed Film Scriptwriting is a truly practical manual for the working writer.

Watson was a figure alternately eminent and notorious. Born before the Civil War, he lived through the turn of the century and past the close of the First World War, pursuing his career in an era as changing and paradoxical as himself. In the nineteenth century, Watson championed the rising Populist movement, an interracial alliance of agricultural interests, against the irresistible forces of industrial capitalism. The movement was broken under the wheels of the industrial political machine, but survived into the twentieth century in various  fantastic shapes...to be understood mainly by the psychology of frustration.  Political frustration transformed Watson as well, from liberal to racial bigot and from popular spokesman to mob leader. In this biography, through careful study of public and private writings, and through objective and tolerant exposition, Mr. Woodward has attempted to solve the enigma of this man who did much to alter his times and who was, in turn, altered by them.  Mr. Woodward s biography of Watson is a model of its kind. It has all the obvious qualities of scholarship, thoroughness and impartiality. It has, in addition, a sympathetic understanding of broad social movements, a mature appreciation of character, an original interpretation of economic facts and factors, an incisive criticism of political techniques, and a literary style that is always vigorous and sometimes brilliant.  H. S. Commager, New York Herald Tribune Books  Mr. Woodward s biography of Watson constitutes the best one-volume history that has appeared of that first crop of social ideals, politically garnered in Populism...Mr. Woodward s biography is also valuable in that it is something more than the story of Populism. It is a striking portrait of a man.  W. A.

Philip Ennis presents a major social and cultural study of the origins and evolution of \\"rocknroll.\\" With masterful command of general trends and telling details, he describes the artistic, economic, and political context that nurtured this radically new popular music. This \\"seventh stream,\\" which drew from existing forms of pop music, began as a youth movement of rebellion and remains a worldwide banner of youth in search of alternatives. \\"Rocknroll\\" emerged, he shows persuasively, from the successive meeting and melding of the other six \\"streams\\" pop, black pop, country pop, jazz, folk, and gospel. He chronicles how these were shaped by struggles over musical property rights, and by the new technologies of radio and phonograph record. The most decisive clash was between the New York based music publishers and the radio broadcasters. Their decades long contest resulted in many cultural changes. The basic unit shifted from sheet music to the phonograph record. The radio disc jockey in small, independent radio stations became the new focal point for all the popular musics. New venues, audiences, and talent appeared throughout the nation. The appearance of \\"rocknroll\\" marked a significant cultural moment, argues Ennis. This \\"seventh stream\\" was part of an explosive efflorescence in all the American arts after World War II. Its early stars Little Richard, Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Elvis Presley built a pantheon of performers with deep roots in all the other streams.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dwJ4pa36cYkC&dq=The+Seventh+Stream:+The+Emergence+of+Rocknroll+in+American+Popular+Music&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Women and economics;: A study of the economic relation between men and women as a factor in social evolution,","description":"\\"Women and Economics\\" is a book written by Charlotte Perkins Gilman and published in 1898. It is considered by many to be her single greatest work, and as with much of Gilman's writing, the book touched a few dominant themes: the transformation of marriage, the family, and the home, with her central argument: \\"the economic independence and specialization of women as essential to the improvement of marriage, motherhood, domestic industry, and racial improvement.\\" The 1890s were a period of intense political debate and economic challenges, with the Women's Movement seeking the vote and other reforms. Women were \\"entering the work force in swelling numbers, seeking new opportunities, and shaping new definitions of themselves.\\" It was near the end of this tumultuous decade that Gilman's very popular book emerged. Charlotte Perkins Gilman (1860-1935) was a prominent American feminist, sociologist, novelist, writer of short stories, poetry, and nonfiction, and a lecturer for social reform.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DGVODwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hunting for Hidden Gold (Hardy Boys, Book 5)","description":"Investigating a payroll robbery, Frank and Joe encounter timber wolves and a mine cave-in","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ikEKDfbb_WwC&dq=Hunting+for+Hidden+Gold+(Hardy+Boys,+Book+5)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kaplan AP Biology, Second Edition","description":"Kaplan's AP Biology Prep Plus 2020 & 2021 is revised to align with the 2020 exam changes.

The armies of Philip H. Sheridan and Jubal A. Early contended for immense stakes. Beyond the agricultural bounty and the boost in morale a victory would bring, events in the Valley also would affect Abraham Lincoln's chances for reelection in the November 1864 presidential canvass. The eleven original essays in this volume reexamine common assumptions about the campaign, its major figures, and its significance. Taking advantage of the most recent scholarship and a wide range of primary sources, contributors examine strategy and tactics, the performances of key commanders on each side, the campaign's political repercussions, and the experiences of civilians caught in the path of the armies. The authors do not always agree with one another, yet, taken together, their essays highlight important connections between the home front and the battlefield, as well as ways in which military affairs, civilian experiences, and politics played off one another during the campaign.

When she falls into a crevasse, she finds she has followed her uncle farther than she thought-to Norchester, England, in 1657. Times are dark: the ruling Puritans have beheaded the king and prohibited song, dance, and even Christmas. Though she passes as a boy with her short hair and pants, local official Noah Fallam is still suspicious of her strange clothing and outspokenness. Luckily, she soon finds her uncle, and another man: the Raven, a bandit who provides for the poor through smuggling and robbery. The unlikely couple fall in love, and Lydde must decide where-and when-she belongs.

In this radically different scientific investigation of a process that ends, literally, in the putrefaction of the living body due to chronic suffocatin of the tissues, Reich has arrived at the conclusion that \\"cancer is the most significant somatic expression of biophysiological effect of sexual stasis.\\" If this is so, there is a far greater possibility for prevention of cancer than for its treatment.

Never conquered and taking its enduring independence as a sign of divine favor, free of civil strife and proud of its internal stability, Venice broadcast the image of itself as the Most Serene Republic, an ideal state whose ruling patriciate were selflessly devoted to the commonweal. All this has come to be known as the \\"myth of Venice.\\" Exploring the imagery developed in Venice to represent the legends of its origins and legitimacy, David Rosand reveals how artists such as Gentile and Giovanni Bellini, Carpaccio, Titian, Jacopo Sansovino, Tintoretto, and Veronese gave enduring visual form to the myths of Venice. He argues that Venice, more than any other political entity of the early modern period, shaped the visual imagination of political thought. This visualization of political ideals, and its reciprocal effect on the civic imagination, is the larger theme of the book.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=X4xGDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sense of Direction : The Director and His Actors (SD 13)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=X5lBAQAAIAAJ&dq=Sense+of+Direction+:+The+Director+and+His+Actors+(SD+13)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"English Thought in the Nineteenth Century","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CqRFzQEACAAJ&dq=English+Thought+in+the+Nineteenth+Century&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rand McNally 2007 Road Atlas: United States-Large Scale (Rand Mcnally Large Scale Road Atlas USA)","description":"Overview Give road-weary eyes a break with this spiral-bound Large Scale edition featuring all the accuracy you've come to expect from Rand McNally, only bigger.

This book examines the reality behind the often hysterical media coverage of the topic. Drawing on extensive new research findings, it examines how child pornography is used on the Internet and the social context in which such use occurs, and develops a model of offending behaviour to better help understand and deal with the processes of offending. Detailed case studies and offenders' own accounts are used to illustrate the processes involved in offending and treatment. The authors argue that we need to refine our ideas of offending, and that while severe deterrents need to be associated with possession of child pornography, a better understanding is needed of the links between possession and committing a contact offence. Only by improving our understanding of this complex and very controversial topic can we hope to deal effectively with offenders and with their child victims. This is a book which will become an essential read for anyone involved with offenders or victims from a psychological, judicial or social background.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=swuOAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"French Bulldogs","description":"These small lap dogs will warm your heart.

Most North Indian Buddhist texts are composed in it. It is based primarily on an old Middle Indic vernacular not otherwise identifiable. But there seems reason to believe that it contains features that were borrowed from other Middle Indic dialects. In other words, even its Middle Indic aspects are dialectically somewhat mixed. Most strikingly, however, BHS was also extensively influenced by Sanskrit from the very beginning of the tradition as it has been transmitted to us, and increasingly as time went on. Many (especially later) products of this tradition have often, though misleadingly, been called simply 'Sanskrit', without qualification. In principle, the author has excluded from the grammar and dictionary all forms which are standard Sanskrit, and all words which are used in standard Sanskrit with the same meanings.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wOJSEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Alabama whitetail records: The Alabama record book for whitetail deer","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=j2dfPQAACAAJ&dq=Alabama+whitetail+records:+The+Alabama+record+book+for+whitetail+deer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Fabricated Mexican","description":"Pages:1 to 25 -- Pages:26 to 50 -- Pages:51 to 75 -- Pages:76 to 100 -- Pages:101 to 125 -- Pages:126 to 150 -- Pages:151 to 168","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lqfLqZb26-sC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Hardy Review","description":"Brief description of The Hardy Review The Hardy Review is a publication of The Thomas Hardy Association and the premier journal devoted to the scholarly study of Thomas Hardy.

Noted track writer B. K. Beckwith called Seabiscuit s career a saga because, like a Greek myth or beloved fairy tale, it is the tale of a forgotten, abused animal who was rescued, fought his way to the top of horse racing, stumbled, and then returned for a spectacular victory. First published in 1940, when Seabiscuit and all the major characters were alive, its pages sparkle with stories about the great horse: the moment when trainer Tom Smith noticed the emaciated bay in a cheap claims race at Saratoga Springs, the events that led Charles Howard to take a chance and buy the  raced-out  three-year old colt with bad legs, and the exhilarating accounts from jockeys Red Pollard and George  Iceman  Woolf of Seabiscuit s trademark bursts of speed. Under Smith s training and care, Seabiscuit would defeat the Triple Crown champion, War Admiral, by four lengths in the most famous match race in history. Featuring period photographs and specially commissioned artwork by Howard Brodie, Seabiscuit: The Saga of a Great Champion follows the thoroughbred s illustrious career, from his humble birth in Kentucky to his remarkable string of races across the country from 1936 to 1940, and culminating in his stunning victory at Santa Anita, a moment that confirmed Seabiscuit as one of the greatest racehorses of all time.  His courage, honesty, and physical prowess definitely place him among the thoroughbred immortals of turf history. He has intelligence and understanding almost spiritual in quality, and all of us who are close to  Biscuit  naturally have the deepest affection for him.  Charles S.

Forgiveness is most powerful when a woman reaches midlife: a natural time for reflection when she stands at a biological and emotional crossroads. In this groundbreaking book the first of its kind for women acclaimed therapist Tian Dayton shows women how assessing their lives and forgiving old wounds is as essential to their well-being as proper nutrition and retirement planning. In forgiving, we must work through layers of issues, pain and resentment. Because of this, the process is of great psychological, emotional and spiritual benefit. Left unresolved, past hurts wield their power from within and can contribute to depression and anxiety, undermining the immune system and ultimately opening the door to a multitude of diseases. And harboring resentment prevents us from engaging in deep, meaningful relationships. Through solid research, poignant case studies and personal examples, Dr. Dayton guides women through the sometimes painful but healing process to provide the comfort that may have eluded them for years. This beautifully written book will open women's eyes to the liberating power of forgiveness and provide the ability to find true joy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wDSZDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Magic+of+Forgiveness:+Emotional+Freedom+and+Transformation+at+Midlife,+A+Book+for+Women&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Get ready for battle","description":"The tangled family affairs of a New Delhi businessman, whose cause-hungry wife urges her son to \\"get ready for battle\\" and do something with his life","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DerjugEACAAJ&dq=Get+ready+for+battle&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ma Ma Hu Hu: An Introduction to Chinese Writing","description":"Explains how Chinese writing developed and demonstrates how to write over seventy-five Chinese characters, using detailed instructions and examples.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2SMqGQAACAAJ&dq=Ma+Ma+Hu+Hu:+An+Introduction+to+Chinese+Writing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The New Wood Architecture","description":"A detailed and timely look at the resourceful ways wood is being used in some of the world's most innovative new buildings.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kWMCy5brbCUC&dq=The+New+Wood+Architecture&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Entre objetos, respirando (Coleccion Vitrales de Alejandria) (Spanish Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=L7ffAAAAMAAJ&dq=Entre+objetos,+respirando+(Coleccion+Vitrales+de+Alejandria)+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"PHP Phrasebook","description":"PHP and MySQL Phrasebook gives you the code you need to complete your web programming projects quickly and effectively in PHP, the leading scripting language for creating dynamic web pages.

Partly, no doubt, it is the appeal of his gypsies, childlike and magical, oppressed by the world around; partly too, the work s elemental concerns: machismo, honor, sex, betrayal, revenge, bloodshed, death; partly also, the many echoes of Andalusian popular culture: horsemen and smugglers, fiestas and local saints, legends and superstitions, ballads and deep song. By its dramatic dynamism, its subtle stylisation and its mythical stature, Romancero gitano is one of the most appealing books of poetry in Spanish literature--but it is also one of the most difficult. In his introduction to this edition for English-speaking students, Ramsden considers briefly Lorca s \\"Double break with the past\\" and then concentrates on the \\"Romancero gitano\\" itself, with emphasis on the interplay of immediate appeal and wider resonances. An annotated select bibliography and select glossary are provided with explanatory end notes offering practical guidance, both linguistic and interpretative.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HGCwIQAACAAJ&dq=Romancero+gitano&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Chinese Garden","description":"A  very intelligent, sensitive, and compelling  novel of adolescent rebellion and sexual awakening at a girls  boarding school (Anthony Burgess).

Distill perfume using a method created in ancient Mesopotamia by a woman named Tapputi! Aspiring chemists will discover these and more amazing role models and memorable experiments in Chemistry for Kids, the debut book of The Kitchen Pantry Scientist series. This engaging guide offers a series of snapshots of 25 scientists famous for their work with chemistry, from ancient history through today. Each lab tells the story of a scientist along with some background about the importance of their work, and a description of where it is still being used or reflected in today s world. A step-by-step illustrated experiment paired with each story offers kids a hands-on opportunity for exploring concepts the scientists pursued, or are working on today. Experiments range from very simple projects using materials you probably already have on hand, to more complicated ones that may require a few inexpensive items you can purchase online. Just a few of the incredible people and scientific concepts you'll explore: Galen (b. 129 AD) Make soap from soap base, oil, and citrus peels. Modern application: medical disinfectants Joseph Priestly (b. 1733) Carbonate a beverage using CO2 from yeast or baking soda and vinegar mixture. Modern application: soda fountains Alessandra Volta (b. 1745) Make a battery using a series of lemons and use it to light an LED. Modern application: car battery Tu Youyou (b. 1930) Extract compounds from plants. Modern application: pharmaceuticals and cosmetics People have been tinkering with chemistry for thousands of years. Whether out of curiosity or by necessity, Homo sapiens have long loved to play with fire: mixing and boiling concoctions to see what interesting, beautiful, and useful amalgamations they could create. Early humans ground pigments to create durable paint for cave walls, and over the next 70 thousand years or so as civilizations took hold around the globe, people learned to make better medicines and discovered how to extract, mix, and smelt metals for cooking vessels, weapons, and jewelry. Early chemists distilled perfume, made soap, and perfected natural inks and dyes. Modern chemistry was born around 250 years ago, when measurement, mathematics, and the scientific method were officially applied to experimentation. In 1896, after the first draft of the periodic table was published, scientists rushed to fill in the blanks. The elemental discoveries that followed gave scientists the tools to visualize the building blocks of matter for the first time in history, and they proceeded to deconstruct the atom. Since then, discovery has accelerated at an unprecedented rate. At times, modern chemistry and its creations have caused heartbreaking, unthinkable harm, but more often than not, it makes our lives better. With this fascinating, hands-on exploration of the history of chemistry, inspire the next generation of great scientists.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dW_XDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","description":"Includes a conversation with the author, fan artwork, an excerpt from Six of crows, and the author's The demon in the wood, a Darkling prequel story.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9anzsgEACAAJ&dq=Shadow+Rising+(Turtleback+School&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Psalms: Prayers of Many Moods","description":"The book of Psalms, NSRV version, arranged with a prosaic explanation of each psalm alongside the text of the psalm.

By the age of fifty, Nelson Glueck had excavated remains of the civilization of the ancient Nabataeans in Transjordan, described in detail a biblical copper-mining industry at the shore of the Red Sea, and shown how the Negev could actually support a large population if proper irrigation techniques were used. In addition, Glueck was a personal friend of David Ben-Gurion, Abba Eban, Golda Meir, Henrietta Szold, and Judah Magnes, among other notables worldwide, and became a pioneer in the burgeoning field of biblical archaeology. But Nelson Glueck simultaneously played another academic role. He served a long tenure (1947-1971) as president of the Hebrew Union College and oversaw the merger of HUC with the Jewish Institute of Religion. He expanded the Cincinnati-based institution to include schools in New York, Los Angeles, and Jerusalem. In California he encouraged the creation of the Schools of Jewish Communal Service and Jewish Education.

These adorable, furry marine mammals--often seen floating on their backs holding hands--reveal the health of the coastal ecosystem along the Pacific Ocean. Once hunted for their prized fur during the 1700s and 1800s, these animals nearly went extinct. Only now, nearly a century after hunting ceased, are populations showing stable growth in some places. Sea otters are a keystone species in coastal areas, feeding on sea urchins, clams, crab, and other crustaceans. When they are present, kelp beds are thick and healthy, providing homes for an array of sealife. When otters disappear, sea urchins take over, and the kelp disappears along with all of the creatures that live in the beds. Now, thanks to their protected status, sea otters are making a comeback in California, Washington, and Alaska.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dYcpDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Orlando (World's Classics)","description":"'I feel the need of an escapade after these serious poetic experimental books...I want to kick up my heels & be off.'Orlando tells the tale of an extraordinary individual who lives through centuries of English history, first as a man, then as a woman; of his/her encounters with queens, kings, novelists, playwrights, and poets, and of his/her struggle to find fame and immortality not through actions, butthrough the written word. At its heart are the life and works of Woolf's friend and lover, Vita Sackville-West, and Knole, the historic home of the Sackvilles. But as well as being a love letter to Vita, Orlando mocks the conventions ofbiography and history, teases the pretensions of contemporary men of letters, and wryly examines sexual double standards. This new edition discusses Woolf's stylistic aims, the biographical parallels, and the work's literary context, and includes the original illustrations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BYgbBQAAQBAJ&dq=Orlando+(World%27s+Classics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Haunted Sister","description":"A sixteen-year-old girl suffers a near-death experience in which her twin sister, who died in an accident twelve years before, returns to forcibly share her body.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bKod0nMeswwC&dq=Haunted+Sister&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Training Manual for Total Parenteral Nutrition (Pocket Guides for Medicine)","description":"First multi-year cumulation covers six years: 1965-70.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pH3UlJjMvcgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The works of Shakespeare,","description":"Gathers all of Shakespeare's plays, sonnets, and poems.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=D02LWkkBxn4C&dq=The+works+of+Shakespeare,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Art of Rhetoric (","description":"With the emergence of democracy in the city-state of Athens in the years around 460 BC, public speaking became an essential skill for politicians in the Assemblies and Councils - and even for ordinary citizens in the courts of law. In response, the technique of rhetoric rapidly developed, bringing virtuoso performances and a host of practical manuals for the layman. While many of these were little more than collections of debaters' tricks, the Art of Rhetoric held a far deeper purpose. Here Aristotle (384-322 BC) establishes the methods of informal reasoning, provides the first aesthetic evaluation of prose style and offers detailed observations on character and the emotions. Hugely influential upon later Western culture, the Art of Rhetoric is a fascinating consideration of the force of persuasion and sophistry, and a compelling guide to the principles behind oratorical skill.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qUOerdDyI4MC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Two Faces of Silenus","description":"When the figure in the fountain comes alive, magical things happen to a brother and sister visiting Italy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ACQxtAEACAAJ&dq=The+Two+Faces+of+Silenus&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"One wonderful night: A Romance of New York,","description":"Lady Hermione flees to New York to escape marriage to Count Vassilan, a penniless Frenchman, whom her father, the ne'er-do-well Earl of Vallefort, would like for a son-in-law so that he can manipulate his daughter's maternal inheritance.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=158wEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Early Buddhist Discourses","description":"Twenty discourses from the Pali Canon--including those most essential to the study and teaching of early Buddhism--are provided in fresh translations, accompanied by introductions that highlight the main themes and set the ideas presented in the context of wider philosophical and religious issues.

His fellow New Yorkers either respected or despised him, depending whether they considered his policies beneficial or harmful to their interests. The character revealed herein possessed some admirable qualities; high intelligence, sharp analytic skills, great capacity for hard work, and a clear talent to set his executive agenda. But equally evident are Wood's less admirable qualities; ruthless business practices, shoddy personal ethics, corrupt politics, dictatorial tendencies. What emerges is the story of a very complex person: a successful businessman, consummate politician, resourceful three-time may of New York City, and nine-term congressman, beneath which lurked mean and self-destructive tendencies. Take as a whole, Wood's colorful career was a unique microcosm of American history both during and after his lifetime. His business achievements mirrored popular beliefs in upward mobility. And Wood's mayoralty held a promise of revitalizing municipal government, giving it a social conscience, and setting new standards for the future. Despite his shortcomings, Fernando Wood played a major but unappreciated role in the urban and political history of time.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QLUrBIgCRHEC&dq=Fernando+Wood:+A+Political+Biography&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Utilitarianism (The Great Books Foundation)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5b7CvwEACAAJ&dq=Utilitarianism+(The+Great+Books+Foundation)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"U2: The Ultimate Encyclopedia","description":"Completely revised and expanded new edition of the lavishly illustrated, bestselling U2 reference compendium.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=e66Cykrw1K0C&dq=U2:+The+Ultimate+Encyclopedia&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"20 Marvelous Math Tales (Grades 2-4)","description":"Suggests writing prompts to encourage students in grades 2-4 to write about their math thinking.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2AR5qFGOioAC&dq=20+Marvelous+Math+Tales+(Grades+2-4)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The white woman and her valley","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zsjTAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+white+woman+and+her+valley&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Jameson Reader","description":"This book brings together key essays and excerpts from the broad spectrum of Frederic Jameson's writings, providing an accessible introduction to the intricacies of his thought and uncovering new and exciting aspects of his work.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5PHqYHpGcBAC&dq=The+Jameson+Reader&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Last Scream","description":"Robin Fear has waited decades for this moment.

The first is that Daniel should be understood primarily as a wisdom figure, and that the first chapter of the book of Daniel is programmatic in that regard. The second is that the vision of the one like a son of man represents a theological hinge that guides an understanding of both the tales and the visions as expressions of participation in the divine life on the part of the wise Daniel and his people. The third claim is that the final chapter of Daniel, as the capstone of the wisdom story of Daniel, shows the aim of wise participation in the divine life as an enduring legacy of righteousness in those who encounter this wisdom. These claims are supported by a close reading of aspects of the narrative art on display in the book of Daniel; an exegetical appreciation of the interpretative impact of understanding the faithful wise as expressive of the hopes placed in the temple by the ancient people; and a theological and contextual reading of the experiences of Daniel and his friends-in the daily routines of life in the Babylonian and Persian courts, and in those strange apocalyptic encounters of the later chapters. From such reading there emerges the paradoxical nature of faith as certain hope and ethical clarity alongside mystery and uncertainty and the call to patient endurance. This delicate dance between certainty and patience, clarity and mystery was a feature of the experience of Daniel and his people in their time of exile, of later readers suffering under the heel of Antiochus Epiphanes, of those resisting the claims to lordship on the part of Rome, and still today of readers of the book of Daniel wherever empire is encountered and resisted.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8FYBzgEACAAJ&dq=As+the+Stars+Forever&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"War and the Works of J.R.R.

Ingersoll","description":"As outspoken in his day as Richard Dawkins or Christopher Hitchens are today, ROBERT GREEN INGERSOLL (1833-1899) was a notorious radical whose uncompromising views on religion and slavery (they were bad, in his opinion), women's suffrage (a good idea, he believed), and other contentious matters of his era made him a wildly popular orator and critic of American culture and public life. Legendary as a speaker-he memorized his speeches and could talk for hours without notes-and as a proponent of freethought, Ingersoll is an American original whose words still ring with truth and power today. His most important works are gathered in this 12-volume collected edition, first published posthumously in 1901.
