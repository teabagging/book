Life can get lonely outside the establishment, especially when the reason one is an activist is because of a commitment to the Jewish people and community. Unencumbered by the necessity of being popular, playing the political game, dancing to the funders' tune, or delegating to others, the activist must be encumbered by these principles.One other thing. While Rabbi Weiss is often considered an extremist, rabble-rouser, or carpetbagger by the establishment, this book helps you to understand how and why he does what he does, as well as lessons he's learned and changes he's made. Jewish unity doesn't mean conformity, and the Jewish community is diverse enough, and strong enough, to support different approaches to what are at the root of things, common aims. As Rabbi Weiss writes in Principle Seven:The Jewish Community is a Symphony: We view the Jewish community as a symphony orchestra in which there are drummers, flutists, violinists, and so on. We are drummers, peaceful drummers; our goal is not to drown out the flutists and violinists, but to beat steadily, relentlessly, never stopping, and yes, sometimes sound the alarm loud and clear. When any one of the instruments is missing, there is no symphony. Each one has an important place in the orchestra.Rabbi Weiss is reportedly working on his autobiography. This book provides a glimpse of how interesting that book will be."},{"Title":"Principles of Spiritual Activism","review":"Rabbi Avi Weiss is a courageous Jewish leader who time and again has put himself on the line for his principles.

Remember that L'Amour's works were primarily written in the fifties and sixties and, as a result, have a certain &quot;dignity&quot; about them that no longer applies with the westerns of today, especially those on the big screen.Take THE LONELY MEN for example. There is plenty of action here but it is painted much more subtly on L'Amour's canvass than, let's say, on those of Larry McMurtry or on Clint Eastwood's or Kevin Costner's movie screens. Frankly L'Amour or his readers would not have tolerated the raw, often harsh violence of today's western s offerings.L'Amour wrote with a clear sense of nostalgia and romance about the west. He was much for the kindred spirit of John Wayne and John Ford than of McMurtry, Eastwood or Costner.I thoroughly enjoyed THE LONELY MEN, a Sackett tale of revenge, deceit and, as is the case with all L'Amour tales, of ultimate white-hatted triumph and justice. Tell Sackett is tricked into a dangerous venture in Apache-held country. He and his friends find much more than they bargain for. Read it in the correct mindset and you have a masterpiece.Douglas McAllister"},{"Title":"LONELY MEN (SACKETTS)","review":"This book offers the adventures of six feet three inch William Tell Sackett in the mid-1870's in the borderlands of southern Arizona Territory and eastern Sonora. He and three other 'lonely men', who banded together in Yuma, continue to ride together from Tucson into eastern Sonora and the Sierra Mountain stronghold of rancherias of the Apaches. At least two of the Apaches we meet in the book, Kahtenny and Toclani, were actual people, with Toclani serving as Apache scout with Captain Emmett Crawford, one of the better Army officers who was later killed in error within the Sierra Madre Mountain strongholds by the Mexican Army.Tell Sackett is trying to locate and return his brother Orrin's son from Apache captivity. Two problems here: Orrin has no son, and the Apaches haven't stolen a son that never existed. Through several week's hard riding and hard living, Sackett and the 3 other men riding with him learn that he is following a lie, so they grab all the white children available from the Apaches, trying then to ride and shoot their way back to Tucson.One of the more standout chapters of this book is Chapter 5; wherein Louis L'Amour shares some of his vast knowledge concerning the desert and how to stay alive in it. Lieutenant L'Amour, during his WWII years, had taught a survival course on just these matters and later in civilian life delighted in just taking off getting lost wandering and living in the desert. So the information shared here is information the reader can count on.Two other important people from real life we meet along the way in this novel are Pete Kitchen and William S. Oury. Kitchen is a legendary pioneer in Arizona Territory never allowing the Apache to chase him out as true of so many other Arizona pioneers, and the 'Apache pin cushions' mentioned by Louis are from true life. And Pete Kitchen's ranch was a famous stopping place along the Tucson to Nogales trail. William Oury had once been a noted Texas Ranger, a pioneer rancher, and was at the time of this story, Tucson's first mayor. As Louis stated in another book, many books could be written on these two men alone.One other fact Louis includes in this book concerns the 'deserted ranchos' scattered in eastern Sonora. The Spanish and Mexican ranchers had been fighting the Apaches for many years before the coming of the Americans, and the fight generally went against them. The Apaches from the time of Mangas Coloradas through Cochise pretty much controlled and owned this eastern Sonora area. The Mexican Army early on from the mid-1700's had established what they called \\"presidios\\" or 'bastions of the Spanish borderlands' which were many times themselves also wiped out by the roaming, raiding Apache war parties. The extreme desolation mentioned by L'Amour in his writing in The Lonely Men is quite accurate to the time and place.This is a rather good read with much historical accuracy included, just the discussions of the Shoo-Fly Restaurant operated by Mrs Wallen in Tucson is portrayed exactly as it would have appeared circa 1869. So read and enjoy but also learn some history in this book by the very talented Louis L'Amour."},{"Title":"LONELY MEN (SACKETTS)","review":"Orrin Sackett's treacherous wife sends Tell Sackett on a false rescue mission. He and three of his drifter friends pursue the elusive Apache to save Orrin's kidnapped child.This is a basic white men vs. Apache tale. There are plot twists the reader can easily see coming. The action is fast and violent. The writing is colorful. Tell Sackett's first person narrative rambles in places, but that adds to the Western aura. One can almost visualize Tell weaving engrossing tales to listeners around a crackling campfire. There is irony in men facing suffering and death because of loneliness and a woman's deceit. The &quot;Lonely Men&quot; of the title refers to the four men who band together because they have nothing else of meaning in their lives. The Apaches are portrayed as fierce killers, but also as honorable men who respect a worthy enemy.Louis L'Amour instills new life into the familiar elements of the Western story. His novels and stories stress character and atmosphere over the routine plot elements of &quot;a man, a horse, and a gun.&quot; As with many of his novels, this book serves the purpose of good, lightweight reading. It doesn't require in-depth analysis to get the point. Enjoy the ride. ;-)"},{"Title":"LONELY MEN (SACKETTS)","review":"I have read all but 4 of Mr. L'Amour's (that doesn't include his short stories) and I have to admit this is not his best book but still is earns 5 stars in my opinion.

Two, like L'Amour I am fascinated with the era when the West was being explored and settled. The adventurers who carved civilization out of the wilderness were a commendable stock. Going back to the first feature, this book centers around a manipulative woman who is ruthless in the way she sets up other people for destruction. She plots the deaths of the lead character and 3 of his fellow cowpokes. The acknowledgment of bravery and mutual respect between Tell Sackett and Kahtenny, a leader of the Apaches is a secondary theme. In more than one espisode the two help each other even though they are techincally on opposing sides. This story helps demonstrate how there are various forms of knowledge. Tell Sackett talks of reading the desert like other people read books. Things such as tracks, flora, rock formations all have meaning for the astute observer. The weakness in this and other L'Amour books is the way he disregards the Christian way of life. His character saw it as something to be taken lightly. For Christians it is the only thing that gives meaning to life."},{"Title":"LONELY MEN (SACKETTS)","review":"Over the years I have read all, and posess all, of Louis L'Mour's books.

His son Jeff has written prequels and sequels to his father's famous novel. One of the main characters is Joshua Chamberlain, commander of the 20th Maine Infantry Regiment. James \\"Gus\\" Filigar writes about another member of that regiment, a non-commissioned officer named Nathan Clark.Like Shaara, Filigar writes about people who really lived, so I guess we can describe it as a \\"non-fiction novel\\", a term popularized by Truman Capote. It refers to using the techniques of the novelist to tell a true story. Filigar uses Clark's diary and pension records as well as histories of the regiment and biographies of Chamberlain, who appears in the story from time to time.Born in Ireland, Clark and his family immigrated to the United States in 1848. They eventually settled in Levant, Maine. In 1859, Clark bought his own land and became a farmer in Mesardis, Maine. Sarah Cowperthwait was already working in her uncle's general store there. They were married just before Clark joined the army in 1862. Two of his brothers, Sidney and Prentiss, had joined a cavalry regiment the previous year, and Benjamin, another brother who had been a student of Chamberlain's at Bowdoin College, joined another infantry regiment when he did. His cousin Samuel Witherspoon, whose branch of the family had immigrated to Alabama, was in the Confederate army. At one point in the book they meet up.In July of that year, President Lincoln had called for 300,000 volunteers to join the army for three years to put down the rebellion in the southern states. Clark, his friend George Buck, and 70 other men from Mesardis answered the call, and they became part the 20th Maine Infantry Regiment. With inadequate training, they participated in the Battle of Antietam. Later they fought in the battles of Fredericksburg and Gettysburg. Clark is a corporal during most of the first year of his service. This book ends with Clark and others witnessing the execution of deserters, including a former sergeant in his company, by firing squad.I did not find any historical errors, although I am by no means an expert on the American Civil War. However, I did wonder about the religion of Clark's family, which Filigar fails to mention. They were members of Ireland's tenant farming class, which usually meant Catholic. Nathan and Sarah were married in a protestant service, but no one makes a comment so presumably Nathan was already a protestant. Then, as now, this is a serious issue in Ireland, and I wish Filigar had gone into it, especially since he had been so detailed about every other aspect of their lives.It is this attention to detail that brings me to recommend this novel. It includes everything from the type of socks the soldiers wore to the quality, or lack of it, of the food the army served them. Yet Filigar does not get bogged down with such details or bore the reader with too much information, as many writers do. They never get in the way of the story, which is a fascinating one.Rating: 5"},{"Title":"Fathers, Sons, and Brothers","review":"I had the pleasure of reading an excerpt of this novel during the pre-publication stage and I am delighted that I've been given the opportunity to share with you my feelings about the book. First of all, the vibrant cover of the Union Soldier in front of the Stars and Stripes made this book jump off of the shelves. To look at the cover is to be invited inside to journey back into time.Fathers, Sons and Brothers is a story told from the vantage point of Nathan S. Clark. Clark is an Irish immigrant and patriot that left home soon after his marriage to the woman that he loves to fight for the country in the Civil War. He is a member of the Twentieth Main Infantry Regiment and he is seen as a leader by his superiors from the beginning. He feels that the war is just, even though he does not savor the fact that he will be taking lives, he is determined to carry out his orders.He and his regiment battle the weather, disease and fear as they march towards their objective. His service is dotted with several skirmishes and a first hand view of the horrors of war. However, Gus Filegar will show you the human side of this struggle. With the violence that is a part of any war, he will also show you compassion and mercy for those who take up arms on opposite sides of the battlefield.The writing is extremely descriptive and the vivid details will take you as close to the battle as you would like to go. You see the men charge into battle, you see them fall on the battlefield and you see the medics struggle to piece together the mutilated parts to make the soldiers whole again. You see the sacrifice and feel the pain. You enjoy the small comforts that the men enjoy - such as hot coffee and stale bread. You travel into a world where soldiers die on the battlefield due to the munitions or the biting cold.As you read this you realize that these things actually happened. A country united once to escape from the watchful eye of Great Britain now drawing a line between the North and South and battling for independence from the other's ideals and beliefs. This book has it all and it will pique your curiosity and perhaps you will go on a fact-finding mission to learn more. While on that mission you learn of the plight that every soldier faces as they lay down their lives for a cause and develop a new sense of respect for this \\"career\\".Read this book and digest every word, just as I have, and you will appreciate the level of craftsmanship that this book contains. It is well worth one or two evenings to travel with the Civil War historian Gus Filegar and perhaps understand why he had to write this book. It wasn't just for him; it was for all of us.(...)"},{"Title":"Fathers, Sons, and Brothers","review":"This book accurately and vividly details the life of the common soldier in the Union army during the Civil War. You follow along with Nathan Clark as he lives through the travails of Antietam, Fredricksburg, and Gettysburg. The story is rich with the description of armies on the march, great battles, and the longing for loved ones.Mr. Filegar, aside from being a promising new author, has also been deeply involved in Civil War re-enactments for years, and this is obvious from his writing. Nowhere, have I seen a better, more thorough description of camp life. He has captured the essence of the everyday life of the common foot soldier and set it before the reader to delve into. The humor, the tragedy, the frustration, the hardships, and even the victories overcome you with an emotional impact that leaves you wanting more.The subtitle of this work is \\"Book One\\".

Clark, an Irish immigrant who joins the Twentieth Maine Infantry Regiment in 1862. Just after his marriage to Sarah, Nathan joins many other men from Maine as lumberjacks, fishermen, and farmers journey to Bangor, Maine to answer President Lincoln's call for volunteers. Nathan and his comrades later form the Twentieth Maine Regiment and they are ferried to Virginia by a steamer from Portland.Their commanders, Colonel Adelbert Ames and Lt. Colonel Joshua Chamberlain soon shape Nathan's regiment into a cohesive fighting unit Nathan is soon appointed as a corporal, and the regiment manages to get into a small skirmish after the Battle of Antietam. Nathan's regiment is ordered into action and bloodied at Fredericksburg and the Twentieth Maine later draws guard duty at Chancellorsville. However, their true test of fire comes when they are marched north to just below Gettysburg, where they are ordered to anchor the left side of the Union line at Little Round Top. Nathan becomes the de facto commander of Company H, and his Twentieth Maine Regiment is then attacked by Colonel William Oates' Fifteenth Alabama Regiment. After hard fighting and a gallant bayonet charge, Nathan Clark and the Twentieth Maine win the battle for Little Round Top, but Nathan's friend George Buck is killed at his side in the fight.Gus Filegar puts the reader into the forefront of the battle. Just like Uriah the Hittite, the reader is thrust forward into the fray of combat. You are able to hear the thud of minie balls colliding into human flesh. You can smell the acrid smoke of the battle, and hear the Rebel yell and the popping of musket fire. Filegar places the reader into the shoes of Nathan Clark, a brave citizen soldier. We see the hardships that Nathan and his men face in the volunteer service as they struggle to preserve the Union. Filegar shows us compassion in Nate, as he makes an effort to contact his cousin, Sam Witherspoon, who is taken prisoner at Gettysburg from the Fifteenth Alabama Regiment. I strongly recommend this book to Civil War buffs, and eagerly await the next installment in the series."},{"Title":"The Panda's Thumb: More Reflections in Natural History","review":"First published on 1980, The Panda's Thumb is a collection of slightly edited essays from Professor Gould's monthly column at Natural History Magazine.The thirty one essays are grouped in eight chapters according to their similarities. The Chapters are:Perfection and imperfection: A trilogy on a panda's thumb - that deals with comparative anatomy;Darwiniana - that brings the context of Darwin's revolution and the preceding ideas;Human evolution - that also brings an article on Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse evolution;Science and politics of Human differences - that shows how science used to foster or justify prejudice and sexism.The pace of change - in which Gould introduces his and Niles Eldredge's theory of Punctuated Equilibrium;Early life - a chapter on pre-Cambrian biology or early ideas about pre-Cambrian biology.They were despised and rejected - on evolutionary dead ends or not quite as in the essay about birds descending from dinosaurs and;Size and time.Most essays are very interesting and surprisingly up to date despite the fact that many were written almost thirty years ago. The essays can be read one by one in no particular order since they bring references to each other when necessary. The scope of the book goes way beyond biology including also geology, history of science, gender and race relations, and the ever lasting debate between science and religion. The style is again accessible and witty. After introducing the only exponential equation on the whole book the author almost apologizes.In my opinion some of the most interesting essays are The Death Before Birth of a Mite; Caring Groups and Selfish Genes; Dr. Down's Syndrome; Nature Odd Couples; Our Allotted Lifetimes; Time's Vastness; and all essays under the chapter The Pace of Change.The Pace of Change is the most original and still controversial chapter of the book. It introduces Gould and Eldredge's theory of Punctuated Equilibrium that is, in short, a slight correction on Darwin's belief of slow and continuous change throughout the process of evolution.This is a very interesting and enjoyable book. I doubt anyone interested in science, just by reading a random article of this book, would not feel compelled to read the rest of the book and also other Stephen Gould's books.Leonardo Alves - January 2001"},{"Title":"The Panda's Thumb: More Reflections in Natural History","review":"&quot;Panda's Thumb&quot; is the second volume in a series of essay collections culled primarily from Gould's column &quot;This View Of Life&quot; that was published for nearly thirty years in Natural History magazine, the official popular journal of the American Museum of Natural History. Once more readers are treated to elegantly written, insightful pieces on issues ranging from racial attitudes affecting 19th Century science to evolutionary dilemnas such as the origins of the Panda's thumb (Not really a dilemna, though &quot;scientific&quot; creationists might argue otherwise; instead Gould offers an elegant description of how evolution via natural selection works.) and the evolutionary consequences of variations in size and shape among organisms. Gould is differential to the work of other scientists, carefully considers views contrary to his own, and even points the virtues of the faulty science he criticizes. Those who say contemporary science is dogmatic should reconsider that view after carefully reading this volume or any of the others in Gould's series. Instead, what we see are the thoughts of a fine scientist rendered in splendid, often exquisite, prose."},{"Title":"The Panda's Thumb: More Reflections in Natural History","review":"What Carl Sagan is to astronomy, Stephen Jay Gould is to biology. Both men can write about their subjects fascinatingly and in layman's terms without dumbing down the material. That said, Gould is more down-to-earth, with a sense of humor that is more uplifting than caustic. In &quot;Bathybius and Eozoon&quot; (no, that's not a comic book duo) and &quot;Crazy Old Randolph Kirkpatrick,&quot; he takes a look back at two of science's more oddball mistakes while reminding us that scientists are more human than shallow stereotypes might allow. &quot;The Great Scablands Debate&quot; questions the widely-held notion that all geological (and, by extension, evolutionary) change happens at a snail's pace. In &quot;Women's Brains&quot; and &quot;Dr. Down's Syndrome,&quot; he questions some of the uses to which science has been put in the past, while not (unlike certain feminists who should know better) discarding the whole idea of science altogether. There are even essays on the (supposed) stupidity of dinosaurs and on Mickey Mouse, which might make excellent reading for a child with good reading skills and an incipient interest in science."},{"Title":"The Panda's Thumb: More Reflections in Natural History","review":"This volume is a collection of Gould's earlier essays for the New York Museum of Natural History. They reflect his marvelous insight into the heart of current arguments in evolution studies, his knowledge of the history of the subject, and his take on life in general. The Panda's Thumb, entitled from one of these essays, is not quite as witty as his later works are, but his personable style and conversational approach make the book very readable.One of the more interesting topics included is his discussion of the 19th Century rationale for prejudice against women and individuals of non-Western cultures. I found the very circular reasoning on the correlation between brain size and intellect and the misbegotten comparison of developmentally delayed individuals with individuals of other races particularly informative. The same kind of reasoning appears to be enjoying a destructive renaissance among social biologists today, most notably the authors of the notorious Bell Curve. The dissection of this type of faulty reasoning by an expert is instructive and a process well worth learning oneself and teaching to young people.Some of the more admirable of Gould's writing habits, and well displayed in this book, are his ability to give fair voice to the opposition, his acknowledgement of the work of others, and his capacity to find value even in the faulty work of others. The latter is well demonstrated in his discussion of the 19th Century effort to locate a representative of a basic life form, a link between the living and the inert. In this essay he shows that good science is part hard work, part individual brilliance, and part being able to say &quot;I was wrong in my thinking here.&quot;The casual, approachable style, the brilliant and open mind, the logical approach to argument all make this an excellent book for anyone but would definitely make it a good book for high school students to learn the process of critical thought."},{"Title":"The Panda's Thumb: More Reflections in Natural History","review":"The second collection of Gould's articles from Natural History continues to explore Darwin's themes and the resultant ideas since. There's several interesting essays here, including my favorite one in which the evolution of Mickey Mouse is discussed.One of the essays here dealt with Richard Dawkins' controversial stand (in The Selfish Gene) on genes in which he states that a person is just a gene's way to make another gene. (This is different from normal evolutionary thought in that genes there are the subject of random variation which then is subject to the environment and tested.) Gould is not convinced by Dawkins' theory, mainly because, he says, there is no evidence that genes can be linked to specific attributes, i.e., there isn't an &quot;eye&quot; gene. Gould wrote this some years back, so it will be interesting to see if he revisits this subject now that researchers have indeed discovered the &quot;eye&quot; gene (through testing on flies).Gould also covers Robert Bakker's theories about warm-blooded dinosaurs (later written up in Bakker's The Dinosaur Heresies) and the link to birds, a good essay for people to review prior to the hullabaloo that will follow Jurassic Park 2 (it's always fun to check up on an author's source material)."},{"Title":"The Panda's Thumb: More Reflections in Natural History","review":"An entertaining and elegantly written collection of discursive essays on natural history and evolution.

Perhaps because of this date there is very little about DNA and nothing about HLA and tissue-typing. I shall check his later books to see if he ever got up-to-date on these. (He died a month ago). He was concerned to defend his field as being real science against &quot;haughty and high-riding mathematicians and experimentalists.&quot; In fact this sort of biology seems more akin to history and archeology than to hard science, but that adds to its readability rather than detracts from it."},{"Title":"The Panda's Thumb: More Reflections in Natural History","review":"The \\"argument from design\\" traces back at least to the medieval theology as a favorite proof for the existence of God. The argument runs that the exquisite design and interrelation of earthly organisms can be explained only by the existence of an Intelligent Designer.I continue to believe in God, but Stephen Jay Gould's essays in \\"The Panda's Thumb\\" is a rather large nail in the coffin of this argument.In essay after essay, Gould describes nature's mistakes and improvisations, seeming proof against the work of an intelligent designer. For instance, the \\"thumb\\" of pandas -- a specialized appendage to strip leaves from bamboo shoots -- is not a true thumb, but a weirdly-designed extension of a wrist bone. Gould demonstrates many other animal adaptations, from orchids to hermit crabs, that use unlikely body parts to perform survival tasks required by later generations of organisms.Gould's explanation of neoteny - the tendency of organisms to retain anatomical features from childhood - is one of his most fascinating chapters. With a simple mutation, the basis for much uniquely human behavior and anatomy comes in to focus. We humans don't develop elongated snouts like other mammals; we retain our capacity to play throughout our lives rather than abandoning it at puberty; our brains continue to grow after birth; we are helpless and dependent on our parents far longer than other mammals. And in a typically Gouldian play of ideas, he charts the changing facial features of Mickey Mouse over the years to show him being drawn with more infant -like (and therefore human-like) features - rounder head, bigger eyes, shorter snout.Though Gould is not a theist, \\"Panda's Thumb\\" is not an argument against God, but *for* the appropriate use of science to describe the natural world. We theists are well-served by books like this, which give us the ammunition needed to battle cultural forces that seek to blind us to the truth that lies right in front of us in the natural world and of which we are a part."},{"Title":"The Panda's Thumb: More Reflections in Natural History","review":"I'll be short, there are plenty of other good reviews. My main point is that this book, although written over 20 years ago, retains its readability and accuracy because many of the topics it discusses are historical, and also many of the chapters concern general aspects of human nature and science, which are timeless. An excellent overview of evolutionary theory, and well worth a read as an introduction to natural science and evolution for enthusiastic thinkers."},{"Title":"The Panda's Thumb: More Reflections in Natural History","review":"The Panda's Thumb: More Reflections in Natural History by Stephen Jay Gould is classic Gould with a more open and approachable style. This is Gould's second in a series of books gleamed from his essays in \\"Natural History\\" and they have a timeless value to them.As Henry Adams said, \\"A teacher... can never tell where his influence stops.\\" So it can be said of Stephen Jay Gould as these essays are twenty plus years old they still have inherent and intrinsic value as they are essential in historical character. Gould's writings here are compassionate, well founded, plausible, and spot-on. As Gould explores evolutionary biology, were dinosaurs dumb, a panda's thumb, or why are there as many men as women born, to magneticly seeking food... Gould explores the realm of biological theory and does an excellent in expanding the readers mind .If found this book to be a wonderful look into how biology, theory and history all interplay with discovery. Gould acts as a tour guide to thought and observation as he writes. This is an excellent book written in a more relaxted style, but his rapier skill is apparent and you cannot help but read on and enjoy his elegantly explored essays.These essays have a broad range, but are integrated and organized into eight sections of thought-provoking prose. Enjoy Gould's arguments as he takes you on a ride. A ride that compels us to seek the answers within ourselves."},{"Title":"The Panda's Thumb: More Reflections in Natural History","review":"This was the first Stephen Jay Gould book I ever read - thirty years ago - and I immediately became a Gould fan. It is the second in the long series of books collecting together the essays he wrote for the journal \\"Natural History\\". Despite being three decades old, most of the essays in this book are still a must for anyone interested in evolutionary theory.All of Gould's writings are excellent: he never fails to make you think. But I like his earlier writings (such as this book) best, because his writing style then was at its most sharp and concise. Gould's later stuff is still well worth reading, but his later writing style could at times be rather repetitive and self-indulgent.I now apologise because the following summary of Gould's ideas is taken from my Amazon review of \\"The Richness of Life\\", a book which brings together a selection of Gould's writings from all of his publications.Gould's output falls into four main areas. Firstly, there is his contribution to evolutionary theory: he developed (with Niles Eldredge) the theory of punctuated equilibrium (linked to the concept of species selection); he emphasised that evolutionary history consists of a branching bush, not a ladder of progress; he argued that chance (or rather \\"contingency\\") plays a large part in evolutionary history; he contended that not every feature of an organism can be explained by functional adaptationism; and he showed that organs can often be adapted and used for purposes which are different from the ones they first evolved to perform.Secondly, Gould saw that science is a human activity which is influenced by the social, historical and ideological context in which it takes place. His historical biographies of scientists always show them to be products of their times. In this context Gould is also excellent at showing the dialectical interaction between theory and factual evidence in the development of scientific knowledge.The third area of Gould's work is his lifelong battle against those crude biologically deterministic theories (such as sociobiology and evolutionary psychology) which try to explain away human behaviour as being mainly determined by our genes. An example of what Gould was up against is Richard Dawkins. Dawkins refers to living creatures as \\"lumbering robots\\" programmed by their genes. And in an interview published in \\"New Statesman\\" (26th March 1999), while discussing cloning, Dawkins said: \\"Cloning Saddam Hussein would be horrible. Cloning David Attenborough, or someone we all admire, might be fine.\\"This is the sort of genetic determinism that Gould demolishes. Does Dawkins really think that the nastiness of the dead dictator and the niceness of the admirable Attenborough are simply the result of their genes, and nothing to do with their upbringing, experiences, social circumstances and life-history? Gould has pointed out that nature's clones (identical twins) have already shown us that having identical genes does not mean having the same personality.Unlike Dawkins, Gould has a grasp of the subtle and complex interaction between our genetic potentiality and the environmental factors which play an enormous part in making us what we are. Gould also points out the real danger of genetic determinism: it suggests that social problems and inequalities are the inevitable result of our biology rather than things that we can put right.Fourthly and finally, Gould has written about the relationship between science and religion. Gould (an agnostic) believed that there need be no inevitable conflict between the two as long as each sticks to its own sphere and leaves the other alone. Religion should leave science to get on with explaining nature, and science should leave moral debates to religion. I think Gould is on shaky ground here. He is understating the conflict between science and religion; he is playing down the reactionary role that religion still plays in society; and he is failing to analyse the SOCIAL roots of morality. He rightly says that we should not leave moral decisions just to scientists, but I would also say that we shouldn't leave them to priests either!Nevertheless, even though I am an atheist myself, I do not believe that Richard Dawkins' crude version of atheism is any better than Gould's \\"softness\\" on religion. Dawkins is like the philosophers of the Enlightenment in that he thinks that religious beliefs can be dispelled by directly confronting them with rational, scientific arguments. He fails to understand that atheists have to do more than just show religion to be superstitious nonsense: it is necessary to understand its social roots and to get rid of the oppressive and alienating social conditions which make people turn to what Marx, in the famous \\"opium of the people\\" passage, called \\"the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world and the soul of soulless circumstances.\\" (For more on this see my review here on Amazon of Dawkins' book, \\"The Selfish Gene\\".)Phil Webster.(England)"},{"Title":"The Panda's Thumb: More Reflections in Natural History","review":"When it comes to evolution, the interesting \\"leit-motiv\\" of Stephen Jay Gould seems to be: \\"I ain't got a witness, and I can't prove it, but that's my story and I'm sticking to it\\". By repeating and recycling the mantra of Charles Darwin again and again, Stephen Jay Gould keeps convincing himself and others that evolution gives the final account of all that is. Of course he couldn't be further from the truth. This point is clearly made by man like William Dembski, Phillip Johnson and Michael Behe, among others, whose books are available and are much more promising than Stephen Jay Gould's. This Harvard Professor takes the same view of Occam's razor as Richard Dawkins: \\"as long as we can speculate freely about natural causes of all there is, we will keep ignoring all evidence of intelligent design, no matter how strong, even if that requires engaging in scientific acrobatics\\". Stephen Jay Gould's \\"punctuated equilibrium\\" is just an example of such acrobatics. This theory came as response to the huge problems that darwinism faces, and to the fact that many darwinists are coming to the conclusion that they have been \\"climbing mount impossible\\" in their quest to explain life with the tools of chance and necessity, leaving intelligence, information and design aside. Of course to some darwinists, these huge problems are just minor detais that their own \\"naturalism of the gaps\\" can quickly fix and hold together. But the equilibrium is getting harder and harder to maintain. This is the man who knows well that the lack of correspondence between the fossil record and the theory of evolution is the trade secret of paleontologists. It is true that Stephen Jay Gould has a problem with darwinian mechanism of matter, mutations and selection. He also seems to have a problem with The Selfish Gene (Richard Dawkins autobiography). How can this mechanism explain the huge amounts of information generation that are needed in the evolutionary process? How can it explain the mythological prebiotic soup? How can this mechanism account for being and matter in the first place? What about the Cambrian explosion? What about the \\"black holes\\" in the fossil record? This mechanism is not even adequate to legitimate extrapolations from micro to macroevolution? Stephen Jay Gould seems to realize that the only way for science to evolve is to criticize the theory of evolution. Still he sticks to his story, presenting the thumb of the Panda as evidence against design. If he is right, then the tower of Piza wasn't designed either. Of course Stephen Jay Gould and all the scientists together are not able to design a Panda, but that is just another detail."},{"Title":"The Panda's Thumb: More Reflections in Natural History","review":"Gould is a reactionary, who is simply trying to salvage a washed up, out-of-date, theory.

He not only made major contributions to the field, particularly with his notion of \\"punctuated equilibrium\\" and his conceptual refinements to evolutionary theory such as the notion of \\"exaptation,\\" but he was a world class essayist and did more to spread knowledge of evolutionary theory to the general population than probably any other scientist of his day. This is one of his finest works and the title essay, The Panda's Thumb, probably contributed more to my understanding of contingency in the evolutionary process than any other book or journal article.

And, as always, Gould's essays give me something to think about."},{"Title":"The Panda's Thumb: More Reflections in Natural History","review":"This is the book that reminds us why Stephen Jay Gould was the Great One. He was perhaps the greatest naturalist of his generation, as measured by being able to get across complex scientific ideas for the common man in an interesting manner. Additionally, he was a great scientist in his own right. The world is a sorrier place to lose him.Gould's essays are far-ranging, but center around his view of life and evolution- through punctuated equilibrium. Using analogy (allowed in natural history essays) and his extensive research experience, he looks at how paradaigms shift, and why they should. He describes the evidence and logic behind a punctuated model as opposed to gradualism. And along the way lets us learn some fascinating new worlds in human and animal life.At times I don't agree with his strong dislike of religion. At times his writing is dated- to be expected in a book now 25 years old. (He talks with great excitement about how we can now determine the code of RNA.) But his writing is always interesting, always thought-provoking and challenging, always novel. He has a new way of seeing things, even after a quarter century. He forces the reader to confront their preconceptions and shift their paradaigms. You learn, yes, but with great joy, and a spice of humor."},{"Title":"The Panda's Thumb: More Reflections in Natural History","review":"I bought this book for a class several years ago.

In what I believe is his finest book, he argues that it is the imperfections in life's design, like the panda's thumb formed out of its wrist instead of as a full digit, that prove evolution by natural selection. In one essay, he teaches about neotony, some animals' tendency to stay younger-looking, by describing the &quot;evolution&quot; of the drawing of Mickey Mouse.

I do not think you need to read the preface to get the gist of what he says. Most of the prefaces of his plays are long, interesting and dated. There is no preface in this edition. Shaw makes his philosophical positions very clear in his work, for instance in the Preface ofMrs. Warren's Professionhe says that he had \\"no respect for popular morality, no beief in popular religion, no admiration for popular heroics.\\"But you do not have to share Shaw's views to enjoy the plays. Nowadays, you can like a cartoon from the NewYorker without betraying what you belive in, or enjoy any humorist you see on TV. We laugh because there is some truth behind what the humorist says.

Although I found it dryly written, which some wit involved, he makes some good remarks on the problems of Christianity. Mainly is the devout in which they will surely go to the lions before giving up their gods. Hypocritically the Romans could care less who their gods were or whether they believed in them, so long it was not a Christian god. The introduction acts as a set-up to put one in the mind set of Shaw and to understand his point of view which makes the play that much easier to understand and funnier to read. The play itself is a wonderful entry into the classics of the thearter."},{"Title":"Hansel and Gretel","review":"As a 5 and 6 year old, I recall reading this stark version of the fairy-tale. The illustrations here are simply beautiful! I remember talking to my mom about the issues in this tale -- famine and starvation, abandonment, cannibalism, supporting, being supported by your sibling, and returning/reunited to your family after being through everything.My mom helped me understand the mom's behaviour in this story, and I hope I can do that for my son some day. Like all fairy tales, this simply looks at some of the worst that could happen, and lets you see a way out. I read it without these gorgeous illustrations too. You can't disney all of life, though I admit, I'm a sentimental soft-hearted person who cries when the cats get rained on when I'm watching the Aristocats :-) Enjoy, and think too ..."},{"Title":"Hansel and Gretel","review":"I noticed some reviewers very concerned about the fact that the children end up killing the old woman at the end. However, in every version of Hansel and Gretel that I've ever read that is how it ends. The old woman imprisons them and plans to \\"butcher\\" them to eat. Quite gruesome. She is not described as a \\"witch\\" but rather just a wicked old hag who uses her gingerbread house to lure in innocent children. While we don't want to teach violence to children, there is something empowering for young children to know that they can act to protect themselves against someone (even an adult) who is trying to hurt them. Rather than a fairy godmother or a handsome prince \\"rescuing\\" them, they rescue themselves. So, offing the witch at the end didn't bother me as much as some of the earlier pages. Hansel and Gretel's parents are so poor and have no food so the mother persuades the father to abandon them in the forest. It's a little hard to explain to a very young child why a mother would want to leave her children to die in the forest, regardless of how poor they are. I judiciously edited that part while reading it. I still think the book is a good one, but parents might want to read through it first before buying it."},{"Title":"Hansel and Gretel","review":"This is a nice rendition of Hansel & Gretel, much as the one I recall from my childhood. One of the only more obvious differences I noted was that it was not the \\"step-mother\\" who encouraged the father to abondon the children in the forest, but instead, the \\"mother,\\" perhaps reflective of our more sensitive times. Zelinsky's illustrations, as indicated by the Caldecott Medal, enhanced the story greatly. All-in-all, a cute, nostalgic Grimm's Fairy Tale...though I see no mention of the Borthers Grimm in this book."},{"Title":"Hansel and Gretel","review":"As other reviewer here have noted, this story is not the 'watered down' modern version of the tale. I would not recommend the book for especially senstive kids. As it is my daughter (4 y.o.) asks each time we read the book, &quot;why would H&amp;G's mama and papa leave them in the woods alone and try to get rid of them?&quot; &quot;why would the witch keep Hansel in a cage / want to eat Hansel?&quot; &quot;why does Gretel push the witch into the oven and burn her?&quot; etc. If your son / daughter is prone to nightmares, the wonderful illustrations really 'bring to life' the tale, so this book - between the story and the pictures - might just be too haunting for many kids. It dosen't bother my daughter, but then again, it is also not picked for bedtime reading very often, either. It really IS a gorgeous book, though."},{"Title":"Hansel and Gretel","review":"When my kids were 5 & 6 years old, I discovered this book at the local library. It caught my eye because it was a (1985) Caldecott Medal Honor Book, and was displayed w/lots of other Caldecott Medal winners. We usually read 30-60 minutes before bedtime and this book was a family favorite; we checked it out from the library again and again. The illustrations are vivid and memorable. Of course, it helped to read the book with a creepy/scary voice for the witch's character. The kids enjoyed the illustrations tremendously, often looking at the pictures on their own. Recently, I bought a copy of this book and gave it to my son, a recent new father. What a big hit!

But I find it almost beyond belief that people are complaining about it's subject matter. What versions are these people reading? These tales were originally written for adults and then rewritten for children. It's definitely NOT a tale for very young children and never was. It should be ok, though, for the slightly older ones who like to be scared a bit. I always avoided it because of the child abuse/abandonment and cannibalism aspects. But I never realized people thought it was about anything else. Maybe I'm just used to the Grimm's versions because I collect fairy tale books but if you're going to make this a non-violent tale, you'd have to pretty much rewrite the whole fairy tale. I have to give this book high marks for staying true to the original tale and for the wonderful artwork.

The mother convinces the father that they should go out into the woods and leave their children there. She says that it is the only way they will survive. Hansel heard his parents talking about this one night and he told Gretel. The next day, their parents told them that they were going into the forest to chop wood. Hansel took a handful of pebbles and dropped them a little bit at a time on their way. This was so they could find their way back home. The idea worked. The mother and father decided to try again. This time Hansel dropped breadcrumbs, but the birds of the forest ate the breadcrumbs and the children were lost. They started walking and came upon a house made of candy. Little did they know, a witch lived inside. The witch tried cooking Hansel, but Gretel managed to shove the witch into the oven. Hansel and Gretel found lots of pearls and diamonds in boxes in the witches house. They shoved them into their pockets and left. They finally found their way home and when they got there, they found out that the mother had died.This book has always been one of my favorites. When you add Zelinsky illustration's it is a literary success. Rika Lesser did an incredible job of retelling this classic. The umbrella theme of children's literature of, \\"if you put your mind to it you can accomplish anything\\" is hidden in the fairy tale book."},{"Title":"Hansel and Gretel","review":"Despite the ridiculous, overly sensitive reviews above, claiming that Hansel and Gretel is too violent for children, I think that such stories are of great value to children. The world is filled with violence, whether it stems from humans or other natural forces. Children should be aware of such danger not only so they might defend themselves but also because we have an obligation to truthfully depict reality for them. It is unwise to euphemize their early years and then expect them to be able to adapt to the disappointments and painful situations of later life. Besides, if someone were going to eat you, you'd put her in an oven too and make sure that she was good and dead, so that she would not eat anybody else. Three cheers for Gretel!"},{"Title":"Hansel and Gretel","review":"I think this is inappropriate for young kids, because in this original story, the parents abandoned them in the forest, and the old woman used \\"graphic\\" details about how she is going to eat the kids!

I have no doubt that this is true. The pictures are beautiful, and the story engaging. But this is not the version of the story where the old crone is a witch who turns children into gingerbread. Instead Hansel and Gretel, abandoned by their parents, find the house of the old crone in the middle of the woods. The old lady has plans to cook Hansel for dinner. Near the end of the book, Gretel pushes the old lady into the hot oven, locks the door and listens to the old lady's screams until the old lady is reduced to ashes. Then Hansel and Gretel loot her stuff.

Almost all stories of Grimm have moral values and this one is no exception. Fairy tales were told as form of entertainment too. They show the kids the right way to behave. However, If pondered over, Hansel and Gretel is one fairy tale with Biblical resemblance. The kids view their parents house as a place of security.The two children are wandering through the woods and are hungry, tired and alone. This closely resembles the passage where Jesus wandered through the desert for forty days. He too was tired and hungry and completely alone. During this time, Satan tried to tempt Jesus with food. Satan told Him that if He were the Son of God, then He should turn a stone into bread for food (Luke 4:3). Jesus did not get tempted but here in the story, the children saw the gingerbread house and ate parts of it until they were full. The children continued to eat pieces of it even after they were full, which is gluttony. And Gluttony is one topic in Bible is seen as one of the seven deadly sins, if I am not mistaken. Than the final part, Gretel traps the witch inside her own oven, right before she was getting ready to cook Hansel. The witch is burnt up. This resembles the story of Satan. At the end of Satan's reign over earth, the Christians will be saved from the fire and Satan will be thrown into the fiery pit of Hell, where he will be tortured forever. In end, there is rejoicing; very similiar when the satan (witch) dies,the children reap the rewards and rejoice to 'live happily ever after' Moreover, the tale show abandonment, hunger, fear,friendly sibling example, family unity - issues that startles kids minds to pause and think. It makes the kids dive into imagination and with the very good illustrations and very well re-told classic, this book is a wonderful Pick for all Children - Best of the Best Fairy tale to read and instil moral values in kids."},{"Title":"Hansel and Gretel","review":"The tale of Hansel and Gretel is hundreds of years old and has been told time and time again. Rika Lesser's retelling, however, strives to be a true as possible to the tale as it was first published by the Brothers Grimm. Beware that this version of the story is darker than more modern, Disney-fied versions: the mother, wanting more food for herself, abandons her children in the forest. When they return, she angrily takes them back into the forest and leaves them when they're sleeping. Then of course there's the whole debacle with the children-eating witch and Gretel cooking her alive in the oven, a portion of the story that, for all it macabre violence, hasn't actually changed much over the centuries. But at the end when the children return home, their mother has \\"died\\" inexplicably, and it may just be me, but it seems likely that the father, outraged with his wife's attitude towards her children, has done her in.This is Hansel and Gretel in all its glory, with folksy, well-done illustrations by the esteemed Paul O. Zelinksy. I wish there were a bit more detail in the illustrations, but it seems Zelinksy strove to capture the rustic feel evoked by the text.My one criticism is that the story is rather long, but this is likely due to its loyalty to the original. In the final analysis, this is one of the much better - if not best - tellings of Hansel and Gretel on today's market."},{"Title":"Hansel and Gretel","review":"My 7-year-old son has been listening to this book for a few years now, and it is one of his all-time favorites.

I highly recommend this book for families that enjoy classic fairy tales in all their grisly glory; Rika Lesser stays true to the original story, without watering down any of the more gruesome elements. The illustrations are not too harsh for children, though, and as in all fairy tales, everything works out in the end. For especially sensitive children, a gentler version might be better.

You can take a lot of heat from passionate listeners for stepping out against policies that are politically correct and advocating ones that are politically incorrect. For the brave souls that step out of line to do this, I salute you. However, there remain a few sacred cows that even these courageous individuals will not assail.Hans-Hermann Hoppe in his book, Democracy: The God that Failed, took on several of these cows. He took on the ideas that the state is necessary for the production of defense, that democracy was a positive progression, that democracy and freedom go hand in hand, that democracy has no link to tyrannical systems like communism and fascism, and so on. He advocates in this book a system of natural order or anarcho-capitalism. In this system, fundamental private property law applies and the free market has assumed the production of goods that were produced almost exclusively by the state (education, roads, national defense, etc.).Now Hoppe is back with plenty of assistance. The Myth of National Defense is an expansion of the ideas found inDemocracy:TGTF. The attention this time is primarily on defense. The questions &quot;Does the state do its job of producing defense well?&quot;, &quot;Will a free market defense alternative work?&quot;, &quot;Would it be preferable to the state institutions?&quot;, &quot;Is there any historic precedents?&quot;, &quot;What are some of the potential problems involved?&quot;, &quot;How can this system be implemented?&quot;, &quot;What will keep such a system turning into a state?&quot;, &quot;Could such a system adequately defend against states?&quot;, and others are raised and answered in this book. This does not mean that all angles are covered and this is the end of discussion. The idea of the free market providing defense is not new (this book is dedicated to precursor Gustave de Molinari 1819-1911), but you will be disappointed if you expect to find a large library of literature devoted to this subject.Is this book for the casual reader? Not quite. Like Democracy: TGTF before it, The Myth of National Defense can only be fully understood by those who have a bit of economic knowledge under their belt. While this is a great book involving sound Austrian economic theory, it is not to be confused with good economic primers likeEconomics in One Lesson or Economics For Real People. Hopefully, we will see a book that covers the subject of the state and national defense in a way that is accessible to the layman.One of my favorite essays in this book was Privateering and National Defense: Naval Warfare for Private Profit. Larry Sechrest shows how private enterprise being involved in national defense is not without precedent. In the War of 1812 and many wars prior, it was taken for granted that private ships specially licensed by their government to capture or (rarely) destroy the ships and cargo of the enemy existed. These privateers would capture merchant or military ships from enemy lands, take them to port, and (depending on the outcome of courts which examined whether ships captured were enemy vessels or not) sell the ship and cargo at auction. This practice was not always but often profitable for the ship shareholders and crew (who earned a percentage of the take). It also had the added bonus of being a successful form of defense. So successful that large nations with large navies feared smaller nations with privateers to the point of outlawing the practice via treaty. The whole essay is very enlightening to me. I had never heard of the practice even though 800 American privateer ships participated in the American Revolution!This book is a great read and welcome continuation of the theories rendered in Democracy: TGTF. If you enjoyedDemocracy: TGTF, then The Myth of National Defense is a must read. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Myth of National Defense: Essays on the Theory and History of Security Production","review":"_The Myth of National Defense: Essays on the Theory and History of Security Production_, published in 2003 by the Ludwig von Mises Institute, and edited by Austrian economist and anarcho-capitalist philosopher Hans-Hermann Hoppe is a series of essays by noted scholars and anarchists which attempts to show how non-statist solutions to the problem of national defense may be accomplished. These individuals make the claim that the state is a coercive institution that through force or the threat of force preys off the people and seizes their property while making the ideological claim that it is necessary to protect rights and property. As these scholars attempt to prove, this necessity is founded on pure ideology which is widely accepted by most mainstream scholars and by the populace at large. However, alternatives to state monopoly of the production of security may be feasible and these scholars attempt to show how such alternatives could work. In particular, one possibility that has been suggested is the use of privately owned insurance companies as the means for providing defense (in line with a suggestion by liberal economist Gustave de Molinari (1819 - 1912)). If such private production of defense is possible, then the scholars in this book would suggest that the world would become more peaceful and violence against person and property would be minimized. There may however be problems with this view in the sense that it is unclear how monopoly could be prevented from arising among such competing defense producing insurance agencies which would then lead to greater coercion. Also, as pointed out in one of the essays (though argued against), it is unclear as to whether there is not coercion in any club, organization, or group. This seems to be a difficulty with human nature and the human tendency to form groups when such groups become too large. The book also considers the possibility of secession so as to weaken the state and the New World Order, one world government, should such arise. I believe that a further question the authors of this volume have not fully explored is the relationship between technology and the growth of the state. In light of technological developments which enable global communication and global travel, it becomes easier to understand how the global order of nation states has emerged. Nevertheless, this book offers several interesting possibilities and alternatives to democracy as currently understood and the emerging global welfare-warfare state.This book begins with an Introduction by Hans-Hermann Hoppe in which he re-examines the Declaration of Independence as written by Thomas Jefferson. Hoppe argues that rather than securing rights to \\"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\\" as maintained by Jefferson, the United States government has largely ignored this mandate and become ever more tyrannical. Hoppe further shows how national defense as offered by the state monopoly has largely failed in light of the attacks of September 11. Hoppe considers the case of monopoly, showing how monopoly is largely viewed as bad in nearly all cases by mainstream economists and philosophers, except for the case of the state and the production of defense. Hoppe considers a thesis of Ludwig von Mises that in order for government to fulfill its primary function it must be democratically organized and it must allow for unlimited secession. But, as Hoppe argues this would in effect render the state a voluntary membership organization. Hoppe then outlines the essays which appear in this volume, arguing against a coercive state monopoly on the production of defense with the power to tax.Section One of this book is entitled \\"State-Making and War-Making\\". The first essay is entitled \\"The Problem of Security: Historicity of the State and \\"European Realism\\"\\" by Luigi Marco Bassani and Carlo Lottieri. These authors consider the development of libertarian thinking concerning the state and the role of the state in anthropological and sociological literature. The authors consider the conquest theory of the state and discuss such individuals and theories as those of Max Weber, Oppenheimer, the Italian elitist (Gaetano Mosca and Vilfredo Pareto), the European Realists (Carl Schmitt and Otto Brunner), and modern libertarian thinkers (such as Murray Rothbard). The authors show how the modern state originated in feuds between Germanic princes and show how world government and the New World Order has arisen. The second essay is entitled \\"War, Peace, and the State\\" by Murray Rothbard. This essay takes an extreme view on the role of the state in war, arguing that the state has no right to make war, and maintaining that in self defense of self or property it is necessary to pinpoint violators. Section Two of this book is entitled \\"Government Forms, War, and Strategy\\". The third essay is entitled \\"Monarchy and War\\" by Erik von Kuenhelt-Liddehn. This essay written by a European aristocratic thinker argues that monarchy is superior to democracy (noting how Western civilization rests on the death of two persons, Socrates and Jesus Christ, and that both were murdered by the popular will). The author explains how monarchy led to wars which were less violent and more humane than the era of democratic war and total war. The author also considers some of the horrors of the Second World War showing Allied atrocities, as well as the rise of the totalitarian movements. This author maintains that the state is the result of Original Sin and argues the case for monarchy over democracy. The fourth essay is entitled \\"Nuclear Weapons: Proliferation or Monopoly?\\" by Bertrand Lemennicier. This essay argues against monopoly of nuclear weapons and for proliferation through analyzing the situation using game theory. The fifth essay is entitled \\"Is Democracy More Peaceful than Other Forms of Government?\\" by Gerard Radnitzky. This article considers the case of war and the state showing the role of democracy. In essence, the author shows the horrors of state involvement in war, mentioning the results of Rummel showing that governments are responsible for countless deaths (\\"democide\\") but arguing against Rummel's democratic peace theory. The author argues against the widely accepted \\"democratic peace theory\\" arguing that democracies are not more peaceful than other forms of government (and in fact are far more violent) and considers the case of monarchy showing how democracy has led to an era of total war. The author also shows that the idea that democracies do not go to war against each other is false and shows how supposed democracies get to define what constitutes democracy so that they can fight to \\"make the world safe for democracy\\". Section Three is entitled \\"Private Alternatives to State Defense and Warfare\\". The sixth essay is entitled \\"Mercenaries, Guerrillas, Militias, and the Defense of Minimal States and Free Societies\\" by Joseph R. Stromberg. This essay attempts to show various private alternatives to national defense by considering the cases of mercenaries, guerrillas, and militias and showing their role in the American War for Independence, the Southern War of Secession, and the Anglo-Boer War. The author shows how such private means of defense allow for pinpointing of violators as suggested by Rothbard thus eliminating damage done to the lives or property of innocents. The seventh essay is entitled \\"Privateering and National Defense: Naval Warfare for Private Profit\\" by Larry J. Sechrest. This essay shows the role of privateering as a private alternative to state produced naval warfare. The eighth essay is entitled \\"The Will To Be Free: The Role of Ideology in National Defense\\" by Jeffrey Rogers Hummel. This essay shows the role of conquest in the development of the state which arose in the capture of hunter-gatherer bands and the rise of the Agricultural Revolution. The author maintains that ideology is essential to maintaining the power of the state. Section Four is entitled \\"Private Security Production: Practical Applications\\". The ninth essay is entitled \\"National Defense and the Theory of Externalities, Public Goods, and Clubs\\" by Walter Block. This essay argues against all so-called public goods, maintaining that they can be produced privately, and argues that the state is coercive unlike voluntary private clubs. The tenth essay is entitled \\"Government and the Private Production of Defense\\" by Hans-Hermann Hoppe. This essay begins by showing the failure of the state to protect rights and property. Hoppe shows how the state interferes both domestically and abroad and results in countless violations of rights and erodes the institution of property. Hoppe shows how the right to exclude has been systematically eroded and with it the right to property. Hoppe argues that instead of a state monopoly on defense production, that private insurance companies would be ideal candidates to offer protective services. Hoppe maintains that such private production of defense would lead to a more peaceful society in that there would finally be disincentives for aggressing. The eleventh essay is entitled \\"Secession and the Production of Defense\\" by Jorg Guido Hulsmann. This essay considers the case of secession and shows the necessity of defining this term carefully. The author argues for secession and considers various secessionist movements and the role of guerrilla fighters. The author argues that secession can be used to achieve political reforms, establish a free society, and further break up schemes towards global government. However, it must be pointed out that in order for a secessionist movement to survive it is frequently necessary to appeal to some overarching religious, nationalistic, or ideological motivation. The author does not find this problematic in that it unifies secessionists against the intrusive state.This volume offers a series of fascinating essays which attempt to offer real anti-statist alternatives to the state monopoly on production of defense. The authors show how private means can be used (such as private insurance companies offering protection, private militias, or individual self-protective measures assured through the right to own weapons) to defend individuals and their property from assault. While some of the arguments made here may be troublesome and may need further development, I believe that the contentions made are certainly interesting and worthy of consideration for those who realize that the performance of the state in protecting life, liberty, and property has been deplorable."},{"Title":"The Myth of National Defense: Essays on the Theory and History of Security Production","review":"Hoppe here smashes myths surrounding the State's apparatus like a belligerent prohibitionist gentle-lady wielding an axe in a glass bar in the 1920's.

Sure, Henry's deafness makes his flight special, but it is his description of grass-roots aviation that makes this book a keeper. You won't recognize John Nance, Dale Brown, or Tom Clancy in its pages--not even Richard Bach--just a middle-aged guy in love with flying."},{"Title":"Flight Of The Gin Fizz: Midlife At 4,500 Feet","review":"Faced with late middle age and a life that has not quite provided all that youth expected, any number of males have taken to the open road and written about it -- most often, to my way of thinking, in a fairly whiny manner. This is a different twist on that theme; Kisor, a critic for a Chicago newspaper, doesn't take to the open road, he takes to the open sky in a small Cessna. And not just any open sky; it is the open sky which the nearly forgotten Cal Rodgers followed in the first solo flight across the United States. Coincidentally, Kisor and Rodgers share the handicap of being deaf. This all makes for a leisurely and instructive read on flying, on living deaf in a hearing world, and -- gently -- on growing older and finding the new satisfactions rather than the disappointments of that fact. Kisor's writing is not particularly gripping and his journey is mostly uneventful. Rodgers' trip was much different, plagued by all manner of equipment and crash problems, some of them triggered by his own aggressive and overconfident actions. Kisor's episodic retelling of that journey, based on an unpublished work by a woman he meets along his own route, is the best part of Flight."},{"Title":"Flight Of The Gin Fizz: Midlife At 4,500 Feet","review":"I enjoyed this book so much, I took my time reading it. As the author crossed the country slowly in a Cessna 152, he follows the path of Cal Rodgers (another deaf pilot) - and I followed the author slowly, limiting myself to a few chapters at a time, savoring them. While the author shared his observations about the places he went and the people he met, he also shared his his views as a deaf pilot and a deaf member of our society. It is this perspective that gives the greatest insights. He keeps running into people who &quot;can't do something&quot; because they are different. Women pilots, black pilots, pilots who are afraid of flying, deaf pilots. Fortunately, none of them listened (pun intended) to &quot;them&quot; and some great little stories about some fascinating individuals come out. I must confess I might have tried to limit some of these folks before I read this book - I hope this book has taught me to encourage them instead. I limited myself to four stars because this flight of self-discovery isn't quite in the league of Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, but that's a high bar to meet."},{"Title":"Flight Of The Gin Fizz: Midlife At 4,500 Feet","review":"Excellent, entertaining read for any pilot that loves low and slow aviation . Reminded me of my own long cross country flights at only 95 knots true airspeed."},{"Title":"Flight Of The Gin Fizz: Midlife At 4,500 Feet","review":"As a middle-aged private pilot myself, I have all the respect and admiration in the world for both pilots who flew coast to coast in light aircraft.Through out this book you will meet Henry Kisor, who is deaf, but who is trying desperately to communicate with not only himself through mid-life but also the outside world who has trouble accepting a deaf pilot. I found myself skimming over the historical recount of Roger's first coast-to-coast flight to catch up with Henry in his 150.Henry paints the all to true, sad picture of today's general aviation. Yet he also highlight it's greatest joys. Namely, meeting other aviation nuts and seeing the world from a different vantage point.After reading the book, I sincerely hope to one day meet Henry at a small GA airport and share a Diet Coke and a few stories. People like Henry are a main reason why I waste my hard earned money so foolishly boring $114 per hour holes in the sky.The brotherhood of aviators is well shared by Henry's book and is a good read by fellow aviators."},{"Title":"A Long Way from Home: Growing Up in the American Heartland (Tom Brokaw)","review":"I picked this up because I had a long commute and it was about the only thing that looked interesting in the library's collection of audio books on CD. What I found was surprisingly charming and entertaining. Mr. Brokaw gives us a biography of who he is, and starts out with his ancestors. He tells how they came to South Dakota, what was important to them, and how that eventually affected him. He includes proper historical setting for the events he relates and in some cases the reasons behind the values they held. He is clearly aware that a part of who he is comes from his ancestry.He also tells about his own life; where he lived and the memories he has of the various places and people that were a part of his life. I was even impressed that he spent a considerable amount of time dealing with his shortcomings. One chapter tells how his pride and arrogance nearly cost him much of what he holds dear today, such as his career and his wife. I was impressed with the candor with which he discussed the events, rather than trying to excuse himself or simply hide a weakness. Another item that made me smile was telling about how the parents of a friend, who had gone through the Depression, had a difficult time using disposable paper towels, such a wasteful item.While perhaps a nostalgic view of his life, I found it honest and sincere and I enjoyed listening to it."},{"Title":"A Long Way from Home: Growing Up in the American Heartland (Tom Brokaw)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Tom Brokaw is ten years older than I, but I can identify with many of his experiences in growing up. Like him, I came from a small state that is often ridiculed by those from more urbanized areas (Arkansas in my case). Like him, I was lucky enough to be born to wonderful parents that instilled the right values. Like him, I don't really want to move back to where I came from, but I am eternally grateful for it, love to visit, and continue to be nourished by it.Brokaw is a thoroughly appealing character in this book. His introduction cites his mother's assessment of the book: that his ego was showing through in some places. True enough, but it's not the sort of display that irritates you--more like the sort where you shake your head and are more than a little charmed. He doesn't spare himself in his account. He was told at one point by his future wife to basically shove off, since he was obviously heading nowhere fast--an assessment that one of his friends cooly confirmed to Brokaw's face. Given where he has gone since then, it's a little comforting to learn that he wasn't some ambitious machine checking off the steps on his ladder to success.I especially enjoyed his discussion of how his consciousness was raised as regards treatment of American Indians. Time and again, a somewhat cocky Brokaw is shown not to be as smart as he thinks. The response of an Indian woman to his self-assured statement that he knew a lot about Indians since he was from South Dakota--I'll leave that to you to discover. It's a gem.I've always had a weakness for tales told by people who are out of the limelight, who aren't the immediate images called up when you think of a particular era, who weren't in what some would consider the &quot;mainstream&quot;. Tom Brokaw's South Dakota upbringing is just as integral a part of America in the '40's and '50's as that of someone not living in &quot;fly-over&quot; territory. He brings it to life in an engaging way."},{"Title":"A Long Way from Home: Growing Up in the American Heartland (Tom Brokaw)","review":"Just as my parents turned to Walter Cronkite to bring them the news when I was growing up, I have turned to Tom Brokaw. Through numerous presidential elections, world crises and the horrific days surrounding 9/11, his coverage has been the one I tuned to. To me, Brokaw has a way of delivering the news that makes it seem like a conversation among friends --- with a tone that has feeling and emotion, as well as authority.A couple of years ago at an AOL Partners Conference, Brokaw was a guest speaker. He had just finished covering the funerals of Lady Di and Mother Teresa, traveling to both from his vacation at his home in Montana. His stories about two long trips to report on these high-profile events back-to-back gave new perspective on the high price that being in the news spotlight carries. His talk was personal as he referenced how the Internet has changed the way we receive news and what it --- and cable --- have done to the relevance of the kind of news he has delivered for the past couple of decades --- network news. Later I heard him moderate a panel about this same subject in the city with some leading journalists from Time, CNN and TheStreet.com. He was the consumate host, approaching the evening's discussion with one caveat. We would be finished by 8:00 as the Yankees were playing in the Playoffs and he was not going to miss the game on television. Sports, which brought him such joy when he was growing up, continue to be a passion.While Brokaw is great to watch from the studio in New York, the pieces that he has done in Montana and South Dakota have been some of my favorites. He always seems more in his element there in the Heartland than he does standing or sitting at an anchor desk in New York. As he walks along a mountain ridge or a street in a small midwestern town doing an interview or a color piece, it is clear that his home and his history in South Dakota mean a lot to him.Reading A LONG WAY FROM HOME: Growing Up in the American Heartland I see why. It's a memoir of the days before Brokaw left South Dakota to travel the country as a reporter, and then as a national media personality. What shaped him was a childhood in this desolate part of the country where success was measured on honest work and a God-fearing life.One interesting note --- while television was available in most major cities by the mid-'40s, it did not find its way to South Dakota until the early '50s. News in this part of the country came from radio --- where the weather report led the news since it would affect everyone's livelihood, farming. He would watch David Garroway on the Today Show with his mom, not knowing that someday he would have that same anchor seat. He writes how his mom would comment on his broadcasts with the seasoned eye of someone who had watched the show for years before her son took over.With a gift of gab from the time he was a young boy, Brokaw gave his first public speech at age four --- it began with &quot;They said I was too young to speak a piece tonight&quot; --- a line he still remembers. It was a harbinger of things to come.Throughout the book he references friends from over the years, and how they have influenced his life. For all his celebrity there were a lot of stories about how he has woven his past and present lives together, asking old childhood friends to join him at events like the Olympics and other special athletic championships. This is a man who has moved on, but still remains connected to the place that raised him. He and his wife Meredith returned to South Dakota to celebrate their 40th Anniversary last summer. As a man who could afford to celebrate this event anywhere he chose, it is fitting that he returned to his roots for this.The basic values are referred to again and again. His mom taught him and his brothers to handle household chores such as basic cooking, ironing and shopping, as well as guiding him in building self-confidence and getting a good education. At one point he mentions how he often will iron his own clothes in a hotel, rather than spend the time or money to call for valet service. His dad, Red, named for his flaming red hair, taught him the value of a hard day's work though he confesses he inherited none of his dad's handyman talent.Brokaw does not glorify his early days. He spends a fair number of pages talking about his failures and what he did when his path went awry. There's a lot here for people to learn about Brokaw. At the same time there are some pretty strong lessons about mastering the basics in life.--- Reviewed by Carol Fitzgerald"},{"Title":"A Long Way from Home: Growing Up in the American Heartland (Tom Brokaw)","review":"Tom Brokaw gives us a vivid recollection of his formative years and with that a history of the United States that flows well from page to page.

I found his account of the struggles of his forbears in South Dakota poignant, his account of his time in Bristol, Igloo, Ravinia, Pickstown, and Yankton full of interest. If you liked Russell Baker's Growing Up (which won a Pulitzer Prize) I think you will also like this book, even tho it might not win a Pulitzer. You can read this in a few hours, and when you are finished I bet you will have warm and friendly feeling about the author. I surely did."},{"Title":"A Long Way from Home: Growing Up in the American Heartland (Tom Brokaw)","review":"I can relate to this book. My parents lived through the Depression and raised their children in the prosperous sixties and seventies. They live in northern Wisconsin where most of the population was white. The similarites with Brokaw's South Dakota is basically the same. As a product of the Midwest, Brokaw is more similar to me than Rather (Texas) or Jennings (Canada).I enjoyed this simple story. Tom relates how he made it in televison journalism and New York. Despite where he lives now, he considers himself at home in South Dakota rather than New York. Tom chronicles his early life and relates how and where he was raised even now determine his outlook on life. I feel the same way and that is why this book struck home. I would rather tramp the forests of northern Wisconsin than see the lights of Chicago. People make their way in life in some measure because of who they were born to and where they lived. Tom's rural life and his parents survival of the Depression determined a lot of what Tom eventually turned out to be.

I heartily recommend it to anyone who likes biographies."},{"Title":"A Long Way from Home: Growing Up in the American Heartland (Tom Brokaw)","review":"Review of Tom Brokaw's A Long Way From HomeTom Brokaw's A Long Way From Home: Growing up in the American Heartland provides a fascinating look into the roots of one of America's most beloved television newsmen. Brokaw's story about his humble begins in rural South Dakota and the life lessons learned during his childhood delivers a theme of how the formative years will impact the rest of people's lives--no matter how far from home life takes them. Brokaw narrates how dependent all his life's successes have been on the values taught to him by his upbringing in the American heartland.Brokaw begins his novel by telling the story of the evolution of his family since they settled in the South Dakota. He tells of great-grandfather's role in shaping the town of Bristol, SD and of his father's day's delivering coal and ice to support himself at age 10. The Great Depression's impact on both his father's and mother's lives is explained and is never forgotten, as it is a familiar theme throughout Brokaw's childhood.The novel then moves on to the various stops in Brokaw's South Dakota childhood. From Igloo, the site of his first Public speaking performance, to Yankton where he graduated high school and landed his first broadcasting job. Along the way, Brokaw tells of childhood mischief and misadventures with his younger brothers and childhood friends in the great outdoors. Brokaw openly and honestly reveals his struggles with failure as young man after high school and the rocky relationship that developed into a marriage to the love of his life, Meredith Auld.The issue of race and the importance of his mother also warrant entire chapters in the book. Brokaw explains his view of Native Americans as a child and of his realization the injustices done against them in his home state. Brokaw's mother, Jean Conely Brokaw, had the greatest influence on Tom's life. Her work ethic and even her political consciousness and news acquiring habits were passed on to her eldest son. Brokaw beautifully illustrates her role in his family and in his life.Overall, I was pleasantly surprised with Brokaw's memoirs. I was expecting a soppy, romanticized version of his life, but it was definitely not that. The book is a page-turning, relatable collection of funny stories and life lessons."},{"Title":"A Long Way from Home: Growing Up in the American Heartland (Tom Brokaw)","review":"Veteran newscaster Brokaw made me weep with THE GREATEST GENERATION, so I had high hopes for this one. Undoubtedly, his essays are thoughtfully, honestly written and he is both a gentleman and a scholar. However, this work is often too self indulgent (as autobiographical works can be!) to evoke much emotion from the average reader. For example: It's hard to get too choked up over his financial struggles in the post-Depression midwest when, in the same sentence, he mentions negotiating a multi-million dollar contract or his sprawling Manhattan condo.I look forward to adding more of Brokaw's works to my library, and hope he will devote a good portion of his upcoming retirement from the Nightly News to writing!"},{"Title":"A Long Way from Home: Growing Up in the American Heartland (Tom Brokaw)","review":"A very interesting book that brings back a lot of memories for me, growing up in North Dakota during the same time period.

Although the tone is warm and nostalgic throughout, Brokaw does not view the past exclusively through rose-colored glasses; he's quite frank about the discriminaton Native Americans have suffered in his homeland; and he's quite open about a period of his own youth when he strayed off the right path for a while.

But, it was how his family was able to handle the hardships through hard work, ingenuity, and integrity that stuck with Brokaw and what made him successful and more importantly happy in life.

Seriously, there couldn't be a worse book."},{"Title":"A Long Way from Home: Growing Up in the American Heartland (Tom Brokaw)","review":"Tom Brokaw must think that people care about every facet of his dull life--because he has elaborated on it in so much boring detail in this book that even Brokaw fans will throw their hands up after hearing another insignificant story and say \\"who cares.\\"Sadly, he comes across as a person who considered himself better than others and was incredibly insensitive when it came to class status. He often mentions in the book whether someone is \\"working class\\" and he claims that in high school \\"I was a member of the ruling class...it was a white man's and white boy's world\\" and writes about racism issues that deal with his going to school with Native Americans. If he thinks he is getting sympathy from the reader because he somehow grew beyond his bigotry it is hard to come to that conclusion through this book.Brokaw is trying to build on his past \\"Greatest Generation\\" reputation by painting a picture of his childhood on the South Dakota prairie. But the problem is that it was a pretty boring childhood. Camp, summer jobs, trips to Minneapolis, fitting in at school--almost nothing happened to him that was anything unusual.There are two exceptions that are worth hearing about. First, as a teenager he headed to New York City to appear on a game show with the South Dakota governor and ended up cheating on the show. Yes, he was part of the quiz shows scandals. This is something he probably should not have revealed.Second, the only good thing about the book is that it tells the story of how this partying college kid was \\"counseled\\" to leave school by a caring professor who told him, \\"Get all the wine, women and song out of your system.\\" Though this should embarrass the future anchorman, his professor used it to turn Brokaw's life around. Tom dropped out of college then begged the professor to let him back in as a serious student.The book is also deceptive in length. It may look like a long book of over a couple hundred pages, but the types is double spaced and there are about 30 pages of picture-only pages mixed in the middle of chapters, so the actual length of the book would be about 100 pages in a normal book.After reading this book any favorable opinion people have of Brokaw should decrease because he comes across as a smug, arrogant, rich guy who thinks his lowly upbringing was something special. It wasn't--he was raised the same way most other people were in the Midwest and nothing really changed for him until that college professor gave him a verbal kick in the pants to change his life."},{"Title":"A Long Way from Home: Growing Up in the American Heartland (Tom Brokaw)","review":"One reviewer called this book \\"for simpletons by a simpleton.\\" Well, as I have very little respect for today's mainstream media, especially Dan Rather and Katie Couric, Brokaw, though preachy, is better than most. This book is a simple book, but it's also pleasant and does lend insight into his modest upbringing in South Dakota---far different from what the elites usually value.I read it while I drove cross country, which is probably why I gave it 3 stars, rather than 2, as I appreciated it more.Brokaw may be biased and pedantic now, but he's no ninnyhammer either. He covered stories with some depth, and was rarely lazy or a liar, like Rather. And he worked hard to get where he was, without modern affirmative action. The stories of Big Sky country and the \\"tragedies\\" he observed befalling the \\"Natives\\" when he returned were unnecessary and awkward, though.He's still better than Brian Williams."},{"Title":"A Long Way from Home: Growing Up in the American Heartland (Tom Brokaw)","review":"In our hearts we realize that wherever we lived in those days we were basically raised in the same manner.

I was raised in Detroit Michigan, being the same age as Mr. Brokaw the book spoke perfectly of our upbringing. I believe that our strength as a nation was shown by all ages after 9/11. Those values came charging back though some of the younger ones didn't know exactly where they had arrived from. We elders know. As the youth now say &quot; We are all on the same page&quot;.

I grew up in a small town in central Montana. Brokaw's parents were very frugal, as were mine, by necessity. Brokaw had aunts who worked in a creamery; my father was a butter maker in a creamery for 40 years. Brokaw now owns a ranch in Montana. He is such a down-to-earth journalist and writer. I also enjoy seeing him on Morning Joe and The Today Show on NBC.

It doesn't take long to discover that Brokaw's upbringing is so mundane and ordinary that it's almost painful to tread through this book. I suppose there may be some ardent fans of his or maybe family or friends of Brokaw's that would want to know the minute details of his early life, but otherwise you might as well be reading about any random person from mid 20th century South Dakota. Nothing out of the ordinary at all happens in Brokaw's early life and this book deals with none of the latter half of his life (where he actually became noteworthy), thus unless you have insomnia I don't recommend bothering with this book at all."},{"Title":"A Long Way from Home: Growing Up in the American Heartland (Tom Brokaw)","review":"Before Tom Brokaw became one of America's most famous anchormen, he was a kid with white bucks and a ducktail trying to make his mark in the hardscrabble world of South Dakota, circa 1950. \\"A Long Way From Home\\" details that journey in a thorough if bloodless kind of way.Published in 2002, shortly after his similarly rootsy appreciation tome \\"The Greatest Generation\\" became a mega-bestseller, \\"A Long Way From Home\\" seems to ride the coattails of that success. It recites facts from the author's boyhood, pleasant and otherwise, without much subjective sense of what it was like to have lived though them.Instead you get pages and pages of platitudes, as if from an Oscar speech gone awry: \\"Time and distance have sharpened my understanding of the forces that shaped my parents' lives and mine so enduringly. These forces are the grid on which I've come to rely, in good times and bad.\\"That's stiff enough even for an introduction, but the book continues like that for all of its 200-plus pages. At least they are wide-type, double-spaced pages, with photos showing a young Tommy looking not unlike Charlie Brown's long-lost pal Shermy. Yet narrative padding makes a slow-moving read even slower. Often he pauses from a brief story to explain a life lesson learned, or just bask in how far he has come. At times, Brokaw even catalogues various global events in a given year, like the fall of the Peron regime or the introduction of the Chrysler.\\"America was booming, but that was of little comfort to 12-year-old Red Brokaw,\\" he writes of his father. About one boyhood town, \\"Ravinia was a snapshot of America in transition from the party-line telephone system to rotary dial; from kerosene lamps to full electrical power...\\" After a while, I stopped hearing his resonant tones in my mind, and started hearing another Midwestern broadcasting legend, WJM's Ted Baxter.A good memoir gives you a sense of what the people around the author were like, rather than what values they imparted on young Tom. Except for a few instances, bits of detail about teasing drunks, shoveling snow with a snaggle-toothed Swede, or waiting on a pair of down-and-out boxers, he seems content to skim the surface, surveying his life rather than examining it.He does offer some amusing anecdotes, though they feel more like filled-out cocktail-party banter than anything introspective. One of his early college radio interviews was with that year's new Miss South Dakota, whom he greeted quite unintentionally as \\"honey\\". He was teased pretty good about it later, though it didn't hurt him as he wound up not only keeping his job but marrying Miss South Dakota.Pain wasn't a stranger to Brokaw, but it could have been much worse. Brokaw is frank and somewhat humble, in his self-important way, in acknowledging this point. Did adult success make for a dull boy? I don't think so; I believe Brokaw's youth had a good memoir in it. But this wasn't it. Unless you are a Brokaw fan or have a deep, specific interest in the Midwest at mid-century, this is not worth your time."},{"Title":"A Long Way from Home: Growing Up in the American Heartland (Tom Brokaw)","review":"If you like memoirs and are tired of hard-luck childhoods, this might be the book for you. It's not really a celebrity memoir, and it's certainly not a tell-all, as it ends with his marriage at 22. Brokaw was the golden boy of his high school--athlete (though not a star), student body president, and Boys' State governor. The only things he didn't excel at, besides sports, were music and Algebra II. He also had some difficulty getting the hometown girl he wanted, Miss South Dakota Meredith Auld, as she spurned him for \\"having a girl in every port\\" and for his irresponsibility during his senior year of high school and freshman year of college. He cleaned up his act, though, and even won over her prestigious parents, despite his own blue collar upbringing. His father was a heavy machinery operator for the Army Corps of Engineers, and Tom's mother worked at the post office and then later managed a shoe store. Brokaw was lucky in that he never lacked for good role models and mentors, including his very industrious parents. Still, his ego and affinity for partying almost derailed him at a time when he felt that he could do no wrong and would always be forgiven occasional lapses."},{"Title":"A Long Way from Home: Growing Up in the American Heartland (Tom Brokaw)","review":"A wonderful, informative, interesting and honest look at the making up of Tom Brokaw. I felt as if I was there watching him and looking around at the scope of the land that was his home. I was amused at his smug self confidence of his youth, sort of reminded me of myself! Totally enjoyable account of his growing up years."},{"Title":"The Story of Patriarch and Prophets; as Illustrated in the Lives of Holy Men of Old","review":"It was not the book I wanted it was Volume 2 in a series of books, but my second order was the book that My Mom wanted.

Anyone who is in a relationship with someone of a different background whether it's religious, racial, or ethnic will appreciate this book. Even individuals who maybe contemplating a relationship that fosters differences will have a better understanding. Subtle differences can enhance or create friction in the relationship. This book celebrate differences. I hope everyone will embrace our differences!"},{"Title":"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner : Celebrating Interethnic, Interfaith, and Interracial Relationships","review":"In searching for ways to help me understand my relationship with my Kenyan boyfriend better, I (American) turned to books about intercultural relationships. This was the first one I read. It is very encouraging. It is full of other people's stories and experiences in being in an intercultural relationship. They describe issues that came up in their relationship - some which were expected and some which were total surprises - and how they worked through those issues. They are real life stories, so they don't all live happily ever after.I enjoyed reading the happy stories of the couples who were able to make their relationships work despite their differences. It was also helpful to know about the couples who did not stay together, and what happened to them that made them end their relationship."},{"Title":"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner : Celebrating Interethnic, Interfaith, and Interracial Relationships","review":"Sensitively written, entertaining read, very informative for those seeking insight particularly on dynamics of black-white relationships. Unfortunately, if you are not in this kind of relationship yourself, much of the rest of the book barely serves but for a token mention, which I read as a disservice to the customer. No book can be all things to all people and the author merits respect for 1) speaking of what she knows (her own relationship) and 2) attempting to report wisdom gleaned from her interviews with other intercultural/ interracial couples. However, a better-aimed advertisement would ensure a better match, e.g. that it is a black-white relationship book, with a smattering of other kinds of international relationships to add perspective. Unfortunately without this kind of caveat upfront, the other interviews come off as a token effort in a book trying to market itself as insightful for most international couples, which it is not, really.Still it's a difficult subject to broach and the author made an admirable attempt. It needs, perhaps, a companion book, from an equally powerfully expressive author of perhaps another major demographic background (Hispanic? Asian? other?) That, I think would make all the difference."},{"Title":"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner : Celebrating Interethnic, Interfaith, and Interracial Relationships","review":"I watched a PBS special on black white relations and Prof Gates talked about a film with the same title as this book starring Sidney Poitier that he used as a reference when attending Harvard. I thought this book might give helpful advice for those of us in black white relationships.While the book is an easy read and full of interesting stories, the stories are quite dated and don't really address modern problems. If you ever read Ann Landers' column in the newspaper and can recall the WWII how-we-met stories, then you'll enjoy this book as the couples interviewed seem to have married in the 50's and early 60's. As life is substantially different now, I didn't find any of the stories helpful. In fact, in an age where people research each other on Facebook, then Google each other for criminal records, then date as friends with benefits, then agree to live together for a few years before agreeing to marriage, these stories of couples marrying on a whim then whining later about blatantly fundamental conflicts but gainfully trying to make it work anyway only to eventually throw in the towel and of course behave badly during the divorce just look childish.I was hoping for something more insightful such as I'm a minority surrounded by the majority so although I am aware of both worlds, my partner is not. How do I share my world? or the opposite, I'm a minority surrounded by the majority but so locked into my world that I really am oblivious to the majority world. My partner feels neglected when I don't share his world but why should I? Unfortunately, this book addresses neither concern.My friend wrote a research paper on marriages that indicated that mixed race couples had the highest rate of divorce but the numbers referenced in this book dispute that. It would be helpful to know exactly how high the mountain top is before beginning the climb."},{"Title":"Miss America","review":"Don is a teacher of mine I have known for over a year and just today I was in his office and saw this book on a shelf beneath the great books we have been studying from Plato, Homer, and Darwin, among others. I asked if I could borrow it and without hesitation he said, \\"Sure\\". He went on to tell me it was out of print and the copy I was borrowing was mint and worth much more than the cover price. I have not read much other than the first story, 'Miss America', but I already see a lot of him in it. I heard he was the best short story author in America, and I think it may be true. I wish they would bring this back into print and I believe Don Skiles is immensely underrated."},{"Title":"Miss America","review":"Skiles' lead story is alone worth the price of this book. Instead of waking up as an insect, this guy starts taking orders from Miss America in the bed next to him.

A decent view from 30,000 feet, but it was not very helpful to a perl developer thrown kicking and screaming into a project requiring XML and the use of SOAP::Lite. &quot;Disappointment&quot; was the best way to describe it.But *THIS* is the book that the other one should have been - it's fantastic. It is chock-full of real live examples *with code*, the introductory and explanatory material is excellent, and the writing style is simply a joy to read.In particular, the reference material for SOAP::Lite is very much welcome: it was written by the author of the code.Five very glowing stars for this book."},{"Title":"Programming Web Services with Perl","review":"Programming Web Services with Perl is principally a book on implementing solutions using XML-RPC and SOAP in Perl. It also covers complementary and alternative standards such as WSDL, UDDI, and REST in some detail. And on the periphery, it finishes with a whirlwind tour of developing message routing, alternative data encoding within XML, security, transactions, workflow, internationalization, service discovery, extension, and management techniques and specifications.The book assumes the reader will have the knowledge of an intermediate level Perl programmer. I.e., the reader is assumed to have a working knowledge of references, data structures, and object-oriented Perl. On the other hand no previous knowledge of XML, XML-RPC, SOAP or XML related technologies is required.It should also be mentioned that both of the authors Randy J. Ray and Pavel Kulchenko are also the principle developers of the most popular XML-RPC and SOAP Perl modules: XML::RPC and SOAP::Lite respectively. That said, the book is not a soap box for the authors to tout the merits of their tools.Rather, it is a practical book which starts with grounding fundamentals. Readers should walk away with a core understanding of XML-RPC and SOAP and not just a particular tool set for working with them. The authors examine the alternative XML-RPC and SOAP tools, illustrate how they are used, and give practical and even handed reasons why their modules should be preferred. Which comes down to issues of features, active development, support, and the amount of work required to code to a particular interface. They then settle down to a comfortable and thorough guide to XML::RPC and SOAP::Lite.The topics and issues are illustrated throughout using real world web services. For example creating an XML-RPC client for O'Reilly's Meerkat news wire, or a SOAP client to covert use.perl.org's journal stream to RSS. Code is presented to the reader filtered down to highlight each particular issue as it is discussed. This is nice in that it avoids listing slight variations of the same code multiple times, but on the down side it can also leave the reader flipping back and forth to reassemble an example in their head. Full code for each example is provided in the appendices. And all of the example code may be downloaded from O'Reilly at [their web site].All-in-all, the book is a thorough practical introduction to working with XML-RPC, SOAP and related technologies. When I started reading the book, I was a bit disappointed to see that it only covered XML-RPC and SOAP related services. When I finished, I was impressed with how very much information they'd managed to pack into so few pages.And yet, I was left wishing there'd been a more through coverage of interoperability issues between other SOAP implementations and things like custom de-serializers. To be honest interoperability and de-serialization are mentioned, and the authors do an excellent job of referring the reader on to sources for continued reading on most other topics.The book does an admirable job balancing content, length, and information density. Not to mention an excellent job delivering the information that will still be relevant years and not just weeks from the date published. Most of the topics I'd wished to see covered in more depth are those that are still developing and consequently most likely to become quickly dated. In short a well balanced practical guide to applying XML-RPC and SOAP to solve problems."},{"Title":"Programming Web Services with Perl","review":"This book desperately needs an update with real-world SOAP examples passing complex data into SOAP::Lite running in PERL."},{"Title":"Programming Web Services with Perl","review":"As with all O'Reilly books there's a great intro to the technologies. They take you through how it works, not just how to deploy some code.

Ray's RPC::XML modules (he's also one of the authors). I've been fighting with getting the 'system.*' handlers hacked in with other aproaches and it was great to see someone had already figured out such a clean approach.

The first has to do with leveling and then raising the playing field. Leveling involves removing the negatives of barriers, 'isms', and biases in appointment, assignment and promotion, while raising the playing field involves proactive practices to build cross-difference partnership, ensure continuous individual and team development and create systems to enable all people to do their best work (i.e. to allow for individual and cultural differences in approaches).The second is based on an 'Inclusion Breakthrough Cycle', the elements of which are developed in the five chapters of Part 2 of the book.The third - Creating an Inclusion Breakthrough - is based on development of a methodology incorporating 4 phases:* Building the Platform for Change* Creating Momentum* Making Diversity and Inclusion a Way of Life* Leveraging learning and Challenging the New Status QuoEach phase contains specified actions, which are detailed in the four chapters of the part.None of the material is 'rocket science', but the authors do take a systemic approach to the issue and they set out a sound and useful process, which is clearly explained. It is, of course, fundamentally a particular application of wider approaches to organizational learning, focused on the specific issue of diversity."},{"Title":"The Inclusion Breakthrough","review":"To be honest, I am not well-read on the subject of diversity. I have much to learn, and this was just the book for me! What I love about the book is how it helps me (and my clients) imagine what could be done and how to do it. Given the opportunity, I doubt I'd do it exactly as Miller and Katz write about it, but their practical model (coming out of long experience) is a valuable backboard for my own ideas.This book does not get stuck in an affirmative action box or strategy. It reaches beyond to a larger organizational perspective, serving everyone in the process. This book's ideas create more complete, productive and human organizations; it is not just about neglected or mistreated workers. With its larger scope, it serves everyone.The real power of the book can be found in the dynamics of its title and subtitle: It's inclusion AND diversity, not OR, not VS. The creative pairing of these two words produces new possibilities--and that's what the authors help you learn about.The book is readable, built around a central model. The authors do a good job of leading you through their thinking. And, their long experience shows in every chapter."},{"Title":"The Inclusion Breakthrough","review":"Creating diverse and inclusive work cultures seem to be hot, albeit sticky, topics these days. When I picked up this book I was worried that it might spout esoteric jargon. Instead, I found that the book was insightful and easy to understand. Miller and Katz don't assume that you need a Ph.D. in organizational development to create change-you can begin using the methodology immediately. The book is full of useful models, real-life examples (successes AND failures), and easy-to-use steps towards building an environment where all people feel included and appreciated."},{"Title":"The Inclusion Breakthrough","review":"What I like most about this book is that it gives so many examples of what different companies are actually doing - how they are being more successful using their diversity.

I peruse dozens of topical books before choosing one for my students. Important to me: (1) book assumes no prior knowledge; (2) book is not so dense and difficult to read that a student would hate me for assigning it; (3) and despite (1) and (2) above, it still gets deeply, academically and substantively into the subject matter. Inclusion Breakthrough does a pretty good job of meeting my requirements, although it gets only 4 stars because there are places in the book through which one must trudge. However, the students take away a solid understanding of the implications of diversity for their workplace, and concrete tools that they can apply. I like this book. I use Jerry Diller's \\"Cultural Diversity: A Primer for Human Services\\" instead for students whose interests are in service provision, e.g. hunger, education, mental illness, etc. It is also a good book, although I give it only 4 stars for it's occasional oversimplification."},{"Title":"The Inclusion Breakthrough","review":"Don't waste your money on this title.

Buried in Burrywood is set in Washington, and The Madd Mountain Murders takes place in the mountains of California. Each tale revolves around either a mansion or a resort, with lots of nooks and crannies to hide corpses, whether frozen or not. But Lana Waite has clearly outdone herself with her latest spooky whodunit, set in Grampus Island, where Granada Inn is located.Maren O'Connor has a talent for trying to help her relatives run their resorts in times of need. It isn't her fault that people begin to die just as she arrives on the scene. But when she is called by her long ago fiance, Norman, to come back to her family inn in Granada, California, she answers the call, even if it means leaving her comfortable little business in the city to help out an ailing aunt, who may or may not have been poisoned. The problem is, nine years before Maren was on a sailing trip with her parents and twin brother during which her parents died from apparent food poisoning, and her brother washed overboard during a sudden storm as Maren tried to guide to boat back to shore. Or was he? And who is the monk who is haunting the Inn?Maren arrives on the scene to find her aunt in a frail condition and the inn's main desk undermanned. It seems that there is a smuggling operation taking place in the inn's cellars and some very unsavory characters hanging around like wraiths. Maren's childhood friend, a cop in town, never seems to be there when she needs him, and his boss continually gives her the eye:\\"'What are you doing here anyway?' I asked. 'I'm sure you're not just taking a walk. You must have been following me.' Was that why I had felt watched? 'Are you following me?' He ignored my question. 'Why did you come here?' I looked around and spread my hands. 'It's my family's burial ground.' I was amazed that he should ask.'\\"In her own inimitable fashion, Lana Waite hooks the reader from the first page with her fast-paced plot, quirky characters, and well-crafted writing.

His understanding comes from the historical perspective - he writes an informative and enlightening, though not entertaining, history of the organization. However, he tends to focus on the purchasing power of the OPEC countries, rather than realizing that OPEC had reached a peak in it's power by the time his book was published. Granted, we cannot expect Mr. Smith to have predicted what would happen to OPEC. On the other hand, he surely cannot have thought that the US would be reduced to supplying military equipment to the new Arabic superpowers (this, he implies, is essentially the only way we can attain anything approaching an import/export balance with Saudi Arabia).A few chapters are spent on real estate, the market for which Mr. Smith thinks is now controlled by speculators and people attempting to hedge against inflation. He decides that the long bull market in housing has finally ended. Alas for Mr. Smith's reputation, it has yet to do so, with the median price for a home increasing every year since his book was written (as it had done every year before).Mr. Smith, however, manages to redeem himself near the end of the book, when he makes his stock market prediction. At the time he wrote the book, the Dow was at 900. He predicted that within ten years, it would rise to 2700, an amazingly accurate guess. However, in reading his reasons for a prediction, we can see that his bullishness has almost nothing to do with what actually moved the market. Overall, this book is worthwhile only to the true Adam Smith fanatic or to someone trying to thouroughly research the economic situation of the 1970's."},{"Title":"Paper money","review":"I have read this book twice, once in college as an economics major, shortly after it was released, and again a few weeks ago. I thoroughly enjoyed both times. Although Smith rambles at times, it is an entertaining and informative look at macroeconomics in the 70's and teaches things that you won't find in Economics 101 textbooks. If you like reading about these matters, you'll find this book enlightening and fun. If you don't, there may be enough anecdotes, and such, to keep your interest through the book, but it won't be enjoyable for you. (There's a reason they call economics \\"the dismal science.\\")"},{"Title":"Paper money","review":"In the 1970s, the world economy suffered heavily from brutal spikes in the oil price.One of the culprits was OPEC, which was formed on the model of the 'Texas Railroad Commission'.The rise in the oil price provoked an enormous wealth transfer from the oil consuming to the oil producing countries.Moreover, the oil consuming countries were confronted with the choice between higher taxes or printing money and chose for the latter. But in the US, the bill of the Vietnam War was still not paid. It all ended in stagflation, a mighty drop of the dollar (\`my swissies') and a real estate bust.Adam Smith gives us also a brilliant course on the origin of banks and money.This book reads like a thriller and is a must read for all those interested in the economy of the 1970s in the West.For an in depth analysis of the oil crises, I highly recommend the book by F. William Engdahl \`A Century of War.'"},{"Title":"Paper money","review":"I first read this book back when it came out, and have reread it twice over the years since.

Gold, the oil industry, OPEC, and their effects on the economy are the whole point of the book! Like anything else, I guess, you take out what you put in.

Every challenge, great or small, is moving you to look deeper and draw forth the highest in you. You're never given a challenge beyond your ability to meet and master. You'll rise above every circumstance because you're greater than any circumstance.\\" ~Alan CohenAlan Cohen's wisdom continues to inspire me after years of hearing excerpts from his books on the \\"Dave 'til Dawn\\" show. Every time Dave Wingert would read a quote or passage it would be exactly what I needed to hear. Finally, I decided to read all of Alan's books and thought I should start with \\"Wisdom of the Heart.\\"Alan Cohen's message accesses a deep place of peace and can calm a troubled heart. His insight and wisdom will resonate with your core beliefs, no matter what religion you espouse. If there is a battle between your head and heart, this book will quickly remedy any doubts and will foster an environment in which you can escape the tyranny of the mind.Through aphorisms, lessons, poems, quotations, humorous stories and parables, Alan provides a calm environment in which you can reconnect with your heart. Unique quotes and passages from Anatole France, Theophane the Monk, Parker J. Palmer, Rumi, William Shakespeare, D. H. Lawrence, William James, Piet Hein, Walt Whitman and Albert Schweitzer made this book quite interesting. Especially since these were not quotes you would find that easily.

It seems to be around 1960. A man, unnamed, wishes to visit his youngest brother, with whom he has only a distant relationship (he is ten years older than this brother and, from internal clues in the story, the man appears to have been born around 1926, just as the author was). But - metaphorically speaking -- to get to the brother he must proceed through their father, who is dead. And to get to the father, in the sense of knowing him again, of establishing a clear (and fair) picture of him in his own mind, he must revisit the past and in some sense become his father (become both a critic of his father and a devil's advocate for his father). These are the two voices in which the reader is addressed by the anonymous narrator - his own and that of his father as remembered and as re-imagined in a way allowing him to defend himself in the mind of his son.The father was a carpenter by trade and a man who had one big adventure in his life - leaving his wife and four children behind for a year to work in Persia in the 1930's. The family lives in a small Moravian village, unnamed, situated in hilly country along the border with Slovakia. The narrator loved this country as a boy and especially loved the comfortable adventures of woods-trekking, tree-cutting, and apple-stealing that he undertook with his father. The village and its neighboring villages are filled with aunts, uncles and cousins as well as schoolmates and friends. It's idyllic, but a far from perfect place - the narrator remembers injustice and petty class conflict, but it seems manageable, especially by his clever and opinionated father. The world of the narrator's childhood is defined by its local boundaries and local flavor. It seems \\"timeless\\" as the world of childhood often does. However, its coziness and even the premises of its existence undergo profound changes during the man's adolescence and adult life - the forced dismemberment of Czechoslovakia, the military occupation of Bohemia and Moravia by the Germans establishing a \\"Protectorate\\", the war, and the profound changes brought about by the establishment of the new communist government in 1948.The old world is gone and the new one is being built. His father is one of the builders. He has become the chairman of the Party's local council in the village. He's keen on his new role and begins to ride roughshod over local farmers and artisans who resist the changes and who resent being directed to participate in collective enterprises of which they are skeptical. If they refuse they are penalized, not so much by direct punishment as by exclusion from access to decent work and to the normal necessities of life. The man's father applies these harsh measures to old friends and family without exception. It makes for tension and gloominess with his wife and children, even though he explains his ideas of socialist justice and the imperatives of building the new society to them. His family does not disintegrate as a result of these new conditions, but it does separate and drift apart as families do over time - the narrator's long-suffering mother (who won't sacrifice her own standards of justice when she appraises her husband's career) dies, and the three brothers and their sister disperse to new lives. In his last years the father becomes a collective farm manager and remarries a woman with a young child. The new marriage is both understood and resented at the same time by the narrator. Soon after the marriage the man's father dies in hospital from a brain tumor, and the final talks of father and son hint at a reconciliation without either party explicitly asking for or offering forgiveness for perceived wrongs (in other words, the usual mess where our actions do not match our intentions and even our intentions are unclear to us as well as others). The narrator is uncertain if his father at last understands how much he has dehumanized himself in the pursuit of his ideals. On the other hand the experience of his father's illness and death forces the narrator to re-evaluate the new wife in a more positive light after he sees her at her best in grim conditions.The dispersed family and its situation tell us something about the new society that is being built. The narrator has become a successful journalist, living and working in Prague. As such he and his colleagues must trim their sails to suit the constant ideological breeze that emanates from the Party leadership. His own wife has a tense relationship with his father, worried that her husband may be transformed into his replica. His sister is married to a factory worker in their old village, which has become transformed into a grimy town as a result of rapid industrialization and construction of residential block housing. Its skies, hills and streams are now dirty, unattractive. His youngest brother is a substitute bus-driver struggling to turn even that meager job into a full-time one in order to be able to establish a family. His other brother, only vaguely sketched as the insightful one who gave their father the most respect and support, works somewhere in Slovakia. The relatives who remained behind in the village no longer wish to see the narrator's father - his hard ways have made him a persona-non-grata in their lives. The narrator wishes to maintain his respect for his father while he realizes his father has played a role in causing the suffering of his officially disdained uncle and cousins. It's difficult for him to balance the scales, as it always is when we examine the career of a man on a mission who leaves damage along his path. The situation is one in which the \\"formal socialist justice\\" championed by his father rolls ahead like a machine and produces deplorably unjust results in individual cases.In imaginatively going through the father so that he can arrive literally at his youngest brother's doorstep the narrator is also undertaking a specific mission - the return of his father's cremated body to a hillside meadow of which he was especially fond as a young man (his father had engaged his bride there and taken his son there for both sunny and snowy walks and wood-cutting expeditions). The narrator wishes to strew his father's ashes there, and the journey from the old family home to the meadow is filled with both pleasure and apprehension (some of his memories of the woods evoke the typical fears of a small boy who finds that he might be lost and alone in the forest). The description of the countryside in this passage -- and in many others when he recalls the specific surroundings of childhood exploits -- is extremely lyrical and touching. But you can't be saved by scenery ; you have to work at salvation, one day and one task at a time.And work at salvation the narrator will, in his own way as a journalist, because it's become obvious to him as to most of his countrymen that they will have to rescue themselves from the strange and inhumane apparatus which their fathers and they built, at times with enthusiasm, and always without insight into the logic and dynamics of power as it goes about creating the \\"new man\\" in an ideologically constructed society. Things are falling apart everywhere, there is corruption and shabbiness everywhere, and yet no one dares to point out the obvious for fear of discrediting the dream and its chosen implementers (who, in point of fact, may have once been chosen but are now appointed through force and misrepresentation).This constructive reformist attitude now leads the narrator into his own mission, a journalistic misadventure which turns into a scandal and a quandary. His investigation of a case of local injustice to a young woman (denial of admission to a school for spurious reasons) leads to two very different outcomes - her suicide and his creation of a problem for the authorities. As he and his colleagues take the misadventure apart and \\"politically\\" reassemble it to protect both him and their journal he undergoes some confusion in his own mind about what he is actually responsible for: a necessary reform, an unnecessary death, or both? As it is presented this incident appears to me to be emblematic of Vaculik's ambiguous self-appraisal at this point in his career as an intellectual and artist - will his work help to reform the system or will it destroy the system whose basic idea of socialist justice still appeals to him? And hovering over this are the bigger doubts -- can the system even be reformed in any meaningful way, and if we destroy it will it be replaced with something worse? This story-within-a-story also supplies some of the novel's sharper dialogue in the form of comical exchanges that take place in the journal's offices as the staff wrestles with the problem of how to handle their colleague's indiscretions. The comedy, which has some sinister undertones, takes us directly into a more serious philosophical discussion between the narrator and his fellow-writer, the corrosive but insightful Slavek. When the narrator and Slavek consider the collective complicity of themselves and their fellow citizens in creating their own mess, they reach the gloomy conclusion that, \\"Actually, that's what the Czech invention amounts to - terrorizing ourselves so democratically that there's no one for us to assassinate.\\" The discussion has unforeseen consequences and echoes, which I will not describe here, except to say that they have a bearing (as an unseen force) on the narrator's eventual meeting with his brother; in fact, several strands of the story lead to this meeting resulting in unexpected and symbolic actions. I won't comment on those either, since you will enjoy getting there on your own.If there is a \\"classical\\" predecessor or model for this story it is Turgenev's \\"Fathers and Sons\\" (with its better, alternate title of \\"Fathers and Children\\"), but in \\"The Axe\\" all of the polarities of this story are reversed. In the Russian novel it is the sons (primarily Bazarov) who become harsh agents of progressivism, cynically mocking the humane ideals and pretensions of their elders because they appear to be futile. I say this is the model because the events in an alternative source of inspiration (Dostoyevsky's \\"The Possessed\\", a far more extreme and dramatic work, downright feverish, depicting a pathological relationship between Verkhovensky and his son) are driven by the anarchistic rage of the son and his idol, the totally icy and empty Stavrogin. At least Bazarov wants to proceed rationally and humanely to recreate the world and has no wish to see it go up in flames. He's all for hard and thankless work, incremental improvements, not heroics. In \`The Axe\\" the narrator's father is the \\"Bazarov\\" type.This is the story (or intertwined stories) as it is told, more or less. The manner of its telling has great appeal. Vaculik utilizes a fluid approach to both time and narrative voice - I'm here now while being there then, and I am he while he is me -- and often this fluidity is elliptical as well. Don't worry, it's not confusing after you catch the drift and grasp the antiphonal nature of the interior monologues which are dialogues. There is comedy, irony, and a good deal of old-fashioned nature-lyricism; the latter is apt in the recreation of one's youthful impressions and sensibilities, whether one was raised in a sleepy country village or an urban apartment building. Great praise should go to the translator from the Czech, Marian Sling, who has done an excellent job in conveying the author's highly personal style.And now a brief word about the politics of the period that influenced the subject- matter of this work. Within a year of this book's publication Vaculik had written the \\"Two Thousand Words\\" manifesto of public complaint, criticism and demand for reform. Both his novel and the manifesto (along with the works of other Czechs and Slovaks) were part of the growing dissent movement which resulted in the Prague Spring events of 1968. The system's response (Russian military occupation, extreme repression of dissenting intellectuals for years to come) reduced many artists to silence, co-operation, or self-imposed exile. Others flourished in a way, but in a very small arena - the readership of a few hundred people who were still willing to compose \\"samizdat\\" manuscripts and circulate them among trusted friends and allies, sometimes to be smuggled out of the country for publication abroad. Vaculik's fate was not a kind one. He wasn't jailed but he was harassed and hemmed in for the next twenty years and not allowed to publish anything within Czechoslovakia. You can get the flavor of how demoralizing his situation was by reading the collection of his underground essays published in the West as \\"A Cup of Coffee with my Interrogator: The Prague Chronicles of Ludvik Vaculik\\". The last essay in this collection is dated 1987, when another fresh breeze of reform was starting to blow as a consequence of Gorbachev's policy of \\"glasnost\\". By this time Vaculik was beginning to despair of reform because he felt the bulk of his fellow citizens had become apathetic and indifferent, not even responding to the physical ravaging and pollution of their own country. Worse, he believed that most people had bought into the Party's \\"normalization of life\\" phase (a sort of Czechoslovakian \\"goulash communism\\" comparable to the revised system in Hungary - summarized as, \\"we feed you, we house you, we give you jobs and entertainment, we crank out some nice consumer objects, you do what you want in your free time, but, please just leave us (the Party leadership) alone and life will be fine.\\") Then came the Velvet Revolution in which the Party disintegrated peacefully and Vaculik's old friend and ally, Vaclav Havel, was elevated to the highest office. And Vaculik took a new direction in his writing (i.e., his novel \\"The Guinea Pigs\\"), somewhat liberated from the constant pressure of politics and polemics, which can inspire but also deform art. The story is not over -- Vaculik celebrated his 80th birthday this past July and he continues to think."},{"Title":"The Axe (European Classics)","review":"Multiple narrators and a non linear narrative in a rambling, disjointed remembrance, far from scintillating.Whether it be the translation or the original, The Axe is a wearisome novel - potentially of interest to any analysing ethical dilemmas of cadres and functionaries under communism but otherwise very forgettable.The brilliance of The Guinea Pigs is nowhere to be found here."},{"Title":"Mechanical Measurements","review":"This text provides a good, basic overview of methods for measuring several physical phenomena.

Some things are also changed. Best thing is the price, but I would rather have better quality."},{"Title":"JIGSAW MEN","review":"First off, this isn't a typical Amazon title, rather it is the product of PS Publishing, which puts out limited, signed editions by various science fiction and fantasy authors. Specifically, \\"Jigsaw Men\\" by Gary Greenwood was limited to 300 hardcover and another 500 paperback copies, and at the time of this writing, some copies were still available from the publisher. Moreover, there are copies available on the internet, and should the opportunity to acquire a copy present itself, I would strongly recommend doing so.A big problem with many alternate histories is the need for exposition at the expense of plot. For example, an author spends so much time explaining why the South won the Civil War, precious little time is left for characters to interact and grow in the altered timeline. One would expect that this situation would be compounded in a novella, where length becomes a limiting factor, and then compounded again by the odd amalgam that forms the backbone of Gary Greenwood's \\"Jigsaw Men\\". It's hard enough to succinctly portray the above scenario, but Greenwood has gone far beyond that relatively simple scenario, as he posits the \\"what ifs?\\" of a world in which Dr. Frankenstein succeeded in making his monster and Martians invaded and were beaten off as predicted by H. G. Wells. Happily, Greenwood succeeds admirably; producing a world that is drastically altered, nicely realized and fully believable, and at the same time, introducing an engaging plot and characters, and all the while drawing relevant parallels to our own world.If it wasn't for the setting, \\"Jigsaw Men\\" would be a noir-esque detective thriller. Loaded with all the elements of the genre (seedy locales, prurient scandals, streetwise cops) the mystery would be compelling enough without any allo-historical element. However, it is this altered timeline that really makes the story; it elevates what would be an entertaining, but generic, mystery into an interesting commentary on morals, and international relations. The British Empire of Greenwood's timeline is plainly a metaphor for the U.S. today, and in many ways his Prussia is today's UK. In \\"Jigsaw Men\\" Britain is still an Empire, and the globe's dominant power, with Prussia as a staunch, if somewhat restive ally. Furthermore, much like today, no matter how benevolent the UK attempts to be, there is an element of hubris which colors its actions. Thus, a relatively straightforward disappearance becomes a major espionage crisis as Greenwood questions whether cracks in hegemony must become holes, and whether or not that is a bad thing.Now that I've spent so much time saying why Greenwood has produced something beyond a merely altered timeline, I feel obligated to state how much I loved the purely alternate history elements. The premise is engaging enough, but Greenwood takes it in directions I never would have expected. To delve too deeply might spoil the plot, but Frankenstein Monsters as the ultimate soldiers and Martian technology as the greatest State secret of Great Britain are just two of the interesting ideas put forward. However, it is the small things that make or break an alternate history, and Greenwood comes up with plenty to make his story feel familiar but foreign. Again, I don't want to give anything away, but my personal favorite was a sly reference to the passions of British soccer fans: he mentions fans of rival teams have friendly chats after games.Like most things in literature (or life) there's no right or wrong way to write alternate history. However, truly great additions to the genre transcend the academic exercise of imagining another world (which is no mean accomplishment when done well) and reveal something fundamental about the human condition, or even more interestingly, our values and culture. To my mind, no one has done this better than J. N. Stroyar in her massive \\"The Children's War\\". Likewise, another PS Publishing title, Ken Macleod's \\"The Human Front\\", offered an intriguing critique of political systems, and was, like \\"Jigsaw Men\\" an unusual premise in a short form. Both of those books won the Sidewise Award for Alternate History; it is my expectation that \\"Jigsaw Men\\" will get a long, hard look for the award, and it would not surprise me in the least if it resulted in a trophy for Gary Greenwood and PS Publishing.Jake Mohlman"},{"Title":"Applescript for the Internet (Visual QuickStart Guide)","review":"This is the third AppleScript book I've bought but the first that told me what I needed to know (and made sense)!The book contains a short overivew, starts you with basic basics, goes through most of the language with simple sentences and clear examples, and then ...The fun part!

From 1939 - they published a dozen Botanical Leaflets, they called them. And they give some scientific backing to the stories in here!The first few pages are photos & drawings of Venus Fly-traps and other insect eating plants. They mention a Death Flower, but assume it's fiction. However, they have included a couple of very long stories, with drawings, about this man-eating tree, which almost had me believing it was true! The story of sacrificing a young girl to it has many details, as if an explorer wrote it, and is quite disturbing and gruesome.Highly recommended as an interesting publication put out by a major Natural History Museum, about plants which may or may not be true!"},{"Title":"Linear and Nonlinear Programming","review":"In my opininon it is more clear than the other examples of this category.

Tableaus are obsolete. If you want to solve a linear program, you use Maple, Mathematica, Matlab, GNU Octave or some other computer program.

Definitions are hard find. The algorithms are presented in a very cumbersome manner. The exercises are so many you don't bother even to read them. I would be nicer with a few, carefully selected, exercises.The book would not be nice for an introductory course since everything is presented in such an obfusacted way.

Thank goodness the modern authors haven't hijacked and ruined this story (yet)"},{"Title":"THE LEGENDS OF KING ARTHUR AND HIS KNIGHTS","review":"I have read many books on Arthur over the years and this is a good basis for many of the tales read since this was written."},{"Title":"THE LEGENDS OF KING ARTHUR AND HIS KNIGHTS","review":"It's curious to me that this is the best-selling version of the King Arthur story in the kindle store, because it's a singularly flawed collection, well-eclipsed by other variants that are also available for free online; I suspect its popularity is an artifact of the search engine, not the book's own merits.The author, Sir James Knowles, was an architect and friend of Tennyson, best known for founding the Metaphysical Society; this is, therefore, a very Victorian Arthur. In this case, \\"victorian\\" means \\"bowdlerized to the point of inanity.\\" The story of Merlin's enchantment of Uther and Igraine to arrange Arthur's conception is almost completely elided (\\"When Uther, therefore, was at length happily wedded\\" -- yep, that's the whole story); Sir Tristram is apparently completely chaste with Iseult (King Mark just doesn't like him for some indiscernible reason) and even when Lancelot and Guinevere are caught together and the entire course of the story turns on adultery, such that bowdlerization was completely impossible, Gawain suggests that \\"it may well be that Lancelot was in her chamber for no evil.\\" The story of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight is simply not included at all.I suppose that kind of bowdlerization might be acceptable in a children's version of the Arthur stories, but this edition isn't good for that either, for two reasons: 1) like many free kindle ebooks, all illustrations have been removed, and 2) it's a kindle edition, and who gives a $250 ebook reader to a child too young to read a story with adultery in it?There are other problems also. The King of Gaul (Sir Bors) is an ally for the first third and last third of the book, but in the middle, Gaul has a different king, Flollo, and Arthur conquers Gaul six ways from Sunday (mostly as a stopover in his conquest of Rome); timelines don't add up; so on, so forth. I didn't feel the author did a good job of telling the Arthur legends, in any particular. In short, this is a bad version of the King Arthur story and the general reader would be better off not wasting time on it.I'm sure people are going to say \\"hey, it's an early victorian version, don't hold it to such high standards,\\" but there's no reason for a modern reader to read these, any more than there's reason to read Sir Thomas Bowdler's \\"Family Shakespeare\\". For more \\"historical\\" versions of the Arthur legend, either of this versions' main source materials -- Geoffrey of Monmouth's _History of the Kings of Britain_ or Sir Thomas Malory's _Morte D'Arthur_ -- are superior reads (though I'll admit you'd want to skim Monmouth heavily). My own personal favorite, Howard Pyle's three-book version of the Arthur story (\\"The Story of King Arthur and His Knights,\\" \\"The Story of the Champions of the Round Table,\\" and \\"The Story of the Grail and the Passing of Arthur\\") is similarly available for free online in the public domain, can be found with excellent illustrations by Pyle himself, is written in a fashion suitable for children and adults, and does a far better job of capturing the romance of the Arthur legends.But whatever version you pick, this one is a poor place to start. It does have some strengths -- chiefly an encylopedic compilation of at least some version of almost every PG Arthur-related tale -- but the author's victorian mores seem to have twisted far too many of the stories into unrecognizability. Not recommended."},{"Title":"THE LEGENDS OF KING ARTHUR AND HIS KNIGHTS","review":"I enjoyed this book, or what part of it I read, anyway. It is the rather un-nuanced account of the adventures had by a group of knights (of the Round Table, of course). There is no character development and very little overarching plot to tie the stories together, but there is something oddly compelling about it. There is a great deal of smiting, and rending helms asunder, and rescuing fair maidens in distress (can you imagine???? The evil giant makes ladies actually do manual labor, though they be of high birth!).You get the general idea pretty quickly, I've read half and feel like I've gotten all I will get out of this book. It's free though, so I am glad I checked it out."},{"Title":"THE LEGENDS OF KING ARTHUR AND HIS KNIGHTS","review":"Classic King Arthur stories, with all the smiteth-ing and destresseth damsels one might wish.A bit of a slow read due to the older writing style and inclusion of every name of every knight present at every battle, but the book contained everything from Merlin's predictions to the Quest for the Holy Grail to Arthur being bore off to Avalon, although it lacked the tale of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight."},{"Title":"THE LEGENDS OF KING ARTHUR AND HIS KNIGHTS","review":"I have only given up on a book once before in my life. This one makes two. The language is a bit cumbersome for the 21st century reader, but one can overcome that. If you make it past the archaic language, there is little/no character development or plotline. Basically, all you get is a series of fights and battles. \\"Sir So-and-So fought Sir So-and-So until their lances broke. Then they fought on the ground with swords until they were both bleeding badly. Then Sir So-and-So prevailed.\\" Repeat this over and over and you've got it. The parts you'd think would be more interesting, like the sword in the stone or Arthur's marriage to Geneviere, are barely mentioned in the midst of all the fighting. I gave up about 1/3 of the way through and I'm going to check out some other Arthur stories recommended by other reviewers of this book."},{"Title":"THE LEGENDS OF KING ARTHUR AND HIS KNIGHTS","review":"There are many versions of Arthur and the boys that are worth reading; Le Morte d'Arthur, Four Arthurian Romances, or even novelizations and outlandish ones such as Mists of... and Dawn of Avalon. All have something to offerreaders who wish to delve into the rich legends and lore where the rules of Chivalry dictate the action andin which the exploits of errant knights are captured in all their glory.In this work by Sir James Knowles, we are treated to these outlandish tales through a very Victorian lens.While some reviewers may see this as a deterrent, I found that this perspective took very littleaway from this fine work and, in some ways, enhanced the storytelling to a degree. The detractors focus on what'snot written. The broader influences of Merlin say, or the omission of certain tales (the green knight), or howthe dalliances of Lancelot are written in such a way to suggest it was a misunderstanding and not an affair. Butunderstand, while I too wish these were more plainly wrought, there is still much here to enjoy.Many other sources may have a leg up (Pyle's three book narrative especially) but there is a certain preciousnessor innocence to these works that Sir James manages to capture that in some ways surpasses these works in terms ofromantic ideals. And, honestly, the courtly romance is truly what is at the heart of all Arthurian legends. Theepic adventures are nothing without the grounding of the courtly, chivalrous love that inspires them.To a modern reader, this may be a point of frustration. It is hard for us to look upon the actions the knightshave to take to fulfill their promises without a certain amount of cynicism. Most will roll their eyes each timea night promises to fulfill an obligation to a woman without first ascertaining if the woman is true or if she isnot a woman but a witch, etc. But again, it is the utter idealization of Arthur's court and the romantic notionswinding their way through the symbolic adventures that make these stories worthwhile.Once you can accept these ideals, you will find the stories themselves to be chock full of adventure. Note thatredundancy is also an issue here. Fights always take an \\"hour or two\\", with pages devoted to horse provisions,damsels are always more than they seem, and all valiant knights of the Round Table face 40/1 odds and alwaysslay opponents on both the left and the right. These scenes and phrases abound to the point where you oftencan find yourself skimming large portions of the action scenes if you are not careful.At about the 2/3 point, however, Galahad joins the crew and the whole focus of the book shifts. The courtly codeno longer is as obtrusive, and the focus goes from finding adventure to pursuing the holy grail. Here thesupernatural elements seem to become doubled, and each and every page begins to drip with symbolism. Lineages toancient biblical figures are established, and Camelot is propelled to full mythic proportions. Fittingly, just asyou begin to accept the godliness of these heroes, their very real humanity destroys them all.Buying any Arthurian romance is worth the price of admission (in my opinion anyway). \\"Buying\\" it here as a freeE-read is even better. There are some disappointments with the format. Chapters are not as clean and themany illustrations are described but are not to be found. However, these are available to view on the net if youinsist on seeing them. And as I said earlier, there are many versions available for purchase that can meet yourneeds and many of them are free/public domain as well. But if you want to take a quick, accessible dive thise-book will be a great first step into the realm of Camelot."},{"Title":"THE LEGENDS OF KING ARTHUR AND HIS KNIGHTS","review":"I grabbed this as a free choice, and since I had never read any of the Arthur legends, thought this would be a good place to start. However, after getting a third of the way through, found myself wanting something better. The more I read from there, the more tedious it became.1. The historical setting, with the relationships to politics and the church just seemed to be far-fetched. Life may have been like that later on, but it just got a bit hard to swallow at times.2. Jousting seems a little strangely entered into. It's kind of like: \\"You shall not pass.\\" \\"I must.\\" \\"Then one of us must die.\\" \\"OK, let's do this.\\" Chivalry and honor are not really explained, so it feels like mindless killing for bravado.3. On the other hand, knights are placed in moral dilemmas all the time, making them choose between their promises and their direct orders. Morals are in tension all the time, as well as the repercussions of endless revenge seeking. This is interesting, but does not really satisfy because of the above 2 objections.I think I'll look for something more accurate to the legends, since that is what I really wanted to read about."},{"Title":"THE LEGENDS OF KING ARTHUR AND HIS KNIGHTS","review":"This book read more like the book of Numbers in the Bible than the great legend of King Arthur. In place of a long list of parentage, this book contains a long list of smiting and killing. I expected to read the story of the sword and the stone and the boy king, but it felt like that story actually took up about four pages and then went right into Arthur trying to take over the world. I expected to learn about the relationship between Arthur and Guinevere, but we meet her in one chapter followed by \\"they're gonna get married later\\" and then later all of a sudden they're married. Instead of learning of the good deeds of Lancelot leading to him wooing the Queen, you see killing left and right and it almost seems that any good deeds are purely by accident. I'm only halfway through the book and I'm fighting myself to finish it. I have never put down a book after I've started to read it regardless of whether I've enjoyed it or not (similarly to never having walked out of a movie theater in the middle no matter how bad the movie is), and this book is trying that record.If I could get past my issues with the story itself (maybe I had the wrong expectations), I find the quality of this edition very poor. I understand that Kindle versions won't have any illustrations that may make a difference in the print version, the \\"publisher\\" replaced the images with bracketed descriptions of the image, which was very distracting. Additionally many of the paragraphs are not properly indented which causes a disruption in the reading. Every time this occurred, I found myself looking back a the paragraph before to make sure that I wasn't missing something.All in all 0 for 2."},{"Title":"THE LEGENDS OF KING ARTHUR AND HIS KNIGHTS","review":"This book has definately captured the spirit of medieval times and chivalry. While reading, I felt like I knew King Arthur and each of his knights and had an immediate like or dislike fr each of them. There is no lack whatsoever of blood, traitors, or twists in the plotline.

It's basically just a dry reporting of jousts and battles - non-stop slaughter & cruelty, leaving me wondering why it's recommended as a children's version (or how there were any men - or horses - left at all after such goings-on). The Arthurian legends are fascinating, but there are many more detailed and interesting versions than this one."},{"Title":"THE LEGENDS OF KING ARTHUR AND HIS KNIGHTS","review":"This wasn't my favorite. I'm not quite sure if it was the language or just that I thought the stories were toned down from the original. Also, I was amazed at how often everyone \\"smote\\" each other. I like the King Arthur stories, but it can become a bit repetitive after a little while. A lot of damsels in distress who are wandering through the forest and then of course the smiting of each other. Even with all the smiting, the fighting wasn't very descriptive which is why I think it feels toned down. However, the story is a classic and one that I think every avid reader should read.

Would you keep them? Send them up for adoption? Try to find their parents? Well, a family from England kept him, and named him Spider for the way he walks. They found some interesting facts about him. He can mimic animal's calls perfectly; one of his only phrases is \\"Good un!\\", he walks weirdly, and can't learn any thing.His friends make fun of him for the way he walks, how he can't learn, and how he does not go to school. His parents also worry about how he acts. The people on the farm make fun of him behind his back, but none of this matters to him because he does not understand any of it. His parents try to make him act normally but they notice that he is happy, so it does not matter.This great fiction book is set in World War II!

This is one of the most detailed account of urban warfare in Stalingrad I have read. The book is fast-paced, easy to follow, thoroughly researched, and extremely informative. I could not put this book down and learned more about the streetfighting in Stalingrad than from all the other books I have read combined. If you want to learn about the horrific fighting in Stalingrad from a first-person perspective, this is the highest quality work I have encountered. I recommend it to anyone with an interest on the subject and can assure you that you will not be disappointed. A first class historical work all the way. Impressive!(On a side note, I specifically looked for the author emphasizing that he was only doing his job and only found one reference. So, I have to respectfully disagree with the other reviewer who stated that this was a repeat issue.)"},{"Title":"An Infantryman in Stalingrad: From 24 September 1942 to 2 February 1943","review":"Well, I ordered this book right from the publisher on his site.This book is a translation from the German copy, and was done really well as it flowed with no problems.I found this book excellant with pictures and maps. The publisher has air shots of the city and has super-impossed lines/boundaries where the author was. I found this to make the story really easy and INTERESTING to follow. When the author describes a certain building ie\\" the transformer\\" there is air shots with the transformer in them and you are able to see what the author saw. Nicely done with photos of other commanders and vehicles though there isn't a lot of them. In no way does this detract from the book.If the author talks about a certain soldier, the publisher has researched them and gives the dates of birth and fate ie: died in Stalingrad or survived the war etc. I found this also informative though the author made a few mistakes with names.....The only part that was sort of repeated was the author continuously repeating that they were doing their job. The battle descriptions are also very well described and you can feel yourself in the battle or in the cold bunker with him.The book ends with the author waiting to surrender and I found myself wanting to know more about his survival in the POW camps and the end of war. Instead of fighting it out to the last bullet he decides to go back to the wounded after he finds out they are to be left to their fate.HIGHLY recommended !!!!"},{"Title":"An Infantryman in Stalingrad: From 24 September 1942 to 2 February 1943","review":"The book is a pleasure to own.

Extremely poignant image. Movement orders, mundane daily (relatively) contact / battle reports all complement the junior officers perspective of warfare in an inhospitable climate.The inevitable camaraderie that builds up within fighting units at the front line is admirably portrayed. Along with the interaction between incompetence, inefficiency, intolerable conditions, and the sheer bloody hard work that is the burden of the modern Infantryman. Holl buffers as much of this from his troops as possible, and earns their respect as a result.In summary, this book combines personal information of the fighting on the front line with factual data in a way that is addictive to read."},{"Title":"An Infantryman in Stalingrad: From 24 September 1942 to 2 February 1943","review":"The value of this book is not in that it portrays the full scope of the battle of Stalingrad. Such books can be written by anyone (even you or I)if we wish to access the German and Russian archives. This book's value and unique qualities lie in that it covers one persons memiors and experiences over a part of the battlefield. It can never be replicated, which is especially important given only 5,000 german solidiers surrounded at Stalingrad made it home.It is well written and easy to read. The original work is enhanced by pictures, maps and historic data provided by the translators. Given it was written about 25 years after the event it is very detailed and accurate. I'm not sure if it was written from a diary but it gives a day by day account of Holl's experiences as a narrative. It doesn't get affected, as other books do, by \\"visionary\\" writing such as forboding about possibly being surrounded. It is written as if it were based only on the knowledge of that day, not subsequent events. He is proud soldier but not a Nazi apologist.It begins with Holl's return and leading of the attack at the mouth of the Tsarita gorge to the banks of the Volga. His unit is then swithed to a quiter zone but called on to clear out a russian pocket. Then the entrapment and the desperate retreat back to the city. The writing is dispassionate; but is still full of feeling for the conditions of the time. Holl leaves his story immediately before his surrender. It would have been nice to know what happened to him (how long was he a POW?) but that is not the purpose of the book.I have over a 100 2WW memiors. This is one of the best. It is a must have for any one interested in Eastern front combat."},{"Title":"An Infantryman in Stalingrad: From 24 September 1942 to 2 February 1943","review":"This is the second book that we owe thanks to Jason Mark for his meticulous research and efforts.It follows naturally from his first work, a history of the destruction of the 24 Panzer Div. at Stalingrad - \\"Death of the Leaping Horseman\\", going from the Divisional scale down to the individual scale. They should be read together.While it is a memoir of a soldier who was there, in his own words, Mr. Mark's research expands and develops the account with maps, documents, cross references to the personalities referred to by Holl, and photographs. It makes for a professionally produced memoir and an invaluable reference for serious researchers and students of that battle.You won't find heart wrenching torment,soul searching or soaring prose in Holl's memoir - he is very matter-of-fact and, if anything, downplays the terrible events and suffering involved. However, that does not detract from the recounting. This is not a sensational telling but solid, factual and in that way, authoritative and very moving account.Again, I thank Jason D. Mark for bringing Adelbert Holl's memoirs to us. Its a perfect \\"collaberation\\"."},{"Title":"An Infantryman in Stalingrad: From 24 September 1942 to 2 February 1943","review":"This is a book that I highly recommend, especially for Stalingrad buffs. Its about Adelbert Holl, a 23 year old Leutnant coming back to duty after recuperating from a severe chest wound. He is in charge of the remains of 7th Company, 276th IR of 94th ID. He arrives at Stalingrad in late September and describes the daily action he takes and sees around him as he strives to reach the Volga River. His heroic account stirs the mind and heart and helps us understand, at least a little, how awful the conditions were for both sides. The author also shows fragments of daily after action reports which were enlightening.In addition to this dramatic story there are 24 maps that shows where and what the objectives were. In addition to the maps there were a number of aerial photos that also shows Stalingrad and helps you to follow the story. Besides the aerial photos, there are other photos that shows the remains of the city and the men fighting in it. At the end of the book there are a number of documents but they were in German and not much help to me.There is also a listing of Leutnant Holl's career that includes medals won, promotions earned and wounds received. The book closes with an index of soldiers described in the book.If I hadn't read \\"Island of Fire\\" recently, I would have given this book 5 stars. Its really good and though the format is different than the other book, its not on the same quality level. Still, I believe most people would enjoy this story."},{"Title":"An Infantryman in Stalingrad: From 24 September 1942 to 2 February 1943","review":"I really enjoyed this book and would definitely recommend it for anyone who is interested and familiar with WW II/Eastern Front. I have read several excellent historical accounts of the Battle of Stalingrad, but those dealt mostly on a macroscopic level - in the cold, analytical facts (which are fascinating in and of themselves). They always left me wondering about the human side of things. This book was delivered on a much more microscopic level - and from the point of view of the defeated.This book was an excellent supplement to my earlier readings on the subject and I would certainly recommend it as such."},{"Title":"An Infantryman in Stalingrad: From 24 September 1942 to 2 February 1943","review":"If you already have a good understanding of the battle of Stalingrad, then this book is worth reading. It is one soldier's experience, and does not discuss the big picture. There are lots of maps, many created out of aerial photographs. The maps and the sit-reps give one a good sense of what the author is talking about. He does not overly dramatize and is quite matter-of-fact. Nevertheless, one gets a good idea of just how awful the conditions were."},{"Title":"An Infantryman in Stalingrad: From 24 September 1942 to 2 February 1943","review":"The book was very comprehensive particulary for one interested in tactics. The charts, diagrams and photos were very explicit and one has to realize that the bulk of the book occurs in a very concentrated area. I felt the book was overpriced in comparison to others of equal quality and content."},{"Title":"An Infantryman in Stalingrad: From 24 September 1942 to 2 February 1943","review":"In the wake of Theodor Plievier (1969) the epic battle for Stalingrad has been re-told in the past ten years or so by several eminent historians like Anthony Breevor (1999), Geoffrey Roberts (2002) and Michael Jones (2007). Therefore one might ask what added value there might be in yet another book on the same subject, in this case \\"An Infantryman in Stalingrad\\" by Adelbert Holl. My conclusion is that the material offered in this book is interesting enough for reading. Where other books present the full scope of the battle with emphasis on the strategic and operational interactions of armies, divisions and regiments, in which the individual soldier is often reduced to a simple cogwheel in the war machinery, this book tells the day-to-day story of an infantryman in the ruins of the city. As a consequence the horizon of the story is often limited to the factory behind the next block or the houses across the street. The momentous battle of the 6th Army is reduced to the struggle of a Wehrmacht officer to stay alive and to keep his men alive while fulfilling his duty. This book, a diary actually, covers the period of 23 September 1942, when Holl reports back from convalescence leave to his battalion commander, up to and including 1 February 1943, when he is waiting for captivity with a few other survivors.When I started reading this book I wondered if the author would reveal anything about his motives for serving in the Wehrmacht and to what extent he would justify the invasion of Russia, which brought so much misery to the population. Holl is surprisingly quiet on these moral issues, even in hindsight. He only tells us that he took the oath for F&uuml;hrer, Volk und Vaterland voluntarily at the age of 18 and that he considered it his duty to fulfill this oath in the belief that the free world should be protected from the curses of Bolshevism. It is scary to realize that similar distorted views on certain groups in our society are still the driving forces behind the atrocities that fill our newspapers today. As if nothing has been learned from history. The positive side of this lack of reflection is that the character of the narrative, which is very much matter-of-fact, is not weakened by attempts to justify the actions described in the book.The publisher deserves credits for the quality of this book. The translation is excellent and the text is richly interspersed with illustrations and maps, many in the form of aerial photographs. Additional information is provided in the form of footnotes. In my experience military history books often suffer from a lack of clear maps in places where they would be helpful for a better understanding of the military movements described in the text. That is not the case in this book where maps are abundant and always on the right spot.Conclusion: Contents are interesting and presentation is excellent. A recommendation for readers interested in the history of the Nazi-Soviet war from 1941-1945."},{"Title":"An Infantryman in Stalingrad: From 24 September 1942 to 2 February 1943","review":"The author inundates the reader with useless small talk and salutations again and again and again. For example, this one says hello and that one says thank you and another says long time no see and so on. There are three problems with this style. First, it is irrelevant to the story. Second, it is largely fictional in the first place because the author is writing decades after the events and doesn't remember the guten morgens and dankes and auf wiedersehens. He's making them up. Third, it wastes space and increases costs. An Artilleryman in Stalingrad is vastly superior."},{"Title":"An Infantryman in Stalingrad: From 24 September 1942 to 2 February 1943","review":"This book describes the combat ezperiances of a German soldier in possiblely the most important battle of World War II.

Recommened."},{"Title":"An Infantryman in Stalingrad: From 24 September 1942 to 2 February 1943","review":"\\"An Infantryman in Stalingrad: From 24 September 1942 to 2 February 1943\\", by Adelbert Holl, and translated by Jason D. Mark and Neil Page, is is a book written by a Wehrmacht officer about his experience in Stalingrad from September 1942 until his surrender in Feburary 1943.The book begins when Mr Holl, arrives back with his old unit at Stalingrad after recovering from a serious wound suffered several months earlier. The book details his subsequent combat experiences while in command of a company, his time on his regimental staff, his command of another company formed from diverse personnel amalgamated into a unit, and ends with his staying with his wounded men, waiting for the Russians to arrive so that they may surrender.While his book is fairly well written and interesting in its own right, what makes it stand out is Jason Mark's adding detailed maps, pictures, actual orders and situational summaries from higher headquarters, and pointing out where Mr Holl's memory failed him when he compared Mr Holl's narrative to actual unit diaries and other supporting information. (However, as Mr Mark points out, even though Mr Holl wrote his book in the 1970's, before masses of archival data was released, his narrative was amazingly accurate and his mistakes few and far between.) The synergy between Holl's story and the other supporting data raise this book well above the typical war time memoir.The book gives a good feel from a worm's eye view of the fighting for Stalingrad, shows some of the tactics used in the fighting, and gives a sense of the harsh conditions and deprivations the men endured. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"An Infantryman in Stalingrad: From 24 September 1942 to 2 February 1943","review":"This is a simple daily log of an individual.

In fact, this is by far the best I had come across on Convertible Arbitrage. It's so informative and well written that it should be a handbook for hedge fund professionals or finance professors. However, it's far beyond the comprehension of the investment public who would surely be confused by the vast amount of greek alphabets, financial equations and graphs.

How do you do this? The book correctly tells you that a binomial method must be used, but it spends only 10 pages or so on this matter! And even if you are proficient with binomial valuation, this description is quite poor and confusing. Most important though, the book does NOT cover the more complex attributes of convertible bonds (such as call and put provisions) that are very common. How can you expect to find underpriced CBs if you don't value them properly? If you truly want to learn convertible arbitrage, I instead recommend the book \\"Pricing convertible bonds\\" by Kevin Connolly who carefully explains all the things you need to know about the valuation of CBs, so that even if you have never heard about binomial trees you will still understand it (he also supplies a disc with excel files)."},{"Title":"Convertible Arbitrage: Insights and Techniques for Successful Hedging","review":"i studied from this book for the CAIA exam. while it presented some very fascinating approaches and ideas for me, keeping in mind i am not a practising arbitrageur yet, it was very poorly edited and written in general.every book starts with an assumption about the level of sophistication the reader. this book seems to assume different levels in different chapters and even paragraphs. the chapter on equity valuation is written for kids (lose the chapter, nick) and the ones on hedging techniques doesn't even bother to list assumptions behind complex positions.the author uses the most confusing notations. e.g. Nu-1, literally typed out like that, which is supposed to represent a variable with subscript u-1. geez - whatever happened to computer typesettng with actual subscripts, and why use the same notation for different variables in different formulae? at least he could have used Nu-1 and Mu-1. I spent a lot of time making sense out of this one and assumed he was referring to Nu minus 1!basically, if the same ideas were carefully thought out and presented by better editing and writing (and typesetting!), this would be an enjoyable book. as it stands, its a torture to go through. such wonderful ideas and such poor presentation. this one went out the door too early."},{"Title":"Convertible Arbitrage: Insights and Techniques for Successful Hedging","review":"This is no book for beginners, as I have a background in economics, econometrics, and trading, but I find the prose jumps over and casually breezes past assumptions, leaving me thinking I must have missed something. In almost each sentence and paragraph you have to absorb and absorb and keeping trying to figure out the author's angles on what he means. Currently I am on pages 139-140, and I find impatience when encountering one-time blithe statements like \\"In practice, some slight additions to the short position on the way up will lock in some gains and avoid a hedge ratio that is extremely low relative to the delta.\\" Or, \\"The hedge ratio on a leveraged bullish tilt position should generally be slightly more than the hedge ratio on the un-levered bullish tilt position to reduce some of the added volatility in the return.\\" The syntax while trying to be plain language, loses the reader. I keep asking what exactly is \\"generally be slightly more than the hedge ratio\\" mean in the context of a portfolio; and do you own one each of the levered and unlevered to reduce volatility, and if not how can I be so confident my hedge ratio is thus adjusted properly if the volatility is well, volatile? It is like he writes to impress, which is not a bad thing by itself. It's clear he's having a good time. But if read aloud at a conference of CEO's, I can envision them nodding their heads and furrowing their sagacious brows without actually a full understanding of what is said.So the prose is dense. But it eventually \\"sounds\\" right to the ear if read over a couple times quickly, but still loaded with very subtle ideas watered down into plain words which can makes me stop and pause to consider each idea as if it were some kind of rosetta stone to the prior material. At the same time it gets me to pause and think, which is an upside and rewards patience. But it's getting harder to gauge at this chapter how much progress I have made or not made, but I optimistically press on. I keep it hand so I can have more chances to peek inside this mysterious veil of conv arb. and learn something new and interesting.It would be helpful to have more specific details where a natural question of 'why?' occurs if asked by a reader. From my own perspective, formulas would be far more compact and precise in conveying these ideas.

When I began managing, the information found in this one book, had to be gathered from many different resources, if it was available at all. I wish this had been available when I first began. This book exposed me to techniques that I have not used before because of my investment mandate. Now I have them in my toolbox if I decide to hunt extra \\"alpha\\" for my portfolio.Some of the techniques are only applicable by arbitrageurs that are in foreign markets. Even these are creative and inspire great avenues for further thought. It was while studying these that the thought occurred to me that the book might not be useable by the individual investor unless they are highly unique.There are elements of this book that have the air of \\"promotion\\" to it. The first chapter cites the advantages of this technique in concert with other management styles. The returns and other statistics span from publication date back to 1995. 1994 was a profoundly difficult year for convertible arb managers and could possibly weakened Calamos' assertions (to be fair he acknowledges as much at the end of the book). Convertible arbitrage will have difficult comparisons when it operates in an environment of low volatility and rising rates unless all risk (and return) are hedged away."},{"Title":"Convertible Arbitrage: Insights and Techniques for Successful Hedging","review":"Calamos has put together a useful reference for those interested in learning more about the proper pricing of convertibles. However his own agenda is quite transparent when looking at his own performance - picking the bottom (2002) of the CB wipeout to chart his own performance.There are other gaps such as a lack of consideration of stock price movement and its influence on omicron (change of CB prices w/ resepct to credit spread). This has been researched by Berger and others - it the stock craps out, one side of the market is saying the credit worthiness of the issuer has declined.If you are really going to *TRADE* a CB book, you need to quantify as many of these variables as possible with respect to each other. No risk factor exists in a vacuum, but Calamos seems to skip this level of integration.If you are not a market practioner but would like to be, read this before an interview.

By reading it, I learned enough about the strategy and how it works to have intelligent conversations with portfolio managers and analysts and understand what needs to be done to make it work. The book covers the Greeks and why they matter, and gives explanations of the strategies that are easily understood, but whose details are laid out in sufficient depth that the layperson might not be able absorb them all the first time through.The books doesn't, and really can't, get into issues relating to data providers, prime brokers, and other execution-related topics. Yet it does cover almost every permutation of the strategy that you might find currently being implemented by a CA fund.Overall, I think that this book provides an excellent grounding in the strategy, is a very engaging read, and will be a good reference as your understanding of the subject grows.In closing, let me say this: The chapter on the Greeks alone justifies the purchase of this book.

Words are organized topically, with sections on family relations, work, things around the home, clothing, travel, and so on. The vast majority of the vocabulary consists of nouns. If you want to learn verbs (a few are included) and their conjugations (nothing here) this book is not for you. Prepositions, conjunctions, objects, and sentence structure are not covered at all. But as a learning aid for nouns the book is very good.The only real negative for the book, assuming learning nouns is your goal, is that there are a few errors. While this might be overlooked in some books, a vocabulary book, like a dictionary, should not have errors in spelling and definition. It is easy to see how some of the mistakes occur. For example on page 176, in a list of the parts of the face, eyebrows are called parpados and eyelashes are called cejas. In fact, eyelids are parpados and eyebrows are cejas.

William E. Gladstone certainly did influence British politics for over fifty years, and was elected to the Prime Minister position four times. This short book (or thesis) explained his political development through those fifty years. He moved from a Conservative on social issues to that of a Liberal or even Radical position. His championship of Irish Home Rule kept Ireland within the British Empire for thirty more years. This man and his political position kept the radical left from many popular positions.The unfortunate part of this book is that it reads like a thesis. It probably was a thesis and as such will not attract much interest from the general public. I did learn a great deal about this most influencial of British politicians."},{"Title":"The Confessions of St. Augustine (Little blue book)","review":"Having studied &#34;Confessions&#34; in graduate school, I found embracing this text to be akin to running into an old and trusted friend after a long absence.

Chadwick's eloquent translation caputes not only Augustine's ideas and thoughts, but equally important, his rhetorical skills. This alone justifies the purchase of this work. The philosophical nuances that, ironically, have entered twentieth-century thought again are very clearly articulated in Chadwick's translation.

The metaphysical argues from logic and the existence and nature of reality, the historical from the past - both human and pre-human, and the experiential from personal, and private, experience.While I don't want to diminish the metaphysical or historical components of Christian belief and apologetics, I think that the most important source of living belief is the experiential, but it is also by far the hardest to communicate, since it is by nature, private and personal. While my experiences may convince me of the truth of the Christian faith, how can they convince you? They are part of my experience, not yours. It might seem to be an impossibility, yet this is the challenge that Augustine took on in &quot;Confessions&quot;, and it is by the degree of difficulty that the extent of his success and the greatness of the work can be measured.&quot;Confessions&quot; is a work of great beauty. Written in the form of a confessional prayer, Augustine bares himself utterly, and in so doing, makes the reader want to lower his defenses as well, making it possible to experience another's life more deeply than he might have thought possible, and in so doing, to translate his experience of Christianity across the divide that separates us from each other.Because of the nature of &quot;Confessions&quot;, I think that analysis of it is to be avoided.

We are all sinners but there is salvation that God gives if we repent and believe in God's word. It does not matter how far we have strayed and what sins we have committed that have offended God. God loves each one of us unconditionally. God selected us to be... before we were a twinkle in our parent&#8217;s eyes. God created each one of us in our mother's womb at the moment of conception. God's wish is that we spend eternity with him. All God ask that we serve him, love him and keep His Commandments. It is not easy but God is with us every step of the way. God provides the tools and all we have to do is keep his word. But since we are all sinners because of &#34;Original&#34; sin we need God to show us the way. In Holy Scripture and the Holy Bible God talks to us and we must listen. We should listen because this world and our life here is temporary. Our permanent home is in Heaven. In the case of Saint Augustine he tells he reveals how as a young man he lived a very wretched life. His mother prayed for his conversion. Now his father also was a very sinful man. So his mother prayed for both of them. It took a while but God answered her prayers of a mother and wife and they both were converted and left their sinful lives to live a more pleasing life by keeping God's Commandments. The Confessions of Saint Augustine is a way to tell the world that he was a terrible sinner but now he sins no more. In the confessions he also shows that prayer can be as simple as talking to God. One must remember that God should always be the center of our lives. Some people before making a decision say, &#34;What would God do?&#34; That is the right attitude but we must follow through. We may be very alone here on earth because of our current situation but we should not worry for God is with us. My mother was very religious in life. She is no longer in the visible world but in the invisible world. She would often tell me, &#34;If you are with God nothing can be against you.&#34; I can imagine that Augustine's Mother besides continually praying for Saint Augustine she also encouraged her son to go in the good ways of God. This book also shows that miracles do happen to all who believe in miracles. In conclusion God will not abandon us if we ask for help and our number one goal while here on earth is Heaven. We can get there is we stay close to God. The Confessions of Saint Augustine is a manual of how God's love can make this possible in a heartbeat. Today is Ash Wednesday so at mass ashes were distributed by place a bit on our forehead and saying, &#34;Remember that you are dust and to dust you shall return.&#34; God bless all who repent and believe the gospel for Saint Augustine did and now he is in Heaven where we should all be some day but we must believe in the word of God. ."},{"Title":"The Confessions of St. Augustine (Little blue book)","review":"The claim of being &#34;optimized&#34; for Kindle is misleading.

I was unaware that any informed people thought otherrwise, but apparently they do. They probably go a bit too far in describing the extent to which China's collectives and SOE's are only so in name, but the gist is certainly correct.The best part of their book is the description of how full blown capitalism arose in China. They choose not to focus on the desire of the Chinese leadership to establish full blown capitalism. they show how small reforms created contradictions that necessitated more reforms. Thus, capitlaists reforms went further than the leadership initially desired. Of course, the lack of discussion of the leadership's bias towards capitalism is a problem because it is necessary to explain why the original capitalist reforms were made in the first place, and why the direction taken to resolve the problems of the reforms was towards further liberalization rather than the repeal of the reforms themselves.The discussion of the performance of the Chinese economy is quite sound, and is from a Marxist perspective. It examines Chinese development in the context of uneven development throughout the world or region, and also the increase in misery amidst wealth.The book is good overall, but in addition to the limitation mentioned above, there are some other problems. The book is short (the main body of text is around 115 pages) and it would've been better had it gone into a bit more depth. I disagree with some of their observations (mostly unrelated to their general conclusions). The agricultural miracle of the early 1980s and late 1970s had less to do with decollectivization or state price support. Rather, it was mainly a result of development of agricultural technology and infrastructure in the late Maoist era (See Chris Bramall's book \\"Sources of Chinese Economic Growth: 1978-1996)."},{"Title":"China and Socialism: Market Reforms and Class Struggle","review":"While the Chinese government has done an excellent job in raising the country's GDP using protectionist techniques similar to the East Asian Tigers, this book delves into the cost of such economic growth. For instance, while wages have gone up (highly unevenly), health care that used to be provided for free (and so wouldn't be reflected in wages) is now very difficult to come by for the mass of Chinese. The heart of socialism - full provision of education, food, housing, medical care - has been eviscerated by Chinese leaders in Deng's mold who think that capitalist economists are the true scientists, and their advice can be relied upon to generate wealth. Wealth which one day may be more evenly redistributed, someday in the future.

Street kids back then didn't have quite as \\"foul\\" a vocabulary as they do today, but if you control for the greater amount of civility in public speech in those days, I would guess the shock value back then was about the same as it is now."},{"Title":"God is for Real, Man","review":"I recall reading this when I was a kid.It's still fun to read Bible stories as told by alleged street gang members.This is also a bit of a historical document at this point, a nostalgic look at &#34;ruffians&#34; from the 1960s that were actually able to tell stories from the Bible. Do gang members quote from the New Testament anymore?"},{"Title":"Blue Moon","review":"No question. This tale of love between two lost souls is very sweet. Olivia Bond feels unworthy of love because of the year she spent as Darcy Lankanal's sex toy. Reclusive Noah LaCroix feels unworthy of love because of his severe facial scars. When Noah rescues Olivia after she gets lost in the swamp while on the run from Darcy, they begin to care for each other. Wonderful idea, yet two things bothered me. First, two such appealing characters in a romance novel deserve far more in the way of a sexual pay-off. More should have been made of Noah's loss of virginity. The build-up in tension between Olivia and Noah was never given a decent outlet. Second, and more serious, the last part of the book spent way too much time on Darcy and a shaky attempt to clean up his image in preparation for a novel of his own. I'm sorry, Jill, but Darcy is no hero."},{"Title":"Blue Moon","review":"Set in the 1820's when Illinois is on the frontier, Blue Moon has the potential to explore some new territory in the romance genre. For starters, the main characters are a refuge from a brothel and a man described as the &quot;oldest living virgin in the territory.&quot; The obstacles to their love (because there must always be obstacles) are even fairly original. And certainly, Landis can write a terrific romance (Sunflower and Come Spring are permanent members of my keeper shelf). Somehow, it doesn't all quite come together in Blue Moon. I'd lay the blame on too much time spent on the threat posed by Darcy, the brothel owner. The time could have been better spent on more interaction between Olivia and Noah.Also worth noting, this book is the sequel/spin-off to &quot;Just Once.&quot; I went out of my way to read them in order but that probably isn't necessary to understanding and enjoying Blue Moon."},{"Title":"Blue Moon","review":"Colonel Sullivan and his river pirates force the father of teenager Oliva Bond to surrender his daughter to them. In turn, they sell Oliva to Darcy Lankanal, owner of a New Orleans house of gambling, liquor, and prostitution. As is his want with any new prostitute, Darcy uses them for two-three months before he turns them over to his customers. However, Oliva was still with him after a year. One month ago, she fled his boudoir.By 1820, a desperate Oliva runs into an Illinois swamp, seeking asylum, but instead takes a nasty fall. Hermit Noah La Croix finds the unconscious teenager and carries her to his remote tree house. When she first awakens, Oliva seems frightened by the scarred visage of her host. However, as he shows her kindness and compassion, the duo falls in love with one another. Still both have deep rooted scars to overcome and the obsessed Darcy plans to have Oliva return to his house of ill repute no matter what it takes to get her there.Anyone who has read a Jill Marie Landis historical romance knows they can count on authenticity, an exciting story line, and a haunting climax. BLUE MOON takes off from where its prequel, JUST ONCE, leaves readers. Noah remains the same recluse, but even lonelier as his only friend has just been married. Oliva has demons chasing her, but still can see the beauty inside her savior. The story line vividly paints to readers a different, more complete side to the Era of Good Feeling. Ms. Landis illustrates why she is a best selling, award winning author with this awesome Americana romance.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Blue Moon","review":"Once in a blue moon there comes along a novel that really grabs your attention. You become immersed in the characters lives, and you never want the story to end. Jill Marie Landis' latest release, \\"Blue Moon,\\" qualifies for this category. \\"Blue Moon\\" is the sequel to Landis' highly acclaimed \\"Just Once.\\"Landis' loyal readers just had to know what happened to the handsome half-breed Noah LeCroix who, in a tragic river-boating accident, lost an eye, leaving him both physically and emotionally scarred for life. There was just something about this fascinating character that left readers wanting more. Landis obliged by re-creating Noah in his own story, \\"Blue Moon.\\"When loner Noah LeCroix rescued a scraggly young girl from the swamps he had no idea that his serene, solitary world would be turned completely upside down. He only knew that this girl was hurt, scared and in need of his protection. He knew how it felt to be lost and alone. Something about the winsome creature touched his soul. Little did he know she would soon capture his heart as well.Olivia Bond was desperate to find her family. After being kidnapped and enslaved for over a year in a New Orleans brothel, she had only a vague idea of where to start. But would they accept her after all she'd been through? Keeping her past a secret, she enlists Noah's help in finding her family. In the process she finds herself falling in love with the mysterious, gentle man. Could they both overcome tragic pasts to embrace the passionate love they feel for each other?\\"Blue Moon\\" is an absorbing, fascinating, emotionally moving story of overcoming one's past and adversities to begin life anew. Jill Marie Landis again proves herself a master storyteller, enthralling her readers with a touch of humor, a dash of mystery and enough passion and romance to reach to the moon."},{"Title":"Blue Moon","review":"Blue Moon is a sweet love story of two people who have scars inside and out but are determined to rise above their problems and live their lives the best they can. Olivia is a girl on the run who gets lost in a Southern Illinois swamp. Noah is the half-breed man who finds her and nurses her back to health. He also helps her find her way to her family who she has been separated from. In doing this he sets aside his own feelings for his love of Olivia.This book is a fantastic read. The characters are real and the story wonderful. It doesn't take long for the reader to be engrossed in their story and wanting them to have their happily-ever-after. Blue Moon is a wonderfully written book with a great storyline and well-developed characters. Blue Moon is a book to keep on the shelf and revisit again and again."},{"Title":"Blue Moon","review":"Oh, this was a good frontier romance. Jill Marie Landis did some wonderful things with BLUE MOON. She masterfully used a disfigured hero, a tarnished heroine, and a captivating villain. The results: a good story.Mutilated by an accident, Noah LeCroix chose to spend most of his life alone. However, his solitary lifestyle changed the day he found the lovely unconscious Olivia Bond. Hesitantly, he brought her to his cabin, to care for her, to make her well again, but now desire fills him.Experienced with the wiles of men, Olivia recognizes Noah's attraction, but thinks that her wantonness breeds his desire. To hinder his attraction, Olivia reveals her dishonorable past, a past spent under the control of whoremonger, Darcy Lankanal. Olivia Bond was Darcy Lankanal's personal toy. Now all she wants is to go home, but how will her family accept what she has done? Will they welcome her or ask her to leave?Darcy Lankanal is angry that his bedtoy has run off. He is obsessed with his little student. She must be returned to his private quarters in New Orleans so they can continue with her instructions.The story's favorable factors:Jill Marie Landis' depiction of the harsh living conditions is first class. Landis' dialogue is top notch and the author cleverly nourishes the sexual tension between Olivia and Noah. But it is the portrayal of Darcy Lankanal that carries the book. Landis has created an enticing villain in Lankanal. His charming, scoundrel behavior is the story.The story's non-favorable factors:Olivia Bond's relentless struggle with her past becomes tedious. But it is the character of Noah LeCroix that is the big disappointment. Noah unfolds as a big mule - something akin to Li'l Abner or Jethro Bodine. His confusion and uncertainty are too much. Reality is good, but romance heros have to be divine beings. Grade: BGrace Atkinson, Ontario - Canada."},{"Title":"Blue Moon","review":"I was so happy to find out what happened to Noah LeCroix.I don't know what else to say -- I fell in love with the characters of all of these books and will revisit them again.That, to me, makes a good book and worth keeping.I can sympathize with Noah and Olivia - sometimes there are just too many people around, too much noise and confusion. I do believe that they have learned the value of silence and contentment on Heron Pond.The story that led them back to their home was so very fascinating. I don't see it as turning their backs on family so much as their need to just be together.Definitely Recommended and another keeper. But form your own opinion."},{"Title":"Blue Moon","review":"I've always been a big fan of historical romances, it's about 95% of what I read, for some reason those times capture me and I can imagine being there myself. After reading this book I couldn't stop talking about it and nearly drove my husband crazy with my enthusiasm about the originality of this book. If you like historical romances and you're looking for something that's different from your typical characters (who in most other romances almost always seem to be the same people in my opinion) this is what you need. Jill Marie Landis did a great job. This was the first book of hers that I've read and I'm looking forward to reading more of her works! An excellent read!!"},{"Title":"Blue Moon","review":"I am usually a sucker for romances with men that are the outcasts in some way, so when I read the reviews for this book, I thought I would love it. However, I found it fairly predictable. I found the main female character rather dull actually, and I didn't find the obsessed pimp character all that believable either."},{"Title":"Blue Moon","review":"I stayed up late so I can get to the ending, I just couldn't sleep until I found out all the particulars. This book keeps you hopping. Very few writers write about the man being a virgin and the woman being experienced. I loved the change. I even felt sympathy for the villain! A must read!!"},{"Title":"Blue Moon","review":"I'm giving this a good rating because it got a good bit of an emotional response out of me, but all in all the book is TOTALLY unsatisfying.The book deals with some horrific situations and makes no bones about it, and I love that, but I'm a sucker for a happy ending and when a majority of characters didn't get what I felt they had coming to them I dodn't find it too happy."},{"Title":"Blue Moon","review":"More than 5 stars, in fact. This my first Jill Marie Landis book I read and it is not my last. Blue Moon is a fabulous read. This is a very beautiful love story of two emotionally tortured people who at first believe that they are not worth of love but gradually feel the true love from one another as they fall in love. The hero, Noah LeCroix, one-eye, scarred half-breed is the hero of my favorite type - physically and emotionally scarred. Noah belives that he is not worth of being love because of his scars. The heroine, Olivia Bond, believes that she is worthless because of her being exclusive whore of Darcy Lankanal, a whorehouse owner in New Orleans. She is a real heroine who can forgive every unforgivable crime others did to her in the past. You will savor the romantic love story between the two while get excited by thrilling intrigues as dangers approach them.If scarred-hero theme is your favorite, this book is for you. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Blue Moon","review":"If you LOVE romance novels, this one will have you hooked. I read it on a vacation recently, and the drive to the city I was going to was six hours long, but this book was so amazing it had me hooked every minute of the way! Its one of the best books I have ever read I would reccommend it to anybody who loves romance!"},{"Title":"Blue Moon","review":"From beginning to end, Blue Moon kept me reading almost nonstop for two days. As always, Ms. Landis paints the most exquisite visual imagery and evokes the deepest emotions from her characters. Looking forward to her next book, Orchid Hunters!"},{"Title":"Blue Moon","review":"Once again Jill Marie Landis has written a touching novel that is filled with emotion. It is extremely romantic and fills you with hope. The characters are down to earth and endearing. An excellent read from an excellent author."},{"Title":"Blue Moon","review":"I liked this book, but I can't put my finger on what it was that made me not want to keep it. I loved Noah. He was sweet and kind and a virgin. I liked all of that. I also liked Oliva. I just got tired of the repeated vows of being unworthy. I thought this a good story, just not as good as the other reviewers."},{"Title":"Blue Moon","review":"Jill Marie Landis never disappoints and this one might be one of my favorite by her. I was transported by the story and characters--they are heartbreaking and true. A first rate read!"},{"Title":"Blue Moon","review":"This book seemed to have so much potential but it just didn't come through for me. I'm just not sure if it was the writing style or the characters but I was left with the feeling, that was it? Then at the very end he takes Livvey away from her family that REALLY needs her, to live in a swamp and have lots of babies?? Come on! What was wrong with building their own little cabin over by the woods and stream? Why not live near the people that love her? It's not like he had anything actually waiting for him in the swamp, Noah was very selfish and self centered. I just hope all those babies sprout wings or they are in for more heartbreak."},{"Title":"Blue Moon","review":"This is the first book I have ever read by Ms.Landis and if all her other books are as depressing as this one, it will probably be the last one I ever read! I felt that Olivia and Noah's relationship had so much potential but the writer let them wallow in SO MUCH SELF-PITY that one just could not really see where the love came in. And if it wasn't bad enough that the two main protagonists were punishing themselves throughout the entire book, the peripheral characters were, too! In that sense, Darcy was perhaps the most normal person in this book and he was supposed to be a pervert! This book had so much promise, and Noah being a virgin was really sweet, but really there is just too much pain and angst running through it. Depressing."},{"Title":"X-Man (X-Men: The Age of Apocalypse Gold Deluxe Edition)","review":"When Legion, illigitamite son of Charles Xavier, traveled back in time to kill Magneto and accidently killed Xavier, an alternate world was created called the Age of Apocalypse in which Xavier never lived to form the X-Men and Apocalypse took over North America and most of the world. All the regular X-titles were put in hiatus for four months and replaced with alternate titles. X-Man (Cable) tells the story of young Nate Grey; a mysterious mutant created from the DNA of Scott &quot;Cyclops&quot; Summers and Jean Grey who is the most powerful mutant on the planet and is destined to face Apocalypse. Jeph Loeb's intricate writing is chock full of surprises and twists, and Nate's slugfest with Mr. Sinister is a must see. Even after the AoA saga concluded, X-Man continued to be a monthly title for a few years with Loeb at the helm in the beginning. All in all, X-Man is one of the best stories in the AoA storyline, and I strongly suggest looking up the Twilight of the Age of Apocalypse TPB to see Nate go toe to toe with Apocalypse and Holocaust."},{"Title":"X-Man (X-Men: The Age of Apocalypse Gold Deluxe Edition)","review":"This comic book has grat artestic pictures.The story is perfict to.Out of all the age of apacolips this is the best."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Family Time Bible","review":"This is such an incredible Bible.

It's out of print now, so hard to find, but I heartily recommend it."},{"Title":"White House Nannie","review":"I'm sure this book would probably not be of much interest to those who are too young to remember \\"Camelot\\" or weren't even born yet for that matter, but for those of us who grew up in that era, I found the book very enjoyable. If you're looking for juicy details, you won't find them here, but Ms. Shaw does shed some light on the personal relationships between Jack, Jackie,and their children which I found endearing."},{"Title":"White House Nannie","review":"If you are looking for a narrative on the early years of John and or Caroline Kennedy- this is the book for you. I own 60+ Kennedy books and had always wanted to purchase this one. Maude Shaw was with the Kennedy family from 1957-1965. She was the only person to live in the same home as Jacqueline and John Kennedy for an extended period of time. The book shows the loyalty and love she felt for the President, Mrs. Kennedy, and their children. This book comes highly recommended from an avid Kennedy reader and follower."},{"Title":"The Economics of Network Industries","review":"This is an original academic textbook for network economics. Oz Shy starts the book by making some reasonable claims on his discipline at large: scientific papers in economics are too technical and use unnecessary amounts of calculus. Though the book is very analytical and covers a wide scope of issues, prerequisites are at a considerably low level. Because the book uses game theory and logical reasoning instead of calculus, it is accessible to readers with different backgrounds. This book will be in good use at least with the students of economics and engineering.The book starts from the basic economics of networks and then analyses various networked industries from hardware to software and airlines to social interactions. Most topics stand separately on their own feet. The book ends with a compact presentation on the used game theoretical concepts as appendices.Being a texbook in economics, however, does not excuse inaccurate and sometimes clearly misleading use of technical terms. I had serious problems understanding why &quot;software&quot; denotes in this book to all kind of digital content including music and movies. In my mind, the word software is restricted to computer programs and associated materials. Also, building models on some specific technology, Shy continuously leaps over the problem of defining its essential features, which should (or should not) be modeled. Taking definitions of technical terms as given (by Shy) can definitely confuse at least engineering students.In overall, this book might be best characterized as an academic add-on to the well-known business book &quot;Information Rules&quot; by Carl Shapiro and Hal Varian. With some inaccurancies and perhaps some time-gap to real world applications, it makes a good textbook. Essential parts are timeless and presentation clear."},{"Title":"The Economics of Network Industries","review":"This is a very interesting book that covers the full range of network industries - and is in many ways a welcome addition to the literature.However, I found the pitch of the book to be not quite right. In an attempt to satisfy a student market, the presentation is a little simplistic in places. Although there are IO courses everywhere, there are few solely devoted to network industries - so it is surprising that the publishers risked producing a paperback.As a consumer, the price of Professor Shy's book is an appealing factor, but I found Hans Gottinger's far more up-to-date, rigorous and analytical book of the same title (Routledge, 2003) more stimulating."},{"Title":"The Parrot Trainer","review":"Jack Miller meets people in the strangest ways.Take the dead man at the beginning of this finely crafted Southwestern novel. The car he's driving flies off the cliff above Miller as the former pot hunter is digging in a place called Lacuna Canyon. Inside the wrecked Ford Taurus is a German anthropologist dead from a probable heart attack. Among his possessions are drawings of a compelling young woman on a Mimbres Indian pot and a map on how to find it.Driven by the compulsion that some people have for ancient artifacts, Miller follows the map and finds an untouched Mimbres site with the bowl in a bed of parrot feathers. Carrying the find to his truck, Miller is bitten by a scorpion whose poison makes him delirious. That's when he meets the second stranger in the form of a sexy Tinker Belle named Willow-an apparition of the girl on the bowl. Her spirit is trapped inside, she tells Miller. Her request: break the bowl so her spirit can go free.This quest and others Miller undertakes explore his conversion from a mercenary pot hunter to man with a genuine desire to unlock cultural mysteries. In the course of his exploration, he encounters such odd characters as Henri Bashe, a French intellectual who deconstructs everything he observes; a film crew right out of Dukes of Hazzard; an Indian art forger named Kills the Deer; and Lucy Perelli, the sexy head of a preservation fund. She proves to be an enabler for a sleazy Eastern archaeologist. His goal: lay claim to an archaeological find of Miller's that proves prehistoric migrations took place much earlier than those claimed by Native Americans.With this stew of characters, the plot cooks up into a wild comedy. It is a darkly funny send-up, in which cultures and characters that should not even be in the same county with one another are forced to interact. The result is thoughtful, hilarious, frightening and at times philosophical.I have known Wolfe for three years now, meeting him here in the Valley while he was in the midst of writing The Parrot Trainer. We visited the Salado ruins near Globe, where he exhibited an encyclopedic knowledge of the dwellings and artifacts there. But he never revealed the bizarre plot line that he was working on in his book. I'm glad of that, because reading the final product has been a delight.I had never thought of the stodgy world of archaeology as being fodder for such wry stuff. But here we have a diverse cast of characters examining the meaning of culture through lenses warped by their own cultures. These differing and sometimes hilarious points of view make it easy to understand the observation by Bashe that is the central theme of the book: \\"The waking world is merely illusory. The world of dreams is the true reality.\\"This is one of the few novels I have read that contains a bibliography of scientific references. This provides reassurance that the historical references in this work of fiction are indeed accurate. But I think the fiction in this wonderful little book is accurate, too. The past holds many treasures, and these can bring out the best and worst in us all. - Paul Perry"},{"Title":"The Parrot Trainer","review":"\\"The Parrot Trainer\\" by Swain Wolfe is just plain awful. I kept reading, hoping it would get better but it didn't. The writing is ham-fisted and the story telling is clunky. The characters are simply a collection of badly written stereotypes and are shallow, predictable and uninteresting. The writer seems inordinately satisfied with the breadth of his own amazing intellect -- there's a know-it-all quality about the information he regurgitates onto the pages without much point and the writing swings wildly from pretentious to unbearably cutesy and cringe-making ...The only thing in this book that rings true is the lecherous/dirty old man way in which the author (not to be confused with the characters) seems to salivate over Willow, a character who spends the book [with few clothes on] and which made me want to wash my hands when I put this book down. ..."},{"Title":"The Parrot Trainer","review":"I purchased this book finally, after borrowing it from the library at least 3 times. I love the characters, the story, and the ideas that Mr. Wolfe brings to the table. Especially the Parrot Trainer, she is an amazing creation. Great information about archeology, the south west now and long ago, some pomo and even a dash of motorcycle gang and mean, crazy criminals."},{"Title":"The Parrot Trainer","review":"Usually I write reviews of non-fiction books. But this exceptional novel has caused me to change my review area.Swain Wolfe gets to a thousand year rain (Have I said too much?) by a lovely and interesting story that is part ghost story, adventure story and love story; peopled by slightly loopy characters, who add a gentle level of fun.I have often joked about prefering my knowledge sugar-coated (within the context of a story). There is plenty of this kind of knowledge in THE PARROT TRAINER including archeology and Southwestern American culture, both ancient and modern. Good evidence for the author's honesty with facts is his willingnes to provide a bibliography for the reader to explore the subjects used in the story.GREAT FUN AND A GOOD READ!"},{"Title":"The Parrot Trainer","review":"This book is awful. I had to force myself to finish it. The author spends an inordinate amount of time describing events and characters that actually have very little to do with the story. The main characters are not developed nearly enough. There was a lot of potential in the character of Jack Miller, but he was, ultimately a disappointment, as was the entire book. this book sucks.

How many people it will appeal to I have no idea. On the one hand it is not going to rival Tolkien or J K Rowling for sales. On the other hand as scholarly revolutions, and scholarly controversies, go it is one of the famous ones, and one that in its time made banner newspaper headlines.This is the second edition of a book that had to be extensively rewritten because the evidence was pouring in even as the author wrote the work. Palmer had been very quick to support the decipherment, by a young amateur Michael Ventris, of the Linear B tablets found both on the Greek mainland and at the Palace of Minos at Cnossos on Crete, famously excavated by Sir Arthur Evans, as being in the Greek language. This had a radical impact on the history (or prehistory) of the Bronze Age in Greece, because if these tablets are Greek it is patently impossible to suppose that the Greek invasion of Crete took place at some later date. As recast, the book now takes us through the decipherment process, the identification and location of the Mycenaean fortress of Pylos on the south-west Peloponnese, the early history of Crete and finally the origin of the Greeks themselves and a theory of the nature of the Linear A tablets, which Palmer believes to be in the Anatolian Indo-European language Luvian. This was, at least, the position in 1965. I have been out of touch with the issue since then, but whatever refinements have been made in subsequent scholarship, this book surely represents a watershed second only to the work of Ventris himself.It is a book for scholars (some of whom clearly need it badly) but also for a certain type of lay reader. Palmer concedes that the book is to some extent demanding, but I would ascribe that more to the amount of detail than to anything else, and the detail is largely a matter of a plethora of place-names which can be followed from the maps. There is also a great deal of detail regarding the interpretation of the archaeological evidence. This should in fact be intelligible and enjoyable to anyone who enjoys following a good advocate's reasoning - Palmer himself uses the analogy of his readers as a jury at several points. Greek words and names are given in Roman script, and in general Palmer's vast learning is carried lightly and presented with skill and tact. As I remember him from real life, his mind is a little bit quick for mine and I sometimes had to scramble to keep abreast of the steps of his reasoning, but in general he is clear enough. He is careful not to burden the reader with excessive philological detail in particular, but I suspect a footnote about \`labio-velars' would actually have helped readers puzzled about how i-qo becomes \`hippos' the Greek for a horse, and it would not have hurt to let out that the syllable shared by the words for \`and' and \`four' is \`te'.What made the book famous of course, is that in some places it flatly contradicts Evans based on the evidence of Evans himself and his collaborator Mackenzie. This is what produced the newspaper features claiming that Palmer had debunked Evans. In fact one should expect that, although Palmer, as if butter would not melt in his mouth, claims innocently that in fact Evans made two compensating errors and thus arrived not far off the truth. What it also produced was some scholarship of the worst kind in some quarters. Challenges to Ventris's decipherment had already been mounted, which is perfectly fair to that extent but which should not have descended to attacks on his integrity without very good evidence indeed. Palmer himself came under some knee-jerk straight-into-denial attack from a colleague at Oxford, the posthumous apostle of Evans. I never saw a better in-fighter than Palmer. He is afraid of nobody and nobody upsets him. The calm serious academic manner never deserts him and he is all the more effective for it.I wonder where it has all gone since 1965, but I'll be surprised if this book is not still the major monument along the road. In this highly favourable assessment you will of course bear in mind that my teacher was, well, Palmer."},{"Title":"Star Trek Voyager Avalon Rising Graphic Novel Special Edition (Wildstorm Star Trek Comics, Special Edition Prestige format)","review":"Taking a brief break from the USS Voyagers usual storyline writers Janine Ellen Young and Doselle Young combine Starfleet and King Arthur in Star Trek: Avalon Rising. I myself am a big fan of historical times dealing with wizards and knights so this for me was pretty fun although I can see if some hardcore fans would find this issue difficult to swallow. Penciled by David Roach and colored by Dan Brown the characters are spot on and the scenes look great(don't be fouled by the poor artwork on the cover). The story has a moderate amount of action and is written very well. The majority of the issue deals with a single beings struggle for self worth and his place in an unknown future. There are some faults with the story mainly when Janeway starts to tell the story in the beginning of the issue but doesn't conclude it in the end, but its not a very big deal and most probably will forget it anyways.A good story if you want to take timeout from the usual Voyager Vs. Borg story.ALL FEEDBACK IS APPRECIATED. THANKS AND GOOD READING."},{"Title":"Somewhere in the Night: Eight Gay Tales of the Supernatural","review":"Well, if it bothers you - Andrew is a gay, 20 something vampire. If it doesn't, you'll find this book a lot of fun to read - I especially enjoyed the 2 Andrew stories and have also bought the other related books. Not all of the stories are as much fun - but all were worth reading. I have purchased more than one copy and have given a few to friends."},{"Title":"Somewhere in the Night: Eight Gay Tales of the Supernatural","review":"McMahan makes a valiant attempt in this collection of gay-themed horror stories, but the results are mixed. At times he turns phrases nicely and presents us with vivid images, but his insistence on using the present tense in all but two of the stories is irritating, distracting, and unnecessary. Reading fiction written in present tense always makes me feel like I'm on a tugboat on storm-tossed waters. I get confused and a bit dizzy.&quot;Johnny Two-Face&quot;, about a ghoulish Halloween party, is just silly, and &quot;This Apartment Possessed&quot; turns out to be a mess. Still the title tale is impressive, with its moral conundrum that must always be at the heart of successful horror fiction. Here Andrew, the protagonist, a young vampire, reflects on his ability to bestow immortality on his victims. Andrew returns in &quot;Hell is for Children&quot;, but only a dolt would not be able to figure out who the decapitator is in the first few pages. &quot;Fantasyland&quot; is probably the best story in the collection. Its theme, of escape from adversity through imagination, is familiar enough, but McMahan shows some skill in demarcating reality and fantasy."},{"Title":"Somewhere in the Night: Eight Gay Tales of the Supernatural","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The stories were diverse, from horrifying to lighthearted, and well thought out. One of the stories here provides the basis for his later book &quot;Vampires Anonymous&quot;"},{"Title":"Somewhere in the Night: Eight Gay Tales of the Supernatural","review":"Eight horror tales that (more or less) deal with gay people or gay issues. I have no problem with that (I'm gay myself) but I honestly can't say I like this. McMahan is (or was) a very talented writer and knows how to depress and scare an audience...but he goes too far. Most of these tales are full of unlikable characters and the events are just downright disgusting. \\"Two-Faced Johnny\\", \\"This House Possessed\\", \\"Who Could Ask For Anything More\\" and especially \\"The Dark Red Day\\" are all well-written but the protagonists all go through unbearable agony and pain with no real closure that it becomes a chore to read. \\"Fantasyland\\" is one of the few ones that offer ANY hope at the end. The two strongest stories--\\"Somewhere in the Night\\" and \\"Hell Is For Children\\" make this whole collection worth reading. They both deal with Andrew--a vampire who passes as human but is always fighting his thirst. You see everything through his eyes and hear his thoughts--and mostly they're pretty funny. The humor in these stories are a welcome release from all the gloom and doom of everything else. Make no mistake about it--these stories are gruesome but the humor helps make them more pleasurable.

He was co-founder with Harry Hay and Don Kilhefner of the Radical Faerie movement in 1979 and was the first writer to propose a gay-centered Jungian psychology in his 1975 Master's thesis, \\"Gay Depth Psychology.\\"Since then he has continued to explore gay archetypal truths as a queer shamanic psychologist in his writings, practice and a growing community of people engaged in gay-centered inner work.Visionary Love: A Spirit Book of Gay Mythology and Transmutational Faerie (Treeroots Press, 1980) is a little book of barely a hundred pages. But, oh! What treasures are buried within those pages, what globe-encircling and decade-spanning memes given rise to! This is a book about rebirthing within ourselves and within one another as queer men that alchemic power to transform the world and everything in it that a heterosexist, pleasure-denying and oppressive cutural matrix has sought to stifle, to silence and to rob. It is a wonderful companion to that other great work of Queer spirituality, Judy Grahn's \\"Another Mother Tongue,\\" and the two serve admirably as complements to each other.This little book has been out of print for many years, but it played so epochal a role in the revivification of the Queer Spirit, that wild faith of the Faeirie, that it needs to be not simply widely read, but widely learned and loved."},{"Title":"Who is the Holy Ghost:","review":"Ray Hughes is one of the best known preachers in the Church of God (Cleveland, TN). He is in high demand for campmeetings and for revival services in many Pentecostal churches. He also is one of the Church of God's most prolific writers with many of his sermons becoming books.In this short book, Rev. Hughes offers a classical Pentecostal view of the Holy Spirit. The classical position being that the every Christian needs to experience the Baptism with the Holy Ghost with the initial, physical sign of speaking in other tongues according to Acts 2:4. Those who have never spoken in tongues are said to not be Spirit-Filled according to Scripture. Hughes writes to defend this position.However, this book is much more than the Church of God, Spirit-Baptism, and speaking in other tongues but Rev. Hughes presents a short overview of the entire person and work of the Holy Ghost from the Old and New Testaments. He briefly touches on various views of the Holy Spirit but mostly offers an evangelical view apart from sanctification (Wesleyan) and Spirit-Baptism (Pentecostal) and the gifts of the Spirit (non-cessasionist)."},{"Title":"The Complete Painters Handbook: How to Paint Your House Inside and Out-The Right Way","review":"I've used this book to guide me, a raw beginner that did not know the difference between oil & water based paint, from painting room to room to exterior porches and windows...on and on...to the point that I'm now considered a very good painter.Well written for the beginner, with plenty of practical information without getting too technical."},{"Title":"Parenting the Heart of Your Child: Teaching Your Kids to Make Good Decisions Even When No One Is Looking","review":"You have kids?

The format is great and very easy to follow. The book helps you identify where your child is currently in his or her character development and then gives you the tools to help them progress. I found it to be extremely practical. Diane's ideas, for example, about consistent consequences and random rewards made sense and were very easy to implement in my home. This book is really about developing your child's character, not improving their behavior. I love the idea that I am helping my children grow in the way they think, so that they can know for themselves the appropriate behavior response, rather than just giving them a list of what to or not to do. I'm so excited about what I've learned from this book that I'm going through it again, this time with a few friends.

Not at all, according to this intriguing work by the late professor Qiwen Lu. This book, fascinating at times, offers an in-depth look at four successful Chinese tech enterprises. Taking each of the four as a case study, Lu thoroughly illustrates the challenges facing a bureaucracy attempting to break into a fast-changing industry. In spite of its good points, Lu's book isn't perfect. The text is laden with jargon, and at times it's difficult to understand exactly how these enterprises are organized.

The first two chapters are very engaging. But by the third chapter he moves into more philosophical territory and never regains the pace and focus. This chapter (the third) is mostly worth reading, but at times it's distracted and repetitive. It's true that &quot;evolution is a blind process, and not a caring designer&quot;, but the point is not that interesting by the fourth repeat. It's a seven chapter book, but the fourth, fifth and sixth chapters have nothing to do with human lifespan and the propect of immortality. They cover neuroscience, cosmology, quantum theory and some anthropology. There's also postmodern thinking on the mind and consciousness. There's nothing down-to-earth or practical about 'The Last Mortal Generation'. If you haven't read any Daniel Dennett, Paul Davies or Jarad Diamond these chapters (3 - 6) may make a good summary, but otherwise, you'll just be reading reviews of all their theories. In these chapters too, the book labors under elements of predictable political correctness. There are the usual comments on sexism, racism and intelligence that get miles of coverage in the press. Yawn. If you're looking for information on aging and extending lifespan get Stephen Austads' book &quot;Why We Age&quot;. It's well worth it. Likewise for anthropology and human history I'd get &quot;Guns Germs and Steel&quot; (Jarad Diamond) and go straight to the source. (Why hear things second hand?) Since I was looking for immortality and lifespan information I was disappointed overall, even though the first two chapters had me gripped and intrigued. To be honest, if the book was cheaper and only four (relevant) chapters long I might have given it 4 stars (maybe). If you want a review of lots of science related books from the 90's (and you haven't read many) then this may be just what you need. Otherwise I'd look elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Last Mortal Generation: How Science Will Alter Our Lives in the 21st Century","review":"I have to be honest. My last review was too harsh. I've read half the book again (a couple of times). In fact the first two chapters have been such a good resource that the book is worth it, just for them alone. Broderick has drawn together a lot of information about a huge topic. It's as up to date as any book can be on the big medical breakthroughs against aging.In a nutshell, this is an enormous topic. My expectations were probably unreasonably high on the first read. The fact that I read it (or half of it) again says a lot. Broderick is one of the very few who are writing on the profound possibility of medical 'immortality'. He's obviously read almost all the significant science books on every topic that have come out in the last decade (he's a book-reviewer for a major paper). So he has a very broad knowledge-base to draw on, unlike a medical specialist. I haven't read a better summary of the pace of medicine and the logical next step.The middle chapters on neuroscience, consciousness, quantum theory and cosmology didn't grab me. But that's probably my failure of interest with the topics rather than a reflection on Broderick's writing. They are a bit of a long bow to draw from the title (and I'm transfixed by the possiblity of immortality for humankind, so it would be hard for any topic not be a let down after the first half of the book.) I got a lot out of this book. I would've given it four stars if the middle chapters didn't seem so unconnected with the title. My previous review was accurate but unfairly balanced. (I'm feeling a bit sheepish). Actually, I wouldn't mind meeting the author. (Aww. Unlikely after my first review).

Nearly every character in this story is a lowlife, and many are murderous, but good wins out in the end and everybody gets what they deserve. At the heart of the action are Jack, an ex-con who dreams of a better life while washing dishes in a takeout Chinese joint next door to the strip joint of the title, and Gloria, the dancer of every man's fantasies, who lives in her family's abandoned theme park. Along for the ride are Cecil R. Dupree, a redneck mobster who runs the little town of Mexican Wells, and his band of merry pranksters, Grape and Cat, as well as the suave Ricky Chavez, who pines for Gloria with boxed chocolates in his hand and French condoms in his pocket. The story follows a number of conventional lines, but the characters are so memorable that readers can forgive author Neil Barrett, Jr. for treading down a predictable path."},{"Title":"Piggs","review":"Pigs is my first Neal Barrett book and I was more than pleased.

The worst abomination is the editor's assignment of some of the choral lines at certain points to be sung solo. Luigi Cherubini wrote his C Minor Requiem for chorus only, with no vocal solos whatsoever, with orchestral accompaniment (reduced here, of course and acceptably, for keyboard instrument).I once attended a performance of this sublime work in Boston, at Trinity Protestant Episcopal Church in Copley Square, given by that church's own fine choir and organist. I remember being outraged on that occasion at the use of solo voices in some places. I wrongly blamed the conductor for this sacrilege, but later I learned of this appalling edition, which, very probably, was the one that the chorus, unwanted soloists, and organist were using.Incidentally, that performance in the 1960s in Boston was a good illustration of why a choirmaster-organist should study the full score (in this case chorus of mixed voices with orchestra) of such a work when preparing a performance with an organ arrangement of an accompaniment originally for orchestra. It is crucial for the organist to know the orchestral colours that the composer intended, in order to choose best the registrations to use on the organ to approximate them; that Boston performance was woefully deficient in this regard, too, since the organist's choice of organ stops was far from what better would convey the composer's range of colour to convey the work's varying moods. If the editor of a score with reduced accompaniment indicates a choice of organ stops for use, it still behooves the organist who prepares a performance of the work to study the full score of the music and/or to listen to a recording of the work in its original scoring to judge how best to select the stops for a performance with the accompaniment arranged for organ.Both of Cherubini's supremely fine requiem masses (the other, the second of the two, in D minor, the choral registration being for men's voices only) have gained immensely in popularity in recent decades. Buy one of the many good to excellent editions (or several of them) of these works, not this publication!"},{"Title":"15 Two-Block Quilts: Unlocked the Secrets of Secondary Patterns","review":"One of the most fun things about working with quilt blocks is that you never know what surprises you will encounter. Two relatively plain looking blocks can yield a dynamite quilt design by the interaction of their elements, creating an entirely different secondary pattern. Claudia Olson takes this basic geometric phenomenon and makes a science of it. By studying various quilt block designs, she discovers the secrets of why some blocks work well together and others do not, and shares her knowledge with us. The result is a series of striking new geometric designs made from familiar favorites. The lion's share of this book is given over to detailed project instructions illustrated in full color, and Olson's color choices are varied and interesting. I particularly like the quilt \\"Dublin Square,\\" which combines Dublin Steps and Town Square blocks. This book can teach you a lot about the social lives of quilt blocks."},{"Title":"15 Two-Block Quilts: Unlocked the Secrets of Secondary Patterns","review":"Great book!

However, as with his other books, The Battle of New Orleans is replete with new information, new perspectives, and new insights. Above all, Professor Remini always makes his topics, (even those the reader thought he knew well), exciting. Like a good novel, I had trouble putting down the book."},{"Title":"The Battle of New Orleans: Andrew Jackson and America's First Military Victory","review":"Remini has filled a gap for lovers of American history. The War of 1812, which the Battle of New Orleans ended convincingly (allowing the previously negotiated Treaty of Ghent to be accepted by both the British and our side as negotiated), has had too few treatments in recent years.Yet the Battle of New Orleans, as the author argues, perhaps was the event that convinced hostile Europeans that America was here to stay as a free nation. I would not completely agree with Remini's contention that the Battle of New Orleans was America's first major victory over European arms (he dismisses Yorktown and Saratoga as mere surrenders doing in my opinion a disservice to the aggressive American commanders and troops who did fight and convincingly beat the British at Saratoga). The author makes a case that this neglected Battle of a forgotten war earned our country the grudging respect it would need to grow unmolested over the next few decades.That having been said, the book is a very well written account of a stirring and fascinating story. General Andrew Jackson, after defeating the Creek Indians and punishing Spanish Florida for aiding that foe as well as the British, leads his American volunteers to Louisianna to defend against the expected British move on New Orleans.The British proceed to the bayous of the Mississippi delta and engage in another European style campaign against wiley American back country fighters. One wonders why the English high command did not learn the lessons of Gen. Braddock's defeat in the French and Indian War or numerous defeats during the American Revolution. Doctrinaire plans and rigid troop handling along the lines of European war were not very successful against citizen soldiers who know how to use their weapons with skill and fight from behind cover.Using first person sources to illustrate the events in December 1814 to January of 1815, Remini gives voice to the events and people who helped make New Orleans a stirring American victory. Unsurprisingly, this biographer of Jackson paints a good portrait of the man whose talents and traits were sorely needed by our side in facing British regiments who had recently faced down Napolean's best troops. The hodge-podge of defenders are given colorful treatment. The pirate Laffite brothers and their outlaw band who manned our artillery, backwoodsmen in buckskin (giving the name the British used for our troops -- 'dirty shirts'), freed blacks, Creols and New Orleans first citizens all manned the barracades to await the onslaught.The British, with their straight ahead determination, poor avenue of attack and lack of planning aided the American cause. But Jackson earned much of the glory that surrounded his victory. He cajoled troops and supplies, built a well fortified line, attacked before the British were all up and ready and worked to keep together an army that in reality was more like today's UN peacekeeping forces than a coherent American corps.The battle scenes are well told, particularly the Jan. 8th main assualt in front of New Orleans. Remini's writing is good enough that the unfamiliar (to most) details of an unknown battlefield come alive in the reader's mind. So do the personalities on both sides. His descriptions are aided by three very good maps that allow one to fully picture the terrain.This book is a quick read. The author tells just enough of the main charactors to separate them from one another in the story without bogging it down with a lot of background. The battles themselves come alive and are given a full description and dramatic rendering. You'll enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Battle of New Orleans: Andrew Jackson and America's First Military Victory","review":"A fine account. Lucid, flowing prose and an interesting subject. The author is able to relate the details that make battles interesting from the point of view of the common soldier to the officers in charge, yet also connects the events of battle to the war itself and larger diplomatic and political issues thus highlighting their significance. This book also has what some good military histories foolishly lack -- good, detailed battlefield maps that make the action understandable. Take it from a former soldier (US Army 1966-69, Vietnam service 1968-69) you will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Battle of New Orleans: Andrew Jackson and America's First Military Victory","review":"Robert Remini, a noted and prolific scholar on Andrew Jackson, has narrowed his focus to write a colorful and informative account of the Battle of New Orleans, the final battle in Britain's unsuccessful war of invasion of the United States, the \\"War of 1812\\". Most Americans' grasp of the battle boils down to a few factoids: Andy Jackson won, pirate Jean Lafitte helped, and the battle was fought after the treaty marking its end (the Treaty of Ghent) was signed, but before news of the treaty reached the new world. Remini's success is in providing a wonderful and interesting background for the events of the battle: the polyglot and stratified society of New Orleans; continued British designs in North America even after the American colonies won their independence; and most starkly, the stalwart, near fanatical patriotism of Andrew Jackson.The British campaigning is well recounted, from attacks at Mobile Bay to the laborious transfer of troops through the Louisiana bayous, to the final disastrous assaults on entrenched American lines. This book is informative without being overly-dense to a newcomer to the material. A must-read for Americans who've let the battle and its significance slip from the national consciousness. Remini does pay a bit of lip service to the British by doing some research on their commanders and setting them in the context of their career paths. He also wraps up by noting that the Battle of New Orleans was, for decades, seen as a defining coming-of-age moment for the young American republic, it launched Jackson to the White House and was the final and true declaration of independence for newly-empowered Americans.However, Remini's unabashed flag-waving and affection for his hero create some awkward passages. Time and again he gnashes teeth at British arrogance and nearly weeps at the ragtag nature of the American army, held together by the immense will of great Jackson. At times the book borders on hero worship and veers away from analytical political/military history. So that in the end, this is a readable and interesting history, but a flawed one. An informative ride to the gates of New Orleans, but one taken from the American side."},{"Title":"The Battle of New Orleans: Andrew Jackson and America's First Military Victory","review":"While researching the Battle of New Orleans for a paper, I consulted this work as a source. Admittedly, I came to it expecting some partiality for \\"The Hero of New Orleans,\\" but this book goes far beyond mere partiality. It is essentially a rehash of the traditional American version: The complacent redcoats, accustomed to victories in Europe, came to brush aside the \\"dirty-shirts\\" and seize the \\"Beauty and Booty\\" of New Orleans, but the Americans, inexperienced but endowed with innate talent, rallied behind Old Hickory, who outwitted and outfought the British at every turn in true American style. The marked disparity in casualties makes this a difficult argument to refute prima facie, but there is much more to the story.Remini is very selective in his sources, especially when compared to other historians of the battle. Robin Reilly takes a very reliable approach in The British at the Gates. While consulting memoirs and secondary histories, he makes extensive use of diaries, letters, and reports from the participants themselves at or near the time of the battle. Remini, however, largely eschews this line of research, especially for the British. For their point-of-view, he relies almost solely on Lieutenant Gleig and Captain Cooke's accounts written years after the event. Unfortunately, the best source for the British does not even appear in his bibliography. Colonel Dickson, the British chief of artillery, kept a detailed, fairly objective journal throughout the campaign. But while Remini is willing to quote a young infantry lieutenant's perception of the artillery battle on Jan. 1 written years after the event, he ignores and flagrantly contradicts the British artillery chief's assessment, complete with figures and a sketched plan, immediately after the battle. Major Michell's diary is infinitely briefer, but it does not show up either, since it too contradicts what Remini writes. Official British reports receive little attention, in contrast to the near-dependence upon just two subalterns' memories. Common myths of the battle- among them that the British used casks filled with sugar (instead of the earth they actually used), that the Americans managed to spike the guns on the West Bank, that the British would have sacked New Orleans had they conquered it, and that the Americans completely silenced the British artillery on Jan. 1- abound in this work, despite the lack of corroborating evidence in primary sources, which often actually disprove them.The tone itself is an indicator of the author's bias. Remini beats his audience over the head with the \\"Beauty and Booty\\" charge against the British, even though this has been convincingly refuted in Donald Hickey's Don't Give Up the Ship! Myths of the War of 1812 and Reilly's The British at the Gates. We are always reminded of the perfect marksmanship of the American riflemen, even to the point where Remini says, \\"The Tennessee and Kentucky riflemen never seemed to miss a target,\\" having just a paragraph earlier cited Lieutenant Gleig's memoirs to show that \\"\`the Americans, without so much as lifting their faces above the rampart, swung their firelocks by one arm over the wall.'\\" This only compounds the problem in Remini's emphasis on rifles that they were too few, too slow-loading, and too hindered by the clouds of black powder smoke to greatly impact the battle, and that Donald Graves's analysis of British units \\"shows that those with the heaviest casualties were in front of the American guns, not the American riflemen.\\"Remini can also be vague with the sources he does have. Some of his most exciting tales (Choctaws raiding the British camp and inflicting 50 casualties and the Tennesseans sneaking up a 6-pounder to fire on the British by night) have no citations with which the reader can verify them. He even states that Jackson, already weak with dysentery, went \\"five days and four nights\\" without sleep or a good hot meal, and apparently with no impairment of his faculties. He describes the victory celebrations immediately after the battle very well, but when he describes the changes in America following the battle, he does not provide any citable evidence of causality, rather than just correlation.And he even feels free to change his source's evidence. To prove that the British intended to march up the Mississippi all the way to Canada, he cites a quote attributed to Lord Castlereagh by early American historian Alexander Walker, which curiously does not appear in too many other historians' works on the battle. Castlereagh supposedly proclaimed just about the time the expedition arrived at New Orleans that it had already taken New Orleans, burned the major American seaports, and seized the entire Mississippi and the Great Lakes. It is a ridiculous claim that Castlereagh said such a thing, all the more problematic because Walker does not provide his source, so Remini changes it to a prediction instead.This book is not complete fiction, but the errors are blended in so thoroughly with fact that it should be avoided. There are more balanced accounts available, such as Robin Reilly's, Donald Hickey's, and John Elting's in Amateurs, to Arms!."},{"Title":"The Battle of New Orleans: Andrew Jackson and America's First Military Victory","review":"I tend to agree with all the previous reviews of this book, both the good and the bad. That may sound a bit strange, as this is a well told historical account of the Battle for New Orleans. The book's narrative is fast and snappy, the story is well told and presented in a way that it reads like a novel. The author, Robert V. Remini certainly loves this period of history and has a deep respect for Andrew Jackson, which shows throughout the book, maybe too much so. One of the previous reviewers mentioned the fact that the story was a bit too much like \\"good versus evil\\".I found on occasions that the American forces could do no wrong while the British were blunderers. For example, the chapter \`The Night Attack' shows Jackson throwing his troops, inferior in numbers and without full knowledge of the British forces in a spoiling attack against the advance guard of the British forces. Certainly the spoiling attack is a sound military move and paid good dividends in this instance. Jackson is shown as a daring commander however when the British forces do something very similar against the American positions they are made to sound like bumbling fools. Why is one commander a daring master and the other an idiot?On a similar note, when Jackson showed caution on a number of occasions throughout this battle he was commended but when the British leadership showed this same caution they were castigated. I agree with the author that the British leadership was ineffectual at times but that is making a judgement in hindsight. The author made mention of Jackson's burning hatred of the British and their contempt for the American forces, maybe a little of this has rubbed off on the author?Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this book, it's a great story and my own country's history has no love of the British but I don't like it to show so one sided in any book I read. Beside that, the maps supplied (3) were of a high quality and a pleasant change but once again even the maps seemed to be one sided. The map showing the positions of the opposing forces for the attack on January 8, 1815 (page 135) show in great detail the American positions with the units indicated but nothing as detailed for the attacking British forces.Having said all that, it was pleasing to note that the author paid tribute to the brave soldiers on both sides of this terrible battle. Overall this is an excellent story, told with verve and passion and it's a great book to read. I hope that the remarks above do not offend anyone, they are not made with that intention. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys history and would like to learn about this turning point in America's history."},{"Title":"The Battle of New Orleans: Andrew Jackson and America's First Military Victory","review":"This is a wonderful book for anyone interested in the real \\"soul\\" of the United States and its military future; it's not just a history of the Battle of New Orleans, it's also a primer for the debate about the future of the American military.The United States was thoroughly defeated in the War of 1812. By 1814, the New England economy had been destroyed and several states were talking of secession to join Canada, Washington was in smoldering ruins, the Navy cowering in ports and the British were conducting search and destroy missions at will along the seacoasts. At Ghent, American negotiators threw in the towel and accepted the British terms to restore everything as it had been before the war.Out of this, Americans invented their nation. Until then, European nations often regarded the War of Independence as an accident. After 1815, no one doubted the United States. Without the Battle of New Orleans, the United States might have dissolved in confusion or dissension. For the British, it was a minor skirmish in a dismal far off swamp. Only 291 British soldiers were killed in the final attack, compared to 240 British soldiers killed in the charge up Bunker Hill.After New Orleans, the British created the greatest empire the world has ever seen. After New Orleans, the Americans created democracy as the world knows it today. This nation is a product of the resourcefulness, courage and ability shown by Gen. Andrew Jackson at New Orleans. Remini puts his focus on Jackson; without him, the Battle of New Orleans would have been a sorry repeat of the burning of Washington.New Orleans didn't teach the British anything. They used the same stupid \\"charge the cannons\\" tactics in the Crimean War, celebrated in The Charge of the Light Brigade. In World War I, British generals updated their New Orleans tactics to \\"charge the machine guns.\\" New Orleans taught the British nothing; the War of 1812 taught Americans never to make the same mistake twice.Instead of fat generals who were heroes of an earlier war, Americans learned the value of military competence and professionalism. Thirty years later, officers trained in the War of 1812 needed less than one quarter of the troops used in the War of 1812 to rout the Mexicans. War is the harshest test of any nation, and by 1815 the United States learned it could survive against the world's finest military. New Orleans showed they could also win smashing victories.After the War of 1812, the United States became the de facto partner of Great Britain in blocking further European interference in the Americas. Remini's descriptions of events relating to the battle are vital; it emphasizes the core values that made the United States what it is today -- and Great Britain what it is today. It gave Americans their wonderful confidence to always overcome any disaster and come back stronger. This is a wonderful book that explains the nature of the soul of this country.Take away that self-assurance, and the United States would have become \\"the first Balkans\\" with Serbian troops needed to keep the peace among fractious states. Hopefully, Professor Remini will now expand his last four and one-half pages into another book of this length to illustrate the lessons and myths learned from the Battle of New Orleans -- as relevant today as they were in 1815 - 45. The United States is now in the position that Britain was in 1815; in another century, the US may be in the same position that Britain was in 1915. That is the implicit meaning of this book.Perhaps the finest assessment of the War of 1812 came from Thomas Jefferson when he wrote, \\"We owe to their [Britain's] past follies and wrongs the incalculable advantage of being made independent of them in every material manufacture. These have taken such root, in our private families especially, that nothing can now extirpate them.\\"This book outlines the mood that made it so. The decisions of the next decade, in terms of military and civilian attitudes, will be as significant as those made after Gen. Jackson's triumph over \\"the evil empire\\" of his era."},{"Title":"The Battle of New Orleans: Andrew Jackson and America's First Military Victory","review":"This is an exceptional account of a pivotal -- though largely neglected -- moment in US history.

Buy it, read it, a must have for any history collection. Remini gives excellent quotes complete with consumate sources and background on both the Americans and our invading British enemies of that time. An excellent read."},{"Title":"The Battle of New Orleans: Andrew Jackson and America's First Military Victory","review":"I truly enjoy running across a history book that tells an important, yet virtually unknown, story. I had heard of the Battle of New Orleans the way most people do: an odd battle, the only significant battle of the War of 1812 that the United States won, happening AFTER a peace accord had been signed on the other side of the Atlantic. There is much more to the tale, and Robert Remini does us all a favor by telling it well.The plot seems taylor-made for a hyper-patriotic movie: Pirates, rag-tag frontier militia (\\"dirty shirts\\"), freed slaves, \\"men of color\\", regular soldiers, poorly armed New Orleans lawyers and shopkeepers band together to take on some of the finest troops in the finest army on the planet at the time. Outnumbered three to one, the Americans prevail, with a killed/wounded ratio rarely seen before or since (thousands of British versus a few dozen Americans).Professor Remini shines when he is talking about facts, and he unearths interesting and unusual facts in profusion. Who knew that January 8th (victory anniversary) was almost as revered a date in American history, and celebrated nearly as vigorously, as the 4th of July for over 50 years after the battle? I had never heard of the pirate brothers that ran a business (more like a multi-national corporation) near New Orleans as effective as a chain of Saks 5th Ave stores, but were also wicked accurate with batteries of cannons, and when recruited as allies may have turned the battle to the Americans. I was delighted to learn more about Andrew Jackson, a true American hero.Remini, however, eventually leaves the field of facts, and waxes what can only be called hyperbolically about the importance of this single battle. Had we not won this battle (AFTER the war itself was actually over), we might not be a nation, we might not have espoused democracy, we probably wouldn't have beaten the Russians to the moon, and worst of all, the Lakers might not have won the NBA championship in 2009. Okay, okay, I exaggerate. But not much. Remini waxes so eloquently on the importance of the Battle of New Orleans that one truly does begin to feel that all that silly Declaration of Independence stuff, the Revolutionary War, and all men that wore wigs (Jefferson, Washington, John Adams, etc.) were mere preamble to the true birth of the nation: The Battle of New Orleans.If you're willing to suspend judgment on Remini's adulation of Jackson, what remains is a well documented and fascinating tale, short enough to polish off on a long plane trip or a weekend at the beach."},{"Title":"The Battle of New Orleans: Andrew Jackson and America's First Military Victory","review":"If you prefer your history written in the style of the 1950's, then this book is for you. The &quot;Indians&quot; are variably described as 'hostiles' and &quot;banging on their war drums while they screamed their defiance&quot;, their battles described as &quot;massacres&quot; the US army response as &quot;vengeance&quot;, &quot;the punishing hand of Andrew Jackson&quot;.One has the impression that the British and the Spanish are dastardly characters who deserved to lose the battle of New Orleans. There is some reasonably nice history of the city and the battle, but I must confess I hadn't the stomach to finish this book.What I read of the book is too black and white, heroes and villains, good guys and bad guys for my taste. I would have returned it if I hadn't accidentally torn the dust cover just after receiving it."},{"Title":"The Battle of New Orleans: Andrew Jackson and America's First Military Victory","review":"During the closing months of the War of 1812, the British attempted an invasion of Louisiana, with the intent of capturing New Orleans. The citizens of the city, the British believed, would welcome them only. Instead, the British encountered dogged resistence orchastrated by one Andrew Jackson, who only had a motley assortment of military and militia units at his command. On December 28, 1814 and again on January 8, 1815, the two sides clashed, and eventually the British were repulsed, sustaining disproportionately high casualties. Tragically, however, the treaty ending the war had be signed on Christmas eve--thus the battle was little more than a useless waste of life. All and all, this was an entertaining read, but I was somewhat bemused by the fact that the author found it necessary to emphasize the fact that such a rag-tag assortment of men had defeated the &quot;best trained army&quot; in the world. Considering the repeated defeats that the Americans had experienced prior to this, and the fact that the British were much more preoccupied with Napoleon, etc., the victory at New Orleans really seems to be a hollow victory at best."},{"Title":"The Battle of New Orleans: Andrew Jackson and America's First Military Victory","review":"When I first got the book, the edge was too sharp and as I went to open the cover, I cut my self, thus having an unfortunate injury of which gave me great discomfort, mental anguish, and above all, a fear of opening books ---Thus I surmised by bad Karma, the book it self was terrible.Take heed!"},{"Title":"The Battle of New Orleans: Andrew Jackson and America's First Military Victory","review":"Battle of New Orleans - Robert ReminiThis book is about the Battle of New Orleans that took place as the last fight with Britain in the War of 1812. For me, I had to read it at one sitting. Great book.The battle took place in January 1815, with 2 more attempts by the British, to defeat the Americans after their defeat on the fields of Chalmette.The book includes 3 maps to support some of the writing as to where the battle was fought and who was where. However, the author goes into a lot of detail explaining which unit was where on the battlefield, and no maps are shown for the kind of detail written.The book details events before and after the battle.He notes that a group of states in the Northeast had met in Hartford Ct, and had drafted a proposal to secede from the U.S. The war was going badly, and we had been defeated everywhere, except at Baltimore.The British had reason to believe they could just brush the Americans off the field of battle, as they had done this in several previous battles, including Washington, which they burned, and Hampton, Virginia, where they raped the women.New Orleans was the key to the Mississippi, and the British were sending an army south from Canada, and this army was to go north. The armies would meet, and then they would march east to the Atlantic ocean, shredding the American military in its way.They were the best of the British army, fresh from defeating Napoleon. 15,000 of them vs. 5,000 Americans.New Orleans was bulging with goods, having been cut off from shipping due to the war. Only the Barataria pirates dared to venture into the Gulf. The British army knew that New Orleans had plenty of booty to share when they won the battle, and lots of women to rape, so they were very much in favor of the battle.The British endured much to get to the battlefield, but the men thought it worth the prize.The Brits though, had to deal with Andrew Jackson. He fought the Creeks, allies of the Brits and defeated them before the British army arrived. Had they not been defeated, it is likely that the combination of the Indians and the British army would have defeated Jackson.Jackson attacked the Indians in Alabama and Spanish Florida, and defeated the Spanish and Indians at Pensacola. The Brits had a fort at Pensacola too, and blew it up when Jackson defeated the Spanish at the 2 Spanish forts defending Pensacola from a land attack. I have read accounts indicating that Jackson was insubordinate, disobeying orders from Washington not to attack the Spanish. Jackson did not get orders not to attack until after the battles were over.Frustrating a British attack on New Orleans starting from Pensacola, the Brits attacked Mobile.Jackson's men defeated them there too, successfully defending a fort defending Mobile bay.This defeat meant that the British could not attack New Orleans over land, the easy way.They had to attack from the east, in the swamps.This they did, attacking from lake Borgne.Having lived in New Orleans, and having seen several movies about the battle, this book corrects some myths.Jackson had steel gray hair, not the white hair Charleston Heston wig of white hair. Jackson was 47 at the time of the battle. The people of New Orleans rallied around Jackson and his men, and fought bravely. Jackson's men did not defend a bunch of Cajun wimps. There were 3 Lafitte brothers. I did not know that Dominique You was one of them. He has always been portrayed as a former Napoleon artillery gunner.The author makes no mention of any of the brothers fighting for Napoleon. It is true that the Lafitte pirates were pivotal in the battle, furnishing supplies, and artillery and knowledge of the land expertise. Jean Lafitte became one of Jackson aides.In spite of this being the best of the British army, the officers made several blunders which cost them the battle, over and over.1.When they initially got to the battlefield, on December 23, the Brits had enough troops to take New Orleans, and General Keane was urged by his officers to attack then and there with the men he had. Jackson was not aware that they were there. Keane waited for the rest of the army, so the opportunity was lost.2. The plan on the day of the major battle , January 8, was to attack from both sides of the river. Unfortunately, a dumb Scot officer delayed the boats taking the troops across the river by several hours, thus the attack on the West bank was delayed several hours. The west bank attack was successful, but occurred after the major battle on the east bank, so thanks to the Americans spiking the artillery on the West bank, meant nothing when the Americans were defeated. General Packenham attacked even though he knew his troops were not placed correctly. He was impatient, and had no respect for the Americans.3. Even after the battle on Jan 8, the Brits tried again to sail upriver and attack New Orleans from the river. Had they been able to get past Ft. St. Phillip, they could have still won. The Americans held Ft. St Phillip, and again New Orleans was saved. This battle is never shown in the movies.4. The Brits then tried again at Mobile, to make an overland attack from there. This time they took the fort at Mobile. Unfortunately, the message that the Treaty of Ghent had been signed a month earlier arrived, so further attack was called off."},{"Title":"The Battle of New Orleans: Andrew Jackson and America's First Military Victory","review":"Robert V. Remini is the great modern authority on Andrew Jackson, having written a majestic, award winning, three volume biography. Now he has taken a lifetime of research and consideration and distilled it down into one slender volume examining the pivotal moment in Jackson's career and, he argues, one of the vital events in our nation's history.If you're like me you know exactly three things about the War of 1812. First, that Dolly Madison saved the White House portrait of George Washington from being burned by invading British troops. Second, every kid who ever went to summer camp knows the great Johnny Horton song Battle of New Orleans. Third, that the battle itself took place after the peace treaty had been signed ending the War, but before the combatants had been informed. That was seriously all I knew until I read David Nevin's novel 1812 a couple of years ago (see review). You may know more. If so, more power to you. Should we know more? Remini makes a compelling case that we should.In addition to doing an excellent job of narrating the events of the battle, he argues that the victory was the moment that really made America a nation. The elements he cites include not merely the fact that it produced a future President, but also the confidence building importance of a citizen army winning a battle against the professional troops of the great British Empire, as well as the fact that this overwhelming defeat made the nations of Europe begin to take the United States seriously as a player on the world stage. In fact, he goes beyond this to argue that New Orleans was actually the nation's first military victory, discounting actions like Saratoga and Yorktown as mere surrenders. It is, of course, possible that he overstates this case a little, having such a vested interest in Jackson's career.On the other hand, he raises an excellent and little understood point about the War. It was one of only three wars in our history where our existence as a nation was truly threatened (obviously the Revolution and the Civil War were the others). We've fought all kinds of skirmishes, minor brush wars and mopping up operations--Mexican, Spanish-American, WWI, Korea, Vietnam, Persian Gulf, etc. And we like to kid ourselves about the threat that the Nazis posed in WWII, though by the time we got in, they were already toast. But really there were only the three conflicts where the United States as we understand it could have perished. If we understood that fact better, perhaps we would pay more heed to the events of 1812-1815. As is, Remini has done his part to capture our attention with this excellent little book.GRADE: B+"},{"Title":"The Battle of New Orleans: Andrew Jackson and America's First Military Victory","review":"Kudos to Remini for an outstanding and historically accurate understanding of the battle and its significance. Despite the absurd statements of anglophile reviewers like Mr. Kiley, the most overlooked fact about the battle is simply that it DID decide the final outcome of the War of 1812: the peace that had been negotiated had not been passed or approved by the British parliament (or the US Senate); the Brits were literally waiting for the battle's outcome before deciding whether to accept peace or continue the war. Had Jackson lost, the Brits would likely have kept the entire territory and left a permanent military presence in America's backyard. Simply put, this battle helped decide the fate of the American nation, and its importance can never be overestimated - British and embarassed Canadian historians engaging in revisionism first started the idea that the battle supposedly didnt matter because the war had already ended. No gentleman, Andrew Jackson ended the war - with a huge, crushing victory - when he whipped British regulars at New Orleans and secured the path for the US to become the world's most powerful nation."},{"Title":"The Battle of New Orleans: Andrew Jackson and America's First Military Victory","review":"This is a well-written, concise account of the southern theatre of the War of 1812. His writing style is comfortable to follow.

There is good description of the significant leaders involved, and a good smattering of personal accounts of the less famous to keep it personal and interesting. I liked the book!"},{"Title":"The Battle of New Orleans: Andrew Jackson and America's First Military Victory","review":"\\"In 1814, we took a little trip, along with Colonel Jackson down the Mighty Mississipp\\"... whoops! I may have been channeling the spirit of Johnny Horton there, but remembering that song causes one to remember the battle it commemorates and the all-too-forgotten war in was a part of. All that most people know of the War of 1812 was that it was the second time we fought and defeated the British. Some may know that that was the war when our great national anthem \\"The Star Spangled Banner\\" was penned (though most think it was written during the Revolution or Civil War). Few realize or understand just how important the War of 1812 was to the future of the United States, or just how close this fledgling country came to having its livelihood destroyed. Even those who know a little more about the war may view the Battle of New Orleans as an unnecessary skirmish coming well after the signing of the peace treaty between Britain and America. Fortunately, Robert Remini's book, \\"The Battle of New Orleans\\", puts the war into its proper perspective and shows us how important military victory the Battle of New Orleans was.For those not familiar, the War of 1812 began because the British would not recognize the sovereignty of the United States and kept conscripting its sailors to assist in Britain's war with France. In addition, Britain, along with all other European nations, did not respect the United States in general. The U.S. government believed it needed to take action to secure the safety of its own ships while also sending a loud statement to Europe that this was not a country to be trifled with. So, they declared war on Britain. Aside from a few skirmishes, though, the war was not much of note before the parties met to negotiate a peace treaty. The most notable happenings were the failed U.S. invasion of Canada (still a British colony), the British invasion and burning of Washington D.C., and the famed bombardment of Fort McHenry where the fort's resiliency caused Francis Scott Key to pen our anthem. While the terms of peace were be negotiated, though, the British forces sensed and opportunity to strike a crippling blow the United States by attempting to capture New Orleans, which would give them control of the Mississippi and essentially end all of the U.S. expansion hopes and keep this nation at only a third of its current size and likely would have slowly choked it to death. The U.S., recognizing this threat, sent a ragtag force commanded by General (not Colonel, as from the song) Andrew Jackson to fortify and defend the city against British aggression.It is Remini's assertion that the ensuing conflict, which at one point included a skirmish where over 1000 British soldiers were killed to only 8 for the U.S., was the first true military victory for this young nation. He contends that the key battles of Saratoga and Yorktown during the Revolution were more surrenders than decisive military victories and, for that reason, Britain still did not respect the United States because they did feel that they had truly lost. Even most of the War 1812 was devoid of any decisive engagements. While Remini's opinion of those last battles of the Revolution are highly debatable, there is no doubting his claim that the resounding victory at the Battle of New Orleans was landmark achievement in the development of United States as a legitimate nation and a fledgling world power. Remini does a fine job setting up the battle and chronicling all the dramatic twists and turns that took place. Reading this book is essential to understanding the importance of the Battle of New Orleans and, on a greater scale, the War of 1812. At just 240 pages, it is a quick read. Yet, it gives the reader a wealth of detail regarding that battle. It's a definite must for any history buff."},{"Title":"The Battle of New Orleans: Andrew Jackson and America's First Military Victory","review":"I bought and read this book while visiting New Orleans which made the book a very enjoyable read. Remini starts with Jackson's early War in the South. A forgotten American war hero, Jackson manages to win decisive victories in the Creek war, repulse the British at Mobile, and capture Pensacola from the Spaniards before scurrying over to New Orleans to save the city from an ignominious fate at the hands of the Duke of Wellington's army.The story itself is fantastic - Jackson's few regulars and Tennessee, Mississippi, and Kentucky militiamen, allied with New Orleans society men, free blacks, and Lafitte's pirates wind up outfighting the finest and most disciplined army in the world (who defeated Napoleon, by the way). The book includes helpful campaign maps and is well written even if some of the author's claims are a bit overblown (?America's first military victory?)."},{"Title":"The Battle of New Orleans: Andrew Jackson and America's First Military Victory","review":"There has been much good scholarship that has come out on the War of 1812 in the last ten years or so. John Elting's Amateurs, To Arms!, the excellent work of Canadian historian Donald Graves on the fighting on the Niagara frontier, as well as reliable histories on the siege of Fort Erie, the Battle of Sackett's Harbor, the Battle of Lake Erie, and the war on Lake Ontario. Additionally, Henry Adams' The War of 1812, the definitive volume of the war, has recently been reprinted. This recent volume on The Battle of New Orleans, however, is just not up to that standard, and perpetuates myths of that battle that have been put to rest by some of the above mentioned histories. Now, they are rearing their ugly head again, after so much research and scholarship has been accomplished to find out the facts of the case. In that respect, the author of this volume has done the history of the War of 1812 a great disservice.Like the Revolution before it, the militia in the War of 1812 generally had a dismal record, yet the author seems to wallow in joy praising the 'citizen soldiers' who did so well at New Orleans. The Tennessee and Kentucky Volunteers did perform well, but were not in the strictest sense militia. The accomplishments of the regulars, both army and marines, he pushes to the background, although, especially in the night attack of 24 December, they incurred the most casualties.For the battle itself on 8 January 1815, the author makes a point that American rifle fire was a deciding factor in the American victory, when it was the American artillery and the musket that defeated and outshot the British. As John Elting succinctly states in Amateurs, To Arms!'Though New Orleans has come down in American tradition as a victory for the Kentucky rifle, it was the American artillery that did most to crush the British attack. Next was the smoothbore musket with which regulars and most of the Louisians, Kentucky, and Tennessee militia were armed. Coffee's riflemen, being on the far left flank, were not heavily engaged. In fact, the musket's higher rate of fire made it superior to the rifle for such fighting.'Additionally, the author makes the ridiculous statement that New Orleans was 'America's first military victory' and that previous victories over the British such as Saratoga and Yorktown 'were simply surrenders, nothing more.' Nothing could be further from the truth. There had been American victories in the north against British regulars at Chippawa, Sackett's Harbor, Plattsburgh, Baltimore, the Thames, York, and Fort Erie, not to mention the strategic naval victories on Lake Erie and Lake Champlain. There were famous victories in the Revolution too, besides Saratoga and Yorktown: Cowpens, King's Mountain, and Greene's strategic victory in the Carolinas to name a few. To make a statement such as this in what is supposed to be a military history is ludicrous.Interestingly, neither John Elting's excellent history nor Henry Adams definitive work were used in the preparation of this volume. Neither was Robin Reilly's Enemy at the Gates, which is also an excellent history of the New Orleans campaign. In my opinion, not consulting them hurt this volume irreparably.This volume is not recommended as there are more scholarly and accurate volumes available, such as those mentioned above."},{"Title":"The Battle of New Orleans: Andrew Jackson and America's First Military Victory","review":"Remini has long been regarded as one of the, if not THE foremost historian on Jackson of our day, and he lives up to his reputation once again in this excellent book. He not only accurately portrays this battle as one of the defining moments of our nation's development, but does so with insight, a flair for the dramatic, and extensive historical research. Therefore, this book is both thrilling and educational at the same time, what a concept! Hopefully this book will reignite interest in Jackson and teach my fellow citizens why Jackson deserves to have his picture prominently displayed on the $20 bill. Furthermore, it will hopefully spark interest in how our nations past and present is shaped in great part due to the heroic efforts of a diverse society (just consider the hodgepodge of characters in Jackson's army), and of a society of common, average, hard-working folks who did extraordinary things in advance of their freedom.

The author, Robert Remini, is very fond of his subject, Andrew Jackson, whose fame gained in winning this battle eventually propelled him to high office where he became America's first president with upcountry origins.The most interesting part of the book involves Jackson's planning and putting together of the motley force with which to confront the British. From a military standpoint, the battle itself is not very interesting in that the British simply advanced toward Jackson's works and were cut to pieces. It was a sad waste of fine soldiery, many of whom were veterans of the Peninsular War against Napoleon's marshals in Spain. Their commander, General Packenham, was himself a Peninsular veteran and the brother-in-law of the Duke of Wellington.Remini's narrative flows very well and held my interest throughout. I found it especially informative as a former resident of New Orleans. The names of many of the dramatis personae, not just Jackson, but those such as Girod, Claiborne, Touro and others will resonate with New Orleanians as the names of many of their streets and other landmarks in the area."},{"Title":"The Battle of New Orleans: Andrew Jackson and America's First Military Victory","review":"This book establishes the importance of this battle by setting it in its own time the early 1800s.

I was amazed to find out who was friends with whom... nothing I was ever taught in ANY history class I ever attended! A must for all Pirate buffs!"},{"Title":"The Battle of New Orleans: Andrew Jackson and America's First Military Victory","review":"\\"The Battle Of New Orleans\\" introduces the reader to this battle and its importance to our nation's early history. The battle is presented in detail without the reader becoming swamped by minutia. The importance of the battle to our nation's development is explained.I like books which broaden my way of looking at things. This book meets this test. I had always wondered if the battle was fought outside of New Orleans because I have never heard of anyone visiting the battle site. In this book, author Robert V. Remini confirmed my belief by giving the story of the battles outside of the city extending over several days. He also explained the British war strategy of dividing the U.S. by marching up the Mississippi to link up with troops coming down from the Great Lakes in a way that I had never understood before.The aspect of this book which most interested me was the battle's importance in the development of our national pride and self-image. I was surprised to read that, until the Civil War, January 8, the date of the battle, was celebrated as a national holiday, second in significance to July 4. In this book I learned, for the first time, that the Battle of New Orleans was regarded as America's first major military victory. Although there had been some wins during the revolution, such as at the Cowpens, most of the successes were surrenders, such as Ticonderoga and Yorktown. This was the first time that the U. S. had crushed a European army. The most important significance of this battle was the sense of national unity which it demonstrated. The British had expected to be welcomed by the French settlers of New Orleans as liberators from their relatively recently established American overlords. The British were disappointed as the residents uniformly supported the Americans. The army which defended New Orleans was a polyglot of local pirates, U. S. Volunteers from southwestern states and local militia. This disparate army had united to defeat the most feared military machine in the world. National unity had been expressed as it never had before. The Battle of New Orleans demonstrated that the American experiment would continue. This book tells us why."},{"Title":"The Battle of New Orleans: Andrew Jackson and America's First Military Victory","review":"Truth is &quot;stranger&quot; than fiction. This is a great book recapping the Battle of New Oreans. Like similar books it is &quot;scary&quot; to see how close history could have gone one way or the other based on decisions or mistakes of those who, inevitably, define history.Andrew Jackson did us proud and this is a wonderful book."},{"Title":"The Battle of New Orleans: Andrew Jackson and America's First Military Victory","review":"For a student of this era, this book might be a little short and basic. For someone new to Old Hickory, and this battle, (me) this is a short, easy to follow and very enjoyable read. Only 200pgs., I zoomed through it and was sorry when I was done.The author gives background on many people, especially Jackson, and plenty of background on the Creek Wars and everything that led up to New Orleans. Also plenty of background (journals, etc.) from the British perspective.I finished this book with several new heroes, even more awe for our American history, and something else: a sense of the feeling back when people were truly proud to be American and to be \\"Free Men.\\" Men wo were willing to give all for this Country without ANY outside force or coercion.Thousands of volunteers came together, did for their Country, then went proudly home with barely any intervention from the Government. To most of them General Jackson was all the Govt. they wanted or needed. Inspirational."},{"Title":"The Battle of New Orleans: Andrew Jackson and America's First Military Victory","review":"Remini's thesis is that the Battle of New Orleans was critical for the self-esteem of the young republic. The victory of New Orleans allowed Americans to once again hold their heads up with pride, and Andrew Jackson was crowned, national hero. Remini attributes the victory of American troops to Jackson's Charismatic leadership, and the British leadership's failures lack of intiative and understand of the logistical demands of their invasion plans. Remini evidence is persausive on tatical issues on field of battle, but is less convincing on issues of symbolic importance of the Battle of New Orleans to the American people. However, Remini use of primary sources is commendable. The use of journals of British officers and Jackson's personal letters add credibility to the work. This book is a good starting place for those interested in the Battle of New Orleans or want an introduction to Andrew Jackson."},{"Title":"The Battle of New Orleans: Andrew Jackson and America's First Military Victory","review":"After recent plagiarism scandals in the discipline (cf. Stephen Ambrose and Doris Kearns Goodwin), the future of \\"popular history\\" has been understandably called into question. So it's refreshing to read Remini's _Battle of New Orleans_.Well-conceived and thoroughly researched, this book focuses not only on the American troops, but also on British forces during their New Orleans campaign. The chapters on the battle itself are acceptable military history; they emphasize the new importance of artillery in the American campaign, even as they describe the demoralizing effects of American sniper fire on British troops. Although Remini's account of the battle is not sufficiently technical to satisfy military-history buffs and specialists, it's more than adequate for the general reader.Remini also creates a fascinating portrait of federal-period New Orleans -- a prosperous, multi-ethnic, multi-racial, polyglot society that seems not so far removed from our own. But he consistently glosses over the one major respect that this society differed: the presence of slavery. The prosperity of New Orleans depended in large part on the slave trade, which probably would have come to an end had the city been conquered by the British. Even more than patriotism, the economic threat might explain the passionate defense of the city -- a defense manned by persons spanning every social class.Still, Remini's book generally exhibits the best characteristics of \\"popular history.\\" It's compulsively readable, patriotic but not facile, and responsive to historical and contemporary ideas. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Battle of New Orleans: Andrew Jackson and America's First Military Victory","review":"Studious detail, crisp research and an an uncanny feel for the era provide us with an honest, even glimpse of one of America's key military endeavors. The author doesn't judge, but like a careful observer, shares and explains what he has discovered. In this remarkable presentation, history truly does come alive and jumps out at us, much like the withering fire from Jackson's marksmen...which we can almost see as we turn the pages..."},{"Title":"The Battle of New Orleans: Andrew Jackson and America's First Military Victory","review":"Nobody knows &quot;Old Hickory&quot; like Robert Remini and with this short but very enjoyable book, he recreates the high point of Jackson's military career. Little remembered by history is just how important this battle was, not only because it restored American pride after a war gone badly, but because it prevented the British from establishing hegemony over the Mississippi River and with it America's heartland. The battle scenes are well described and the heroism of the American leader is well chronicled. This is a great history book just begging to be made into a TV miniseries."},{"Title":"The Battle of New Orleans: Andrew Jackson and America's First Military Victory","review":"I knew the basics of the battle, so when I came to this book, I wasn't expecting a lot, but boy was I impressed. The man goes to great lengths to tell you all of the details of the battle, down to what individuals and one single cannon achieved. I really, thoroughly enjoyed this book, and have loaned it out and recommended it any number of times.Paul Buckner,author of \\"From Broke to Broker, and other stories of finding financial freedom.\\""},{"Title":"The Battle of New Orleans: Andrew Jackson and America's First Military Victory","review":"I re-read this book for the third time on Jan 8 (the anniversary of the battle), not so much because it's that great of a book, but because you can pretty much rip through it in a day or two.The book is a very good overview of the battle and the events that directly led to it. It is well researched and written, and is very easy to read. As stated before it is short enough to get through in a couple of days, and is written so that really anyone can understand it, even those unfamiliar with the War of 1812 and this battle.Remini introduces the reader to many of the subplots that impacted the final outcome of the battle (ie: The British attempt to 'buy' the Laffite brothers and use Barataria as a point of invasion, Mullen's failure to lead the 44th forward, the British underestimating the current of the Mississippi.. etc)Yes the book has its flaws.. Remini absolutely worships Jackson and this book is no exception. As one reviewer points out, after reading this book, you would think that this was America's first and greatest victory.. Remini would almost have you believe that Jackson was the sole reason for the victory, and none of the 'subplots' that I mentioned above had any impact on the battle.Yes, as General, Jackson deserves the lion's share of the credit, and the city gratefully bestowed it upon him, but as with many battles, if any one of several events had gone the other way, the outcome of the battle might very well have been different.Of further debate is just how important the victory was. Was it useless slaughter because it was fought after the Treaty of Ghent was signed as some would say, was it important in that it brought America together as Remini contends, or as Charles Patton writes in his book 'Chalmette' (a book I can't really reccommend), was \\"An American victory on January 8th, 1815 was absolutely crucial for..(America's).. survival and future.\\"Regardless of what you believe, the Battle of New Orleans is important, if only for the fact that it is part of our History, and in some way, whether very indirectly or very significantly led to the America we have today. That in itself is reason to learn about it."},{"Title":"The Best Christmas pageant ever","review":"Oh boy another year with the Herdmans!

We read it every year and enjoy it just as much each time. Each year there are a few more children who will sit and listen to the story and we laugh at the antics of those kids. I guess some of our kids wish they had the nerve to do some of the things Imogene and Ralph and the rest of the gang do. I have given numerous copies of this book as gifts at Christmas and our friends love the story also. Our copy sits on the coffee table for our guests to pick up and read at their leisure.It is quick and very enjoyable reading."},{"Title":"The Best Christmas pageant ever","review":"Told in the first person by a pageant participant, this book chronicles the cataclysmic events that take place when the yearly nativity play is hijacked by the worst children that ever existed.It can be read on several levels. Children and adults alike will be unable to stop laughing as disaster builds upon disaster. However, those who are so inclined will also find themselves reflecting on the meaning of the story of the birth of Jesus.Hysterical, honest, and sometimes very touching, the story is aimed at ages 7 - 10, but is very suitable for reading aloud and in that way could be enjoyed by all ages."},{"Title":"The Best Christmas pageant ever","review":"This book was great. It was a little funny. I liked the part when Imogene was smocking in the ladies room becaus when Ms.Homer went in side she thought it was smocke from a fire and called the fire department This is a good book to read.

It might teach you wath christmas was when jesus was born or that every one has a littel good in them."},{"Title":"The Best Christmas pageant ever","review":"Many people brush this book aside as juvenile read, but I can tell you that just by reading this book, it will not only touch the hearts of children, but that of adults as well. I remember first reading this book when I was in Grade 3, and at that time, I cried. Years later, I read the book again, and despite myself being all geared up, I still cried. Now, I cry again. Not only can we find shadows of ourselves in the story, we can also learn to love, to give, to believe. It is such an intricate web of love, humour and sensitivity. If there is any book you want to read this Christmas, make this the one."},{"Title":"The Best Christmas pageant ever","review":"So, you like books with children that do crimes? You do? Listen up. If you don't you can still read this paper and this book. The Best Christmas Pageant Ever is a hysterical book that includes some good kids, some bad kids, and a Christmas Pageant. It was written by Barbara Robinson and illustrated by Judith Gwyn Brown. Since this book was published by Harper Collins in 1972, Robinson and Brown have also created Best Halloween Ever and Best School Year Ever. This eighty paged book has reviewing agencies; ALA Booklist, Horn Book, Kirkus Reviews, New York Times Book Review, NCTE Adventuring With Books, Publisher's Weekly, Wilson's Children's Catalog, and Wilson's Junior High Catalog.In the Best Christmas Pageant Ever you will find Herdman children that are big troublemakers that move into town. Every year the Herdman children's town presents a Christmas Pageant in the town's church. Mother, the mother of one the child in the pageant is in charge of the whole thing. Meanwhile, the Herdman children are interested in the pageant. Imogene, one of the Herdman children, wants the part of Mary. Imogene gets her wish of having the part of Mary. All the Herdman children look up in the public library, nearby their house, what the Christmas Pageant is all about. Mother gives all of the Herdman children a part in the Pageant. The day of the Pageant Mother is stressing out about if the Pageant is going to go the way it's planned. Will Mother see what she wants to see? Read this book to find out!I truly enjoyed reading this book when the Herdman's did something wrong. It just made the story a little more interesting. For one thing, the Herdman's are very bad children. They commit crimes, steal, smoke and lie. When people in a story have some sort of talent or is just a really bad kid it makes the story more interesting to read. Also, I thought it was very thoughtful of the Herdman children when they were interested in the Christmas Pageant. I mean, it's not every day you see really bad kids interested in aChristian play done in a church. Finally, I couldn't help thinking why somebody would do this but; in gym class Imogene always found out everyone's weight and always mad fun of that same person because of it. I thought that was just plain old rude!I was so impressed on how much humor this book had! Again the Herdman children were in on most of the humor. For one thing, when Mother said that she was glad the Herdmen children were at church and everyone knew that she was lying. Also, when Imogene started smoking a cigar in the bathroom, someone saw smoke coming out of the crack on the bottom of the bathroom door, that someone called the fire department! I probably would have done the same thing, but overall that's just funny! Lastly, when Imogene got a baby for the Christmas Pageant, she started talking to tell everyone what the baby's name was. Mother came rushing down the aisle telling her that you're not supposed to talk in a pageant. Mother and Imogene kept arguing on why Imogene shouldn't tell the cast what the baby's name was. Imogene would have named the baby Bill! I thought that was funny because Imogene wanted everything to go her way, and not the way it was supposed to go.When reading The Best Christmas Pageant Ever I experienced some dozing off into sleep, laughing, and some really interested eyes. So, what I really mean is that I experienced some sleeping; the thought the book was boring at some parts. Laughing, I got really bad pains in my side from laughing so much; I thought the book was very funny. Interested eyes was, that at some parts of the book I was so interested I couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen next. I would recommend this book for ages nine and up. Just because the Herdman children do some really bad things. So, I would be recommending for this book to adults and young adults. But, otherwise I would say that this book is an o.k. book."},{"Title":"The Best Christmas pageant ever","review":"This book has been pleasing kids and parents since 1972. It was one of my favorites as a child. It is cleverly written, and often very funny. (I was fascinated with Wanda Pierce's charm bracelet.) Re-reading it as an adult, I still found a lot to enjoy. Moreover, the message is well worth repeating: it is not only the ostentatiously pure who are welcome at the table. The story is for everyone.Recommended."},{"Title":"The Best Christmas pageant ever","review":"As a child my mother would read this story every Christmas. As one of my favorite books growing up, there were some years that we would beg mother to read it two or three times per season. Now, at age 23, it remains a family tradition for the family to gather around the Christmas tree and listen to mother read this book. It is a story that truly lasts through the ages."},{"Title":"The Best Christmas pageant ever","review":"If your Christmas plans include travel, slip Barbara Robinson's beloved The Best Christmas Pageant Ever into the CD player in your car during the journey for family enjoyment. Told from a child's point of view, this hilarious story (first published in 1972) reveals what happens when \\"the worst kids in the history of the world\\" hijack a Sunday School program. The six Herdman children show up unexpectedly at church only because they've heard there's cake. They've never before heard the Christmas story, and their indignant reactions underscore just how shocking it really is.This new audio tape of Robinson's classic story is narrated by Elaine Stritch with a freshness and intimacy that make the tale her own."},{"Title":"The Best Christmas pageant ever","review":"I'm not sure who loves this book more, me or my kids. We read it together every Christmas, and I intend to continue this tradition even when they're not around. We have great fun wtih the dialogue, and we even invoke one-liners from the story all year 'round (the Herdmans were so mean they could have been Herod's relatives: &quot;Herod Herdman&quot;). Park's writing captures the natural flow and give-and-take wit of the best conversational humor. You practically feel like you're part of the dialogue and part of the experience as the Herdman's attempt sort out (or impose logic on) the Christmas story. After all, why in the world wouldn't someone give a pregnant woman a room?! This book helps anyone re-discover the spirit of Christmas right along with the characters in the story."},{"Title":"The Best Christmas pageant ever","review":"I read this book years ago...It is funny but also hasa serious side to it.

I hadn't thought of it in years! It was read to my 6th grade class by our teacher over several afternoons just before Christmas, back when we couldn't play outside due to snow by the \\"foot\\" in Northern Indiana. I was delighted when it arrived and giggled at the tale from beginning to end. More so now than as a kid. It was just that good. A good honest tale of a very believeable Christmas Pageant. If you're a kid, read it! If you're a grown up, read it to a kid, you'll both enjoy the time spent and the story."},{"Title":"The Best Christmas pageant ever","review":"The book was fabulous...but the audio version is hilarious!!!

So they're on they're own. All by themselves. There are a couple of &quot;sware words&quot; in it. But the rest of the book was excellent! I loved the book so much that I cried! I can't wait to read the next book!"},{"Title":"The Best Christmas pageant ever","review":"I was first introduced to this story via the movie when I was in grade school...I loved it the first time I watched it and it became tradition in the school I attended to view it every year. I lost track of the story once I hit high school because it was no longer shown on TV and so it was by pure accident that I found the book in a used book shop. I purchased it on a whim to see if the book held as much magic as the movie did from my childhood and I was more than pleased. There is no other way to describe this book but as a complete joy. Hidden in the guise of a children's book is a well-written, hilarious, and touching story showing the true meaning of Christmas and how even the &quot;worst kids in the history of the world&quot; can understand the spirit of the season if given a chance. This book should be added to the yearly ritual of reading Dickens' 'A Christmas Carol' and Clement C. Moore's 'Night Before Christmas' because children as well as adults will enjoy the story. I'm also happy to say that I was able to find a copy of the movie on here, too, so I can add it to my annual viewing of 'How the Grinch Stole Christmas.'"},{"Title":"The Best Christmas pageant ever","review":"I thought it was an illustrated version of the full story.

In this 80 page book we come to fear and love the Herdmann clan, a gaggle of 6 kids that see the world their own way, and take it on in their own terms. They are just as likely to klonk a kid in the head as ignore them. They are the \\"closest thing to criminals that we knew.\\" What does this have to do with Christmas? Well...Every year a local Church stages a traditional Christmas pageant, but this year the Herdmann's show up in Church on the day that the pageant is announced, and they then show up and end up filling all of the major parts in the play. Everyone keeps their eyes open and their ears to the ground to see what the Herdmann's will do next, and the poor woman that gets saddled with the pageant and the Herdmann's proclaims that \\"This Will be the Best Christmas Pageant Ever!\\"This book is perfect for reading to the kids. I just finished reading it to my 10-yr old daughter (who could have sliced through it in short order herself), and we both enjoyed the experience greatly!Come along for the adventure as the Herdmanns hear the Christmas strory for the first time, and see what it must have looked like through their eyes.Truly, Jesus said, \\"Suffer the little children to come unto me,\\" and that included the Herdmanns.Thanks for a great little book! 5 solid stars!"},{"Title":"The Best Christmas pageant ever","review":"The book came in the condition described.

Most of those little books disappear from memory as quickly as the year's ornaments and greenery. This book is one whose value and impact seems to grow from year to year. It can be enjoyed by kids of most ages, and it holds the interest and challenges the thinking of adults. The book is worth reading again and again--privately and out loud. The audiobook is an excellent presentation. The movie adaptation, though sharing the limits of any visual interpretation of a piece of literature, is quite faithful to the facts and spirit of the story and has a particularly poignant wrap-up.

The author has quite the sense of humor, and will have you laughing along as you read this politically-incorrect book on six dysfunctional siblings who decide to be in the church's Christmas play because they were told they had \\"refreshments\\" there. It is a great gift for everyone on your list this season, and will likely become a household name. It most certainly made me feel better about my dysfunctional family!

The characters and the situation are just so real, and many passages about past pageants do call up memories of my own childhood in the church. The narrator's youthfully practical point of view is natural and unforced, and her observations are subtly insightful. But in the end, it's the Herdmans and their revelations that really make this book a classic, and it's in characterizing them that the author really shines. There's really not much that needs to be said about this book when you get right down to it. It's pure, thoughtful entertainment."},{"Title":"The Best Christmas pageant ever","review":"I've just finished being involved with the play version of The Best Christmas Pageant Ever, which inevitablly led to my reading of the book.

It's absolutely hilarious from the first paragraph describing the Herdmans as the worst family in the history of the world. Story: By default, the heathen Herdman children are cast in the main parts of the church Christmas pageant. The Herdmans, once they learn the story of the birth of the baby Jesus,take it very literally. I was brought to tears at the end when the author shows us how the Herdmans, in their own \\"warped\\" way, were manifesting the true spirit of Christmas all along. This book helped me look at the Christmas story through fresh eyes."},{"Title":"The Best Christmas pageant ever","review":"I like this book so much I give it to my best friends only."},{"Title":"The Best Christmas pageant ever","review":"Many are familiar with this funny, touching story by Barbara Robinson which, for quite a few, has become a classic. But, get ready you haven't really heard it until you listen to this narration by the iconic Elaine Stritch. She turns humor into hilarity and sentimentality into poignancy. It's really a must-have for the holiday season.A refresher (just in case): the story focuses on the Herdman children, hands down the worst kids in town. They thought nothing of using a filched chemistry set as a toy and setting fire to Mr. Shoemaker's tool house.You'd think that going to Sunday School might help them but it doesn't - they're only there because cake is served. When the announcement is made of the annual Christmas pageant this bunch of six hooligans bully their way into getting the lead parts. What a shocker for everyone - the worst to portray the best.However, there are a few surprises to come when the familiar story unfolds.Let Elaine Stritch tell you like it was - you'll enjoy every minute!- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"The Best Christmas pageant ever","review":"Okay, people, what we have here is a GOOOOOOD book.

Every year at Christmas I pull it out again just to get the hilarious parts. The story is about a bunch of kids with the last name &quot;Herdman,&quot; and they were practicly outlaws. But they soon got involved in the Christmas Pageant and took it over. One of the parts I liked was when they got mad that Herod wanted to kill Jesus, so they went to the library to look him up. They read about his life then found out one day he died, and that was it. They got really mad because they wanted to be able to clobber him for what he had hoped to do.

Love it."},{"Title":"The Best Christmas pageant ever","review":"Along with boxes and boxes of Christmas decorations, my wife also placed a stack of Christmas books out to read. Most of them are short and fun. One, I found especially good.The Best Christmas Pageant Ever by Barbara Robinson is only 80 pages, but it tells the story of Christ's birth with humor I've not seen before. It is about six children in a family who live without supervision (father gone and mother working two jobs) and the rest of the children are afraid of them.Due to a series of incidents, the six unruly children get all the major parts in the church's Christmas pageant. It is funny, but it is also sad, because these children had not heard the story of Jesus' birth.The book was published in 1988, so before writing this, I checked Amazon.com to see if it was still available. Not only is it available, there is a 60-minute DVD starring Loretta Swit (of MASH fame) and study guides, too. I guess a few other people found the story of value.If you haven't read it, please do."},{"Title":"The Best Christmas pageant ever","review":"This book is one of the most hysterically funny, heartwarming tales you can read.

I can't reccommend it more highly!"},{"Title":"The Best Christmas pageant ever","review":"My son and I read this book every year at Christmas, and every year I start to cry in the very same spot--which is pretty much the same spot where my high school English teacher started crying when he read it to us and I heard the story for the first time. The idea of grace--that the \\"glad tidings of great joy that shall be to all people\\" included the likes of the awfuller-than-awful Herdmans--is humorously and poignantly conveyed by the narrator, a classmate of one of the older Herdmans. If you have never read this book, you are missing out on a real treat. You will never look at the Christmas story again in the same way. \\"Hey! Unto you a child is born!\\""},{"Title":"The Best Christmas pageant ever","review":"I loved this book so much I bought it for my nephew also. This is a wonderful book to read during the holidays, because it puts the entire season in perspective. It shows children at their best and worst and also being reflective.

She wants to hang herod and tells the magi to bring ham not perfume. Most all of, this book helps readers see the story of Christmas in a new light- through the eyes of kids who know what child welfare is and that Jesus shouldn't have been born in a stable- and that Mary was just a scared kid trying to protect her child in a foreign land. A great lesson, a funny book and a wonderful new tradition."},{"Title":"The Best Christmas pageant ever","review":"I never read this book as a child. My 3rd grade daughter brought this book home from the school library and asked me to read it with her. Doing my parental duty, I happily sat down to read it to her. Was I in for a surprise!

Their antics are absolutely hysterical! This is a great book to share with your kids."},{"Title":"The Best Christmas pageant ever","review":"This was a wonderful book.

The story is about a community of churchgoers whose children perform the same Christmas pageant with the same kids in the same roles year after year; the story of Jesus' birth. During the holiday season of the year the tale takes place, the story's narrator's mother agrees, under duress, to direct the play and ends up having to cast the rowdy ragamuffin Herdman children in all the major roles. And because the story of the birth of Jesus is news to them, the normally simple, straightforward practice sessions transform into chaos as the director tries to enlighten the question-asking Herdman kids about the story. In spite of pretty much everyone in the community's concerns about the normally nonchurchgoing children's participation in the play, their constant questions improve everyone's understanding of the story, their unconventional actions provide plenty of comic relief, and the fact that they step things up behavior-wise during the performance come together such that, they put on The Best Christmas Pageant Ever. For Christians, this is a cute, though predictable, story. Skip the dated, cheesy movie (in which they include the book's girl-smoking-a-cigar scene) in favor of audio book performed by C.J. Critt. Better: The Grinch Who Stole Christmas by Dr. Seuss, A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens and The Polar Express by Chris Van Allsburg."},{"Title":"The Best Christmas pageant ever","review":"I thout the book was relly good!Someday I'll read the book agen.I like the end the most of all becuse the Hurdmens that thatplayed as the three wise men brout ham insted of expenceive perfumes.

It's a heart warming message told about an unlikely group of awful kids who are able to see the real meaning of Christmas and make others see too."},{"Title":"The Best Christmas pageant ever","review":"The Herdmans are a group of some of the worst kids in the entire history of the universe. The six of them steal, lie, talk dirty, curse at their teachers, hit kids who are smaller than them, blackmail people, and smoke cigars (which lead to Fred Shoemaker's broken-down toolhouse to burn to the ground). So when the six of them show up to church and Sunday school one week, and decide to take over the annual Christmas pageant, everyone is expecting the worst. None of the Herdmans have ever even heard the story of Christmas before, but when they do, they interpret all of the characters in their own way - Herod needs a beating, and the Wise Men are a bunch of dirty spies - which make most of the churchgoers very unhappy. But who knew that the Herdmans, and the entire Christmas pageant altogether, could be so full of surprises?Children and adults of all ages will find themselves laughing out loud as they read about all of the crazy antics that the Herdmans are involved in. As a fan of holiday books, I was immensely happy with the dialogue of THE BEST CHRISTMAS PAGEANT EVER. As opposed to being a sad, tragic holiday story, it turned out to be a fantastic, and hilarious one, that offered many laughs, and a great plot. Fans of A CHRISTMAS STORY will relish in this novels likeness, as the kids are all crazy, and entertaining. This is sure to become a holiday classic.

Each day as I read it to the class, I would laugh hysterically, but on the last day, no matter how hard I tried, I could not read it without choking up. I'm sure the kids thought I was nuts!"},{"Title":"The Best Christmas pageant ever","review":"A classic Christmas tale is THE BEST CHRISTMAS PAGEANT EVER, first published in 1972 by Barbara Robinson. Not only was it made into a TV movie, but it is produced annually as a play in theaters, schools and churches all over the world.Now, Robinson is introducing us to the latest picture book version of THE BEST CHRISTMAS PAGEANT EVER, illustrated by Laura Cornell.We're introduced to the Herdmans, who just happen to be the worst kids in the history of the world. They lie, steal and play with matches and everyone stays away from them. However, one day they show up in Sunday school. Not only do they steal all the money out of the collection plate, but they draw mustaches on everybody in the Bible and take over the annual Christmas pageant (acting out the story of Mary, Joseph, and Baby Jesus). Everybody knows the story, except the Herdmans. In fact, everyone's convinced this is going to be the worst pageant ever, but when the pageant takes place and every wrong thing the Herdmans do seems right and natural, it might possibly be the best Christmas pageant ever.The thought of six very unruly children teaching a whole church about the true meaning of the birth of Christ is what makes this a wonderful Christmas picture book to share with children and teach them the true meaning of Christmas. Cornell has updated the story with lively and vibrant illustrations, but the powerful message remains the same. A wonderful addition to your Christmas collection."},{"Title":"The Best Christmas pageant ever","review":"Think of Garrison Keillor. Lots of people think of him as a sort of homespun, gentle Will Rogers style humorist with his fond memories of endearing rural characters. Between the lines he strikes me as an angry man with bitter memories of small, narrow minded people. His low key well disguised contempt for them is just brutal.Well, welcome to Best Christmas Pageant. Most of these characters are written in acid. And I don't mean the Herdmans. They are not \\"unruly ragamuffins\\", they are psychopaths. So broadly written that they become meaningless as characters. But that's OK, because the book isn't about them. The book is about the parson, the church ladies, and the church members. They are rendered as mean and small and uncharitable. But, the tale is presented, a la Keillor, with such a light touch and such a casual air, that the parody just sort of slips by until it finally begins to seep into your awareness.I don't know if the author intended to pull this off, or if the effect is totally unintended, but the result is just a fascinating bit of reporting, with a touch of honest sentiment at the end to make it all palatable."},{"Title":"The Best Christmas pageant ever","review":"I think I'll start with the fact that this book was one of my childhood favorites, so my review may very well come across as biased due to nostalgia reasons. However, I also have fond memories of being able to relate to the characters and sympathizing with the plight of the Herdman children. The truth of the matter is, there is much in their young lives which are not fair.Moving on, I'll go into the fact that the Herdman children aren't good role models for children, they smoke and curse and are simply the bad children that you don't want your children hanging out with simply because they will be a bad influence over your children. The behavior of the Herdman children can be seen as a chance to teach children right from wrong.The Herdman children are not the main character, it is in fact a young girl named Becky who happens to see the children ostracized because of their home life and the way they act. She sees practically every single adult in her community not really step in to be role models for the Herdman children except for her own mother.For young children, there are two groups that can relate to this book. First, it is the young child that sympathizes like Becky and chooses to treat the Herdman like people despite the fact they have bad behavior. This can help these children not feel guilty for not lashing out and talking behind the backs of children like the Herdman, simply because they can, like a good deal of people do in the series.Second, it is the children whose behavior tends not to be the best who can relate to being ostracized as the Herdman children are. The message is, yeah, they aren't the best of kids, but they are still people and have their own good side. Plus, if kids as bad as the Herdman can have a good side to them, what about the kids whose mistakes are more minor.The other thing about this book is when it was written. If you read the books, it may scream to some people that this wouldn't happen in today's society, the way the Herdman children are treated. Their special needs would be met in school and role models would be stepping up. This book was written in the 70's though, before a lot of the legislation to help children who are like the Herman came into place.This makes the book a good discussion piece even in the upper grade levels, to discuss social trends, social rights and other issues, not to mention it is an easy read that even the slower reader can get into. Not to mention, there is the fact that it can possibly bring back some memories of the older students of their younger days.The Best Christmas Pageant Ever, it is a good tool for educational purposes, on top of being a good, enjoyable read.Also read the sequelsThe Best School Year EverandThe Best Halloween Ever."},{"Title":"The Best Christmas pageant ever","review":"This is an easy read for third graders - and it is outrageously funny.

Although I didn't really understand the part about the Herdmans living in a garage - who in the world would have a mother, even one that's almost never home, allow her six children to live in a garage? I found that, for a short, enjoyable read around Christmastime, or someone who's planning a Christmas pageant and needs some new, creative ideas, this book will do. Also, I read \\"The Best School Year Ever\\" before I read this book, and I highly recommend that. I have not read \\"The Best Halloween Ever\\", but it does sound good.The Herdmans are what everyone calls the worst kids on the face of the earth. They smoke cigars, swear, hit little kids, and don't even know what the Christmas story is. That is, until the nameless narrator's younger brother, Charlie, tells one of the Herdmans that they get cake, cookies, candy, donuts, ice cream and more refreshments at Sunday School. Heading to the church, where the main character's mother is hosting the Christmas pageant (the person who usually hosts it is in the hospital) they each try out for a part, where all six of them amazingly are the only ones who try out for the six main roles that they try out for. With Imogene as Mary, Ralph as Joseph, Leroy, Ollie, and Claude as the three Wise Men, and Gladys, the worst of them all as the Angel of the Lord, it's bound to be the worst pageant ever.With everyone showing up just to see what those Herdmans will do, chaos ensures as Imogene, smoking in the ladies' restroom, causes one of the ladies working on a potluck dinner to think that a fire has been set. When Alice Wendleken, the narrator's friend, turns out to be in the angel choir with the narrator, instead of regular role as Mary, the story's teller isn't surprised to find that the Herdmans promised to do terrible things to her if she was Mary. Of course, as the Herdmans learn the Christmas story, they make it sound like it's out of the F.B.I files, calling the Wise Men spies and wanting to burn King Herod. This story really gets you thinking about unexplained things - for example, did baby Jesus have colic?A good read, but also a short one.Sammy Doeve"},{"Title":"The Best Christmas pageant ever","review":"The main charters is a family of kids that go to the same school but not in the same grads.But this family is not an avarege family they are crule and selfish and their names are the Herdmans. They are the meanest kids in the town.THe Herdmans do all sorts of horible things.For example the spit anywhere, punch,kick, trip, trick, steal,cheat,push,shuve,and they dont obay, they even call all the teachers and kids bad mean names,they even cuss in and out side of school.When this famialy of kids are out side of school they smoke,start fires,and everthing els they do in school. One of the Herdmans always picks on this one kid and then the HErdman kid found out that every sunday and every other wednesday that most of the kids that went to there school got snacks and he wondered where they got them because the Herdmans love to eat so the kid told hi they got them from bible school the kid even told him that theres gona be a christmas pageant and theres gona be lots of free food and drinks.So then the Herdman told all of his brothers and sister all about the free food and drinks and about the christmas pageant.All the Herdmans decided to go and if they went they get to be the main parts of the pageant so they told all of the girls and boys at school not to volenteer for the main parts otherwise they'll do smothing realy bad to that person that volenteerd,so when they got to church sunday morning every one got frightened about there aparents even the teachers.The parent that usaly holds that pageant got heart so she asked her kind naborr to run the pageant.So the person that got asked said yes that she'll take care of the pageant and so she did.When she asked the kids to raise their hands if they wanted to be the main part but no one did but the Herdmans so she had to give all the Herdmans all the main parts.Then she asked after class was over when the all the Herdmans she asked the kids that usaly play the main pars why didnt you volenteer to be the main parts they told her that the Herdmans thretend them if the raised there hand they would do somthing terable to them.The Hermans aculay worked very hard on their parts,And the day of the pageant every one was so amazed of how well the Herdmans did ensted of pounding all of the other kids.So that is why this is the best christmas pageant ever.This story does not have a sertant time or place besides a town.The theam of this story is showing that evean no a person is a bad person they do have some goodness at heart and do sothing good and right.I do like this story i acualy love this story my mom use to read it to me when I was little,And when I was able to read I read this story in December when its getting closer to Christmas.And i enjoy reading this novel because I always forget what those HErdmans do rong and every time I read this book it makes me laugh.Thats why I want to give this story five stars.Shannon Lepicier"},{"Title":"The Best Christmas pageant ever","review":"No doubt about it, this little gem belongs on every Christmas Bookshelf!

I think that the meaning of Christmas is on display in this short work. In the modern age in which we live, it is nice to see that the real purpose of Christ's coming to Earth can be seen in such a simple way. The children in this book are people you know.

Read it, and let it touch your funny bone and your heart."},{"Title":"The Best Christmas pageant ever","review":"The book by Barbara Robinson is a necessary book for all ages. This is so because it is a story about how people shouldn't judge an outcome before it happens. The Best Chrismas Pagent Ever is about six LOUD and mean kids called the Herdmans who took over the whole play. They even did things that were unexpected for example instead of bringing perfumes and oils for the baby Jesus in the play they brought ham instead. The whole town learned how to not judge these outcasts and ended up having the best christmas pagent ever.

The story of the \\"worst kids in the history of the world,\\" who've managed to burn down a toolshed, because \\"it was a Saturday, and not much going on,\\" and how they hijack the church Christmas pageant, is touching, true and laugh out loud funny. When seen through the eyes of kids who've never even heard the Christmas story, the pageant becomes something deeper and more true than any of the more conventional parishoners expect, and the lessons learned in this unorthodox manner are priceless. Not just meaningful, but fun, as when the Wise Men, sensibly reasoning that the Holy Family has little use for Frankincense and Myrrh, bring a useful gift (a ham!)or when the Angel of The Lord yells to all in attendance, \\"HEY! UNTO YOU A CHILD IS BORN! For kids and adults, to read and re-read."},{"Title":"The Best Christmas pageant ever","review":"The Best Christmas Pageant Ever by Barbara Robinson is a wonderfully entertaining novel about some delinquent kids, known as the Herdmens, who take over the Christmas Pageant. Its characters are very well developed that it seems as if you know them personally. I thought this book was hilarious because it reminded me of many of my students. My favorite part is when one of the Herdmans takes their wild cat to show-and-tell and it goes crazy destroying the classroom and scaring the students. It's a must read!!!"},{"Title":"The Best Christmas pageant ever","review":"I saw this book acted out at Christmas in a one woman show and thought \\"I have to own this book for my children!\\" I bought it , loved it and plan on using it as part of our Christmas tradition of reading Christian oriented books to try and maintain the true meaning of the holiday for my young children. This book runs the gamut from sympathy for the ones antagonized by these wild children, to hysterical laughter over their antics, to sympathy FOR those wild kids, to a desire to shield them from the coldness of the world. I wanted to take them home with me and shower them with love and compassion. I bought the book for my 10 year old nephew after, to add to his Christmas reading traditions."},{"Title":"The Best Christmas pageant ever","review":"Here's a simple, enchanting tale. It's warm and funny and thoroughly unpredictable. It's published in a short and skinny book in large type and, assuming you can tear yourself away from the story, it can be read in small spurts.The Herdmans are absolutely and without question the worst kids \\"in the entire history of the world.\\" They are guilty of evey unmentionable childhood crime and have thought of more than a few original ones. When they take over the church Christmas pageant (although none of them has ever attended church, much less heard the Christmas story before), the first Christmas becomes new and real in some pretty surprising ways.Nevermind that the publishers call this a children's story. It isn't. The vision it has to offer is hilarious yet deeply touching in a profound yet innocent way.Stock up on copies for Christmas gifts to teachers and friends. I'd give one to the friend who wails that Christmas has become too commercial or to the harried mother of a lively brood or to someone who dreads the holiday. And keep one for yourself because it's almost as much fun each time you read it.Merry Christmas!"},{"Title":"The Best Christmas pageant ever","review":"is the opportunity to revisit your childhood.First, Dr. Suess, then The Saggy Baggy Elephant, and now the Herdmans.I have loved reading since I was five years old. One of my most important goals is to pass that love of books on to my two daughters. I'm no expert, but sharing books that make me happy with them seems to be a good way to start.The Best Christmas Pageant Ever is a story about THOSE kids. You know--the ones you avoid sitting next to at Pizza Hut. The ones who show up at church once or twice a quarter, when someone brings them. The ones you feel sorry for but secretly compare to your own kids to make yourself feel good about how well-mannered, smart, attractive your kids are.THOSE kids, the Herdmans, show us that Christmas isn't just about our own families and our safe, secure homes, but about THOSE kids--the unwanted, nasty, obnoxious, dirty kids with whom we don't want our kids associating.The point of the story is that we should open our eyes and see them as Jesus saw the little children and open our heart to love even the barely lovable.This story is one that will grow with your children. As they mature, you can help them get more and more out of this story. It's definitely a repeat from one holiday season to the next. I would recommend getting the hardback version so that it will last longer."},{"Title":"The Best Christmas pageant ever","review":"My Dad and his wife sent my family this book for Christmas one year, and I read it at bedtime to my 7 year old son and 9 year old daughter. Although we were only going to read a chapter every night, they begged me to keep reading, and I didn't want to stop, either. The Herdman children give us a fresh perspective on the traditional Christmas story, and show us that anyone can be touched by the true meaning of Christmas. A story that young and old can relate to, it made us all laugh and some of us cry. I plan to read this book every year,out loud. A wonderful, touching story. Only one word of warning - there are a handful of &quot;naughty&quot; words in this story, since the Herdman children are a bit rude. You can substitute something more suitable as you read to children, but don't pass by this great story because of it."},{"Title":"The Best Christmas pageant ever","review":"I didn't read this book until I was 32 years old and it made my day! I laughed so hard that I thought that I was going to hurt something. I loved the Herdmans because I grew up with a lot of kids like them. I now know why this is a classic that will continue on long after I'm gone. Ms. Robinson did a fantastic job of incorperating humor in many, many poignant moments. I laughed reading every page until the last two or three when the tears came. You couldn't help but be deeply touched by how, for a few brief moment, the Herdmans cleaned up their act to tell the wonderful story of Christmas in their own special way. I had the opportunity to spend a day with Ms. Robinson last year and let me tell you all, it was the experience of a lifetime.

I first read it when my oldest was six and I've re-read it every Christmas since, and not only have I never gotten tired of it, but I can't imagine Christmas without it.The story is about a church Christmas pageant in which the Herdmans, the wildest, toughest kids in town, move in and take over the main parts. Mary smokes cigars. The Wise Men steal. And the Angel of the Lord is more likely to smack the shepherds in the teeth than bring good news. Everyone in the church is scandalized, of course, but trying to fit the totally unsuitable Herdmans into their Biblical roles makes for one hilarious story after another. When you can get an adult and a six year old laughing out lout at the same things, you know you've got a special children's book.If all this book had was its humor, it would be a treat, but it is a lot more than that. Under all the great jokes is another more moving story. The Herdman kids are hearing the story of Jesus' birth for the first time, and their reactions &Ntilde; shock that anyone would put a baby in a feeding trough, fury at Herod's attempt to kill the baby, amazement at the angel's miraculous appearance to the shepherds &Ntilde; renew the meaning of the story for those of us who have heard it hundreds of times. Little by little they become more and more effected by the story and it changes them.In the end, this is not just a funny book, but a powerful story of redemption. Through most of the book, I can't stop laughing, but by the end I am always reading through tears, even after having read it eleven times."},{"Title":"The Best Christmas pageant ever","review":"We think the Best Christmas Pageant Ever was outrageous and crazy.

The cat has one eye and a broken tail and one short leg. Once Claude Herdman emptied the whole first grade in three minutes flat when Claude took the Herdmans cat to Show and Tell. He did not feed the cat for two days, and the cat was already mad. Then Claude carried the cat in school in a box. The Herdmans invaded a helpless church to steal food.

My 10 year old son and I read it together and we loved it."},{"Title":"The Best Christmas pageant ever","review":"This is a beautiful, while entertaining, story about a family of six unruly children, who are all starring in the church Christmas Pageant.Narrorated by a stunned parish-member, C.J, this story is a classic for young and old.The six children are the Herdmans- Ralph, Imogene, Ollie, Claude, Gladys, and Leroy - are the absolute worst kids in the whole entire world. They curse, cheat, lie, steal, and set things on fire! No ever expects that they will star in the parish Christmas pageant - let alone join Sunday school.Everyone in town is absolutely terrified, when Ralph is gived the role of Joseph, Imogene as Mary, the younger boys as Wise men and Herod, and Gladys as the Angel of the Lord. The townspeople are shocked, yet intrigued, especially when the Herdmans begin to alter the play - changing the Wise men's gifts, deciding they should beat up Herod - but in the process, discover what Jesus really stands for.And when the night of the play comes, everyone is stunned even more than they ever immagined.The sweetest book I have ever read. One of my absolute favorites. Every child, adult, and in between should read this story."},{"Title":"The Best Christmas pageant ever","review":"\\"The Herdmans were absolutely the worst kids in the history of the world...\\" So begins one of the funniest...and ultimately the most touching...books ever written about the Christmas season.

They did blow up a shed that was not there's and they did cigers the girls did cigers to.And they went to church and they drew in Bibles and when they were doing the offering the Herdsmans stole the offering.And the very sadest part of this book was that Imogene was Mary in the play. When the angle started singing, Imogene started to cry and when Imogene burped the baby doll, the girl, who was Mary all of the years theyhad done it, said,\\" what is she doing?\\" .

Not explained well in the desription. The kids saw it so I kept it and ordered the BOOK version this time."},{"Title":"The Best Christmas pageant ever","review":"\\"Just suppose you had never heard the Christmas story, and didn't know anything about it, and then somebody told it to you. What would you think?\\"Before I talk about the book, let me just clarify something. I know that Jesus was not actually born on December 25, and possibly not even in the month of December. However, the birth of Jesus Christ is not only an historical fact, but arguably the most important event to ever occur in history (besides His crucifixion and resurrection). If people consider the births of other men, such as Martin Luther King, Jr. and Abraham Lincoln, worthy of recognition (not to mention our own individual birthdays), then it is reasonable to choose a date to commemorate the birth of Christ. And yes, I am also aware that some of the traditions associated with Christmas, like the Christmas tree, have their origins in pagan practices. I see nothing wrong with borrowing practices from other traditions and assigning new meaning to them. So when I refer to the Christmas story, as this book does, I am talking about the birth of Christ as recorded in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke.The Best Christmas Pageant Ever is a hilarious but touching little story about a family of \\"hoodlums\\" that hijacks a Sunday School Christmas program. Now I don't mean just naughty, disobedient children who don't listen. I'm talking about six loud, dirty, cigar-smoking, foul-talking, fire-setting vandals - or to put it in the words of the young narrator - the \\"absolutely worst kids in the history of the world.\\" All the other kids (and their parents) in the neighborhood do whatever they can to avoid the Herdmans, so when they show up one Sunday at church looking for free food, no one quite knows what to do. And when they start volunteering to take the major roles in the annual Christmas pageant, everyone is sure the result will be nothing less than a disaster.If you're at all like me and you grew up going to church every Sunday, by the time you were ten years old you knew the story of the birth of Jesus without even thinking about it. Maybe you learned to recite the Luke 2 passage that starts out with, \\"And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed...\\" You knew that Mary was \\"great with child,\\" that when she and Joseph arrived in Bethlehem there was \\"no room in the inn,\\" and that the angels told the shepherds they would find the baby \\"wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.\\" We read the story with our own children regularly at Christmas time and, yes, we had them learn that same passage of scripture.What I liked about this book is that it makes someone like me realize how much I fail to consider the wonder of the story of Christ's birth and the amazing events surrounding it. I also take it for granted that it is familiar to just about everybody - surely they know who Jesus is and why His birth was so important. Of course, this children's book doesn't discuss the significance of Christ's incarnation at a theological level. But sometimes we can get so caught up in theology and doctrine that we forget to give attention to the simple truths that are so basic and just as meaningful to our faith.The Best Christmas Pageant Ever allows us to take a look at the Christmas story with new, fresh eyes. To stop and consider some questions that we may never have asked before. The Herdmans don't hesitate for one second to ask questions that the other, churched kids, never thought to ask. Who were the Wise Men exactly? What is myrrh, and why in the world was it given to a baby? How could they make Mary sleep in a barn when she was about to have a baby? And whatever happened to that evil King Herod?At first you may think, these Herdman kids are really disrespectful and irreverent to ask and say some of the things they do. But think about it - they've never been to church or read the Bible (\\"They don't even know what a Bible is...they never read anything except \\"Amazing Comics.\\") But as the program director tells them the story, the narrator notices something amazing:\\"I couldn't believe it. Among other things, the Herdmans were famous for never sitting still and never paying attention to anyone -- teachers, parents, the truant officer, the police -- yet here they were, eyes glued on my mother and taking in every word.\\"Needless to say, the Herdmans definitely bring something unique to the pageant, and somehow it doesn't turn out as awful as everyone feared.Here's my recommendation: Read this book together as a family. But before reading it, read the second chapter of Luke with your kids, and probably the second chapter of Matthew as well. Even if you think they are pretty familiar with the Christmas story, ask them if they have any questions they would like answered about it. Then read The Best Christmas Pageant Ever and talk about the things that the Herdmans bring up. Finally, take a moment to reflect on the wonder of God becoming a man. And not just a man, but a helpless infant, born to a poor couple, in a dirty stable, in an obscure town, and welcomed into the world by lowly shepherds."},{"Title":"The Best Christmas pageant ever","review":"This a great read! I hope you enjoy it as much as my kids and I do. Family tradition material for sure!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Best Christmas pageant ever","review":"This should be required reading of all 5th-8th graders! Even for the older kids, too! This book is about the local church that puts on a yearly Christmas pageant about the birth of Jesus. Each year it is done the same way. With pretty much the same characters.But this year is different. There are some hoodlum kids in town who want to be in the pageant. Will the church let them? Will they be discriminated against? And if the church allows these kids to participate, will the awful kids ruin the pageant by not doing right? Everyone is nervous and uptight about them being in the pageant.Will these kids turn from their bad ways?This book is really good. I am glad I read it. It is a leftover book from my oldest daughter's middle school years. (She graduated college 3 1/2 years ago, so that tells you how long this book has been sitting there.) She has always been a big reader. There are some books I still have from that era that I have not read yet. I just got done reading this book.But don't wait as long as I did.

I purchased the CD so my husband and I could refresh our memories on this timeless classic before we went to visit our grandchildren for Christmas. Also our 5 year old granddaughter is just learning to read and she likes listening to the CD and following along in the book. A few days before Christmas and after several members of our family had either read or listened to the book this Christmas we had a great family book club discussion about the book and how true the story is today. My oldest granddaughter even commented about knowing children in her class who were just like the children in the book and had never heard of Jesus. We talked about how things had not changed much since I was a child in the l950's. This CD would make a great gift to any family. It definitly creates a discussion among the children. They associate with the family in the book and children they know. As an adult you can associate with people you know who are like the family in the book. My husband and I have seen this book performed at a local theater as a play and it was wonderful. At the first it was hilarious; then it got quite serious and as we walked out of the theater I noticed most people had tears in their eyes.

Then I just had to pass it on to others. I read children's books because I babysit a lot. I noticed that this one is often a favorite because the kids weren't too good, and the language was 'naughty'. Kids like to be able to read about something other than perfect lives and happy people. This book presents a bunch of kids that are nowhere near perfect, but seem to love each other and accept one another in their own ways. It's a far cry from A Christmas Carol and some other classic Christmas stories, but it is more realistic in the sense that the kids aren't perfect. No one is. This book is really cute and it will always be a hit because some things are just really unexpected.

I've always thought of it as kind of an obscure book, so I was shocked when I stumbled across it on a list of favorite children's books. The kudos are well-deserved, though: as others have said, this is a wonderful, unique mystery story. As you read the book, various clues are provided to help you solve the mystery of Leon's (I mean Noel!) disappearance; two twins, a boy and a girl, work to solve the mystery along with you. I re-read the book many times, and it was just as enjoyable even after I knew the answer to the mystery (which I had NOT been able to figure out on my own!). A great, timeless read for girls and boys alike."},{"Title":"The Mysterious Disappearance of Leon (I Mean Noel)","review":"I have read all of Ellen Raskin's novels and this is probably the silliest one!

It wasn't really short, but I read it all in one day, it is very grabbing. I loved everything from crazy charachters like Mrs. Carillon and Leon (I mean Noel) to funny interpretations of the glub-blubs. I read it again the next day, and it was even funnier reading them because I knew what the answer was. I loved following the travels or Mrs. Carillon of Mrs. Carillon's Pomato Soup fame and her adopted twins Tony and Tina. I loved Tina's ambition to be a doctor, and I also liked finding out what happened to the charachters in the end without having to read the events until then. This book didn't quite replace The Westing Game as my favorite book, but if you liked The Westing Game, you should definitly read this book. Ellen Raskin doesn't get a whole lot of attention for anything but The Westing Game, but her other books are just as good, if not better. Hold your horses and read this book!"},{"Title":"The Mysterious Disappearance of Leon (I Mean Noel)","review":"In the beginning of The Mysterious Disappearance of Leon (I mean Noel) there is a girl named Caroline Fish who lives with her family. She loves the color purple and she loves flowers. The Fish family grows wonderful tomatoes. Next door lives a boy named Leon Carillon whose family grew delicious potatoes. One night Mrs. Fish and Mrs. Carillon decide to make a soup with their potatoes and tomatoes and it was the best soup anyone had ever tasted. At age 5 Caroline marries Leon (Noel).In the middle of the story Leon (Noel) goes away to school. One day Caroline receives a letter from Leon, as she does every month, saying \\"Noel glub C blub all... I glub new...\\" (p.27). What sense does this make? By now you know there is a mystery to solve, but, can you solve it? You will find out at the end if you really know what happened to Leon... or is it Noel?One of the main characters in this book is Leon (Noel). He is a very smart man who knows what he is doing. He loves horses and Caroline very much. Another character in the novel is Caroline. She is a very nice lady looking for her husband. She wears a lot of purple flowers and does not wear underwear. She was married at age 5 has not seen her husband for very long time. After she goes to New York she becomes the mother of two orphan twins. One of the twin's names is Tina. Tina is a very smart girl and is very good at solving mysteries. She helps Caroline solve the mystery by doing little things. The other twin is Tony. He is also very smart and good at figuring out mysteries. The money maker in the mystery's name is Mr. Banks. He is a very intelligent person and jumps to conclusions when he is confused. The best person at solving mysteries is Augie Kunkel. He is a friend of Caroline's from their childhood. He helps the twins try to find out where Leon (Noel) is. Augie has a head injury and now he has to wear a football helmet so he does not hurt it again. These are the main characters in the mystery.The story takes place in anywhere that starts with New like New York and New Jersey. They moved a lot looking for Leon (Noel). The genre of this story is definitely a mystery. You would like this book if you like mysteries and if you can follow fast moving books.I would compare this book to The Westing Game. Both of these books are mysteries, have many characters, are looking for someone, and are fast moving. The Westing Game and this book are very good books and are by the same author, Ellen Rasken. How this story is different from other mysteries is that it makes you think you know the answer when you really don't. Some comparisons to the Westing game are the Westing game has more characters and more action but they are pretty much the same. Ellen Rasken is an excellent writer. I love the way she writes, and she is one of my favorite authors. I really liked this book as I enjoy the challenge of trying to find out who, what, and why! I spent many late nights reading until I fell asleep, only to wake the next morning to reading some more. This book will not let you put it down! So if you want to know what happened to Leon or Noel, you'll have to read this book."},{"Title":"The Mysterious Disappearance of Leon (I Mean Noel)","review":"This is a timeless wonder, the characters are humaine, the plot querky, and humorous.

Now I have a new wonderful, thrilling book to add to my list.The Mysterious Disappearance of Leon (I mean Noel), is the story of Mrs. Dumpling Carillon and her search for her missing husband, Leon Carillon (or should I say Noel Carillon). The main characters were; Mrs. Carillon, Tina & Tony, Augie Kunkel, Mr. Banks and others.Mrs. Carillon is part owner , along with Leon, of the Carillon soup business, When Mrs. Carillon doesn't receive anymore letters from Leon (Noel), she becomes suspicious and sets out for New York City. There she meets two orphan twins by the names of Tina and Tony, and decides to adopt them. Tina and Tony help Mrs. Carillon decipher the last letter that she received before Noel had disappeared. The strange message stated \\"Noel glub C blub all...I glub new.\\" Mrs. Carillon ran into many other predicaments, but their main problem is deciphering the message and locating Noel.I can relate to Dumpling because of her love of horses. In addition, I like the color yellow, and Mrs. Carillon does too. There are no other connections between the characters and myself, with the exception, that, I too, have felt the same way as Tony. At one point in the book, he finds out something very important. Tony couldn't wait for Augie Kunkel, who was a friend of Mrs. Carillon when she was a kid, to come back home so he could tell him. I once had to tell my dad something important and I couldn't wait until he came home from his meeting.The Mysterious Disappearance of Leon (I mean Noel) is very exciting. I was caught up in the plot and could not put the book down. The story was so great because I was able to solve the mystery while reading the book. My favorite part would have to be when Tina tells Rosemary Neuberger to wash her face daily and not to eat as much junk food as usual, so she could get rid of her pimples. That is my favorite pat because it is very funny to read. Also because Tina hates Rosemary and finally she gets to diss Rosemary. If I could change one part in the book, I would choose the section where Seymour Hall, the horse jockey, dies. I was sad when he passed away.I would highly recommend this thrilling and funny book to anyone who enjoys being kept on the edge of their seat. I wanted to keep reading the story all night. This book would be enjoyable for someone who likes mysteries, horses, puzzles or just a great read."},{"Title":"The Mysterious Disappearance of Leon (I Mean Noel)","review":"The name of my book is The Mysterious Dissapperance of Leon (I mean Noel) It is written by Ellen Raskin.

They were separated until they were 21. It seems Leon (he has changed his name to Noel) disappeared at sea. All Miss Carillon knows are his last words. The sentence is interrupted by \\"glub-blubs.\\" To find out where he is, she must solve the glub-blubs. It does not take place in one spot, because she travels to find Noel.This book is full of word puzzles. It is a book about names. They solve clues based on names and words. They weave through words and names to find their meanings. They use the meanings to solve the mystery. I can't tell you the end because it will give it all away.I'd recommend it for many reasons, including the word puzzles, codes, mysteries, and silly names. The characters are funny. It is a cliffhanger book. I couldn't wait for the book to end (in a good way). If you like crosswords, you will love this book."},{"Title":"The Mysterious Disappearance of Leon (I Mean Noel)","review":"The Mysterious Disappearance of Leon (I Mean Noel) is an amazing book that can be equally enjoyed by adults and children alike. Adults reading the book see more layers to it than the kids, but the read is just as mysterious and enjoyable (although the idea of marriage at that young an age will be a squicky one). If you have read Ellen Raskin's Westing Game, and even if you haven't, this is a book you really need to get your hands on. I've read some of her other books, but absolutely nothing compares to these two classics. This one comes fully equipped with hysterical characters and plenty of footnotes. It's adorably quirky without trying too hard. Every thing, every hilarious incident, is narrated casually and in a way that just makes it all funnier. Everything is so tantalizingly cryptic, and at times, downright confusing, but it's a huge relief when everything really falls into place and you realize that every event that was narrated is somehow connected to the big picture scheme. Other than all that, it's a very readable book. The chapters are divided up into small sections and just style-wise, it's an easy but really worthwhile read. It really emphasizes the reason why we love Ellen Raskin so much--plot twists and surprises everywhere! The other really nice thing is that the mystery is not at all obvious. Nobody would ever suspect the outcome, but it's such a compelling one! It's got snark, puzzles, humor, definitely not just a kids' book. It is also really nice, at the end, to get closure from all of the characters, so I do appreciate it when authors like Raskin do things like that.Rating: 5/5"},{"Title":"The Mysterious Disappearance of Leon (I Mean Noel)","review":"This was one of my favorite books as a kid.

Happily,I couldn't put El Cholo down; now, subsequently, I've finished Barton's exciting quartet of novels back-to-back, and they each get better. Extreme Prejudice(now aka, Black and White On The Rocks), his third, is my favorite. (He just won the Faulkner Award for House Divided, his fourth.) I find myself returning to E.P. - not only for a daily dose of Barton's succintly efficient prose, but also for his progressive southern maleness, including his outstanding movie reviews, each critical to the paradox capturing his protagonist. Reviews included critque Mississippi Burning and Do The Right Thing, both superior to what you might have gotten from Denby,The NYT, or others. Thus, you may accept this review as my five-star rebuttal of the previous reviewer, who missed the point of this southerner's agony with current southern events, as his personal and social life crash dramatically. Once I, too, married and lost a fine New Orleans woman,and my experience tells me that the professor knows something about southern sex, as well. I say, buy Barton's books and buy them new at full price, as we need to keep him writing. Read Frederick Barton and you will be hooked; you'll get your money's worth, and,even better, you'll never return to Grisham."},{"Title":"With Extreme Prejudice","review":"[....] it's worth a few $ to own a little piece of this action. A year after his lawyer wife was killed in a car accident, a burglary in his house makes New Orleans film reviewer Mike Barnett wonder whether her death was really accidental. Eventually, (all too slowly - hence the deduction of one star) he gets to understand that her death was no accident and that it was all linked to a real estate deal which his wife fought against. Much of the 'action' takes place in extended flashback, and too much time is lost reading about Mike Barnett's endless (liberal) film reviews (hence the deuction of a second star). However, the eventual answers reveal much about racial politics and Big Easy corruption, and the book is a compelling read nonetheless."},{"Title":"With Extreme Prejudice","review":"Fredrick Barton's extended reflection on grief and on racism is definitely worth reading. I agree with the previous reviewer, however, that the film reviews are a distraction to the story. I see their intention, but a shortened version of each review would have achieved the same purposes.This is not an easy read--something I'm sure makes Barton proud: it's complex, thought-provoking, and sometimes profound, as this white southern male struggles to undo/ make sense of his own racism. Sometimes it is a little too navel-gazing, but having just finished Barton's first novel, _The_El_Cholo_Feeling_Passes_, I'm guessing that's Barton's style. The depth of Barton's introspection also infuses its narration. It does grow on you, and makes you think his thoughts along with him.The main character's level of self-destructiveness and alcoholism are very extreme, while the sex sizzles in this novel. I'm not convinced these elements are essential to the story, but what is special about this book is that Barton teaches us a lot about racism in the American psyche, without being preachy and within an engaging storyline. In other words, it is first and foremost, a good story. If you are an intelligent, adult reader, give it your time and reflection."},{"Title":"DEADLY ILLUSIONS.","review":"Chester Campbell has created a unique blend of sleuthing with the Greg McKenzie series.

Can they make this a successful business without pursing domestic disputes and photo-jumping hot pant spouses? Their first case doesn't look promising. Molly Saint, a hottie despite her name, wants our dynamic duo to do a background investigation on her husband,a dark, secretive guy she married without much forethought or background info. She fears Damon may be violent, and she doesn't know what he does or where his money comes from. Damon told her he was a former Special Forces operative, and he claims to do occasional favors for his military buddies. But beyond that, Molly says the guy is a question mark, with a personality becoming more aggressive, violent even. She fears he may kill her.Greg wants to decline, thinks this may be a hot pants ride, but Jill sets him straight: They need to pay the rent.And so it begins. Routinely...until Molly disappears. No trace. Just a message that she finally got a look at Damon's basement workshop, and she's terrified. The McKenzies fear the worst. They search the house. Swept clean. But the basement looks like a meth lab. Was Damon a meth'er? Need the cops now. But then the house is torched, all trace evidence gone. Nothing left but a slip of paper with some phone numbers.Who is this guy, Damon Saint? And why doesn't he have any bank accounts? Is Molly alive? Why did Damon flee a thriving business in Indiana without notice? Where does he get his money? Is he really Damon Saint, or just someone posing as him? Greg and Jill probe deeper and somebody gets offended. Threats, their office is trashed, their home vandalized.Meanwhile, as if nothing else is going on, the Fed Reserve Chairman is murdered, almost in front of the McKenzies. A black man was seen running away. The feds and locals suspect the wrong man, but the McKenzie's find a witness who can clear him. The witness is murdered.Greg and Jill find the dilapidated farmhouse where Damon was raised. There's a shovel, some signs of recent occupation. Is Molly buried here?Not gonna say much more, because I don't want to give anything away. Suffice to say, this is the best of the series, a real humdinger.

Molly has been married to Damon Saint for five years. But, Jill has a feeling that something isn't right and convinces Greg to do some preliminary investigations. If they don't find anything alarming, they will stop.They are already working for Leisure Foods Group investigating missing funds from a King Cole specialty restaurant. Jill goes undercover as hostess in the restaurant. Greg gets friends to eat there so that they can determine if the money they pay to the restaurant is actually accounted for in the deposit the next day.The day they met with Mr. Logan from Leisure Foods Group in the Opryworld Hotel, Dr. Elliott Bernstein, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, was gunned down at the hotel. Since Greg used to be an investigator for the DA's office, he knows some officers. But since he left that job after some comments he made about Detective Mark Tremaine ended up in the newspaper, he doesn't get along with many of the officers. The one officer that is still his friend is Detective Phil Adamson.Once Molly disappears, the McKenzie's begin to delve deeply into Damon's background. They never lose sight of their other cases, but this one has become priority.The Greg McKenzie series is fast becoming one of my all-time favorite series. Mr. Campbell has a great way of telling a story while weaving the various cases that Greg and Jill are working on. I find his characters to be very believable. I like that they don't just center on one case. That's not how it is in real life.I like the Nashville setting. And the fact that Jill is a pilot and owns a Cessna allows them to travel to gain additional information and not lose much time.The only complaint I'd have is that they turn off their cell phone too much, especially during important cases.

While their office in a strip shopping center on the east side of Nashville, Tennessee is modest, it suits their purposes fine. It is there where they meet a walk in client by the name of Molly Saint.Molly has a problem with her husband, Damon Saint. She does not really know the man even after several years of marriage. He never told her much about his past beyond the fact that he was a Vietnam vet and that he claimed to have done some sort of covert operations on behalf of the Government. Then there is the shadowy group he says he belongs to that consists of a number of former vets who occasionally need his help. While there were a lot of things she didn't know about him, or why he forbade her to go into the basement of their home for any reason, what has her concerned now is that his behavior has changed in recent weeks. While nothing has actually happened, she feels threatened by him. Greg does not really feel anything is going on but since Jill is concerned, they take the case.Molly soon vanishes and as the McKenzies dig into Damon Saint's background while they look for her, it begins to look like she was right and her disappearance might have been foul play. At the same time, they are working a case of financial fraud at a local restaurant and Greg might have figured out who fired the fatal shot that took down the Federal Reserve Chairman at a local hotel. In short, the McKenzies have their hands full before Damon begins to get seriously annoyed with their snooping.Picking up a short period after the very enjoyable \\"Designed To Kill\\" this book continues the author's track record of strong writing, realistic characters and complex mysteries that makes this series so good. Greg and Jill are a very realistic pairing, especially to those readers that have been married quite a few years. The mysteries are always complex and twisting, and this one is no exception.While this novel could be read as a stand alone, due to the frequent allusions and explanations of the earlier books in the series, it would be best to read them in order. Therefore, start with \\"Secret Of The Scroll\\" which introduces the McKenzies and others and then follow it with \\"Designed to Kill\\" which will lead you right up to this novel.

Greg and Jill are senior sleuths, both of retirement age. Their relationship is refreshingly comfortable, and they work well together. That's not to say there are no conflicts in the book. The conflicts arise from the case and the secrets Greg and Jill uncover.

It is also a creature in criical danger of extinction and Captain Cousteau closes with a passionate plea for its preservation."},{"Title":"The Whale: Mighty Monarch of the Sea","review":"This book was first published in 1972.

This synthesis, however, is a wonderful work of history. Bailey excellently covers the movements of the post-World War I peace effort without spending too much time going back and forth between the armistice and the war or pre-war days. As such, this book reads very easily because the flow is very simple.Bailey's writing style also makes undertaking a daunting task relatively facile. Bailey's topic may be relative to World War I but it is not a military history but rather, more along the lines of a political or even social history. He includes details about diplomatic efforts undertaken at the end of World War I and also covers issues relative to propagating the armistice in the United States. At the very least, the cartoons stand as period pieces that speak volumes about the life and culture of early twentieth century.Those of you who have read Bailey's work before know that he writes in an intelligent and sophisticated manner but one need not be a college level wordsmith to fully comprehend or follow his work. Because this is a synthesis, this may not be a comprehensive study of everything that happened between 1911 and 1920. However, this is a great place to start. Think of this as a building block on which you might build an understanding of the world at the beginning of the twentieth century."},{"Title":"Woodrow Wilson and the lost peace","review":"Bailey has written an excellent book. It demonstrates the reasons why Wilson's attempt to create a lasting peace failed, and then the author gives quality support that not only supports his view, but knocks down opposition to his standpoint. He also includes political cartoons from newpapers that allow you to see public opinion and they support his own opinion. I enjoyed the book for these reasons and because the way it was written helped me to remember what I had read. I would especially recomend this book to any student studying American History. Bailey's writing is clear and concise and will be an eye opener."},{"Title":"Wake Up, Bear (Gold Star First Readers)","review":".Our friend the bear has been asleep all winter.

It was a favorite in our house."},{"Title":"Politically Correct Parables","review":"PCP is a sad ripoff of James Finn Garner's mostly brilliant series of politically-correct bedtime stories -- even down to the cover art. Author Walker offers very straight retellings of the classic Gospel parables -- The Prodigal Son, The Good Samaritan, The Wise and Foolish Maidens -- in a witless imitation of Garner's wicked style. Departures from the gospels are mostly pedantic and uninspired. The Good Samaritan offers to have his HMO cover the costs of the injured man. (!) Sinners are repetitiously \\"compassion-challenged\\" or \\"differently-moral.\\" Occassionally, a bit of cleverness peeks through the murk, as when the \\"matriarch\\" in the story of the ungrateful steward writes off a debt due to liberal guilt rather than compassion. But these moments of wit are rare, especially by comparison with the steady, low-level drumbeat of liberal bashing. The book can be read through in about an hour, so it doesn't even gain in quantity what it lacks in quality.Skip this one -- with my blessing."},{"Title":"Politically Correct Parables","review":"This reads like a search-and-replace exercise in taking \\"offensive\\" terms and replacing them with watered down versions. As such, it is too straight and misses opportunities to (even in good humor) have fun with the absurd new meanings excessive political correctness could have injected into the parables."},{"Title":"Politically Correct Parables","review":"I wasn't sure about this book when I first picked it up.

As he explains, even though &quot;calligraphy&quot; only means &quot;words written by hand&quot;, to the Chinese it is an art with a long history. He affirms that &quot;the characters not only convey the language of thought but also, in a visual way, the artistic beauty of the thought&quot;.In the introduction to &quot;The Art of Chinese calligraphy&quot;, the author says that the purpose of the book is allowing the readers to delight in the intrinsic beauty of Chinese calligraphy, even if they haven't yet mastered the Chinese language. Also, J. Long points out that in this book he provides the instructions that allow the readers who want to try their hands at Chinese calligraphy to do so. The instructions include a step by step guide to using the necessary equipment, and all that is needed to learn the different brushwork techniques. Finally, he also expresses his hope that &quot;a greater understanding of the art of Chinese calligraphy will provide a clearer insight into the character of the Chinese people themselves&quot;.The book is very well divided into interesting chapters that are easy to read and contain a lot of information even though they aren't overly long. The 1st chapter is titled &quot;The development of Chinese calligraphy&quot;, and deals with the history of this art. It is worthwhile mentioning that this chapter and all the others include many useful illustrations, specially photographs (for example, a photograph of a ritual vessel from the 10th century BC, inscribed with characters). The 2nd chapter, &quot;Chinese calligraphy as an art form&quot;, explains how it developed to an art form, from the merely functional act of writing. The 3rd chapter is &quot;Language as a way to the understanding of Chinese thought&quot;, and the 4th is &quot;The calligraphic seal&quot;. Chapters 5 and 6 deal with &quot;Chinese porcelain and ceramics&quot; and &quot;Inscriptions on paintings&quot; respectively, and chapter 7 centers on &quot;Chinese painting equipment and how to use it&quot;. Lastly, chapter 8 is about &quot;The techniques of Chinese calligraphy&quot;.When I bought this book I was not exceedingly interested in attempting Chinese calligraphy, but I wanted to know more about it and the importance it has for Chinese culture. I decided to buy &quot;The Art of Chinese calligraphy&quot; because I considered it would be able to answer my questions... And thankfully, I was right!. This book is a great introduction to the subject, and it is highly likely to be useful not only to artists but also to readers like me who don't want to paint but love to learn about other cultures.On the whole, I think this book is a keeper, and I highly recommend it :)Belen"},{"Title":"Obituaries and Bible records of persons born in the nineteenth century and related to West Texans","review":"Chinese calligraphy is a mammoth subject with thousands of years of history. In addition, calligraphy in Chinese culture has achieved a recognition and respect as an art form that has never been matched by its Western counterparts. Jean Long has written a very readable book that provides an excellent overview to the history of Chinese writing from the tortoise shell oracle bones through bronze inscriptions, pottery vases and, of course, calligraphic scrolls. Also, the author provides basic instructions for how to hold a brush, grind ink, and write a few characters on your own. Given the breadth of the material, the author covers it well, but this book, on account of its brevity, serve as an introduction to whet your appetite. One would then look elsewhere to explore more deeply the various techniques and different calligraphic styles."},{"Title":"Obituaries and Bible records of persons born in the nineteenth century and related to West Texans","review":"This book covers Chinese calligraphy very well.

In a way Landry is more of an urban psychiatrist who's challenging cities and their inhabitants to make up their own minds on how to become a better urban society. The book is chock full of examples, stories and insights on the matter (hence the size) which a well informed Landry uses to picture the bigger and positive image without being pushy about anything, although the 'being creative' gets a bit repeative after a while. All in all the book is an easy to read and feel good story about cities that want or should want to be a good city."},{"Title":"Of the Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity: Set (Hooker's Works Series)","review":"I was extremely pleased when I first came across Via Media's reprint of Hooker's \\"Laws\\". The entire, unabridged text of the eight books that comprise \\"Laws\\" is not easy to find. Via Media provides it in three volumes, using Keble's edition. I thought that the asking price was more than a bit steep, but as I regularly reference the text it seemed worth it to have my own copy ready to hand. So, I ordered it. Poor decision on my part! The volumes I received were absolutely the most poorly bound paperback books I have ever owned. The pages are glued individually to the spine, and they immediately come loose wherever one \\"breaks\\" the spine to keep the book flat. Unfortunately it is almost impossible to work with the book without causing breaks because Via Media's volumes are, of necessity, thick and heavy. In short order I was putting rubber bands around each of the volumes to keep the pages from falling out. My initial delight at having these books soon turned to frustration and annoyance. If the volumes I received are representative, Via Media's edition is not suitable for any reader or researcher who handles books in an ordinary manner. The volumes might look good on the shelf, but as physical products they do not serve well for serious use. In my opinion their quality comes nowhere near to justifying their price."},{"Title":"Devotions for college students (Good morning, Lord)","review":"I enjoyed reading this book of devotions. Having just graduated a few years ago and intending to return to school in the fall, I figured I might get something out of this book of devotions. The devotions are all short and each has one major point. Some of them give a few interesting tadbits of information and a few offer a really intriguing story.The book has two major drawbacks. One is that there is not enough scripture; most of the daily devotions only have one line or part of a line of scripture. Secondly, the book has aged some since it was first published. Some of the lessons really no longer are applicable to the modern Christian college student. Other than that, it's a decent devotion book for college students."},{"Title":"Arthur's Birthday Party (I Can Read Book 2)","review":"The main character, Arthur, decides to have a gymnastics contest at his birthday party.

His friends then decide to give him the award for best all-around gymnast."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"The Battle of Corrin is the final book in the prequel trilogy by Brian Herbert & Kevin Anderson. Overall, the book fits in well with the other books in the series. However, the book has a huge amount of ground to tie up all the plot lines introduced in the other two books. The conclusion to the various major plotlines are fairly predictable but written with sufficent detail and style to make it worth reading.The background material on folding space, Bene Gesserit (sp?) and hatred between the Atreides and the Harkonnens are interesting. I liked the way the Luddite religious extremists are done; a nice social commentary on blind faith combined with a lack of knowledge or thought. It has an interesting perspective when considered with the recent events in Iraq.The book is a fairly quick read and worth it if you enjoy the Dune Galaxy."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"(This is basically a review of the entire 2nd trilogy.)I didn't like this 2nd trilogy nearly as much as the first trilogy these 2 guys wrote. It wasn't just that the subject matter, now being displaced 1000 of years before the original Dune book, isn't connected nearly as intimately to the original books (there are none of the characters from the original books in these), but I also think the 2 writers just laxed up on the writing: parts of this seem more amateurish and stylized than the first trilogy, and some of the writing is just not good.There are a lot of other problems, too, both big and small: 1)Just some things that were hard to buy, or didn't make sense, like: Why didn't the machines use atomics (they do give some non-persuasive reasons for this at one point)? Was it really possible that the machine could never get around their \\"gelcircuitry\\" -- was there no way else for them to construct an artificial brain? What exactly happened to Rayna in the 3rd book, or Raquella for that matter? Why did the Sorceresses have the powers that they did -- the Reverend Mothers of the later books didn't even have those powers? Omnius couldn't come up with a way to kill the humans better than an old fashioned plague with just a 40+% kill rate? 2) Some things were just stupid, and seemed to be put in just to add a \\"neat\\" factor (the little pirahna mites, for ex, are just silly). 3) The whole series was just too long, with too many characters and threads that didn't have to be followed at all, because they lead to nothing, or that were just followed in too much detail. These 1900 pages probably could have been cut to 1000 or so. It's suppose to be an epic, yes, but you don't make a good epic just by bloading it with boring and unnecessary content (the thread with the long-lost Titan Hecate could have been so good, but it led to almost nothing and was dull; and did we have to follow the sword fighters in the 3rd book at all?) 4) It didn't keep the same human characters thru the 3 books, and so it didn't have as strong of a thread as the first series.The first book in this trilogy (The Butlerian Jihad) was enjoyable, but then everything just got old, and the 2nd and 3rd books got boring, and I even skimmed some story lines. But... you do get to see if how Mentats, the Guild navigators, the Bene Gesserit, the Atreides/Harkonnen fued, etc., all got started, even if a couple of their beginnings seem contrived."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"It's actually several stories in 1 book. The main 1 being the battle for Corrin. Others include a planet Dune story (since it appears totally disconnected, I assume it was added so that the word DUNE could be displayed on the cover in big gold letters).Of the others, only the defeat of the Daleks (sorry Cymeks) was vaguely interesting and even that got silly at the end.Waste of reading was the origin of the; Mentats, Bene Gesserit, space guild and any other cult that all appeared at the same time, for no apparent reason.As for the main story, I'll just repeat what others have said; it's described through many conversations between main characters who appear to converse like a bunch of teenagers on a school playground (edit: think early Dr. Who). The characters are so immature, the decisions based on flawed reasoning and the surprises so obvious, even a bunch of chimpanzees could see them coming.1 star for the Cymeks, and 1 for the easy reading format .. the short chapters work when the writers are unable to hold your attention for more then 5 pages.If you like enjoy early Dr. Who and Daleks stories, you too might enjoy parts of this."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"Sorry, I'm a huge Dune fan but I cannot say anything nice about this book or the Butlerian Jihad trilogy. It was really quite bad. The whole thing was forced and repetitive. There was a lot of wasted space with characters thinking the same thing over and over again. The authors forgot something really important -> we know how it end. It ends where Dune starts. Their obligation was to keep the reader engaged while knowing all the fact. It fall short.-spoiler alert-Look I know that they can fold space. I know they are going to figure it out. I know what a navigator is and how one becomes one. So why drag me through the creation story. Boring boring boring. Additionally, the whole thinking machine was a terminator rip off and naming the thinking machine antagonist Omnius is both trite and lazy. Don't get me started on the , yawn, Titans.I finished the third in the trilogy just because. Overall the whole series was a waste of time. I think I may re-read Dune just to cleanse my brain."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"It took me about halfway through The Butlerian Jihad to really get a feel for the characters and enjoy the story. Having very much liked the Prelude to Dune Trilogy, I was relieved when I was able to get into that book and the subsequent Machine Crusade. The Battle of Corrin may just be the best of the three (although, really, I feel the trilogy is best viewed as one long story published in three volumes).If you've gotten this far into the Dune novels by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson, you know what you're going to get in a lot of regards, and you probably already have an opinion, either favorable or not, of how they construct their stories:1. Sweeping, intersecting plots.2. Many characters on numerous worlds.3. Short chapters.4. Compared with Frank Herbert, writing that is more focused on plot and action than subtlety and philosophy.Some people can't get past the fact that this is not Frank Herbert and therefore view anything else done in the Dune universe as unacceptable. I'm not one of those people. I think the Herbert/Anderson team has done an incredible job building upon the foundation Frank Herbert created, and I very much enjoy the characters and multifaceted plots that weave together, telling the story of a century-long war, as well as the beginning of the Bene Gesserit, the Fremen, and the Spacing Guild. Though the chapters are sometimes too short, and there are so many characters to keep straight, there are a lot of emotionally resonant moments.Prequels have a couple major challenges: Staying true to the original and leading you to a known endpoint in interesting and unexpected ways. I think the Butlerian Jihad trilogy does this remarkably well. We know that humanity wins the war against the thinking machines, and we know that there will be a split between the Harkonnens and Atreides, but how it happens is extremely fascinating. If you liked the first two books in this series, then I think you'll like The Battle of Corrin as well."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"Having read the first two books of this trilogy, I picked up the third book with some worry. This book wasn't great, but it did not make me stop reading the book 1/2 way through as I had feared.The Battle of Corrin tells the story of the creation of the society that Frank Herbert created in Dune and of the climactic battle that ends the war against thinking machines. I would say that it ends the Butlerian Jihad, but strangely, the Jihad was \\"declared\\" before the battle that Frank Herbert tells us ended it.First the good points. The authors finally reread Dune and realized that the Butlerian Jihad was not a war against robots but a war against all electronic devices. One of the characters (a young girl who had a vision while in the grip of a deadly plague) creates the Cult of Serena, which is determined to destroy all computers. She insinuates her way to power (it helps that she is the niece of the leader of the League of Nobles and related to Serena) and unleashes her vision on humanity, smashing all electronic devices no matter how helpful or harmless.The authors manage to capture a bit of the feeling of Paul in the original book actually able to capture the imagination of his followers as a prophet and then manipulate his followers to gain power.Second, I did like the description of the creation of the Fremen on Dune. The authors managed to find a way to create a group of very noble, very violent and very outcast people (outcasts from the outcasts) that is a plausible precursor to the Fremen.Third, I found it ironic that actual robots/computers were the ones responsible for the humans who took over this role once they were destroyed, Mentats.Fourth, I did come to enjoy Erasmus. He started out very wooden. A combination of the generic evil character and Data or Pinocchio or any of the many, many non-human characters whose only desire is to become a human. By the third book he is actually interesting.Finally, I did like the slight ambiguity at the end. Frank Herbert basically lets us know that the Honored Matres at the end of his books encountered very strange things when they were scattered by the death of Leto II. Both trilogies have now ended with hints about what those strange things may be. Bravo.Unfortunately, the bad at least equals the good in the book. Others have pointed out how odd the betrayal of the Harkonnens in the Battle of Corrin was. I concur. It seemed very contrived. We all knew it was coming from the original Dune, so the fact that there was a betrayal is not a spoiler, but I can't go into what was wrong with the betrayal without a giant spoiler. It's too bad because the authors' idea--\\"legends are often twisted\\"--is not a bad one.The other almost unforgivable thing is the author's unsubtlety towards religion. Frank Herbert gave us very interesting ideas about religion and humanity in his Dune books. As I read them, Frank tells us that religion and spirituality is very important for the growth of humanity and for keeping humans in an organized society. He tells us that too much religion, especially when concentrated with secular power, can lead to very dangerous things. But also tells us that it may not be possible to separate the good from the bad in religion.The authors of this trilogy understand that religion is important for keeping humanity in line, but tend to see it as just something to keep the dumb people in line. They portray all the heroes as basically tolerantly (or not tolerantly) supporting the silly religion of the masses but not being part of it, or they see religious people as crazy like Rayna.Frank teaches us that smart people and true leaders are often deeply religious themselves, that mysticism and religion is important for Fremen, for Bene Gesserit, and many others. But that it can never be handled. His son does not understand this."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"Must read for Dune fans and scifi fans in general.

Brian has stayed true to the characters and the writing style of his father."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"One steps into this series not expecting the achievement of Dune, an unfairly high standard, but a good read with maybe some flashes of Dune's complexity of character, plot, and philosophy. The first book of this trilogy, the Butlerian Jihad, failed in the latter two areas but the plot was a good enough read to overcome those flaws. The second book was a step backward, with the same weak characterization, but this time not balanced by a strongly told story. The Battle of Corrin, unfortunately, continues the downward trend. As in the other books, characterization is almost uniformly shallow, which is tough to do since some of these characters we've seen over the course of several long books now. Those characters we've seen in prior books don't seem to have developed much and the new characters are mostly two-dimensional. The plot is weak, mostly an episodic narrative of battles among the three major groups at war (the humans, the cymeks, the robots). The weakness of the plot is exacerbated by the \\"been there, done that\\" sense of repetition. It seems the three books could easily have been combined into two, making for a more streamlined, less repetitive narrative. Not everything needs to be a trilogy (Tolkien be damned). Another flaw affecting involving both plot and character is that too many actions seem arbitrary or contrived, done more for a plotline than developing out of character. Some, in fact, seem wholly out of character or simply unbelievable. Finally, whereas the first book mostly avoided the prequel problem of rote action meant to connect the dots of later books, this one is rolling in it, filled with awkwardly introduced or clumsily handled events/phrases written in so the reader can go \\"ahh, so that's why they call them xxxxxxxx in Dune\\". Admittedly, it's a tough problem to overcome for any prequel, but seldom have I seen it so poorly handled.If this were book one I'd definitely recommend against starting the trilogy. But chances are, if you've reached Battle of Corrin, you're going to read it no matter what just to finish the series and see those connections to later Dune books. So all I can say is don't expect much, don't feel bad about skimming, and have a good book set aside to dive into when you're done; you're going to want to recapture a good read quickly."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"Like so many others, I did not expect this series to equal or surpass the original Dune series.I have been quite pleased with this series until now, enjoying the opportunity to view the world of Dune from a new perspective. Watching Herbert's universe take shape has actually been quite entertaining.This particular book, however, falls short. The writing feels forced and rushed, the dialog completely inane, the characters stripped of any complexity. The villians are stupid and easily manipulated. The characters make rash decisions with vast, universe-shattering consequences but do not even pause to do a bit of soul-searching for the benefit of the by now befuddled reader.The sentences are often redundant and obviously barely edited, if at all. The book is readable, but the poor writing intrudes constantly.If you're a follower of the series, you might rent it from the library to find out how the conflict ends, but I'm not sure it's worth the 7.99. (To add insult to injury, my copy, at least, is poorly printed.)"},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"Where others have attacked this series of books for not living up to the original Dune, I've tried to give them the benefit of the doubt. Sure, they don't compare with Frank Herberet's masterpiece, but then I never expected them to. On their own, the first two novels were good \\"Star Wars\\"-style space opera; however, this book was just not as good. It was almost as if the authors wanted to get the series done and over with so they could move on to other ideas. I think it also lacks in continuity between the other novels. The first two books featured the same characters and followed within several years of the Jihad timeline. This book jumps ahead several decades and introduces and entirely new cast of characters, with the exception of Vorien Atreides who survives because he received life extending treatments from his father. Near the end, the book seems rushed and falls flat. What started out as an OK continuation of the Dune saga fell flat with this novel."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"Honestly,the Butlerian Jihad Prequels are hit and miss to a large degree.The overall story is engaging and entertaining but not presented well,in my opinion.As the reviewer below mentions,the characters are all pretty one-dimensional and hard to get inside of.The novels seem to read more like a history than an actual storyline.Kind of like watching Gettysburg as a stage play instead of a film.But then again perhaps that was the intent.It does have a sweeping span to it,but it is more akin to short chapter-like Star Wars episodes than the original Dune novels.And to respond to some of the loose ends that another reviewer mentioned...As most of you probably know,Anderson and Herbert also intend to finish the Dune Chronicals with two more novels that take place after Chapterhouse:Dune.These novels are going to come directly from Frank Herbert's outlines before his untimely death.In Chapterhouse,it was implied that the Honored Matres and others were coming back to the empire because they were fleeing another power.It was never explained what they were running from.It would make sense that according to the Butlerian Prequels,since Omnius sent out the copy/probes of itself and \\"uploaded\\" himself into deep space,that the Thinking Machines may be returning to Imperium space after 14,000 years.This is also implied by a sequence in the novel House Corrino where a Guild heighliner accidently jumps out of known space and the navigator senses an intense hatred of humanity in that unknown area.That could be consistant with the Machines still being in existance.Since aliens or other intelligences have never been in the Dune dogma,this fits as well.So I think the loose ends will end up playing a part in the Dune finale novels.As to the fate of certain characters,it's rather refreshing to leave the story a little open ended as far as the Atreides and Harkonnen dynasties.Perhaps for the readers imagination or future novels/short stories.As far as being disappointed with the novels,I'm not.They are entertaining (if not somewhat predictable) and good reading material if you love the Dune saga.Are they on par with Frank Herbert's epic novels?No..unfortunately not.But these are different authors with their own styles and storytelling methods.One can't forget that.But I think the saga is still in good hands..who better to continue than his son?...and I'll still look forward to the next installment...."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"The original Dune is arguably the greatest science fiction novel ever written; Lotus magazine readers voted it the greatest work of imaginative literature of all time. This being said, it is nothing but a pity that Battle of Corrin was ever written.Let me start out by saying that describing a planet-wide space battle does not make the said space battle exciting. The original Herbert didn't have to rely on cheap attention-grabbing ploys; he was so good at capturing attention that he even left much of the 'action' offstage.Ok, so Frank Herbert is dead and there is no one even remotely like him left in the world of sci-fi literature. It would be selfish and even downright idiotic to asume that his son and Kevin J. Anderson could come anywhere close to him in terms of writing. That does not mean, however, that they should not be exempt from two glaring faults:1. A ridiculous premise that comes very close to flatly contradicting the original Dune material. The Butlerian Jihad, from my understanding, was NOT a literal struggle between humanity and sentient, malicious machines. It was instead a semi-religious movement that purged computers from society. Making the Jihad into a literal war is blatant and cliche; I could have re-watched the Matrix if I'd wanted to experience that. The original Herbert was all about subtelties and hidden meanings, of which there are none in Battle of Corrin.2. A shameless set-up to the likewise awful 'Hunters of Dune.' So Omnius sends out probes and a mysterious 'signal' into the unknown universe, does he? As I read that, I groaned. The simple plotline of Humanity vs. Omnius carelessly tosses the six originals to the wind. The dune universe is about the Atreides and the spice, NOT thinking machines that could have come from B-movies.If you're a fan of the six original Dunes, I'd recommend not buying this one. In all likelihood, you'll be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"All they need to do is connect the dots.Up to this point I felt Dune-Lite is better than no Dune at all. Sure they're fluffy and one dimensional, and don't really touch on themes/philosophy in the depth that F.H. did. But he left some big literary shoes to fill, so I was willing to enjoy these new novels for what they are.The Butlerian Jihad started out OK, unfortunately the last installment is just a fiasco that gets worse and worse leading up to and including the title battle itself. The story is Mystery Science Theater 3000 fare, the characters are B-movie archetypes, and the dialogue is mawkish soap opera cheese (even from the robots!). The villains have become corny silver-age comic book fiends. The Titans have become the Transformers. This book is really a slap in the face, it should never have been released.My biggest gripe is the dialogue. I've never read a book before that made me roll my eyes and groan \\"ugh\\" out loud, ever. Hamfisted, insipid, drivel. Here are some memorable gems:-The Mentat origin: \\"I am your mentor, you are my mentee...You need a nickname...I will call you my Mentat\\". Wow, so this is one of the origins we've been waiting for?-\\"A Butler serves unto no one\\". This corny pun wasn't even clever the first time I read it, after the twelfth time I felt like puking. The fact that it's someone's dying words is criminal.-\\"Spice Rush\\", yep just like the old west. There's spice in them thar dunes!-Omnius' \\"multiple personality disorder\\" Cyber-Sybil?-The retro-virus, Compound X, piranha mites. Muhuhahahaha! Is Dr. Doom collaborating with Omnius now?-\\"Death to the Machines!\\" No need to explain this one.-Agamemnon's battelship form is a \\"demonic Pterodactyl\\". He's a Dino-bot!-\\"It's about taking the think out of the thinking machines\\" Until he said this, Vorian was the one redeeming character of this series. At this point in the book I realized someone was playing a joke on me.-Erasmus was another bright spot in this series, but he went from being the sadistic scourge of humanity to a mawkish drama queen. Yuck.-The worm jousting - this is a joke, right? WORM JOUSTING? Shaitan reduced to cockfighting? Don't believe me? Look at the cover of the book!The ending is absurd. All they needed to do was tie things up credibly - we know what the end result is going to be, it's the journey that needs to be fleshed out with some integrity. Everything is just way too easily, conveniently, and cleanly tied up, like they phoned it in. I'm willing to suspend disbelief and enjoy a light read, but this one was a bomb.The blame for this book goes beyond Herbert and Anderson, where were the editors? Seriously.Somebody please tell me this was all just a joke."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"This was a VERY difficult book for me to read. I tried many times to focus and get into the story, but the poor job of storytelling made this impossible. The plot was not cohesive at all. It jumped all over the place making the story very unpolished and uncomfortable to read. Sadly, when compared to its predecessors, this book was not a huge disappointment - it simply continues the trend of bad writing. Please do not waste your time with this one."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"I find it interesting that many reviewers gave this book low rating because its a lightweight material. I see no reason to debate that since this book is relatively lightweight. But its also unfair to compared it to the complexity of Frank Herbert's works since I don't believed that was the authors' intent.This book is neither good as or bad as the first two books. All three books were basically lightweight materials. But I thought they were all pretty entertaining stuff that you can read for pure relaxation. Many people couldn't get into Frank Herbert's works because it was complex, deep and thought provoking. But these two authors who wrote the Legend of Dune series wrote for almost anyone who can read the English language. I think there is merit on that score.If you read the first two books in this series, then you know what to expect and I would strongly recommend that you will finish up the series. Battle of Corrin is a light reading material despite of its thickness in pages and it does tildy up the series. Beside, if you really didn't like these books, you would never read pass the first book anyway. I am sure that all these reviewers who gave this book one and two stars found themselves reading on because there is a quality within these pages. After all, after the first two books, how can you be surprised???"},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"This (hopefully) last \\"Legend\\" tale was the worst. Like other reviewers, I devoured the original series and even liked the three \\"family\\" series. But something changed in the \\"Legends\\" Series - the story not only got off track but introduced elements that were disconcerting in the least.Where to start? The sadism was so bad that when Erasmus or one of the Titans drew near to a human I skipped ahead, unable to stand any more elevated rationalizations from these monsters. Besides, we are never told why they act as they do - what drove them to this madness? Speaking of madness, the cult of Serena was one of the wackiest ever. The idea of unarmed mobs taking over a governnment was absurd.Then we had those interminable battle scenes that were the epitomy of dullness. The conversations among the robots were ridiculous, more like something on Mystery Science Theater. There were too many characters and the hero (Vor Atriedes)remained distant, never acquiring a personality. Also the characters made decisions totally \\"out of character\\" again and again. The writing style (three pages/chapter) is annoying, making it seem like a series of vignettes instead of a seamless tale.On the plus side, we learn the origins of the Spacing Guild (Norma, my favorite character, appeared briefly). The origins of the Bene Geserit - more an accident than a purposeful event - was a good saga. We learn why the Harkonnens are hated, the Atriedes admired and the Corrinos in command. I hope the authors move on to other things...drop the robots, the battles and get on with the mythology."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"There seem to be alot of complaints from serious Dune fans, that Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson are ruining Frank Herbert's vision of the Dune universe. I will agree to a certain extent that these works are nowhere near as complex and well written as the original Dune series, and that Brian and Kevin seem to have taken certain liberites with Frank Herbert's vision of the Dune universe; changing certain aspects to fit into their storyline. That being said however, these works are an enjoyable read. As I said, these books cannot, and should not be compared to the original works, which are truly great works of LITERATURE, for these are not works of literature, but rather, serial novels designed more to entertain than enlighten. These books admirably accomplish this goal, and when viewed in this light, and taken for what they are, one can appreciate what Brian and Kevin are trying to accomplish. As a huge fan of Frank Herbert's original series, I for one welcome any continuation of the Dune universe, so long as the continuation keeps me entertained.Rather than nit-pick and scream that these books do a disservice to the original series, I would encourage all fans Frank Herbert's Dune to view these books for their entertainment value, rather than their literary value, and simply enjoy them for what they are."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"\\"The Battle of Corrin\\" is the last of the Butlerian Jihad trilogy, preceded by \\"The Butlerian Jihad\\" and \\"The Machine Crusade.\\" Like the first two, it tells part of the history leading to Frank Herbert's Dune novels. The main theme is the struggle of humanity versus an empire of thinking machines.Despite getting only four stars from me, this trilogy is a good example of space opera. It demonstrates how written words can serve as a portal to interesting events and worlds that would be inaccessible without written words. Characteristic of space opera, your spirit will be immersed in science-fiction action, but it will also be immersed in political intrigue, drama, passion, and some of the male-female stuff that most authors refer to as \\"romance.\\" (Yet these books have almost no sex.) The ending for \\"The Battle of Corrin\\" wraps up the story neatly, and though you should read the first two volumes, I suppose you could be satisfied with only this last one.As I did for the first two volumes, I feel obliged to subtract a star from my rating for the third volume, because of some elements of implausibility. Sure, some characters use paranormal powers, starships make hyper-spatial jumps, and the planet Arrakis has incredibly huge sandworms, but those are acceptable givens for science fiction. I do not consider them implausible. The implausibilities I am referring to are moments when characters behave unrealistically and when events do not proceed logically. They make the story unconvincing.Fiction writers often come to a crossroad where they must answer a question: What do I value more, story elements that are plausible or story elements that will impress the reader? More often than not, Herbert and Anderson try to choose elements that are both plausible and impressive. Too often, however, they are lured down a path that is low on plausibility but high on impression. They have an agenda. Maybe they want the plot to go a certain way. Maybe they want a character to appear heroic. Maybe they want a space battle to be exciting. If, in order to achieve items on their agenda, they must fudge a little in regard to plausibility, they do so.Maybe all writers of fiction do so. Certainly some do so more than others. Maybe Herbert and Anderson felt at liberty to fudge because they were writing space opera, not hardcore science fiction. But space opera does not require moments of implausibility. With more honest thinking, their story could have been told with fewer such moments.Though Herbert and Anderson are not the most skillful authors, they tuned me into a science fiction epic that has soulful power. So I recommend this trilogy. But if you try it, I advise that you avoid bogging yourself down by ranting and raving about the moments of implausibility. Ignore them. Just bear down and forge ahead. The portal will open.Note: Sometimes the worth of a book can at least partially be measured by the fondness with which it is remembered. It has been over a month since I completed my reading of the Legends of Dune trilogy (\\"The Butlerian Jihad,\\" \\"The Machine Crusade,\\" and \\"The Battle of Corrin\\"), and my memories of it are quite positive. Though this trilogy forms a different kind of story from that of Frank Herbert's classic \\"Dune,\\" the quality of the story is as good. For this reason I have decided to give each book in the trilogy a five-star rating. I believe the weaknesses in the books do not merit a lowering of rating."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"Let's all be honest: The Butlerian Jihad could have been better written by a high-school drop-out with a vauge knoweledge of Dune. The Machine Crusade at last shed itself of at least half its cliches and made itself almost worth the time it took to read. The Battle of Corrin, then, is so amazingly better than the frist two that I could sing for joy. Granted, it was bad enough that I had to interupt it with a spurt of corny young adult romance novels to keep interested, but in that light the novel shown as interesting, exciting, unexpected, and generally almost worth the time.The long and the short of it is that Omnius gets impatient, uses human inginuity (from captive humans) to attack the League with various forms of danger (super-plague, flesh-eating paranas) while the League ends up loosing atomics on most the syncronized worlds and declaring the jihad over while the last Omnius is trapped on Corrin and the Titans decide to take over what they can in their wake. But the passions behind the people (for instance, the captive humans who innovate the deadly scurge) are exciting, and far from commonplace. Erasmus himself may have at last understod what it means to be human, while Vorian has learned, by the end of the novel, that he is an Atredies - a son of Agamemnon - and that, however much we may lie to ourselves, we cannot fully escape our parentage or our patronage. I actually couldn't see the end of the novel, but again the corny young adult novels I was reading in between might have something to do with that. Still, the best of the Legends of Dune triolgy, which is enough to make me happy that I stuck through it."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"This book is the best of the three.

Lots of characters and subplots but only one or two that really matter. Probably the entire trilogy could have been done in one book that concentrated on Vor, Serena, the Valiant Harkonnens, Erasmus, and Agamemnon. The Guild, Bene Gesserit, and Fremen subplots didn't really work.The end of \\"Battle of Corrin\\" seems to be setting us up for yet another prequel trilogy documenting the birth of the Guild, the Landsraad, the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood and the Mentats. I hope not, but I will probably read them anyway.Its a shame that Herbert died before we could get his entire vision though these books aren't as hard to follow as those by Chris Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"I read the original dune as a kid, & I enjoyed the prequils. However this book seemed disproportional.I spent most of the book waiting for the title battle. When it finally came, it was less than sixty pages from the end of the book! I enjoyed this book, but it could have been better if divided into two books. The Battle Of Corrin, is excelently written, but the post-war happenings are all compressed into about ten pages.I recomend this book, but it is not on par with the other five prequils, or Frank Herbert's original works."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"I've completed the Battle of Corrin and was pretty dissapointed. This really should have been two books. In fact, fundamental questions about the spacing guild, congress of royal houses, the benejeserit, really take a back seat what seems like a schedule of events that unfold. Character development is almost completely abandoned in the entire 2nd half of the book. Erasmus for example, a robot whose purpose is to provide an unimpeded methodical and amoral examination of human behavior begins to and does act in a radical and emotional way. However, no reflection is given to why this transformation takes place.Two elements of the original Dune works stand out as missing in most all of the prequels. The first is the element of mysticism. Poisons, institutions, assumptions, and \\"plans within plans\\" are all a part of the Dune world created by Frank Herbert. Those unknows forced the reader to reflect on the situations created by the interactions of individuals confident in their own agendas and beliefs. A second element missing is the depth of character. In fact, what a person really believes in the prequels are summed up in the brief snipets from other works at the beginning of each chapter. This attempt at character development is more form than function. The entire origin of the conflict between the houses of Atraides and Harkonnen are relegated to an afterthought of a few pages and no sympathy is given to the position of Abulerd Harkonnen. It's like the whole reason for the original Dune series is based on just a misunderstanding.The Battle of Corrin definitely follows an action genre type of formula in that introspective examination is almost null. The condition of humanity is never examined. There are no mantras, no internal conflicts, and no characters undergo personal revelations or growth. Each character tends to follow their own roles and therefore, the book is somewhat predictible.Overall I gave it a 2."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"[ NOTE: possible spoilers below}-- the use of computers: HUGE flaw in the entire story, from the beginning. Computers are outright banned. Obviously, ships controls, communications, industry, and everything else requires complex computations only a computer could do. Yet technology that could ONLY be computer-aided/controlled is used throughout the entire set of books.-- The \\"satellite network\\" - what a joke! I think the writers had a brain failure during this entire concept. If the fleet knew of technology that could wipe out gelcircuitry, why wouldn't they use that technology at ground level to wipe them out there!? Use that technology at ground level instead of having it just sitting idle in space!-- If the network only destroyed gelcircuitry, why didn't the thinking machines just fire projectile explosives and destroy the satellites???-- the fact that THOUSANDS of millions of humans had been sacrificed before in the extermination of the machine worlds, yet the most IMPORTANT battle of all came to a halt because of THREE million? Billions of innocents were killed in less significant Synchronized Worlds before, but at the end, before the extermination of the most important world, the \\"command world\\" of the entire machine empire, humanity was going to stop their war because of 3 million innocents. The writers try to say that that final situation was different, but didn't explain why. Doesn't make sense!-- the fact that they were willing to risk all of humanity's future existance because they didn't want to kill the Serena clone and her child (although they ignorantly believed they were the real people) - when their ENTIRE LEGACY of Serena was that she was a martyr! ** someone who WILLINGLY sacrificed herself so that humanity could be free! If they truly believed this, they would have KNOWN that Serena would have DEMANDED her sacrifice by the fleet in order to destroy the machines, and that by risking humanity's future by not killing her along with the machines would have been something she would have UTTERLY opposed! It's like, they all revered her because she sacrificed herself for the future survival of her people, now they are risking EVERYTHING to allow that not to happen! ARRRR!!! For decades they worshipped her as someone who gave her life for them - but when given the chance to allow her death to ensure the final destruction of Omnius they don't take it!-- although the writers DO hint to something related to this by saying \\"If Rayna truly believed that the spirit of Saint Serena had appeared to her in a fever vision, then how could she believe the real Serena was still alive? It made no sense.\\" But the writers just leave it at that!.. these are just a small sample of the huge number of holes in the story. I make it a personal point to read EVERY word in a book, and to go back and re-read a page if I found that by the end of it I didn't absorb it well enough, but this was the first book in the series I found myself skimming though parts. I'm very disappointed that I read the entire series to have it the story fall apart at the end. Mind you, the previous books in this series were not on the same level as Brian Herbert's writings - but I accepted that before I began them.

The language is still stilted, the plot is sexist, and the use of names suspect (is Ticia pronounced Tisha or Teecha?--is one of many examples). If you were looking for ways in the which the authors would tie up loose ends so that we had a clear understanding of the roots of folding space, the Bene Gesserit, and other terms unique to Dune, they were done. Unfortunately, they were done either in the last 100 pages or spelled out so clearly that you didn't have to read ahead. A strong action story shouldn't be one where we know a forgone conclusion, but how we reach that point.Here are some specific concerns:*Erasmus, whose deeds were needlessly spelled out in gore, and who was the reason for the Jihad, died quietly. Dissapointing.*Abulrud, for no reason, changes his attitude as the good soldier. This was clearly not strong writing*The use of 2004 news and philosophy disturbed me the most. Human sheilds and religious zealots were not original.*The passion of Herbert's fremen was much stronger than Rayna, who the authors reminded us was \\"conflicted\\".

You also should be wary of comdeming something out of hand please read this book first(get it from the library)Overall-I'm going to read the orginal \\"Dune\\" agian bye."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"This is the last of a trilogy (Legends of Dune) that sets the stage for many of the key elements in the original Dune series. I read the first book (The Butlerian Jihad) in early 2005 and the second book (The Machine Crusade) in late 2006. I've also read the first two \\"house\\" prequels (House Atriedes and House Harkonnen) but I don't think that series is as good as this one.These are huge books (actually did them all on audio about 22 CDs each) but I can honestly say that I don't remember being bored at all while reading (listening to) them. In this trilogy you get the origins of the Mentat's, Suk Doctors, Spacing Guild, Swordmasters, the Atriedes-Harkonnen blood feud and the Bene Gessert!Many reviewers have skewered these books but really that is so predictable. If you want to read -Dune- then read -Dune-, don't pick up the author's son's attempt to recreate the magic with a chip on your shoulder ready to hate it. If you don't want to like it then you won't.The only negative thing I can say about this last book is that some of the origin stories were kind of crammed in at the end.Also Vorien's reaction to Abelard's attempt to save the hostages at the end didn't really ring true to me. It seems like Vorien would have mellowed out after everything was over and forgiven him but they need him to hate Abelard so that they could start the Atriedes-harkonnen feud."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"This was an excellent ending to the prequel trilogy. The whole series was riveting, entertaining and filled in a lot of the background for the famous Dune trilogy. The only shortfall is the slightly rushed ending to explain the origins of the Bene Geserit, the Guild navigators and the explanation of the convoluted animosity between house Atreides and House Harkonnen. But, this is just nit-picking, this book was a great ending for the prequel trilogy to Dune."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"Much like I thought for the first prequel triology, the Legends of Dune series concludes with a third story that doesn't quite wrap up the story, leaving large, vital chunks of the story in limbo.This series, however, ends on a worse note than the first. Unlike the first series, few of the characters here have shown any development, expect for the robot Erasmus. Second, almost all of the plot follows a confining, this, then that format, allowing for very little natural flow to the story or suspense.I found the Battle of Corrin to be another major disappointment, especially the supposed cowardice of Abulurd Harkonnen. Instead of a coward, he comes off as a tragic hero, and his hatred of the Atriedes seems justified.I suppose now Herbert and Anderson will work on the alleged Dune 7 found in the notes belonging to Frank Herbert. I can only hope they'll do better."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"This is a very contrived, unimaginative book. That's actually being mild and properly describes the first two books in this trilogy; this last book is just a total mess.First, the notion that every societal theme in the classic novel Dune started at the same time is preposterous. That's not how social evolution works--it isn't so neat and tidy.Second, the plot holes are enormous. As has been mentioned, the hero, Vorian Atreides is completely estranged from his sons yet somehow they carry on his name with pride along with his antipathy toward the Harkonnen. What's even more bizarre is it's only at the end of the book that Vorian adopts the hawk as his family symbol. But by that point, his descendents would easly be on their fourth or fifth generation and would number in the hundreds, if not thousands. Why would they adopt the symbol of a man who killed billions, even if against an equally deadly foe?And why, when Paul experiences his visions of the past, he doesn't remember the wars that killed billions and his own ancestral involvement? Wouldn't this have made him quite likely to accept the Golden Path Leto II later embarks on? (It also makes what Leto II did look simply tame by comparison.)The holes that really annoyed me, however, were about Omnius, the supposed genius thinking machine. Even with the folding ships, it still takes time to kill hundreds of planets and billions of people yet the main Omnius doesn't know about it? Exactly, what kind of idiotic system did he set up? Well, one that only a rather dense writer could invent. Here's the killer part; we have more fault tolerant computer systems today than Omnius. (We even have what are called rad-hardened chips which aren't susceptible to EM pulse.)The dumbest single thing, though, is what Omnius does once surrounded. He creates little robot destroyers straight out of the B movie Runaway. The smarter move would be to build robots with discrete circuits to A) manufacture new gel circuit brains and B) the knowledge to plant in those brains. At the very least, they would be smart enough to attack the shield around Corrin, rather than waste time killing people on distant worlds.Finally, the chapters on Arrakis make no sense and apparently exist solely to offer some connection to Dune.Do yourself a favor and skip this book. I'd even go so far as to suggest skipping all the books outside the original trilogy. But, if you haven't read any of them, at the very least read the original Dune--it is a true masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"These books were great. Are they as good as the original dune books? On the whole, no, but this isn't a case of one writer losing his voice, rather it's two wrtiers who have done a genuinely good job of piecing together the remnants of an awesome storyline. Buy this book, but accept it for what it is: a son trying to finish his father's masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"It was entertaining, and fun to read. However, I found the origin of the Atreides-Harkonnen feud somewhat lacking. I think the problem the authors ran into was making the Harkonnens so honorable that they couldn't think up a good way to start the feud, so we are left with a sub-average explanation. Another quibble I have is that they do not do a good enough job of tying up all the loose ends.*SPOILERS*For example, in the earlier books, one of the Omniuses (Omnii?) had sent copies of itself to as many unallied and unexplored plantes as it could think of. What happens to these probes, except the one that landed on Arakkis, is never explained.Also, near the end of The Battle of Corrin, Omnius broadcasts a copy of himself into deep space looking for something that would receive the signal, download him, and allow him to start anew. Again, we are never told what happens with this.Also, when Gilbertus Albans escapes Corrin with Erasmus's memory core, we are never told what happens to him or the core, beyond the obvious implication that he begins the schools of mentats.Much of the Cult of Serena's anti-technology fanaticism is ultimately not adopted, as we see from the later books where there is a substantial amount of technology. How does this jive with the apparent total victory of Rayna and her cult?Finally, what on earth happens to Vor? The man must have had centuries left to live, and we are left with the idea that he simply spends the rest of his days traveling the galaxy? How does he establish the Atreides as a powerful family with rule over Caladan? How do the Harkonnen take control over Geidi Prime and become the powerful and violent scourge they were in Paul's day?I suppose we'll have to be content not knowing the answers, unless, of course, the duo intends to write another series of prequels."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"6 reasons to read/ buy this book:1) You endured the Butlerian Jihad and Machine Crusade and now you just got to know how it all ends.2) You are related to the author/ publisher/ distributer and they are expecting feedback.3) You love bad dialogue and incredibly stupid characters who are doomed to repeat their mistakes over and over and over...4) You are insomniac.5) You like to throw big heavy books at people when you are mad and believe me there is plenty here to drive you mad.6) You may be one of the few people on the planet who might actually enjoy this book- there aren't many of you, but there are some."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"This is not Frank Herbert's writing, nor has it every been. The prequel's have been met with mixed reviews thus far and understandably so. This hopefully being the last of the prequel books it does quite a bit to tie up some ends and finally lead the way to the universe that Frank himself established. Like the previous books in this trilogy, the book largely focus's on the war itself and tries to execute the story from all the major sides and still mention the other asides as well. The division of the Zensunnis on Arrakis ties in nicely, but could have been explored further. The final steps that lead the Sorceresses of Rossak to turn to the Bene Gesseritt's are here. The further development of Norma Cenva's vision shows further groundwork being laid for the Guild. And ultimately, the book showcases how humanity's greatest hero's can lose site of their own humanity in the throes of war and the furver of religious persuasion. And this is where the book is at it's best. The religious furvor that ignites the Martyrists/Cultists and how the government and even the military bodies use it to bolster their own strength is showcased greatly. The turning of the mob from a blind raging chaos into something slightly focused, given the right words and right beliefs to hold onto is displayed well. The character of Vorian Atreides shows himself to be the hero to end the Jihad, but at what cost? And how much does this hero stand to lose in order to achieve total victory? The contradictions of war and a few other contradictions rear their heads.Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson do a nice job exploring those themes. They also do something that they've done throughout the entire Jihad trilogy- they don't have a bumbling idiot (Shaddam) and his scheming partner (Hasimir Fenrig) running around making trouble for everyone. That is one annoyance we could have done without in the first place, and I am glad to see that they realized their own mistake. Not to say there isn't some comedy; the conversation of the Corrin Omnius with two of its remaining Everminds from two other worlds is pretty funny, if not downright hysterical. And Erasmus is still good for the occasional chuckle, but deepens further in this book as well.On its own merits, the Battle of Corrin is solidly writ and a well told conclusion to a better prequel than the House books. While some questions still remain, and some of the answers are a little rushed, the book does well to end the story of the hundred plus year war against thinking machines. It's not Frank Herbert's writing, but it does work well to fill in the gaps and add even more richness to this already amazing universe. If you haven't liked the prequel books thus far, I don't expect this to change your mind. However, if you do enjoy them, then maybe, like me, you won't be so worried about the eventual Dune 7 release. In the meantime, enjoy the read."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"The main complaint I've had with this set of prequels were: the one dimensional characters (even the difference in the writing style didn't take away from the trilogy as much as the poor characters did). The House Trilogy was not brought down by this problem to the degree found in the Legends of Dune trilogy, as most of those characters were already established by Frank Herbert and Brian only had to take them from point A to B which what seems like the the help of a very detailed outline. But with the Legend Trilogy, it seems like Brian and Kevin were probably left mostly to their own means and sadly the readers were left with characters we didn't care about. Personally, I thought young Serena and Vorian were annoying and sometimes acted incomprehensibly (as well as the idiotic Rayna later on), didn't identify with Xavier (although I felt quite a bit of sympathy for him once I found out he was basically a good man and knowing how history would remember his family) and was completely disappointed in Ginjo's character development from a trustable leader to a corrupt politician.But over time, Vor grew on me and sort of endeared himself to me as we began to see in him the same things that would make the Atreides who they are (his way with his men, ability to make decisive decisions, hawk features and crest and mild cynism). Through him we also saw why things are the way that they are in Paul's time (the fate and destiny of the Butlers, why there were prohibitions against machines and basically why the Corrinos were allowed to take the throne when they were known to be corrupt). I would have liked to have seen from which one of Vor's descendants Paul came from, since there was such a big question mark at the end, whether the descendents of his twin sons would become the Atreides of classic Dune, or whether they'd come from a bastard line, or whether he'd properly settle down on Caladan with another girl and start the noble line. With the beginning of the feud, I found that he came out rather bitter Duke Leto style, something that we really didn't see coming, but then again, considering Abulard's actions, it probably was warranted. But still, I wish they'd gone into the depth of the betrayl, considering Abulard was the only person he treated as a son. I'm also beginning to wonder how history remembered Vorian? It must have, even if his own accomplishments were to be shadowed by later descends.For the sake of finding out how the political, social, genetic and economical structures of Dune were created, this book is worth a read even without there being any characters with the depth of Paul Atreides or his mother."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"Admittedly, it's been about twenty years since I read Dune, and I haven't read the first two volumes in this trilogy. So I don't have the same basis for criticism as some other reviewers. (Some of whom seem to have a screen saver of the Herbert universe on their minds.) But I greatly enjoyed this book. (Or series of tapes, I should say.) I often found myself leaving the car running after I'd arrived at my destination, to hear more. The worlds were perhaps unimaginative -- no local color, really -- but this is a story about people and machines, not a galactic tour. But I still found myself drawn into this strange, yet familiar, alternate world. I don't recall that Dune was THAT much better. Maybe some of the other reviewers are just burned out."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"The long slide of this series into the literary toilet finally ended in a splash. I mostly enjoyed the first prequels, shortly before the time of \\"Dune\\". But these super-early prequels, thousands of years before \\"Dune\\", have started poorly and ended dreadfully.The dialogue is dreadful. Compare it - and the writing in general - to the dense, subtle prose of Frank Herbert. No comparison. This is the kind of writing you expect from wannabe's, not established authors.The plot developments are simply unbelievable. Almost every aspect of the later \\"Dune\\" mythology is the result of a stupid accident? Oh please. The different story lines do not all mesh well, except insofar as they represent lame attempts to establish \\"what comes later\\". Many story develops \\"just happen\\" with almost no logic or slow development.Characterization - with a few exceptions, such as Vorian Atreides and Erasmus - is atrocious. Completely incredible is how/why Abulurd Harkonnen changes heart at the Battle of Corrin, resulting in the infamous \\"betrayal at the bridge\\" we hear so much about later. We can nuke billions but at the last critical moment we refuse to sacrifice 2 million humans? Not believable at all, given how the characters had hitherto developed. People make decisions that are almost random and completely incomprehensible.There is an odd preoccupation with body parts and fluids and such along with the oddly overdrawn descriptions of people dying horribly and violently. The result is a cartoonish caricature that distracts more than it helps move the story.Finally - notice how the story moves almost too quickly, a frantic pace, short stocatto conversations without emotion so that *suddenly* this happens, *suddenly* that decision is made - the final conquest of Corrin really only takes up a handful of pages. Wow. Wonder how it happened? These guys barely take the time to tell us.I can't believe I spent good money on the hardback edition. What a waste. Should have waited for the library copy."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"I haven't read Dune because I haven't gotten to it yet. Therefore, the previous reviews slamming this book because it is 'NOT DUNE' hasn't stopped me from reading any of the prequels.It's a space opera, plain and simple - and it's a GOOD one. I do think the authors tend to repeat themselves a bit and I did find myself glazing over during some of the introspective passages but generally, my imagination was caught in a tractor beam for the duration of my reading.Now, I'm going to invalidate anything I've just said: I grew impatient and read the next book's cliff notes on Wikipedia so I can skip ahead. I'm excited to read the original novels and the prequels were meant to give me the setup. The skipping ahead may have been a result of some real life pressures that have made me impatient and I was also disappointed with the Kindle Price.If you have the patience, I recommend reading the prequels. The stories are fantastic but the characters are relatable and I continually find myself rooting for both sides of the conflict. The periods of total immersion in another time and philosophy experienced by picking up these individual novels make the trip worthwhile. The key (generally & specifically when reading prequels) is to forget the bigger picture and series. Just enjoy the ride."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"A little bit of an improvement on the last book in this series. I suppose some people may like these more than the denser Frank Herbert works. Maybe someone from Dimension X, or a Martian algae-beast.

What exactly motivated Abulurd to betray ideals and values that he had shared with Vorian for the better part of the preceding 2 decades?

While Kevin and Brian don't have the overarching and deeply philisopical points to their story like Frank Herbert did they do a fair job on telling a good tale and getting in some background. As for providing information on different things, it would be very difficult for them in a 3 novel series to cover hundreds of years of information after the war but they do provide good insite into many of the instituions in the later Dune novels. Just waiting for Dune 7 and will not be surprised if the Return is because of an Omnius incarnation and religious war is once again spread across the galaxy."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"I don't understand the negative reviews of this book. Anybody who reads this has already read the first two books in this series so should already know what he or she will find here. Sure, the characters are one-dimensional and the dialogue wooden, but you knew that already. The situations are moderately interesting and the writing competent, if uninspired. And, as far as new Dune books go, this is as good as it gets. Literally. Unlike other science fiction franchises such as Star Wars, where there are a large number of writers of variable talent at work, Anderson and Herbert are it as far as the Dune universe goes. It's them or nothing.So, take this book for what it is, a moderately entertaining addition to a once-great series. Try not to think too much about what might have been and enjoy what we have."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"I did not buy this book for myself, I borrowed it from my son for whom it was bought as a birthday present; he now has the entire DUNE saga.I think my title summed it up really. This is an appalling book, where Anderson and Herbert have tried to conclude the storylines is some logical way that will lead into the \\"House of\\" trilogy. The characters are one-dimensional, the violence gratuitous and the behaviour crass.I fought on to the very unclimactic end. I cared not for a single person in the book. My emotions remained unchallenged apart from mind-numbing boredom.How on Earth could such drivel be extended to 600+ pages? About 100 could have wrapped it up quite succinctly.I'm truly sorry to say the machines deserved to win. The humans in this book are ignorant self-indulgent shadows.Please do not buy this book, it will only encourage more rubbish like it to be inflicted on us."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"This is the final installament of the Legends of Dune prequels?I was not too impressed with the House Trilogy Kevin J. Anderson and Brian Herbert did that ends about 15 years before the original Dune. I liked the first 2 books well enough, but the third book just really disappointed me. The inconsistancies with Frank Herberts Dune were glaring for me. For example, Gurney Halleck owes his loyalty to Duke Leto Atreides because Leto saves his life in the Harkonnen slave mines/pits-in the House Trilogy Gurney hides in a shipment of glass that inadvertently ends up on Caladan. Gurney did not even know who Leto was nor did Leto know who Gurney was. They actually meet through a mutual friend. Which is fine, but kills the relationship for the first 3 original Dune novels. Stupid little slips like that made me dislike the House Trilogy novels.In the Kevin J Anderson and Brian Herbert novels much detail is given, but no suspense is built, everything is spelled out for you-no thinking required. It is the spirit of how Frank Herbert wrote and it is unfair to expect K.J.A and B.H. to be able to copy that-but I am disappointed none the less. It is difficult to write in a well known world and not make errors-especially when it is not the world you created.When I heard that Kevin J. Anderson and Brian Herbert were doing Dune novels set during the time of the Butlerian Jihad I was very excited. I figured with them going so far into the past it would not matter that much if the story had alot of inconsistancies-many records were lost from that time period anyway. I figured I would be able to enjoy novels set in the Dune universe and, since I am not attached to any of the characters in the novel, who cares how K.J.A. and B.H. portray them. Plus many questions could be answered:How did the feud begin between House Atreides and House Harrkonen?How did the Spacing Guild get its beginning?How did the Bene Gesserit begin?How was the first Mentat developed?The ground work for all of those questions to be answered was laid out splendidly in the first book-The Butlerian Jihad. The groundwork was being laid for the answers to the questions I had about the Spacing Guild, the Butlerian Jihad, The Fremen, the Bene Gesserit, the strict ban on thinking machines. Sadly, the second and third book focused mostly on wars and fighting. It did answer the questions but in a very unsatisfactory way-I was hoping for brie and wine followed by prime rib and chocolate mousse and instead got cheese whiz on ritz crackers with Boones Farm followed by salisbury steak and instant jello pudding.All in all I highly reccomend reading it for any fan of the Dune novels. I am still looking forward to book 7 which they will supposedly start now. I am sure they will botch the attempt but supposedly Frank Herbert left a rough draft and perhaps they will gently change that."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"This book isn't the best in this 3-book window that is reserved for House Harkkonen, but this is a good informative and interesting addition to the tale of Dune.

The ending of this book leaves open the possibility of continuing the story surrounding Omnius and Erasmus. I believe they will make an appearance in Dune 7 and 8.

It was too much, just 1 example here, to bite off as forced plot elements \\"mystical\\" spring water suddenly revealing to one individual many of the key powers of the Bene Gesserit (sp).

As with the others this book is a prequel to the original books. The thrust of the series is to provide back story on the various factions in the original book; Fremen, Bene Gesserit, Guild, Mentats, Corrino, Atriedes, Harkonnen, etc. This book does not fail there. I found the Guild the most interesting, but that's just my own opinion.The stories are woven into a fairly uneven story about the destruction of the machine worlds. It's divided into to parts, each with an independent climax that, in both cases, neglects some of the characters almost completely.It's easy to see how this book is drawing parallels to our present situation. In particular the Bush administrations war in Iraq. That's an interesting, if simplistic, side of the book.The entire series of Brian Herbert Dune books is written very different from the original Dune masterpiece. The language is less sharp, the characters less cleanly drawn and more two-dimensional.These are fun light reads though, particularly for those Dune addicts out there who can't get enough of seeing the names of their favorite houses n print."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"Thank you, thank you.

There are a lot of extraneous stories that could be taken from these books and written into whole novels themselves. I especially think the formation of the Cymeks was interesting and how they came to be."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"The history of the computer jihad is brought to a triumphant conclusion in this final chapter of the Legends of Dune trilogy. The computer evermind Ominus still controls half of the known worlds, while the humans (or hrethgir as the computers like to call them) control the other half. The Cymeks have been reduced in power so much that they are almost irrelevant, and for the most part do not come into play until the end of the book. The computers and humans have fought to a stand still, and for sixty five years neither one has been able to gain an advantage over the other. That is until with the help of a deranged human, the computers release a plaque upon all of humanity. The intent was to weaken the human population so much so that they would be unable to stand up against the machine onslaught that was to follow. Forty percent of the human population dies from the plaque and millions more die from the repercussions that follow. Out of this rubble rises a cult lead by one of the Butler's (or Harkonnen's) nieces, Rayna Butler. The cult at first goes about destroying all computers with gel circuitry (meaning the ones that can think for themselves), but then when they become more fanatical they turn their vengeance on destroying all computers in general, even the ones that are being used for good. Even if humanity is able to recover in time to stop the onslaught from the computers, they may still find themselves set back to the dark ages, as all knowledge that was being stored on the computers is lost.In order to avert this set back, Humanity, in many different forms tries to raise itself to a new level of being.On Rosak the sorceresses there had started a genealogy project to help keep track of the best samples of all of humanity in case entire races were wiped out by the plaque. In all of the previous Dune books that I had ever read I had always found the Bene Gesserits to be selfish in my opinion. I always thought that all of their gene manipulation was an attempt to try to create the perfect human, or champion for themselves so that they could rule the world. In this book however, for the first time you are shown their intentions in a more noble light in that they are trying to reach a new level of humanity in order to help keep it from becoming extinct.On Ginaz the swordmasters there continue to perfect their training so that their minds and bodies can react faster than a computers.Mohandas Suk becomes a famous doctor by setting up a universal hospital to try to find a cure for the plague, and with the help of Vorian Atreides' daughter Raquella Berto-Anirul, they draw upon the knowledge of all the world doctors to make great strides in medicine.The evil robot Erasmus is still around, and he teaches his human prot&eacute;g&eacute; (or son) Gilbertus how to organize his thoughts and mind in such a way that he can reach a level comparable with that of a computer. Erasmus begins to call him his mentat.It is at this time that it is discovered that the only ones who do not seem to be effected by the plague are those who have been eating melage on a regular basis. The demand for spice becomes astronomical. Since spice can only be found on Arakis, it is at this point that this planet starts to take on great importance in the world.People began consuming spice in larger quantities than they had ever eaten previously. For some special individuals it begins to change them.By consuming large quantities of spice gas the navigator is born. This is a creature that was once human, but now has the ability to look into the future to safely guide a ship through space.On Rosak the sorceresses are especially affected as a second plague is released upon them worse then the first. With a combination of increased spice intake mixed with the unique minerals that are only found in the jungles of Rosak, the first mother superior is developed in what turns out to be a new line of Bene Gesserits. Besides being able to use their bodies as a weapon, they have now developed the ability to control their internal body chemistry as well. The first signs of using \\"voice\\" are also noted. The mother superior can also see into the future as well as into the past, and draw upon knowledge from her female ancestors.While the humans are trying to reach this higher level of being, some of the computers seem to take on more human qualities. Chirox, the computer fighting mek who has been training human swordmasters for years proves to be more noble than the majority of humans who are part of the cult. The Robot Erasmus who had spent years torturing humans now takes on a new respect for them after he develops a sense of love for his prot&eacute;g&eacute; and starts to think of him as his son. Even the evermind Omnious takes on a love of art (even though he isn't very good at it).The question seems to come down to whether humans are capable of scarifying billions of lives in order to avoid extinction, and still maintain their humanity. Vorian Atreides who has been one of the constants through out this trilogy is given the main task of dealing with this moral dilemma, along with Abulurd Butler (Harkonnen) who for the most part in this story has looked up to Vorian as a type of father figure. The results of this outcome sets the stage for the conflicts that follow between the Atreides and Harkonnens for the next millennium.Family relationships are also a constant throughout these books. The father/son relationships are the most prevalent, but there are many other mother/daughter, father/daughter, mother/son relationships as well that really take this book to a higher level. I would rank this as one of the best books I've ever read. It looks like Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson might try to pick up the series next after Frank Herbert's \\"Chapterhouse: Dune\\". Based on how they ended this series I believe they are now in a good position to accomplish that and move the story forward to new ground. I look forward to seeing what follows."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"I have not read it yet as I have so many Dune books to get through.

But the book has a weak ending. When you read about the last big fight against the thinking machines your realize the story doesn't hold up. Humankind could have easily have defeated the machines without bloodshed long before the last battle.Also in the last chapters a lot of characters alters their persona and you do get the feeling that it is a little rushed just to get to the ending.But disregarding that, this was a good book to get the background on the houses and organizations that is part of the Dune Universe.

No clear start, middle or end to the story."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"As mentioned in my previous reviews of the Butlerian Jihad and The Machine Crusade, I will not hammer on about how this book/series does not stack up against Frank Herbert's work.Now that I just finished with The Battle of Corrin, I will say that it was not the best book ever, but not the worst either. The story just plods and plods along until about the last 150 pages where it all comes together. Nothing ground breaking.Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson have an irritating tendency to re-explain everything about a character that I just read about in the last book. It is as if they chose to write each book to stand on its own (just in case someone does not read the entire series - most likely, anyone who reads this book will have already read the last two) I hope that they do not continue this trend with Hunters and Sandworms of Dune.I was eager to find out the origins of the Atredies/Harkonnen fude, but was disappointed with it once I found out.Rayna Butler and her whole crusade against machines is an element that could have used a lot more depth...I got the feeling that I was reading the script for Joan of Arc (a dumb movie in my opinion).That being said, I am glad that I made it all the way through. I now know the origins of many of the myths and constructs in the original series. However, I most likely will never read it again (like I will with the classic dune series over and over and over again)3 out of 5 stars for the book, 3.5 out of 5 stars for the whole series.P.S. The most gripping portion of the whole book are the excerpts from Road to Dune where we see some deleted scenes from dune...to think, the scenes that made it to the scrap heap from the original were more thought provoking than the entire series."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"Now this is one of those books that fan boys are going to hate simply because it isn't the original. These are the same kind of people that write fan fiction and don't understand why the publishing companies aren't holding contests to let random fans write the ending.This is the last of the prequels and it does a fine job of setting down the Harkonnen/Atreides rivalry (interestingly enough the Harkonnens come out the moral superiors), the birth of the bene gesserit, the discovery of spice's powers, the mentats and the last battle of the Butlerian Jihad which started the Corrino Dynasty. While Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson aren't completely up for the task of imitating Frank Herbert, they don't even attempt it. Sure, all the material about ecology, religious tyranny and political corruption is in this book, but where Frank Herbert set down philosophic texts (God Emporer had absolutely nothing happen until the last five pages but it was still a great read) BH and KJA have written a space opera.And as far as space operas go, it's pretty darn good.Besides that, it reminded me of the same excitement that I felt when I first read Dune Messiah and realized that Herbert wasn't going to be writing an ode to heroic religious types but a complicated epic. The Herbert originals are better, but these make a fine addition to the series."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"Like several other reviews for this product, this review is more a review for the entire trilogy than for the Battle of Corrin in particular.I like the Dune series a lot. The first book by Frank Herbert is one of the greatest sci-fi/fantasy novels of all time. I say \\"fantasy\\" because as a work of \\"soft\\" sci-fi, Dune displays many characteristics of fantasy.Although I contend that Frank Herbert never managed to recapture the greatness of the original in the later books, there is no doubt that he was a tremendously intelligent and skilled writer. His talent still shines in Dune Messiah through Chapterhouse.The Butlerian Jihad had a lot of potential to be made into a great story. I do not pretend to know how Frank Herbert would have handled this subject matter if at all so I'll try to critique this series on its own merits. Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson are NOT good writers. The writing throughout this trilogy is very, very bland. The characters are numerous but the characterisation falls flat (in part because of a very detached narrative style that doesn't allow the reader to peer into the characters' heads).Besides being boring, the writing also comes off as lazy. The authors use vague adjectives rather than vivid imagery. They use too many similes that start with \\"like...\\" I felt that certain descriptions that would have been interesting to the reader if done in-depth were glossed over because an in-depth job would have required more effort. There are also a number of questionable plot elements. Omnius, a supreme AI that exists thousands of years in the future, is more an example of artificial stupidity than anything else. Instead of being a sprawling, non-tangible network, Omnius conveniently has a nexus housed in a few buildings ready to be blown up. Humans employ swordmasters who use \\"pulse swords\\" (the weapons are only vaguely described) to fight war mechs in melee combat. Even assuming that the robots are not armed with rapid-fire ranged weaponry, this idea is just plain idiotic. Sadly a number of scenes from the series are corny or unintentionally funny, a few examples: the way Vorian kills Agamemnon undermines the latter's status as the leader of the \\"Titans\\" (who might as well be re-named the Morons). The death of Beowulf is similarly comical. Xavier and Serena's outdoor love scene is weird and unneccessary, etc.I give the series one star because Amazon doesn't allow 0 stars and because it might provide popcorn entertainment to some readers (though I personally found the series to be terribly boring)."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"Oh, for proper editing. I am a long term Dune fan having read the original back in high school long, long ago. Frank Herbert had the remarkable imagination to make up histories, societies, cultures and religions. I can still go back to the first three Dune novels and marvel. Many scenes are still etched in memory. I have read all the foregoing Dune prequels. None are memorable. Much of the dialog is contrived. In as much as they worked some off of Dad's notes they fill in the some of the history. Battle for Corrin is another plodding addition. Why, oh, why does every character have to be reintroduced every chapter at the expense of true development? Why does prequel history have to be reiterated over and over? Why does the language have to be so stilted. This series could have been half the size with twice the pacing. It is almost as if the authors do not trust their audiences' intelligence. Nostalgically I want to like it, but it is hard to maintain attention. Much like director's cut DVDs, the whole trilogy could do with combining into one manuscript, severely editing redundancy and working out the plot holes. Then divide it into 2 or 3 much shorter, punchier, more logical books. Not likely to happen."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"This is actually more a review for the whole trilogy than just this one book...This trilogy is a better read than the two horrid books that the Hacks Twain wrote for Dune 7. Despite that, this trilogy contains a good amount of retcons from the original Dune Novels and the Encyclopedia.Here in this trilogy, the foundation of the Bene Gesserit School of Thought and the Suk Medical school doesn't quite work. If the Sorceresses of Rossak valued psychic powers so highly, you'd have thought that the BG of Dune and afterwards would have telekinetic ability passed down through at least some of their bloodlines. Franky, Brian and Kevin's version of the origins of the BG just did not work at all.The Titans were an unnecessary addition to the Butlerian Jihad saga. One would think that people would still become cymeks after this, since they don't count as AI. There are other inconsistencies between the Butlerian Jihad trilogy and Frank Herbert's Dune books. The only thing that really worked for me was what the Tleilaxu did, and how that gained them a poor reputation among the other races.The Arrakis-centered storyline also didn't swing for me. Too much was put in personal drama, and not enough about spice. The entire storyline did not feel well-thought out to me.What bothered me most about the trilogy was the character of Serena Butler. Canonically, this character should be named Jehanne. What is wrong with Serena is that she carries the traits of a Mary-Sue... just about one of the worst things you can do in fanfiction. That's right, FANfiction. This trilogy, along with the other Dune books that Brian and Kevin wrote are all fanfiction and should not be regarded as any higher. I mean, come on. Beautiful? Purple eyes? Young and intelligent? Talented? Serena has all of these traits, and later on she suffers a horrible loss and becomes a martyr and everyone mourns for her, just like how crappy fanfiction authors write their Mary Sues.Don't even get me started on Norma Cenva and Aurelius Venport. More hogwash. And the whole Butler family sidestory was another huge and unneccessary side-addition to this story.Frank Herbert could have written about the entire Jihad in ONE book. Maybe two, if Frank had a lot of ideas. But whatever he would have done, it would have been a thousand times better than what his son and supposed number one fan have written together, or will ever."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"If you have ever had that feeling after watching a movie, where you tell yourself,i cannot believe i watched the entire movie.That is how i felt after i completed reading this novel. I kept hoping the plot would improve, and it never did. I get the impression the authors struggled for material for this third edition. The focus of the story seemed disconnected at times from the true plot of Dune."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"Finally this series is over and I can breathe a deep sigh of relief. This book, like the others was an absolute chore to read. I've said it before, and unfortunately I have to say it again: TOO MUCH REPETITION.In every single chapter, you're absolutely bombarded with repetition, and I'm not sure why. I specifically remember that about half way through the book, the authors go to great lengths to say 19 years had passed, on three seperate occasions. This happened in two consecutive chapters. I may not have the best memory, but that's just insulting.I'm not sure what happened with the character development in this book. Everyone just kind of seems to be in limbo. I felt like so much attention was being given to the \\"Universe Changing Events\\" that the authors lose focus on their initial characters, who had great potential. The characters were what drew me into the story to begin with.I was very excited to finally learn why the Harkonnens had been labeled traitors, and why they hated the Atreides so much. Unfortunately, I feel like more questions were rasied than answers. As someone else said, you end up feeling bad for the Harkonnens, which is unfortunate, especially since it seemed like Abulurd Harkonnen was trying to do the right thing.I'm so torn about this novel. I liked the ideas, and the concepts, and I'm always a fan of origin stories. I guess my issue was more with the way it was written than the topic."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"Having gone through 5 prequel books I wanted to read this volume. Unfortunately, it is exceedingly difficult to get through.Plot and characterization are extremely shallow. Many things are repetitious. Not only the story and explanations, but even choice of words. For instance, if you see the word javelin, you just now that it's going to be paired with balista.As it is, apart from subject-matter, to me it has very little to do with the original series. And although it was never to be expected that it would, considering the sheer genius of the original series, it could have had such better treatment than it has got here.Viewed for and by itself as a book of science ficton, it just does not come up to par."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"I could not have been more excited when I heard that an hier would be writing a prequel to the Dune books telling the story of the Bulterian Jihad. I purposefully stayed away from the three Great House books, because I thought that they would not live up to the majesty of F. Herbert's creation. I also dared to dream that B. Herbert and Anderson had worked out the kinks, and were ready to settle down and give us some good Dune canon. How wrong I was.That is not to say that the three books were terrible and unreadable. From a plot standpoint the Bulterian Jihad was pretty good. The next two were not as good, but were readable. I think my biggest problem with the books, including this one, was that as time went on they read more and more like the results of a contractual obligation to produce at the bare minimum, some words on paper. The books lacked any attempt to tell the story from a social perspective, and instead relied on the individual perceptions characters which were not all that well developed. In my opinion, this is why these books do not fit well with the F. Herbert books. They are just space opera fodder with a rather bland description of what happens, with no comment on why, or what the ramifications are. If the books had at least had that, then I would have been happy to include them on the shelf with the good ones, despite the fact that the authors failed in all the ways these various reviews mention.I will give them one more chance with Book 7, Hunters of Dune. But if it is as bad as these, I will re-write it for them for free!"},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"This was my first foray into the works of Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson (I haven't read the other books in this series), and perhaps my expectations were too high, because I was very disappointed. \\"Battle of Corrin\\" reads like an exceptionally dry history textbook -- \\"character A traveled to this place, character B attacked that place\\" -- with character development so cursory that it can hardly even be called two-dimensional. The players in the book keep performing actions that are either so maladroit, or so at odds with their own personalities, that eventually it becomes impossible for the reader to suspend disbelief. Nothing makes sense and there is no sense of underlying intrigue or development to keep the reader motivated. About halfway through the book I resigned myself to skimming through the remainder to look for any interesting snippets. I wish I could say something more positive -- it would've been wonderful to have a compelling successor (or in this case prequel). I do applaud the authors for having a go at what would have really been a monumental writing task for anyone."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"At no time have I expected the work of Frank H to be recreated. I did read all the Houses books (which, are better than the Legends series), and once I started the Legends I felt obligated to finish. No reason whatsoever these should have taken three books. A good editor could have made this one decent novel. If the point was to show where all the parts of Dune originated (bene g's, mentats, guild, et al), why did they finally come together in a rush in the last 100 pages of a trilogy? Talk about folding space to make the stars line up!One point about possible \\"liberally borrowing from other works\\". I just read HG Wells \\"War of the Worlds\\". The discription of the martians in their machines is VERY much like how the Cymeks and Titans are discribed. Oh well.I fear for the sequel to \\"ChapterHouse\\" that they are puportedly writing. Hope and pray for an editor."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"The Battle of Corrin is the final installment of a trilogy, a prequel of sorts ostensibly based on the notes and writings of Frank Herbert. For those of you that don't know, trilogy takes place ten thousand years before the time of originator Frank Herbert's immensely popular book, Dune. It is a collaboration between Brian Herbert (Frank's son) and Kevin Anderson. It is the sixth book co-written by these authors that I know of, having just finished another trilogy/prequel, The House series (House Atriedes, Harkonnen and Corrin).Unlike some other reviewers, I found this trilogy to be exceptional. I believe they may be Herbert/Anderson's most accomplished manuscripts. I finally got to experience the distant past, which was vaguely alluded to in Herbert's original Dune series. We get to meet the beautiful, compassionate Serena Butler, who's young son, the murder of which, set off the rebellion, which eventually after sixty-five years brought down the heartless thinking machines. We also meet distant relatives of Baron Harkonnen - Xavier (who is a good and honorable person) then Abulurd and Paul Atriedes - Vorian (the son of the wicked Titan, Agamemnon {a thousand year old human brain in a robot body})and Tio Holtzman (the revered inventor of the Holtzman Effect and other inventions). We experience the last stronghold of free humanity, with The League of Nobles, the fledgling exportation of the spice melange from Arrakis and the precursor of the Bene Gesserit, in the Sorceress's of Rossak. In the final story the pieces start to come together that were the basis for Dune some ten thousand years later as the groundwork is laid for the Harkonnen/Atriedes feud as well as the space guild and mentatsAs with the original Dune, the authors create numerous civilizations in a Universe dwelling on millions of planets and then embellish it with devious evil characters and their requisite counterpoints. It may be ten thousand years in the past from Dune but they are every bit as advanced to us, as we are to Cro Magnon Man.ConclusionPersonally, I cannot understand why so many readers want to burn this series at the stake. I found this book, consisting of 704 pages, to be an riveting read. True, the chapters are numerous and short but the story is ambitious so it couldn't be overly detailed, or the book would have been unwieldy. We are, after all, talking about a Universal Epic in which the authors followed about fifteen main characters on six different planets and in space. As with Dune we are treated to an excellent page turning science fiction novel with religious undertones.As a reader it seems to be in vogue to criticize this trilogy. As a writer I can tell you that these authors did a wonderful job of juggling this very complex story and telling the story without being confusing and finally closing an open chapter of the Dune Saga. Personally I am in awe of their accomplishment.I suggest that you read this with an open mind and don't pre judge these books. No, it's not as good as Dune but neither were the elder Herbert's following works. The bottom line is this is a good piece of science fiction in this day when Fantasy has taken over the genre."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"Having read the two previous (and all other Dune) books, this was disappointing. The characters were more one-dimensional than in the two previous books, the motivations simplistic, the plot less complex and more obviously contrived and directed toward the needed ending. Perhaps most symbolic, there was an unforgiveable error in the year dating the first part of the book; while it should have been printed as 107 B.G., it was written as 69 B.G. This is representative of the thin, poorly thought out nature of the book."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"I have to say I was somewhat disappointed with the whole book. Don't get me wrong, it was a huge effort to get the stories right and to take over Frank Herbert's Dune story, however, something was lacking. I felt like I was being led blindfolded through a maze of stitched up brainstormed ideas. Caution though, SPOILERS BELOW (sorry!).1. The characters were too shallow and 2 dimensional with colorfully added titles like Supreme Bashar, Primero, Viceroy etc. Do we really need all that? It makes the whole book almost (God Forbid!) Star Wars-like! I could even start drawing parallels, Omnius is to Emperor Palpatine as Vorian Atreides is to Luke Skywalker?2. The House Harkonnen/Atreides feud started like that? Gee, and I thought my cats and dogs had better fights! A minor military disagreement that ended up as a murderous feud between the bloodlines? This was the feud that I was actually looking forward to finding out how it started. It ended up as rumors, gossips, myths and fables handed down through generations. Romeo and Juliet anyone? A plague on both their houses literally!3. The plague was only scratching the surface of the story. If Omnius wanted the humans wiped out, it would have been 100% mortality not just 43% +/-! I would have thought something more devious, like a gene-select bioweapon that targets selective genes like good eyesight, intelligence, body mass etc. Or something that targetted and killed off the females, so the males wouldn't have breeding partners and would die off naturally. But I guess the Dune universe had to survive somehow. The pirahna mites were a huge joke, I think they ran out of ideas.4. 20 years and the machines couldn't find a way to destroy the Holtzmann satellites that imprisoned them? Come on! What about some new faster than fold space ships? Omnius couldn't even develop that? If the Ixians could build no-ships, and Omnius couldn't, then it isn't as smart a thinking machine as we think it is! No wonder humanity destroyed it!(or did they? hmm...)5. Agamemnon was foolish enough to trust Vorian to remove his brain canister from his walker body? I really find that very, very hard to believe, seriously!Well, I guess through all that, we find out the origins of the Spacing Guild. How the Mentats were founded, although it was too convenient! The beginnings of the Bene Gesserit. And how Corrinos and Harkonnens are actually the same bloodline!Still, I'm looking forward to BH & KJA ending our eternal wait (torment) for Dune 7. I pray it will have more depth and surprises than these prequels."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"Simply put, there are too many plot lines in this trilogy that don't make sense. For example, what is the purpose of Hecate? She comes back to fight for the humans, only to have her brain fried by a human (in a misunderstanding). Worse, not only does Hecate get fried, by The Sorceress, Venkee, and Noret all get killed at the same time. For what? What is the point? Frankly, it seems like the author was planning to jump ahead in time in book three and needed to quickly resolve the lives of many characters. That is likely why Xavier, Serena, and Ginjo all get smoked at about the same time as well.Also, what about how Omnius uses the technology of Gedei Prime to launch those probes in to space? They were never mentioned again, but the purpose was to create new sychronized words far out in the galaxy. What ever happened to that plot line? Also, why couldn't the machines figure it out themselves? Why did they need human technology. The whole thing seems silly.Another source of annoyance was the authors apparent insistance on approaching these books from the perspective of moral relativism. The thinking machines keep humans as slaves, but so do the humans. Gee... the humans are no better than the machines. In case you don't get the point yourself, the author takes numerous opportunities in each book to beat it in to you.Oh, and lets not forget the outrageously stupid military blunder that dooms the thinking machines. Omnius pulls practically ALL machines away from every planet and collects them all at Corrin. Then Omius launches them toward Salusa, leaving the entire sychronized empire wide open to attack for a period of months. Given, Omnius apparently did not know about the human's space folding technology, but come on!!! Are you kidding me?"},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"I just finished reading this \\"Dune\\" book and I have to say I am perplexed. It was mindless entertainment, but I can't count it as good for that very reason. Dune fans have grown up with a series that is steeped in complexities and three dimmensional characters and this is the very thing that keeps us coming back to the series. The original Dune books, while entertaining, all had meaning. This book doesn't. It seems to squander all its potentiality to create real people by limiting their appearences to mere soundbites. In fact the only characters who seem to have been well developed are the robots, simply because there isn't really that much to them. Overall, if you're a Dune fan, you'l act exactly like me. You'll rush out and buy the book, excitedly start to read it-grasping for the sparks of the original series- and ultimatly walk away dissatisfied.AD"},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"I reviewed the first book in this series and really pounded it! The second wasn't really any better.This book was actually bearable though! Don't get me wrong, this is no Frank Herbert. The characters aren't developed nearly to the degree his father did but there has been some growth noticible. Erasmus actually developed by the end of this book. If anything I would say Erasmus is the only character to have had significant growth at all in the entire series. As evil as he could be I was actually concerned when it appeared his end was near. Most of the other characters were still pretty wooden.The danger of unchecked hipocritical extremist religion is also accurately portrayed, and how it can brush asiide all reason and social order. The Cult of Serena was well handled by the authors.The depiction of the duplicitous natures of politicians and religious leaders was well described. It was also interesting to see how these leaders became what they were. Truly power corrupts.I find it hard to believe that Abulurd Harkonnen would have done what he did, but somehow the fued needed to start. This could have been done better and more believably. After seeing 2/3 of the human population eliminated by the machines I doubt he would have hesitated at sacraficing 2 million slaves to forever eliminate the threat of Omnius.Omnius will be back in the end, that seems clear. The Thinking Machines are chasing the Honored Matres, or at least that is what happears to be implied by the end of this book and the end of the original series. The method by which Omnius saved itself was pretty good. I wonder though if that was really Frank Herbert's intent...Too many things were tied up with a neat bow by the end of the book. The formation of the Guild, Mentats, Bene Gesserit, etc. Not everything from the original series needed to be esatblished in the course of the 100 years coverred in this series.Overall the book and its writing is an improvement on the previous ones. It is passable sci-fi and makes attempts to cover the deeper issues of the originals. In that it is lacking, but judged on its own it was a good read."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"I liked this book best of any of the Brian Herbert prequels.

Jihad leader Varian Atreides claims rival Abulurd Harkonnen acted cowardly; thus both major houses are ready to battle one another at a time when unity is the only hope. Others have split apart seeking solace in enclaves by forming a sorceress based sisterhood and the Freemen of Dune. The future looks bleak for mankind.Dune fans will appreciate the final tale in the Legends of Dune trilogy (see THE BUTLERIAN JIHAD and THE MACHINE CRUSADE) that is based on references from Frank Herbert's original 1960s novels. The story line is relatively fast-paced (at least for a Dune tale), but also contains the typical mythos-religious blending that is a series trademark). The cast seems two dimensional whether they are human or machine (no Johnny Five is alive amongst this crowd) except perhaps the heated rivalry that adds depth to Varian and Abulurd, but only when they are together in some context. Still readers will enjoy the final act of survival prequels to the Dune dynasty.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"I have ripped through all Brian Herbert's and Keviin Anderson's Dune books, I only finish books when they are so good I can't put them down, this is the only series where I had the next book lined up ready to go, so I wouldn't be without the next Dune story. I have read negative reviews and can't understand them. I read all the original Dune books and only loved the first one and \\"God Emperor of Dune.\\" All the other books I just read hoping they get interesting. This might be my favorite Brian and Kevin book."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"I enjoyed all the first seven books written by Frank Herbert and a number of the books that followed by his son and collaborator, but this one, as well as the one that follows it -- Hunters of Dune -- are too distasteful to me to read at all. There were a couple before this that were hard to read but worse came to worse with this one and with Hunters of Dune. I simply cannot stand reading them. They are both so full of grotesque imagery, torture, etc. I am HOPING some of the following books are better because after enjoying the first ten books I purchased the entire set thinking I was going to like them all. Big disappointment. I would MUCH rather read the character studies and such I got from the previous books."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"As the Legends of Dune trilogy concludes, authors Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson tie up numerous plot threads and clarify the origins of many elements of Frank Herbert's Dune universe, such as humanity's revulsion of \\"thinking machines,\\" the Atreides/Harkonnen rivalry, the Fremen, the Spacing Guild, and the Bene Gesserit.This is a very polarizing series. The number of votes for each of Amazon's five star ratings is nearly equal, which I have seen very rarely. I remain steadfast in my opinion that this is a cracking good space opera epic that is less serious thought and more delirious plot than the elder Herbert's version. At this point, I think anyone reading this review already knows whether it has any chance of winning them over."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"The first 2 books of the series were decent reads and could have still built up to a killer climax. The first half is actually about on par with the first two, but after reading a good 3/4 of the way in you start wondering just when the authors are going to start tying things up. Finally after reading almost the entire novel (well over 90% of the entire series), the authors decide to start tying together a thousand loose ends within just a few pages. Monumental series of events are continually glossed over in just a few sentences, useless characters are introduced and go nowhere. Existing characters behave consistently out of character. Character behavior even becomes utterly unbelievable at parts. Meanwhile, pointless side stories go on and on. I would expect it to be almost impossible to screw up such an easy subject. The entire book could have been just about the \\"Battle of Corrin\\" and still be exciting. The second half was so bad I honestly think I could have done a better job myself. This book was an utter disappointment. If you read the first two, just leave it at that. 3 stars for the first half, but 1 star overall because the second half is inexcusably awful."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"The Battle of Corrin is the final installment of a trilogy, a prequel of sorts ostensibly based on the notes and writings of Frank Herbert.

Unbelievably, the downward trend started in the first book of the series continued and provided the world with this drivel. I am simply amazed that the powerhouse science fiction classic \\"Dune\\" could be so bastardized and beaten down by the creators own son. If I could give this series 0/5 stars I would (but can't find a way to do so).I struggled for months simply to get through this book because I thought it might reveal SOMETHING about the main power players in the classic series. Suffice to say, the explanations provided are juvenile, idiotic, and worthless.Take the money you'd spend on these books and start a small fire with it.

I wasn't disappointed.Neither of these guys has any feel for character, dialog, or plain common sense, and anyone with military experience is going to be shaking their head (or laughing out loud) throughout. Much like \\"The Machine Crusade\\" and \\"The Butlerian Jihad,\\" there is no pace, point, interest, focus, or drama to be found here, but rather a plodding recitation of planets slagged, populations euthanized, loyalties betrayed, and the occasional slave genius dissected for no apparent reason by the robot Erasmus, who seems like an escapee from the \\"Saw\\" movies.Another review has characterized this as fan fiction, which it certainly resembles. I'd modify that description by calling it *bad* fan fiction, except that it appears Herbert and Anderson actually get paid for this stuff.Only completists need read this. Borrow a copy rather than paying for it."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"These books are the literary equivalent of fast food: sometimes tasty and filling, but not of high quality. The writing continues to be terrible, with its hop-scotch short chapters, trite similes (some of which should be on those internet lists of examples from bad high school papers), deadening repetition, impoverished descriptive abilities, and rudimentary, shallow characterization. On the other hand, the stories themselves are actually quite good, for the most part; although about half of the sub-plots could have been jettisoned to the benefit of the series. The books have a relatively high entertainment value, which makes them worth a read notwithstanding the lousy writing. They are what I would call a \\"good airport read.\\"WARNING - SPOILER: The machines, \\"Evermind\\" Omnius and his \\"independent robot\\" sidekick Erasmus, are the weakest part of the series. Omnius in particular is almost comically inept, which reduces his stature as a lethal cosmic villain. And Erasmus, with his attempts to understand humans and his mimicry of human attributes, comes across as an unlikable derivative of Lieutenant Data from \\"Star Trek: TNG.\\" Alas, these feeble villains reappear in the final books of the Herbert/Anderson series, about 13,000 years later. They do not improve with time."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"The Battle of Corrin is well written and entertaining. It also contains the birth, if you will, of the world order found in the original Dune series. It leaves a few large-ish questions unanswered, presumably to leave the door open to more prequels. The biggest questions posed in the first installment of Legends of Dune are answered but some of those answers feel anticlimactic and clumsy in their execution. The resolution of the Harkonnen/Atreides question felt especially unconvincing.The one thing I found interesting in the book is its criticism of democracy, i.e. its inherent lack of long term determination and unwillingness to face critical problems if they have high-cost solutions. This idea is not new, though, and proof of the problem can be found in today's Afghanistan, among other places."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"Of the three Butlerian Jyhad prequels, this isn't the strongest, but neither is it the weakest.The plotlines of this novel seem rushed in places: The saga of Vorian Atreides obviously takes center stage in this novel, but the others get little more than a nod in their respective general directions.The genesis of the Sisterhood had so much handwaving my hair kept getting messed up. Or maybe it was the breeze from how fast the authors breezed through it.. excuse me, glossed over it. The same applies to Norma Cenva's evolution into... if you've read the real Dune novels, you know what.The cymeks are obviously on the ropes in this novel, which is just as well because there isn't enough punch in the characters to really make what they were capble of or their actions in the previous stories memorable.The origins of house Harkonnen, if added up, would barely fill a single chapter. Sad. So much more could have been done, but it was as if Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson knew they only had fifteen pages left in their quota and wanted to get as much meaning as they could into them. Unfortunately, most of the meaning was lost, and it came across as comical.There were a lot of plotlines left unresolved. On the one hand, it sets the stage for the mystery of the original novels, but on the other hand they feel very much like plot holes that the editor missed."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"The Battle of Corrin is the final installment of a trilogy, a prequel of sorts ostensibly based on the notes and writings of Frank Herbert.

However, The Battle of Corrin is none of these things. Most authors would love the opportunity to write a prequel to Dune, carefully divulging the tantalizing secret histories of the forgotten and celebrated. Sadly though, the authors pound out the story of the final battle between humanity the thinking machines as if it were an unwanted chore. They doggedly refuse to develop inventive themes in favor of familiar ones. Characters are one-dimensional tools used to keep the plot moving rather than engaging figures who make us want to read on. And most disappointingly, many scenarios are solved with unrewarding \\"magical solutions\\" or contrived \\"silver bullet\\" schemes.Nothing in this book has the craft or care of the original. If you want to explore the universe of pre-Dune, you might as well write it yourself because you wont be satisfied with The Battle of Corrin."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"I read the \\"Prelude to Dune\\" series and liked it enough to go for the \\"Legends of Dune\\" series. It wasn't great, and it was nowhere near the level of the original Dune novel, a lot lighter and fluffier than the rest of the original Dune series. That's fine, everything can't be a masterpiece... But the latest and last book of the \\"Legends\\" series was worse than that. I hesitate to call it crap, but it did little more than dispoint. All of the institutions we know in Dune- the Bene Gesserit, the Fremen, the Atreides/Harkonnen feud, the Guild, the Suk School, the extreme demand for spice, and the Mentats were all conveniently founded and formed in the last half of this book. Hundreds of years of history between the end of this book and the events of Dune; also, hundreds of years before this book for the League to develop. And *bam* here we go. I know it's fiction, but it would've been far from impossible to make it believable fiction. This may appeal to those who like a lot of lame space battles and flat characters, though."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"[...] This trilogy has been an excellant read. These books are also increadibly imagninative and thorogh in explaining how the houses started, evolved, and interacted with each other. Not only is the story of the war of the machines entertaining, the character's are also well developed and interesting, even thought provoking. Without a doubt, these two guys have done an excellant job of continueing Frank Herbert's work, with probably more imagination and creativety than Frank could have produced. It's always difficult to follow a master, especially one of Frank Herbert's calibar and place in Science Fiction history; so I am not surprised the \\"purest\\" of his work would find fault or be disatisfied with ANYONE'S attempt at continuing in his footsteps. On the contrary, his son, Brian, and Keven Anerson have hit the mark, if not exceeded it! I have thoroghly enjoyed thier collaboration on ALL of the Dune books and I pray they don't stop!"},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"The last two current Dune trilogies are much more beach novels than the hardcore philosophical based science fiction of Frank Herbert's Dune. This is fine by me, and I think once you can get over it and accept it for something completely different, then you can enjoy it (note - I understand people who can't read it - I love Asimov's Foundation series, but I can't stand the prequels). So, assuming that you've read the other two novels in the Butlerian Jihad series, then you'll get what you expected out of this finale.First off, the main problem is the structure of the book. Each chapter is something like four pages and each one deals with a different subplot. Fine - except for the fact that the story will be built up, then you won't hear anything about that story for another thirty pages. By the time you get back to that part of story, you really don't care anymore.This is made worse by the fact that pages 250-500 are really dull as you have to wait for the inevitable conclusion by dealing with random people or plots that you really can't care about.The book suffers from some horrible structure and waiting that just makes it a pain to read.There are also some problems with whole Robots torturing people or arguing with each other, along with other things that just make no sense.Now for the good stuff (skip this paragraph if you want to avoid possible spoilers). You get the final battles that you wanted. You get to see the beginning of Atriedes - Harkonnen feud. You get the first Space Guild Navigator. You get to witness the start of Bene Gesserit. You get to see that start of the Suk doctors. You get the beginning of the Corrino dynasty. You get to see the first Mentat. All in all, this is what I wanted all along. You've heard about these topics from the original Dune novels, and it's really satisfying to know the origins. I guess the only problem I had with it was that everything was wrapped up too conveniently.Also, the writing style of the authors is fluid and interesting, and if they could have just structured it better, would have made for a book that would have been impossible to put down.So, if you want to know more about the Dune elements and don't have the \\"this is not Frank Herbert\\" hang ups, this is your book."},{"Title":"The Battle of Corrin (Legends of Dune, Book 3)","review":"It has been stated many times that this book lacks any substance in comparrison to any book in the Dune Chronicles, so I find no need to expound on that area.

Consistent with the other two in the series, this one is plain awful. I found the House trilogy silly but entertaining. The House trilogy was worth reading for the fun of visiting familiar characters again; even if the writing was weak. The legends trilogy is so bad, it could have been written by teenagers. I also found the short, meaningless chapters quite distracting. It is as if the story threads were so thin, they could only be explored a few paparagraphs at a time before turning to another thread. The trilogy could have easily been condensed into a single novel. Forget about a comparison with the original Dune books, these books are bad as standalones. The characters are one-dimensional without depth and the plot is as predictable as a cheap B-movie.I hope they make a better effort if they're going to write the sequel to Chapterhouse.

The plague wipes out billions of humans on numerous worlds, tipping the scale of power back to the machines. On most League worlds, half the planets' populations are either dead or dying. Fortunately, there's this unallied planet called \\"Arrakis\\" that produces a highly addictive substance, indigenous to its world, refered to as \\"spice\\" or \\"melange,\\" which, when ingested, cure the symptoms of the plague.

Denny Moore and his wife decided to break away and do something exciting--buy a boat and cruise. They never planned to sail around the world--what started as a Caribbean cruise turned into a round the world voyage--downwide most of the way.Denny and his wife Velda made every possible mistake on this trip, but triumphed in achieving what few people have the guts to do. We can learn by the mistakes the made and also by their bravery and courage.I really enjoyed this book and have read it twice and even traded some email with Denny. I'm pleased to have known him in this way. Thanks Denny for a great book.This book would be a great gift idea for a nautical man. It has some meat to it. 456 pages. Nice illustrations and photos.Here is an excerpt to get your interest.&quot;Perhaps foolishly but understandably, considering how long we had been at sea and how badly we needed to see land and to replenish our stores, I was carrying the full twelve hundred feet of sail in our fore-and-aft rig, trying to keep moving against a northwest breeze and a stiff little chop that was developing.The boat hit a wave, bigger than others, which stopped her cold. At the same moment, we fell into a deep trough, and rolled violently to port. It was like a slow-motion demolition derby.I was listening to things tumbling about in the galley, when suddenly I hear a splintering SNAAAP-CRACKKK overhead and looked up in time to see the topmast fall forward, pulled down by the jib topsail, now partly in the water.Velda came running up the ladder and took the wheel in hurried response to my started cry, trying to hold the bow into the weather, while Sylvia and I went forward to drag the sail out of the water. Almost immediately, we stopped and were rolling in the trough.Some 12 feet of the topmast was dangling upside down, suspended from its splintered stub by electrical wires and bits of rigging. The boat rolled heavily, and with each roll, the broken mast swung out and back like a huge wooden flail, hammering the complex rigging at the crosstrees 35 feet above our heads. Bits of wood, broken blocks and other debris fell with each blow. I knew I had to go aloft...&quot;Good reading."},{"Title":"Gentlemen Never Sail to Weather: A Story of an Accidental Odyssey","review":"This is an excellent story; very well told.

She had always been a handful and had been requested to leave from more private schools than you could count. But one thing she knew, since finding her way to France, her grandfather loved and doted on her - every one did, with her beautiful looks, her love of life and laughter - life was good. Well, that was until Ross Trevenan, gloriously handsome, arrogant and infuriatingly self-righteous, had come to be her grandfathers secretary and confidante. Within minutes they had both taken an instant dislike to one another.Set during the upheavals of Napoleons reign, her grandfather was in failing health and believing that she would be safer in England, he and his old friend Ross, actually the Marquis of Sayle, were set upon smuggling her back into England for her own safety. That of course was just one of the reasons, but the other was that Ross, feared for her safety and the knowledge that she held the key to why several young women had been murdered, including Ross' wife Cassie.An elaborate scheme had been set in motion for her protection and without her knowledge to spirit her back to England - only Tessa, independent and stubborn, was not about to go anywhere with this arrogant, infuriating man. After a few attempts to escape Ross, he finally did get her to England where she learned the truth of who he was! Ross had given Tessa's grandfather his word of honor that he would protect her - even if it meant marrying her!The story is an edge-of-the seat fast moving romance and mystery that is difficult to put down. The sexual tension is real just enough to give you a taste, but not overly explicit. Throw in numerous well drawn out secondary characters, including a very vindictive ex-mistress of Ross', a mysterious drowning, and the tense cat and mouse mystery of who is murdering young ladies, and you are in for a real treat. Very good story."},{"Title":"The Bride's Bodyguard","review":"Tessa must leave her grandfather and France, and return to England. She leaves with her grandfather's secretary, Ross. They have had an adversarial relationship. She is spoiled, and willful. He is strong and bossy; and, he has secrets. Their relationship, will lead to a marriage of convenience. Their marriage of convenience leads to a tempestuous romance.The Bride's Bodyguard starts with a murder, in the very first chapter. You immediately know, that you're reading a special historical. It is one that has a mystery, a slow-developing love story, and quite a few supporting players. Each player is well defined. Each, has a role in the mystery, as well as in the romance.Tessa and Ross are beguiling leads. Tessa is both childish and mature, while being a strong heroine. Ross is the enigmatic, tortured (with good reason) hero. Their love scenes together, are sexy, and wonderfully written.This is a complete read, for me. It is a book, that has all the ingredients I need, in a romance. It has a great plot, strong leads, a good supporting cast,and sexy love scenes."},{"Title":"The Bride's Bodyguard","review":"I loved the book and enjoyed it very much. I also loved the charactersThe only thing that frustrated me was that I have just finish to read 300 pages in which Ross lied to Tessa, deceived and cheated her, and in general treated her like a stupid, untrustworthy little girl. The amazing thing was that it took her less then 5 pages to forgive him. Come on !! Get real !!!"},{"Title":"The Bride's Bodyguard","review":"I compare every book that I read to books from best selling author Kathleen E. Woodiwiss. This one not only compares well, it competes and holds its own! Beautifully written with a twisting, surprising and suspenseful plot. This story has depth...the characters are well developed and three dimensional. I particularly was impressed and touched by the way Ross's relationship to his late wife, Cassie, is honored and respected even though he is drawn to Tessa. His love for Tessa is not diminished by his love for Cassie, rather it is enhanced by it. We understand how Ross's first relationship made him the way he is today and why he reacts the way he does in romantic situations. We also follow Tessa's development and can feel her humiliation and embarrassment at the beginning of the novel as she goes through an awkward growing up period in her life. We can empathize as we look back on our own lives at that stage. And as Ross and Tessa's lives become inextricably linked, we grow with them as their relationship changes. True character development here!!! I truely loved this book and look forward to re-reading it many times in the future."},{"Title":"The Bride's Bodyguard","review":"A wonderful book by a great author. I was intrigued from the beginning since the opening chapter was described vividly by a mysterious murder. The hero, Ross Trevenan is a bodyguard to Tessa Lorimer. He and Tessa couldn't even stand each other presence. Tessa considered Ross as man who always keep knowing her affairs and Ross regard Tessa as spoilt and childish. Tessa's grandfather passed away, and in no time, Tessa was suddenly under the care of Ross. Tessa was stalked by a murderer and only she holds the key to the unsolved mystery. As Ross feel that he should protect her, they dealed with a marriage of convenience to ensure Tessa is safe. Ross also hide a dark secret from her, that because of a brutal murder, his life was meaningless. Tessa eventually helped him to search for the killer but Ross still could not tell her about his secret as he feel it will affect their relationship. At the end, Ross did realise about his love on Tessa.This book is not as intriguing as 'You Only Love Twice', but if you would like to give a try on Elizabeth Thornton's book, this book will be a good choice. It was suspenseful and darkly woven."},{"Title":"The Bride's Bodyguard","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book about a spirited young woman (Tessa) in Napoleon-era France (then England) and her interesting and often stormy relationship with a man who is appointed to maintain her safety. I enjoyed how they marry for convenience and safety and their love develops later. The mystery in the background of the story, which provides the tension and keeps Tessa in danger, was interesting, and a different twist for a romance. It wasn't clear to me if this book was part of a series or an independent title, but it stood well on its own. I will definitely be looking for more by this author. She has a good touch with characters and with keeping things unique, interesting, and believable."},{"Title":"The Bride's Bodyguard","review":"I bought this book based on all the 4 and 5 star reviews.I was very disappointed with the story or Ross and Tessa. In fact I started this book several months ago and just couldn't get past how much of a jerk Ross. I was bored this weekend and I had nothing to read and decided to give this book another try. I still could not finish it. I made it through about 100 pages but the interaction between Ross and Tessa just didn't work for me. Ross was overbearing and cruel and he justified his behavior because it was for her safety and he had her grandfathers approval. Tessa was young but she had the right to know that she was in danger. Instead Tessa was treated like a simple minded child.I prefer romance novels where the heroines are not teenagers and the heros are not jerks. Arrogance in a hero of a romance novel is expected but Ross was just to much for me. If you like romance mixed with a mystery try Amanda Quick's Mistress."},{"Title":"The Bride's Bodyguard","review":"The Bride's Bodyguard by Elizabeth Thornton is a fantansic writer. In this novel a group of women have been murdered because they witnessed a drowning when they were young. Tessa is the last of witnesses living happily in france with Grandfather until Ross Trevenan changes everything. If you enjoy this genre, I would also check out The Lady Lies, The Lady Killer and The Lady's Code by Samantha Saxon"},{"Title":"The Bride's Bodyguard","review":"As I said I found the story slow at first but then wow. The heroine, in my opinion, was a bit silly. I suppose she had to be that way so that there was a reason that the hero (and all of his friends) didn't let her in on the murder and mystery puzzle. The hero stuborn. The suspense perfect, it really built up towards the end of the book. I do recommend reading the book if you like suspense and romance."},{"Title":"The Bride's Bodyguard","review":"I liked this story about a mystery that had happened long ago. It was interesting to see the hero and heroine get together in this story. Both are strong characters that over time have had to overcome a lot. Tessa has been sent from person to person until she escapes to her Grandfathers home, while Ross has lived with the torment of the death of his wife whom Tessa might hold the key to the killer. I liked how the characters were human etc... In this one they basically use Tessa as bait, when she would have gladly done it herself... See how this turns out..."},{"Title":"The Bride's Bodyguard","review":"This book is awful. Tessa is a childish, annoying heroine and Ross is an overbearing jerk. It is an endlessly frustrating book. If you like your heroes to treat the heroine like he's her father and full of arrogant I-know-better-than-you attitude then this book is for you. The \\"mystery\\" isn't compelling. Ross's motives all center around his dead wife and yet we're supposed to believe that the reason he's so terrible is all for the greater good. Save your money."},{"Title":"The Bride's Bodyguard","review":"An original plot, a real mystery not easy to unravel, a reluctant to fall in love hero and a heroine who is misunderstood by our hero from the beginning all combine to make this another great story from ET. Once again, her prologue grabs you and won't let go until you're finished."},{"Title":"The Bride's Bodyguard","review":"I found this at a used bookstore and it's going on my keeper shelf. I loved how the two main characters developed their love and relationship over time. They didn't hate eachother on one page and jump into bed the next. I hate heroins who fall madly in love on the first page and throw themselves repeatedly at the hero only to be hurt over and over again. They each gave a little bit of themselves at a time and learned to love and trust eachother. Ross could be a bit brutish at times but I have yet to read an historical romance novel where the hero wasn't a jerk for at least part of the book. This book also had a good mystery element. I thought I had the murderer picked out and I was completely wrong."},{"Title":"The Bride's Bodyguard","review":"A very plesant read! However to be honest, THE BRIDE'S BODYGUARD was not the most romantic novel I've ever read, but it gave me a very satisfying feeling when I finished it :) A very different type of historical, packed with action and suspense.In this story we meet Ross Trevenan and Tessa Lorimer, our hero and heroine. Tessa Lorimer is kind of like a spoiled brat, growing up in a pretty rich background, but an only child and living with her rich grandfather. But what makes her stand out is that she grew up with a very harsh childhood. Her parents died when she was young, and she was always changing schools because she could never adapt to its conditions. Moreover, the last school she attended she witnessed a brutual murder, and because of that she lost her memory during that period of her life.Ross Trevenan, a Marquis living in England, had been married for only a couple of years to a wife that he first thought of as a simple lady to bear him sons, but later on as a wife whom he loved deeply. But before Cassie, Ross' wife, could tell him the good news that she is pregnant, she is murdered. It is up to Ross to find out the meaning of this murder and who the murderer is. This leads him to Tessa, for somehow he discovered that there is a connection between Tessa and his wife, and believes that Tessa could be murdered next. Keeping that as a secret, he gets employed as a financial advisor for Tessa's grandfather. His position deceives everyone, but only Tessa's grandfather knows why Ross is in France. He and Ross come up with a plan to get Tessa out of France and into England as soon as possible. But convincing Tessa to leave her beloved grandfather and country is a problem that Ross has to overcome. Overcoming that, he succeeds, but he never anticipated the attraction he feels for Tessa, and all the problems that they must face together to solve the mystery and find the murderer.All in all, THE BRIDE'S BODYGUARD was an entertaining read. The only reason why I didn't feel it to be one of the best, is for the reason that I did not get the 'tingly feeling' that Ross was really in love with Tessa, since he loved his first wife so much. But then again, that is just my opinion. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Bride's Bodyguard","review":"I really loved this book. I would have given it five stars except for the end. Resolving everything in the last few pages with an &quot;I love you&quot; seemed too easy. But I am ready for another one of Ms Thornton's books!"},{"Title":"The Bride's Bodyguard","review":"I read The Bride's Bodyguard and found the book to very disturbing. The \\"hero\\" (Ross) is almost sociopathic in the way he treats the heroine (Tessa) in this book. He lies to her over and over, he has her under constant survelliance, and he doesn't have the decency to even tell her she may be in danger. He just decides that she's not \\"worthy\\" enough to be trusted with the information.In the end he just treats her like a tool to used and then forgotten. Even when the danger is passed he, doesn't have the courage to tell her truth, instead he arranges for a victory celebration in which he specifically excludes her! I found this part to the most upsetting. It's an ineffective plot twist and unbelievably cruel. Especially since he would never have caught the murderer without her help.And then to top it off, he tells her he wants to start over, with no apologies. And her \\"friends\\" don't act much better.This book would have better served if the Ross has told Tessa truth from the begining. There still would have been sufficient tension and friction between Ross and Tessa, without all the lying, and the relationship could have developed more honestly and deeply.I believe he author thinks she is being \\"cutting edge\\" by writing stories like this. I would have to disagree. I have tried to read some of her other books and I found them to be just as bad-using the same cheesy premise of the herione lying to the hero or the hero lying to the heroine. (Most often the latter than the former.)I don't want to sound sexiest, but this reads like a romance written by a man - the hero never does anything wrong, everyone in the book supports him-no one stands up to him, and he never has to say \\"I'm sorry.\\" And the heroine just forgives him, like it's right to treat her however he wants to.I had heard that this book did not sell very well and I'm not suprized. No woman with any self-respect would consider Ross to be \\"tragic hero\\" or a hero of any kind. If you must try this book, get it from the library.it."},{"Title":"The Bride's Bodyguard","review":"A thrilling and romantic story following two strong characters thrust into a harrowing ordeal. One of my absolute favorites. A must read for anyone who loves historical romance."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"After reading and not really enjoying 'Stone of Tears', I had large doubts about Mr Goodkinds ability to write quality fiction. 'Blood of the Fold' however made me reconsider my harsh verdict on him as an author, with the book turning out to quite an improvement on the 1st and especially the 2nd novels he has written.'Blood of the Fold' is barely half the length of 'Stone of Tears' yet advances and explains the story of Richard and Kahlan much clearer and better, with the storyline building on those of the two previous books to begin to create an epic fantasy scenario in the traditions of Robert Jordan and David Eddings. The story is pretty much a direct continuation of the last book with most of the characters and plotlines introduced in 'Stone of Tears' continued and developed. In particular 'Blood of the Fold' sees the characteristics and nature of the Imperial order, The Blood of the Fold and the Mrswith explained and developed a lot more, with Mr Goodkind taking the time to give us a bit more of an description of where these enemies come from and their place in the grand scheme of his world (something he neglected and was very fuzzy about in his previous books).Indeed in general 'Blood of the Fold' is a much better book than the previous two with a better quality of writing and narrative, a faster pace and more meaningful action, better development of the background of his world and a more comphrehensible plot. In particular 'Blood of the Fold' has less of the meaningless fat and waffle that was in 'Stone of Tears', with Goodkind (or his editors) showing much better planning in the writing of this book, with the consequence that the pace and purpose of this book is a lot quicker and more meaningful.This all serves to make 'Blood of the Fold' a much better book than the previous ones and shows that Mr Goodkind is improving significantly as an author as he gains more experience, thus I would recomend it too anyone who is not really sure whether to keep reading his books after the 1st two novels. However I still feel that Mr Goodkind still puts in too much explicity sadistic violence (though significantly less than S of T), and too lttle work into developing the texture and background of his fantasy world. This combined with the relative unoriginality of some of his ideas and story elements makes me feel that his books do not really compare favorably to those of other big series fantasy authors such as Robert Jordan, George R.R Martin, David Eddings or even Raymond E. Feist. Still a good book and a series worth reading."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"I really liked it a lot. I loved the portrayal of Nathan, Ann and Zedd. I really liked the battle at the end with Richard fighting the mirswith. The only thing was Terry got rid of a interesting feature he had going for him The Palace of the Prophets. Also in my opinion he hurt the book by adding certain points about the mord-sith and their particullar sex preferences. Also I felt that Goodkind centers just a little too much on sexual themes. Other than that it was a great Gooooodkind book."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"I will try to be the mediator here. Please, those of who who say these books are for mindless adolescents, could you try to refrain from insulting people who buy this book, and start insulting the book? That is what a review is; you are not supposed to review the people who buy it. If you can't think of anything to say about the book, you should not be writing a review. And those of who who rate the book excellent, don't demean others for their opinions. I enjoyed the series. I must say, however, that there are only so many things a fantasy novel can contain. One of these things is impossible odds. The army of 5000 defeated the army of 50000 because it is a FANTASY NOVEL. FANTASY. Also, did you ever think that maybe what Goodkind is getting at is that it isn't numbers that always counts. It is strength of character and the brain power to come up with something you don't even know will work. They didn't know, but to protect the people, they were willing to try. They won for their good intentions. And yes, this might not be possible, but that is why the book is a FANTASY NOVEL. Okay, maybe the 'eating genitalia' part could have been edited out, but that is one of only a few things that doesn't need to be there. Once you get past the veneer, you begin to find deeper meanings than the words on the page. I have read all the Robert Jordan books up to this point, and like them very much, but why does the Dark One do what he does. We see him precious little, he doesn't have a personality, you can't relate to him, yet he is the main antagonist. He fights against 'the Creator' if you will, for balance. The same as the Keeper. There must be a balance in all things. Without life, there is no death, and without death, there can be no life. Quite simple. Some of you look too deeply into things, others of you not deep enough. All I ask is that, if you didn't like the book, criticize the book, not the people who buy it. That's a cheapshot."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"WHY YOU SHOULD READ THIS:This book should only be read if you were very interested in the first two novels and wondered what happened next. The book could be titled: What Happened to Gar and Other Important Matters. It's likable enough as the sort of pulp fantasy fiction that many readers enjoy on a plane or at the beach or perhaps visiting the in-laws and looking for an escape. In short, to qualify as a buyer, you should:1) Have read Wizard's First Rule (and liked it)2) Have Read Stone of Tears (and liked it too)3) Want to read something but not in the mood to look for something new.WHY YOU SHOULD PASS:I'm afraid we don't have any earth shattering insight to offer here about a rather pedestrian book. Nothing but fun-no highbrow literature here. If you're looking for something important, seek elsewhere. But you knew that from the first two books. The sex stuff has escalated to levels that parents should prohibit the book from children below a certain maturity level.

It is still based around the main characters Richard, Kahlan and a host of others. I have very much enjoyed the first three books in the series, and would recommend them to fantasy lovers. The Characters are very likeable, and the story lines are good and fairly complex. The endings do seem a bit rushed in the last two, including this one, but the journey is the best part of the book anyways. I am almost through the Temple of the Winds (book 4) and it is also suprisingly good.The reminiscing of events already taken place in the previous books that people complain about with Goodkinds writing is rather annoying, but you can skip those paragraphs if you've read the first two books.The books seem to be getting a little more gritty as they go on also, not as dark as Greorge r.r. Martin or anything, but not cookie cutter clean like Jordan either. All in all, if you like fantasy you should like this series."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"Richard starts out creating the bond to have the D'Haran troops join together under his command. He, Hoping to get word from Kahlan, decides the best way to stand up against the Imperial Order is to claim the Midlands are no more united as one, but should surrender to him in hopes of defending along side D'Hara against the Imperial Order. Sister Verna, now Plelate has to take charge and can only trust Warren, still fearing that there are Sisters of the Dark in the Palace. Richard, impatient from not meeting up with either Kahlan or Zedd, sends Gratch, his gar friend, to send word of what he's doing. With his 3 Mord sith and two bodyguards, Richard tries to figure out a way to help the Midlands.Like my title sats...short, but sweet (altho it is approx. 600 pgs.). There isn't as much action than the last one, but the plot twists and such keep it at a good rate anyways. I still have trouble trying to read accounts of semi-main characters without hoping to get to the next chapter where Richard or Kahlan are the subjects, but doing so helped me like those characters more. I also enjoy reading points-of-view from the bad guys, the Lord General of the Blood of the Fold for example.The explanations of some the creatures is brought forward like the mriswith and gar. And even the bringing in of the 3 Mord Sith adds more to the story. I really like those three, but what man wouldn't? they're three fine women...anyways, characters are good, story is good.Very enjoyable and I'm ready for more..."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"Blood of the Fold is, in my opinion, the best book Goodkind has written. When I first started it, I decided to take it slow, having just come off of the monumentous task of reading the 1000 page stone of tears. Goodkind, however, drew me in with his marvelous plot and characters. I did find it odd that he named the book blood of the fold, and they really didn't play a big part in my eyes, but that is, for the most part, the only thing bad worth mentioning. If you have read the first two books, definatly pick this one up."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"Although as many people keep pointing out, Goodkinds later books do not seem to be as amazing as Wizard's First Rule, you have to remember that you all read Wizard's as virgins to Goodkinds world. It seems to me that he is slowly unfolding the saga of Richard Rahl over the span of his books, which in turn has left some of them the task of slightly bridging gaps in the story, allowing time for the epic to consolidate and then to take it forward again. 'Fold' does this. The set up of the oligarchic blood of the fold gives us something else to contemplate for a while. And while the ongoing thread of Richard and Kahlan's affair becomes tangible at times, it is still there to a add a degree of credibility to the continuity of the story.I think what Goodkind is doing is slowly spinning out his story through the books and giving us a chance to fully sample the world he has created through various adventures. While I agree at times the writing isn't always outstanding and that parts of the books can become tedious, I feel that we stray away from the simple fact that this is all tumbling out of the guys head, and we, the reader are privileged to have the chance to join him in his fantasy. I personally have enjoyed all his books to date and can't wait for the next one."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"I have to say that I am a faithful reader of Goodkind. I feel that his style of writing, althoughcertainly not a new genre, is certainly refreshing. He gives the reader something to lookforward to throughout the plot, as well as at the end of the novel, and I certainly can't same thesame thing for many of the other books that I have read in the past.I have read the other reviews of this book, and although I am not writing a review of the opinionspresented by other visitors to this sight, I have to say that I don't agree with the people whohave stated Terry Goodkind is a &quot;bad&quot; writer. He presents a story line that is enjoyable to follow,as well as characters that are either heroic or despicable. Many books today present the reader withtoo many &quot;gray areas&quot; into which fall their main characters. I feel that Goodkind has intentionallyavoided this, and as a result, allow the reader to cheer on the heroes and loathe the villains.In a day and age where it seems impossible to tell right from wrong, Terry Goodkind has presented uswith a gift. This gift is a series of books that allows for an enjoyable read as well as some food forthought. I applaud Mr. Goodkind for his work, and have only to say that I await his next novel!---Sarah B.

I happen to like it, sometimes. It is what it is, and I don'thave much to say about it from that point of view.I am moved to write a review specifically because of the quality of the Kindle edition.Simply put, this is a poorly edited version of this book. It's not unreadable by any means,and it is far from the worst example I've seen, but there are typos on what seems likeevery few pages, and it is distracting and annoying.Clearly the person(s) responsible for producing the Kindle edition did not bother proofreadingthe text. You simply cannot read more than a few pages of this without finding some obviousmistake.I have read the original paperback edition, a few years ago. I am not going to bothercomparing the printed text with the Kindle text, but I do not recall that original editionbeing so poorly edited.Also I will say that I just finished reading the Kindle editions of the first two volumesof this series, and they were much more carefully produced editions.I would like to urge the publisher to go back and do a better job on this.For some Kindle books I have received updates from Amazon for corrections in editions ofa few other books.

With memorable characters, a complex and realistic plot, and unrelenting action, &quot;Blood of the Fold&quot; is a worthy edition to the &quot;Sword Of Truth&quot; series. The brisk pace that this novel follows, however, is the determining factor regarding its overall rating of 4 stars. Sadly, the immersive and continuous action fails to allow the subtle development of the characters to emerge. This is quite a contrast to his previous novel &quot;Stone of Tears&quot; where the two components were incorporated flawlessly."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"After buying Wizards First Rule, Stone of Tears Unabridged tapes I was very let down when I listened to Blood of the Fold tape. I had to buy the book in order to keep the story flowing. The desire to listen, rather than read the book is a must for me as I travel extensively and listen to books while I'm driving. I and my husband became so wound up in the story that we bought the book to do the necessary research to piece together the story line and character explainations that the Soundelux Audio Publishing Co. failed to cover in their abrided version of Blood of the Fold. By the time this was completed and we got back on track with the Temple of the Winds tape, the company which recorded it had phonetically changed how they pronounced Kahlan Amnells' name. This minor change however small affected our already trained ear for a while until we adjusted to the new name.

The plot has twists and turns no reader would expect, making you flip pages through the night, desperately wanting to read more. The plot is fast-paced, too! The only problem is that some readers might be offended at some of the more... &quot;graphical&quot; details, but my advice is to read ahead, since you don't really need to read it to understand the story.

The worst rape would be if he had created this vibrant, living world but then removed its balls by leaving out the darker side.The question is whether or not Terry can get the series back on track by expanding the original ideas and adding fresh ones.If you don't like sex then avoid books like &quot;Dracula&quot; as well, and if you hate violence, especially the mindless sort, avoid &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot;."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"With &quot;Blood of the Fold&quot; Terry is seemingly under the same publisher pressures as Robert Jordan is in his Wheel of Time series. A plausible world/universe has interesting concepts but they are gradually discarded as the author struggles to meet deadlines.The worst thing is, I really enjoyed reading Blood of the Fold despite the way characters are pushed this way and that to make the plot move forward.Some of Terry's earlier ideas, like the bloodhounds, appear to have been discarded in the haste of getting out another book in the series. The villain is hardly worth bothering with, and worst of all Richard suddenly finds out he's a war wizard, who wanders aimlessly around and yet instinctively reacts properly to any menace which crosses his path (properly in this case is to solve one problem by creating other conflicts which of course build up until Richard resolves the current book and sets up the next one)If I didn't like the series it wouldn't be a problem, but both Terry Goodkind's and Robert Jordan's series are beginning to look more and more like endless rehashes, with the interesting ideas and offshoots disappearing in favour of churning out another volume in the series."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"When I started &quot;Wizard's First Rule&quot; I thought, &quot;This is just like a dozen other fantasy books I've already read&quot;. Twenty pages later, I didn't care. Goodkind writes really good stories. They're based around old themes; a lot of it's like a diet version of the &quot;Wheel of Time&quot;, except without the brain-melting sensation. But still, it's some of the best fantasy I've read in years."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"This book was by far a lot less interesting then the first or second book. I wasn't impressed with the repetitivness of certain lines that Star Wars novels sometime get into such as &quot;Han gave a crooked smile&quot; .. I mean we all know that he smiles like that but they still tell it. Goodkind did this a lot throughout the novel and it just got on my nerves. Richard faced foe after foe and not once did he get seriously injured. Each time he would beat down his foe easily with not apparent challenge. I was enthralled with the first book, interested in the second book (though second was really pretty good and he had not yet started to repeat previous things), and the third was bordering on boredom. I am not sure about purchasing the fourth book but i like to finish a series. I think i will hit the local library.."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"i found that this book was much more original then the last two and that he didnt use AS many things from the wheel of time as in the other book, also i still say that he is a much better writer then Robbert Jordan, whose books are long and fairly boring, and as i havent read much of David Eddings i cant say how it compares to him."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"As I said, this book is extraordinary. True, it may have a few small faults, but overall it is a great book.I myself have read book by many authors. Yes, there are many good authors. Many of them have just not yet been recognized. I think Goodkind is now starting to be recognized. Some of the other reviews said that his writings were &quot;discusting&quot; or able to be written &quot;by a 10-year old.&quot; Do you realize just how hard it is to write a good book that everyone will like. It is impossible. I use that word lightly though, because Terry has come severely close. The first book, Wizard's First Rule; I have read it about 39 times now. I read it over and over now. I now know the personality to the very detail of Richard, Kahlan, Zedd, and many others. This first book was written by Goodkind merely to introduce his characters and start the plot. Although, I have to admit it has a certain ring to itself. The second book, The Stone of Tears; I believe that the title was a little bit off, because the book was not too much about the Stone of Tears, but about Richard and Kahlan up against almost all odds trying to defeat the Keeper while keeping their love for each other. It also shows how Richard can care for many things via Gratch, the gar. Richard cared for that thing since it was a baby. It shows that even though everything says that you can't do something, it is still possible. The Third Book, The Blood of the Fold; This book, too was titled a bit off. The book was not about the Blood of the Fold. They were merely a part of the Order's army. Brogan played but a small part in the background. I was a bit thrown off that the book ended so suddenly, though. I am glad to hear that Terry will have other books out. Terry's books show that he knows what goes on in this world. One of the responses I read was that he has no idea, and that he must be like one of those people who stare at a screen all day and don't know what is going on... I say you don't. This is what really goes on in this world. Wether you want to block it out or not, it is. Goodkind knows this and writes about it. He knows that there is such a thing as love at first sight and a passion for living. Another reader wrote that he wrote about things that could not happen, like being hurt or having such emotional stress and still living. There are some people who, with a strong cause, can out do the limits. Just because you are subject to a lot of emotional stress doesn't mean that you will break down and die... I believe that Goodkind knows this and is willing to let his readers know. And another thing; if you notice, he wrote the second book to his sister. He even named the characters after people he knew. How do we know that he didn't have a purpose for these choices other than the fact that it made it easier to do?Anyway, I think that if you have the book, you should go read it again, and if you haven't, well then go get it... Thank you for reading.-By My Sword-Speed"},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"Richard Cypher is now in a complete mess-up! First, magical beings called Mirswith are rampaging cities, and to make matters worse, he is now the new Lord Rahl of D'hara. And where is his beloved Kahlan when he needs her? To figure out all of this, you must get the book!"},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"Anyone who says that the SoT series is just like everyone else's hasn't read enough to compare.They are not just good vs. evil.Sure there it's there, but there are other deeper themes involved.Mr Goodkind has obviously put a lot of thought into his books.The idea of the skrin and the wizard's wars in which the towers were erected, are fabulous.And it's not just Richard against an enemie, each book is the aftermath of the book before it.just like in our world feces happens, and you have to deal with it.Richard is dealing with that feces.It's a ten!"},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"I loved this book and thought that this is a book that deserves to be noticed. I have read all three books of Goodkinds. All his books are worth reading. I recomend buying this book because I have read all three books at least twice. If you are considering purchasing this book, I recomend it and also recomend buying his 2 other books."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"After reading the reviews, I was stunned at the sheer volume of positive reviews given in an intellectually stimulating fashion. I was also appauled by the negative crticism. I certainly understand people not liking a book, but it seemed the only reason anyone gave for not liking this one was &quot; It was to much like Robert Jordan's&quot;. When I pick up a book and start reading it,. I judge it by it's own merit not based upon whether the author bears similarities to another. If I thought like that I'd never reafd a Steven King book. A dog that kills people, a cat, a car, a unch of cats, etc... The bottom line is this was another fine book from Terry. It started off feeling out the characters and before you knew what was happening you had a full fledged knock down drag out ploy erupting. I particularly think Terry does a wonderful job of breathing life into his characters. From Richard right down to Gratch the characters take on an unmistakable personality. I find myself speeding through the book to find out what happens next. In closing, if Temple of the Winds is half as good as the other 3 books have been then Terry will still have a hit on his hands."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"I've read all three of his books, and the worst thingabout them is that Goodkind uses far too big effects withoutreason. Everything is huge, grand and largely impersonal. This causes the story to lose its emotion, because everything is just so unbelievable--huge battles where thousands die but we knew none of them, hundreds of raped women that we didn't know, etc. If he made his atrocities more personal, it would read better."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"Goodkind never dares venture beyond those limits alreadyestablished for fantasy, and in not doing so, his plot andworld in general are bland and lifeless. I'll admit he's fun in place...but I know better things to do than read the re-hashed adventures of all the characters ever written about in fantasy. He'll be thankfully forgotten and out-of- print soon. That's the way of all followers."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"Blood of the Fold picks up where Stone of Tears left off. Goodkind continues his rip-roaring adventure in a break-neck pace. One thing that this author can never be accused of is being boring. The characters are as good as ever. I really enjoyed the plot as well. While, to me, this book is not as good as Stone of Tears, it is still a fantastic adventure. Goodkind has so much going on in his world, I wonder how he keeps up with it. He has yet to disappoint me! This series is worth your time for certain. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"Terry goodkind continues to write the way we come to expect. memorable characters and despicable bad guys. However, he seemed to come up a bit short in this book.He still retains his love for Deus ex Machina, seemingly pulling a heroic and positive ending out of nowhere and having a sudden explanation for things. What? Gars were created to battle mriswith? How convenient.Despite that it was an entertaining read as always. Richard continues in his heavy-handed, whiny manner that we have all come to love. Kahlan doesn't show until near the end and she is as stalwart as ever.In this book, the main plot arc is the eventual arrival of the Emporor of the Old World, Jagang. He is a Dream Walker. Dream Walkers were weapons created back during the great war, the one that caused the creation of the Towers of Perdition we saw in the last novel.Two things really stood out in my reading though. Number one, the title of the book is of the group that hails from Adie's home country that we learned of last book. They played a decidedly small part in the book. For carrying the title of the book, they weren't even the main plot line or a major antagonist in the book. they simply supplied the glue to keep some of the plot movements together.Secondly was the whole strange sequence of events with the Mriswith. Huh? The whole thing seemed entirely pointless. You'll see it when you read it. That whole part could have been left out of the book and it would have still made sense with some minor changes. It only seemd a device to take Richard from one place to another and back.Other than the obvious shortcomings, is was an entertaining read and I look forward to reading the next book."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"Finished reading the Blood of the Fold Last night, and I felt it was the best of the series so far.Richard is now Lord Rhal and has 3 Mord-siths as his bodyguards(plus they enjoy teasing him from time to time)and his own Army,plus he has to try and get all the lands in the Midlands together to fight the Imperial Order. all in all a good story and both Zed and Kathlan now know what Richard went threw and felt when he had to wear a coller around his neck. Aside from the Blood of the Fold, there was a new foe the Queen Mriswith, and the Emperor Jagang. Who I feel is turning into a really interesting evil character( I like him). I have now started on the 4th book The Temple of the Winds. the one funny part was the scene between Kahlan and Berdine, in which Berdine trys to tell (or I should say hint at) to Kahlan that she and Richard maybe more than just friends, by telling Kahlan that Richard touched her Breasts and saw the rest of the Mord-siths Breasts by his order and that she is Richards Favorite.I liked Kahlans responce to it by hinting that she knows all about Berdine and Raaina's relationship and that Raina's hands would fit her breasts. man that was funny. She was calm ond cool about it and didn't let Berdiane upset her and she got her payback. I highly recommened the series."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"Originally i came on this sight to refresh my memory of the other books in the series but instead i had to stop and comment on some of these reviews. These are some of the harshest reviews I have ever read. All the books in this series were remarkably good and I thought, much better than Robert Jordan. Terry Goodkind manages to add whole new concepts and ideas that add little twists to the plot. And the action makes it more exciting then most Robert Jordan novels which tend to take forever to get one thing done.I have a collection of over 200 fantasy novels and i thought this was one of the best series. Please ignore any errors it was one in the morning when i wrote this review."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"Mindless readers are obviously what are making Goodkindso huge--people who love his trash so much that theyworship the man. _Blood of the Fold_ is hopelessly bogged down by an immature writing style that sounds stale, a predictable storyline that offers no unusual twists, and an incredibly stupid protagonist. Goodkind is falling prey to the Eddings Disease: reusing the same plot time and again. Instead of Darken Rahl, we have the Evil Emperor to fight-- how fresh and original! It was stale in Book 1, and it's rotting in Book 3."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"I am well versed in all things fantasy. You name it - rare or popular - I have probably read and/or watched it. I will let nothing get in the way of my search for the most entertaining, enlightening, life-complimenting reads... not even biased readers whose only goal in life seems to be nitpicking instead of enjoying the things they read. (You can find a few of their reviews here. Look for the reviews with 1-3 stars.)An overwhelming number of readers criticize Goodkind's writing in the Sword of Truth series, using the phrases \\"cliche\\" and \\"cookie-cutter\\" all too often. How funny. \\"Cookie-cutter\\" is itself a painfully cliche phrase. This hypocrisy, to me, is grounds enough to mistrust the opinions of those naysayers...As I said, I know a thing or two about fantasy. Few books have affected me as deeply as the Sword of Truth series. Heck, I haven't written an Amazon review in years; I'm only here now because I'm offended at the negative reviews. I took it personally. That's how much I love this series.The Sword of Truth books are a celebration of life. Beauty. Progress. Emotions. Pessimistic readers seeking a cookie-cutter pattern will surely find one, because Goodkind DOES have a trademark approach to building tension that he uses often. But I know better than to call that \\"cliche.\\" In each book, Goodkind explores different facets of the concepts of life, beauty, progress, and emotions. He NEVER explores the same facet; he always throws in a twist.Reading each of these books is like cheese tasting. A cheese-lover with a refined sense of taste will delight in the worlds of difference between blue cheese and brie and baby swiss. They will compare; they will savor every bite.But someone who is not accustomed to cheese... will, upon trying blue cheese, think \\"this smells like feet.\\" Then they will try swiss cheese, hoping it doesn't smell like feet. Then feta. Alas, cheese usually smells like feet. The pessimists will then proceed to the donut and snack food aisles, looking for just the right junk food to ease their craving; nothing more, nothing fulfulling in the long run.Fantasy connoisseurs adore Goodkind. Yet average readers find numerous things to complain about. Contemplate this for a bit.I'm sorry for not going into detail about this book, but in one sentence I will help you decide if this series is right for you:If you *adore* any of the concepts of life, beauty, progress, and emotions... you will love the Sword of Truth books. I promise you."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"The entire series is quite good.

But while reading this book, I find myself reading one or two pages at a sitting, and even then I am skipping over whole paragraphs to get through them (it is allmost painfull to read them). I have no idea what happend Terry Goodkind while writing this, but it is no where near the quality of Wizzards first rule, and Stone of tears. I am still going to get the next books in the series and read them, as I have faith that they will prove to be as good as the first two were (God I hope I am right)."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"I see a lot of animocity between people.

I'm impatiently awaiting the completion of book 4.The only gripe I have is (as with the entire genre) Goodkind is following suit (as with Jordan, Donaldson, etc) and making the 'Classic Trilogy' into an 8+ book sequel. The world is already built as of book 3. I cannot see Goodkind getting 3 or more books out before having to abandon this plot and start anew."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"This series has kept me interested.

His novels are extreamly creative and imaginative.The conflicts in the story are rather easily resolved, but this is easily forgivin due to the great plot. Goodkind is agreat author. I have read &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and I would say that Goodkind has a slightly more interesting storyto tell than Tolkien had. His books don't rely on one conflict throughout the whole series. There are a number of problems that the characters have toresolve. The main character in the seriers, Richard, is complex and original. It is interesting to see how thischaracter develops throughout the series.

Being a student of writing, I have read innumerable novels including all of Shakespeare's &quot;classic&quot; works and just about every type of fantasy novel (including garbage such as a couple of D&amp;D novels--yuck). Since fantasy is my passion, I enjoyed Goodkind's style as much as content; unlike other authors, he does not waste words. Goodkind is the only author I have encountered who writes better than Robert Jordan. Fantastic works, Mr. Goodkind's novels kept me reading all night"},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"In reading the various reviews already done on &quot;Blood of the Fold&quot; and the other two books in the series I was surprised to find how polarized the reviewers are. It would seem that people either really love Goodkind's work, or really hate it. I believe both camps are missing the point. These books are not the ultimate in fantasy literature, nor are they the worst things ever written. What Goodkind's books are, is an entertaining read. To give them any significance beyond this, either good or bad, misses the mark. This is entertainment, folks, not religion! As entertainment, Goodkind's books work very well. Perhaps the best recommendation comes from the people who state they didn't like &quot;Blood of the Fold&quot;, but apparently were entertained enough by Goodkind's work to read 3 relatively long books by him"},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"I loved the book because of the story. I like the idea behind the series, and that keeps me reading. However, the authors weak style of progressing the novel, and the protagonist's semblance of a reject doesn't help. All in all, Blood of the Fold was a good novel. I await the next installment (considering Terry got paid $1 million for 4 novels) which I hope will forward the series to the &quot;Armaggedon&quot; style ending"},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"It's interesting to see the types of reviews that _Blood of the Fold_ is getting. People seem to either really love or really hate Terry's work, with very little in between. I have enjoyed his work to date, and found myself eagerly turning the pages of his latest work. I was a little concerned with the scope of the novel, given the number of plot lines he had working all at once. The relationships between plots were foreshadowed one way and resolved another, esp. with the mriswith. Terry seemed like he couldn't make up his mind whether the book was about Richard vs. the Fold or Richard vs. Jagang, or Richard vs. the Keeper. None of these plots was really fleshed out, and the whole Imperial Order and Jagang thing just dies out by the end of the novel.Overall, it kept my interest and had me riveted in spite of these objections, so I still give it a solid 8. Good work, Terry"},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"This book was a certain waste of over 500 pages and hours of reading time. The second book didn't leave me wanting to read this book, and I wish I had taken the hint. The only advantage to reading this was knowing every last detail that occurs in the life of Richard Rahl. The plot was week and the subplots were uninteresting, and Goodkind really showed his weaknesses in his skill, such as superfluous description of setting, weak conversations, and bad cliches such as &quot;The Dance with Death&quot;. Really not satisfactory. Skip right to Temple of the Winds, which is MUCH better."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"Just pretend that this book didn't exist. Stone of Tears and Wizards First Rule remain to be my favorite books. This book introduced a new nemesis called emperor Jagang that seems to pop up as an excuse to extend this series indefinitely. No mention of him in the two pervious books except at the epilogue of Stone of Tears. The story plot also becomes a little sloppy starting with this book.If you really wanna treasure this series, don't do what I did. Stop at Stone of Tears and forget about the rest."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"These books aren't really well written. If you start the series expecting Robin Hobb or George R R Martin, you WILL be disappointed. Nevertheless, each book in this series is pretty readable if rather predictable.

I bought it at a booksale at work, always looking for something new to read- this looked interesting. I've read the Robert Jordan Wheel of Time series, and realized about 10 pages in that this storyline was similar. I enjoyed the Jordan series, so i thought, okay, this will be good. Wrong. Shallow characters, transparent plot lines . . . I'm ashamed to say that I actually finished this book. It gets 2 stars because I did finish it, but that goes more to my tenacity than to the quality of the writing or the story. Don't waste your time."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"First of all, I'd like to say that this book is no lower than the standard quality of his previous book. Which was about average. The first book was brilliant, but i found it a little confusing when he said he would call the next book Wizard's Second Rule, and spent countless hours searching for it, only to find that he'd changed the title and had several more books.Alot of my friends were discouraged from this series, because they found the thickness daunting. Well, alot, and i seriously mean alot of that could've been cut down. Goodkind spends a least half of this book recounting what had happened in the previous novels. I am now reading the fourth one, and reading a synopsis of three books is a) very distracting from the story and b) extremely mind numbing and boring. I have \\"trained\\" my eyes to skim over those parts, picking up anything different, but seriously it's just a waste of mine, yours and his time.Aside from that, the book is very interesting and i think that he's done a very good job with it.

I have read the first two installments of this series \\"Wizards First Rule, and Stone of Tears,\\" both excellent novels. I went ahead and bought \\"Blood of the Fold:\\" which was a great disappointment. Mr. Goodkind degenerates into endless feminist tirades that take away from the plot and spoil the book.

So I did the logical thing and bought this book. What a let down! Goodkind writes like an amateur and his protagonist, Richard fares worse. Richard behaves like a lab rat jumping impulsively at every provocation but somehow miraculously surviving every unimaginatively plotted challenge.The plot runs like a video game, one long series of inane obstacles fostered by cartoon characters and then brought to an abrupt end without a conclusion.Goodbye Mr. Goodkind.

I love the main characters, but just as good is the huge cast of sub-characters and sub plots that all seem to come together in a well planned and exciting way. Unlike many series of this sort, you're never sure where the story is going to take you and how it will turn out. And as each book comes to an end, you know there are many unresolved and interesting branches the book can lead to.Other than the three main characters, you also never know who is going to get pulled down to the dark side or who is already on the dark side and we just don't know it yet.There is an amazing variety of various and sundry animals and ghosts with crazy uncontrollable powers, there is a huge base of interesting background and history from characters long since dead, there are hidden vaults and old libraries, prophesies, and very real and evil twisting and torturing of the good to get them to move to the evil side.I love these books and have ordered the next three. A whole new world is opening to me and in some ways, it is even better than the sacred trilogy. It is definitely more adult and certainly not as beautiful and poetic, but the story telling is gripping."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"i enjoyed this book very much.

I have to admit that I enjoyed the first two books (w/ some exceptions when they were rather over the top). Unfortunately, the Blood of the Fold is painfully slow, and so much of the story is downright absurd. As many of the other reviewers have mentioned, the book repeats the same themes from the first two books over and over again (primarily evil psychotic beings controlling sadistic \\"tools,\\" or the tortured-kind-hearted woodsman with unbelievable potential who just wants to go home or see his True Love, etc.). So when I realized I was feeling rather perplexed as to how I got suckered into this series, I decided to take a look at reader reviews to figure out what went wrong. In doing so, I came across one review -- and felt my jaw drop when I read in defense of the Blood of the Fold, \\"You will not see nasty words, vulgarity, incest (unlike some series), porno, or any kind of depravity in the name of literature [in this book]. This series touches on some violence and deals with real world issues...\\" I am sorry - but those statements don't represent this book whatsoever. In fact, I am at a loss how the reviewer even read the same series I did. The amount of redundant, glorifying, silly-yet-sick violence in this book is absurd. As the story drones on and on with new obstacles & evil beings trying to kill Richard and Kahlen, gore & guts are thrown in every chapter in the absence of anything really happening. Action scenes are primarily taken up with women being raped and tortured, men and women being torn to pieces by evil beings (including humans)... the list goes on. Bottomline, the story is itself tortured - with the main character, Richard, now an unbearably silly man, and the antagonists all evil to the core, or psychotic and blood thirsty. The stereotypes are endless.... Sadly, I agree with so many of the negative comments about this book. Basically, really poor writing & character development for the most part; although I enjoyed some of the story surrounding the Sisters of the Light at the Palace this time around - at least this far into the book. Perhaps things will get better in the 2d half when Kahlen comes back, but from what the reviews have stated, it's unlikely. Of course, I guess we've got to give Goodkind some credit for keeping with the series ... on and on and on... page after page."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"Goodkind does it again - superb characters and a world that just works.

If we could just cross this with Dorothy Dunnett, bringing her extremely intellectual story down a bit to merely very intelligent...I would enjoy it so much more!Is there any way Brandon Sanderson could rewrite this? Okay, okay, I'm being rude. But so is Goodkind with his jerky sentences. He'll have a stretch of lovely sentences and then short, juvenile statements crop up. I don't know if he thinks I'm stupid and won't notice or if he's tired of writing. I wish Goodkind had been a bit more forthcoming about the yabree--its effects and purpose--and the effect of the cape. I'll hope he plans to be more informative inTemple of the Winds (Sword of Truth, #4).I loved the scene where Richard dissolved the Midlands and gave \`em all what for! Just imagining the fear, anger, and frustration on all those countries who did not step up for Kahlan is...such a joy. Oh, too funny...I love Kahlan's response to Berdine's comments at the end about Raina's hands! Hoist with her own petard!We finally learn just how the book of magic got into George Cypher's hands and why Richard was left in Westland. There's an interesting interpretation of the Third Rule, passion rules reason. A twist upon the twist.Brogan's collapse and descent were too easy. Goodkind was doing such a great job having him start to question the \\"Creator\\" who appeared in his dreams, and then all of a sudden he goes nuts??It's wheels within wheels within yet more wheels and betrayals abound. It's a bit like the sisters from the Wheel of Time, don't trust a Sister of the Light to keep a promise. I certainly can't wait to see what Nathan plans for Annalina now that he's free. And with that little display Zedd makes...hmmm...seems Zedd has his own wheels turning.The StorySix Dark Sisters have fled the Palace of the Prophets and the Sisters of the Light must cremate the old prelate before they elect a new one, Kahlan has secretly escaped execution, and Richard has found his way back to Aydindril only to find it occupied byD'Haran troops working for the Imperial Order and mriswith invading the city in small bands.Luckily, the Mord-Sith find Richard before he gets into too much trouble. -Never thought I'd say Mord-Sith and luck in the same breath! So, now all Richard has to do is conquer all of the Midlands and put down the Imperial Order. It seems that he'll have a variety of magical help from a bond devised by a Rahl ancestor to a clever bit of economic sleight of hand to the secret of the mriswith. All delivered with a very firm hand.The CharactersRichard formerly-Cypher, now-Rahl, Master Rahl, has left his newly-loyal troops behind in D'Hara. He has a duty as the Seeker, wearing the Sword of Truth to protect the innocent. Cara, Hally, Berdine, and Raina are Mord-Sith who have come with Egan and Ulic (D'Haran soldiers and personal bodyguards to Rahl) to find and protect Richard. Gratch is the short-tailed gar Richard rescued and raised.Even though she is under a death spell, Kahlan Amnell is now Queen of Galea. At least until her sister Cyrilla can recover from the torture and rape she endured. Seems she will garner yet more crowns, too. Accompanying her back to Ebinissia are Orsk, Jebra, Ahern, Prince Harold, and Captain Ryan. They intend to reclaim Ebinissia and restore it as the capital of Galea.Zedd Zorander is Richard's grandfather and the First Wizard. Adie is with Zedd and Kahlan heading for Ebinissia until Gratch arrives with Richard's letter.Mistress Sanderholt is the head cook at the Confessors' Palace. General Reibisch is in command of the D'Haran troops for the emperor in Aydindril.Cathryn, Duchess of Lumholtz is next in line for the throne of Kelton but Brogan gets to her first. Valdora and her granddaughter Holly sell honeycakes in Aydindril, but it seems there is quite a bit more to Valdora than expected. GeneralBaldwin leads the Keltan army; I can't figure out if he was subtle in his leading Richard or was simply that blunt.The Sisters of the Light are all sorceresses dedicated to the Creator; the Sisters of the Dark give their souls over to the Keeper. Nathan Rahl is an ancestor of Richard's and about 1,000-years-old. His magical Gift is Prophecy, which has caused him to be held prisoner by the Sisters of the Light. Sister Verna Sauventreen is the one who collared Richard and took him back to the Palace of the Prophets for training. Warren is one of the wizards collared by the Sisters; turns out he has an unexpected Gift. Sisters Leoma Marsick, Philippa, Dulcinia, Maren, Phoebe, Christabel, Amelia, Janet, Becky, and the tormented Simona--some are of the Dark, and Annalina is expecting Verna to figure out which. Kevin is one of the Imperial Guards at the Palace who was befriended by Richard. Millie is the maid who cleans for the prelate.The Dark Sisters who fled include Ulicia, Tovia, Cecilia, Armina, Nicci, and Merissa. They use and abuse Captain Blake and sailors of the Lady Sefa upon which they've fled only to find themselves used and abused in turn. Not that it seems to engender any compassion in them. Emperor Jagang is a dream walker. A being not seen in this world in over 3,000 years. It's taken him 20 years to conquer the Old World. He doesn't intend to for his Imperial Order to take that long with the New.Lord General Tobias Brogan leads the Blood of the Fold who are from Nicobarese. He believes all magic is evil, a tool of the Keeper, and casually accuses anyone he dislikes of being a baneling. His sister Lunetta has Han and he abuses her even as he uses her. He believes that love means being willing to slit her throat himself. Funnily enough, Brogan may want to eliminate all magic, but he certainly uses it for his own purposes happily enough.The Keeper is who we might see as Satan while the Creator is God. The Palace of the Prophets is where the Sisters of the Light live and work in the Old World. The Wizard's Keep and the Confessors' Palace are located in Aydindril in the Midlands, the former seat of power. Han is the force of magic with Additive and Subtractive Magic. Mriswith are monsters who become invisible. The Mord-Sith are usually women unbearably tortured for years into becoming torturers themselves. They generally dress in red leather--doesn't show the blood. The Sliph is another of those beings created during that long-ago war. \\"Kolo\\" is a long-dead wizard with a message.The TitleThe title is the most immediate threat to the peace of the Midlands for the Blood of the Fold is more interested in an Imperial alliance."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"Although not as intense as \\"Stone of Tears,\\" it was still hard to put down. It was addicting enough, that I read the book in less than a week. My only complaint was that there wasn't much in the book about the Blood of the Fold. But that's O.K. I didn't like them anyway. The origins of Gars and Mriswiths is explained in this book, and that was pretty neat."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"\\"I am the bringer of death\\", in Terry Goodkind's novel, Blood of the Fold, he uses his expertise to create a world of fantasy seem more of a realistic world making his characters seem like someone who really exists.In this novel Goodkind creates a struggle of epic proportions against the forces of the evil Jageng, a dreamwalker, a man with the power over ones dreams. The only way to find refuge against his power is to swear loyalty to Richard, a woods guide turned ruler of a nation, Jageng wants to enslave the world for his own bidding and anyone who stands in his way he plans to destroy. His fury has been unleashed from his prison behind the Towers of Peradon in Old World when Richard destroyed them. Richard now has plans on conquering the world not for power though in stead he wishes to protect the lands from Jageng.Goodkind does a great job of describing everything vividly yet doesn't dwell on unimportant details. When he describes a setting he makes it feel like it comes out of the book and fills the room with all the sights, sounds, and smells he creates.Goodkind also depicts his characters with as much care as he describes his setting. Describing them well in detail, both physically and mentally making each character feel like a close friend or mortal enemy.He creates a great plot with much action and many plot twists, it also jumps around between characters, both good and bad, giving you a broad view of the story instead of just a small part of it.Goodkind's use of language in this novel is easy to understand for the most part, there are a few spots where he uses words that make no sense, but they tell you what the words mean so there's never any confusion.This book is greatly written pulling the reader into a land of fantasy masterfully created and gives a feeling of total release from everyday life."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"Quite simply Jordon and Goodkind have similar writing styles. I can only read a certain style of writing and they BOTH have it. Deep character development and elaborate staging are key. I am normally an Historical Fiction lover with a lean toward ancient civilizations so i guess i was a nantural victim for fantasy writer to embroil in his/her plots.I don't think either author can be seen to have been vying for the same storyline any more than the under-current in most fantasies covering the &quot;good/evil' storyline.JOrdon is superior in depth and scope while Goodkind is superior in readability and flow. Jordon's Wheel of Time is more closely aligned with the real world and contains more realistic mythical creatures inasmuch as they can almost be imagined as having once existed or likely to walk out of the bedroom closet at any moment late at night while absorbed in his books. Goodkind's series is more true to fantasy and its mythical creatures and peoples are well and truly &quot;out there&quot; for the reader to gobble up and envision in his or her own mind.Why spoil either by taking one for the other. Both are worth every penny this lover of mega novels has paid."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"I'm new to the fantasy genre and just recently stumbled upon the SOT series -- and I'm hooked. I'm finding that I'm staying up all night more and more because I can't wait to find out what happens next. I'm currently on the Temple of the Winds, and Blood of the Fold seems a distant memory -- even though I only finished it last week. While Blood of the Fold has not been my favorite, it was great nonetheless.One of the things I love about this series is that Goodkind manages to constantly introduce new characters -- I thought I only cared to read about Richard and Kaylan -- but now I'm also excited about Verna, Warren, etc. and look forward to Goodkind developing those characters. (I probably have the spelling wrong because I'm only listening to the audio tapes). I also love the humor via the Mord Siths. And I don't want to give too much away, but the way Richard takes control of things is very satisfying.There are, unfortunately, subplots which I did not take to. I thought too much time was wasted on the blood of the fold -- it didn't really lead anywhere. The storyline about the Mriswith was also not very well developed -- it was tossed into the mix with little explanation.Oh well, I better stop before I give too much away."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"Albeit not the greatest book I have read in the series, Blood of the Fold is still quite a good one. The only tiring thing I find about it is the fact that yet again Kahlan and Richard are split up to complete their own separete tasks. I only hope that this will not be the case in the fourth book.The characters are once again fleshed out nicel and everyone is covered. From the insane leader of the Blood of the Fold, his bewitched sister, Gratch and many many others, the story unfolds with suspense that leaves you on the edge of your seat.I also found that Goodkind delved shallowly into the issue of homosexuality, with two lesbians. Although I found the cover good, I also found that I was laughing near the end over the joke between Kahlan and Berdine. The fact that he covered this issue made me feel good. As many books look at it in a negative way. I am glad that this one was different.If you enjoyed the two previous books then I recommend this one also, as it too is full of murder, mystery and many suprises which will keep you readin well into the night."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"This book suffers from the same disease that plagued Stone of Tears.The story is way too loose.Its not as loose as it was in Stone of Tears, but it has a good ending, if a bit strange.It does, on the other hand, reveal a lot of mysteries that entered my head while reading Stone of Tears.While I felt that Stone of Tears was more like a &quot;character developement&quot; book, this one seems more like a &quot;mystery revealer book&quot;.By the way, I'm currently reading Temple of the Winds and it is even better than Wizard's First Rule!Wonderful storytelling, wonderful detail, wonderful characters, wonderful world, loose story."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"Goodkind has done it again; although, he is remaining true to his fans.

I felt though that this book was more of an introduction to the fourth book, but still good enough. I am also glad to see that the improved writing style. You won't see the lead characters, Richard and Kahlan, crying and whining every 20 pages. The stress on the Wizard's rules and Richard's &quot;think of the solution and not the problem&quot; motto were less over-drawn, which can be a bit annoying in the previous books. The story was good, but I was acutally more drawn into the story of the Sisters of Light than that of Richard. I found myself hoping that nest chapter would focus on the Sister Verna or the Prelate. Maybe because Richard did so many things that went wrong or stupid that turned out to be right, just because he is the hero. 4 stars because despite the flaws, its still a good fantasy and a worthy addition to the Sword of Truth series."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"im 27 now and ive read this book 2 years ago back in the philippines...i always wanted to own one.the spirit of the leads (khalan n richard) gives inspiration in my day to day struggle...that every difficulty needs a certain faith...faith to those people whom you know wont let u down...and knowing that you are not alone would give you an inner strength to go on and fight...this book will make you relize, to its full extent, that love is always the foundation.this book emits a lot of magic...literally,emotionally..!magic in the sense that this will make you wish you were the mother confessor."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"Goodkind finally seems to be improving his writing style. This book is more of a straight-forward adventure novel, which is good. It's something Goodkind can write decently. He doesn't get burdened down with juvenile philosophy (there is a wizzard's rule, but it isn't important) or sappy emotion. This book also gives insight into Goodkind's world (neither of the first showed us anything). The ancient war is kind of cool, and the twist at the end with the mriswith was well done. This book is still not particullarly intelectual, and the characters are fairly flat, but as a purely entertaining hack-and-slash book, Blood of the Fold succeeds pretty well."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"While Wizard's First Rule was a really enjoyable read, by the time we reach this the third book the series is becoming formulaic and simply annoying.

It's just the same stuff all over again."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"First of all, the only reason that these books are selling at all is that there are a lot of mindless adolescents out there who have no ability to discern good writing from bad. I agree that this book is entertaining and that it makes you want to read on, but afterwards, you realize that the book is just plain stupid. There is no plot, first of all. Could anybody tell me what Jagang's goals were? What did he want out of what he was doing? What does the &quot;Blood of the fold&quot; have to do with anything that is happening in the story? All they are are simpletons that have been taken by a drean walker...... and they don't even do anything important. We see Jagang once, and he is just some guy who likes torturing people and who likes body-piercing. Oh, and could anybody explain to me why Zedd had to cast a death spell on Kahlan? With the D'harans in control of the city, what was the point of doing it? The Characters are still the barbie and Ken representations: they are perfectly formed, and they are stupid. I dare anyone to write to me and tell me what the story behind the book was. And while you are doing that, add in a description of what Jagang's goals are and who he is. Finally, I think that this book is trash that appeals to mindless adolescents and it should be forgotten, by bying these books people, you are making a sick, childish man rich, just think about that."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"Terry Goodkind's &quot;world&quot; is just a bunch ofstuck-together cliches without a life of itsown. Some may say that Goodkind is &quot;holding back&quot; on world details because he is using Richard's viewpoint, but Frodo Baggins knew even less than Richard about Middle Earth at large and Tolkien's world still came alive in the first chapter of the first book. If the author truly has spent time on his world, there's just a &quot;knowing&quot; quality to the writing...even though there may not be a lot of details, we still feel like the author knows this place well and is taking us on a tour of it. With Goodkind, this feeling is noticably absent."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"This book was good, the plot was interesting, but I have to say that it is already old. The story is as a reviewer put it, a soap opera episode, with each book being a \\"new installment\\", never finishing. The pattern of suspense, drama, dark torture and then a rushed conclusion is seen in this as well.PLOT:What can I say, it was interesting and it wasn't a problem that was conjectured up out of then air. I have to say that is was fairly creative. Especially with the dwelling into the history of magic hating. However, Richard's genius, and ability to get out of any situation has gotten really annoying. If they had said he is a \\"rare person\\" one more time I would have thrown the book across the wall. The romance was nice, and it was really sweet to see them together. The continuing simplicity of the narrative is also well paced.CONCLUSION:It is a soap opera, and it won't end for another 10 books or so. I recommend, read the first three/four, and if the ending of the series in the next years gets any better, then you should probably continue. If not, read this book and/or the next, then write at the bottom of the last page, \\"Richard and Kahlan live happily ever after.

Sure, there ARE similarities, but a REAL read of both authors finds that they are purely coincidental, and not meant to 'rip-off' the other. BOTH authors are good in their own way, and the comparisons are as fair as saying that Star Wars ripped off Star Trek simply because the Millennium Falcon jumps to Hyperspace. I 'SEE' the similarity, but I also realize they are COMPLETELY different, and not as similar as some would like to think. After originally reading 'Blood of the Fold' I felt a bit dissappointed when compared to the first two books...but now after re-reading it, I have decided that my original 'review' was a bit harsh. The only book in the series that was truly a let down was the most recent, &quot;Soul Of The Fire&quot;. Other than that, the first 4 books are clearly superior to most (if not all) fantasy novels in print today. I AM partial to Goodkind, but that doesn't mean I can't see the obvious talent that Jordan has...but for ME, Goodkind seems to hit home, just like Jordan 'clicks' with others and SOME find them ALL worthless. Reviews are just opinions, and we ALL know how varied they can be, right? You just have to read the books for yourself to make a judgement call. So go ahead and read Jordan AND Goodkind and make up your OWN mind. Either way, if you are a fan of fantasy, you will most likely enjoy EVERY minute. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"Terry Goodkind, Blood of the Fold (Tor, 1996)Back when I was a kid, I was crazy about the various exploits of Donald Sobol's pint-sized sleuth Encyclopedia Brown. There was rarely a week where I didn't have at least one Encyclopedia Brown book out of at least one library somewhere near wherever I was living at the time. A fine set of books, those. Each was a collection of various mini-mysteries solved by Brown (and, later, his gorgeous sidekick Sally Kimball; after all, every sleuth needs a gorgeous sidekick, right?) in the space of a few pages. Sobol's books had only one problem. Since the stories were collected from other sources, the first few pages of each were like a broken record, giving all the same details about how the \\"office\\" in EB's garage was set up, reintroducing the characters, etc.For some reason, Terry Goodkind saw fit to pull a Donald Sobel in Blood of the Fold, book three in the Sword of Truth series. The first two books, each verging on the thousand-page mark, blaze the way for a fantasy series that, if there is any justice in the world, is destined to become a classic. Blood of the Fold, however, is barely two-thirds of the length of those first two, and Goodkind spends a good chunk of the first hundred fifty pages in reacquaintance. It would make more sense had there been some of it in the second book in the series, or if this book had an extra hundred fifty pages over and above what the first two have to compensate. But given the brevity, one gets the distinct feeling that the book was padded at the insistence of a publisher who wanted to keep Goodkind pumping out one book per year.Not to say that Blood of the Fold isn't still a good book. Once you've invested two thousand pages' worth of time in any fantasy series, it's doubtful that re-reading stuff about what's happened before (no matter how much of it there is) is going to deter the reader from going on and finding the four hundred-odd pages of new stuff. And with Goodkind's usual readable style and almost nonstop action, the pages fly by here just as fast as they did in Wizard's First Rule and Stone of Tears. Of course, with only two-thirds of the bulk, that means you finish the book that much faster. Make sure you've got a copy of Temple of the Winds (book four) lying around before you start this one, oryou may find yourself looking for a twenty-four hour bookstore at three in the morning. *** 1/2"},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"Personally my favorite book in the sword of truth saga.

Goodkind kept the story building from book to book and I found that once I got started, I couldn't put it down. And the characters were so well developed that you would feel their every victory and anguish. Some might find that I'm too emotional about the characters but truly, the only other character that can get me like this reading a book is Raymond E. Feist's Jimmy the Hand. Unlike other fantasies who attempt at describing spell casting as muttering of words or waving of hands, Goodkind has created his own magical world, with the Mother Confessioner's power, the powers of the ancestors etc. Definitely worth the sleepless nights!"},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"Blood of the Fold is an awesome book. It seems a little rushed at times , but very well written. It's nice to read these books and not have so many terrible things happening that you can hardly read it. This book is a good balance. Nice read."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"Except for a few spare moments in the book, this was one of the worst fantasybooks I ever read. No plot, stupid characters and an even dumber main character. How many Rules are there? I hope it will end soon."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"Geez. Good v.s. Evil..wow what intelligence it takes towrite about that! Love at first sight..what brilliance!Sappiness and preachiness..what a stunning mind it takes to explore these things! Really, Goodkind's books are as dumb as they come. Intelligence is looking at the world in a different way--when goodkind's world isn't even his own, that's kinda difficult."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"First, I just want to say I only read this book because my friend wanted me to, to try to convince me he's good. Well he's not. I swore off Goodkind after The Stone of Tears, and I wish I hadn't bothere to read this one. Terry Goodkind is horrible. He contradicts himself, has stupid plotpoints, some of the cheesiest dialogue I've ever heard, and rips everything off Jordan. Granted, Jordan may have pulled everything from Dune, but at least he had the entire plot in mind when he started writing. Goodkind makes it up as he goes along. That's why plot points get left out until the last possible second. PLEASE, stop reading him. That he's been published is an insult to fantasy authors everywhere. Read Robin Hobb instead. She doesn't have enough fans anyway."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"If Goodkind's novels are a gift at all, they're an invitationto go backwards in thought instead of forward. He makeshis world too simple, and this simplicity makes it boring. Pure good vs pure evil has been done, and its time has passed. Goodkind's characters always claim &quot;righteousness&quot; and &quot;truth,&quot; but this sounds like fanaticism to me; to think that anyone knows the ultimate truth about anything is to let the world know you're a fool. The books are fun-- but so is heroin. End of story."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"Love these stories. They are well written and also have a message.

This book, and the others in the series are just what they were advertised as. I wish all sites were as good to deal with."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"The Sword of Truth series is just one long story separated into 12 books. The Blood of the Fold is the third chapter and, as in the previous two, is well written.The only issue someone might have is that every minute detail, no matter how small, is included. Someone might find that a little tedious to read, and someone else might find it makes the story more enjoyable. I'm in the middle as sometimes the detail seems to take just too many pages, and yet, later in the story, in most cases, you find the information useful.Simply put, I am enjoying this series tremendously."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"I am not usually a big reader, but I have not been able to put this series down since I started.I am looking forward to finishing the series.I have to say that this book showed a little more brutal side to he Midlands, but that is what helps keep me going back for more."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"I ordered Terry Goodkind's Sword of Truth Series in the Kindle version; I like the story, though it is way too similar to the Robert Jordan \\"Wheel of Time\\" series, even using some of the same names for main characters; but my main issue is with the editing: there are many errors in spelling, missing words, double words and other editorial issues; I'm hoping this is not true for other Kindle products I have yet to finish reading, but it's been true in the books of this series I've read thus far; I do love how they appear on my Kindle through the \\"ethers,\\" and, in general, like the story, but not the repetition (which feels like a means of bringing the reader up to date if they missed the earlier books, but is tedious to wade through if you have read the all)"},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"Last weekend, I blazed through The Wizard's First Rule and loved it. Decided to watch it after being so disappointed that Legend of the Seeker was cancelled. I have not read novels in years, before becoming a MA and PhD student... I just read the last book from the Harry Potter's series and that wet my appetite for similar books.So, I enjoyed the first book via Kindle (though would have enjoyed being able to listen to it via Kindle). I was disappointed when I could not get Book #2, Stone of Tears, on Kindle. So, I went on to Book #3... what on earth has happened to Richard???? First of all, he uses language that is not in keeping with his character of a woodman's guide. How has he become this crazy ruler? Did I miss that much in Stone of Tears? I don't recognize him and his character leaves me cold. I miss the relationships with Zedd and Kahlan. He has no true peers and he has no one to be his checks and balances.My plan was to read the series to get me away from my school studies once in awhile but if the the characters and story goes the way of Book 3, I will have to find some other distraction."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"This is the third book in the expansive series entitled \\"The Sword of Truth\\". We find Richard is coming to accept the magic that runs in his veins. He is finally more comfortable with the Sword of Truth at his side and with his instinctive magic. It's nice not hearing him complain every 100 pages about how much he doesn't like magic. In fact, he is beginning to accept it as a diversifying element across the continent. With the Imperial Order looming at large it is difficult to take this side since they are hellbent on removing all traces of magic even though they use sorceresses and the like as scent hounds to root out others with the 'gift'. With Mord-Sith at his side, assassination attempts, and high end drama we are once again wrapped up in Goodkind's world.The Sisters of the Dark are still at large and just as deadly as ever. They embody the Seven Deadly Sins and aren't afraid to pursue them to their ends. This puts them in a peculiar spot since the Keeper's influence has been sucked back into the underworld by Richard in the previous book. Instead they are forced to follow the leader of the Imperial Order, a ruthless tyrant named Jagang. He is powerful and is capable of magic despite his desires to destroy all outside magical entities. These individuals are driven by the lust for immortality, their vanity, greed, and desires for domination. The same themes run in some of the Sisters of the Light, which makes everyone absolutely untrustworthy with the exception of Sister Verna. The Sisters of the Light are afraid to leave their immortal timelessness and are stuck in a stagnant atmosphere that is swiftly being brought to change because of Prelate Annalina and Richard's doings.On top of this threat is the Blood of the Fold, an elite set of soldiers who are a hop, skip, and a jump away from being a mini-Imperial Order. They hunt down 'banelings' and have done so for a long time. A 'baneling' is an agent of the Keeper and, unfortunately, the Blood of the Fold equates that with most magic users. And so we are introduced to Tobias Brogan, Lord General, and his sister Lunetta. The book was published in '96 so all you Harry Potter fans better not get your knickers in a twist because of the nickname \\"Loony\\" Lunetta and that she dresses oddly. To be sure, anything with the word Lunar associated with it normally has peculiarities in association with a long standing cultural stigma of the moon. Either way, Tobias uses his sister, who is a sorceress, to hunt down banelings, which, to him, includes the Mother Confessor (Kahlan) and the new Lord Rahl (Richard) once he gets a gander at him. So, naturally, this complicates things. To go even further are issues with the mriswith, a serpentine like creature mentioned in the previous book. For fear of giving much away I will say no more, only that they play an integral role in tightening knots. All in all these factors create an Axis and Allies kind of battleground where politics and fear reign supreme. On one side is world domination while wiping out a particular set of people while the other side fights to keep equality, diversity, and unison across the land.In this book we get an in depth discovery of not only how Aydindril works and will work in the future, but also how the Palace of the Prophets has worked for thousands of years. We get an idea of the Prelate's responsibilities and how they are quite similar to being a Mother Confessor. It seems both the Old and the New Worlds needed something like that.One problem I have with this book is that it doesn't leave a lot to assumption. In other words there aren't a lot of secrets or questions when we're reading this book. We get perspectives from everywhere, which gives us a 'know-it-all' perspective since other characters are in the dark about other people, places, or things. Otherwise it's a quick and easy read with a lot of action and a bit of nail-biting suspense."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"A good read for those folllowing the Sword of Truth series.Plenty of battles,Gars,bloodshed......good stuff! Adult themes also. I like the fact that there are strong female characters in this book, and the whole series as a matter of fact."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"This book is not quite as good as the first two. An interesting back story begins to emerge about the ancient war between the wizards and the dream walkers. A lot of interesting background information is presented, but the main plot line is a bit weaker than the first two books.After this book, the series starts to really go downhill."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"As ever Mr. Goodkind write a long windy book where the main plot gets wrapped up very quickly in a chapter or 2."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"the seeker continues; love this book series and the tv series- you must read the books to get the whole story"},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"The one problem i have with Goodkind is he is a terrible PLANNER of his books. He seems to write them book by book, having no overall plan as to where they are going. An example of this would be the main bad guys in each book. The first one has the standard evil guy. So Goodkind needs to one-up himeslf and make the next bad guy even badder. The second book (Stone of Tears) has the Keeper as the bad guy - a fearsome foe (seemed to me to be like a &quot;devil&quot; of the world, to those who have not read it). So in the third book he tries to make a guy more evil/powerful than the Devil himself, and comes up with... a &quot;Dreamwalker&quot;??!!Though the planning and structure of these books is nowhere near perfect (see Dennis L. McKiernan's series for an example of the most well thought out series ever in my opinion)... nonetheless I do love the series. Goodkind is incredibly addictive, the story is good and I personally cannot wait until the next one comes out.SUMMARY: read it and you'll like it. It is entertaining: treat it like a summer blockbuster movie. There's a lot of entertaining action but don't expect too much substance and don't expect a new way of looking at things."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"While I somewhat enjoyed the first two books, the third left me cold. I cannot imagine that this book would have ever been published on its own. I can only imagine that it was due to the the success of the previous two installments. Unfortunately, I will stop reading the SoT series here. There is not enough time for things like SoT when I know there is better work out there. Do yourself an immense favor and read the Tad Williams books in the &quot;Memory, Sorrow and Thorn&quot; series starting with the &quot;Dragonbone Chair&quot;."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"Even though Goodkind's less than subtle allegorical creation figures heavily in this book, it is still highly readable and worth it! It focuses more on Kahlan, and that is good, because she has become one of the strongest female protagonists in all fantasy since Mercedes Lackey's Paksennarion. The adventure and action is all very fast paced and colorfully done. One wishes that Goodkind would do more allusion than detail when it comes to some graphic items, but you can bypass the particularly extra scenes, as it were. Definately worth the money and time. Read it."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"Terry Goodkind gives way for us to all see through his eyes. Blood of the Fold is the third in the series and it just keeps getting better! One would think the series gets dull after 2 books, but it doesn't.

When Richard, in the first book, was in Westland, he put his trust into &quot;good spirits&quot;, now, after returning from his captivity everyone he knows now has the &quot;creator&quot; as there deity. Like Mistress Sanderholt. Also in Stone of Tears he says he has never heard of this &quot;creator&quot; and I got the impression Kahlan didn't either. Everyone new he meets after being imprisoned, like I said before, has the &quot;creator&quot; as there thingamajig.

This series has surprised me...When 'Wizard'sFirst Rule' came out, I was reluctant to start another multi-novel series with no pre-defined limitation on the number of installments(a la 'The Wheel of Time' series, which has spiraled out of control interms of length and direction).But Goodkind's series has rewarded my reluctant purchase of 'Wizard'sFirst Rule' with two more accomplished novels with substantialcharacter development.The strength of these novels is inherent in thatGoodkind does not extend outside the genre guidelines established by the likes ofEddings, Feist, and Brooks. Many of the characters venerated in thoseimmensely enjoyable series are paid homage in Goodkind's work, andit's therefore no surprise that if you liked those landmark series,you'll enjoy (as I do) Goodkind's series."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"When I first got Wizards First Rule I was a bit skyptical for I'm only 11 and this was a long book.

It opens with Richard taking control in Aydindril after having executed the Council. However, one of the lands in the Midland alliance, Nicobarese, is resistant to the new order Richard proposes, being controlled by the Blood of the Fold. Meanwhile, the scattered remnants of the Sisters of the Dark in the Old World are plotting Richard's demise.Heavier on political intrigue than the first two installments, Blood of the Fold is about Richard's first steps into becoming Lord Rahl, ruler of D'Hara, and how he handles being a leader, and not just a simple woods guide or even the Seeker of Truth.Favorite characters like Gratch and Nathan Rahl play fun parts here, and some new characters like Lunetta, Tobias Brogan, and Emporer Jagang (who will become the arch-villain of the series) are all fascinating.The biggest problem is that after what we learned about the Blood of the Fold in the previous book, the drama one might expect from a book specifically about them falls short of expectations. But those expectations were awfully high, and it would almost be unfair to Mr. Goodkind to demand that every book in his series top its predecessors, when he started out so spectacularly.The audio book version is well-narrated (probably my favorite naration in the series, as some of the others are a bit dry). The reader's deep, resonating voice suits the story very well."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"This book was actually a surprise for me, I enjoyed it more than book two.

If it deterorates, as some suggest, with book five or so, then I will abandon it like the Wheel of Time. But for the time being, I recommend this, assuming you've read the first two.

Although the focus of the novel is set more on war and the upcoming confrontation that Richard and Khalan are about to face, so in actuallity the book is more just a prelude to &quot;Temple of the Winds&quot; than a book itself, it isn't really the best of the series, perhaps close to mediocre."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"Hmm...where to begin? First, I thought the book was very fast paced, but had no real developement to the plot. Though, I do admire it for its realism. After all; life is not always productive.

Goodkind populates a fantastic world with wonderfull characters and detail... why should he stop at the end of the nice stuff? Is the object of Fantasy to illustrate a two-dimensional world with no meat, no guts, and no true evil? If one is looking to escape, immerse oneself in another land, or believe what they're reading, it only seems logical that such a fantasy world should include everything, no matter how disturbing. Unlike the rest of today's popular fiction, Goodkind uses a keen sense to rip the &quot;get the sword, kill the bad guy, rescue the damsel&quot; mockup cover off of the genre and stirs the reader's guts with clarity of vision and emotion. I have never been more moved by a series of books than by the Sword of Truth series. This is what making a world come to life is all about. Raw, unapologizing, and laced with truth, this series puts the reality into fantasy like masters of the genre used to."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"You know so far I have read all four of Mr. Goodkind's books, and I have been riveted to all of them.I realize that all have a right to their opinion on these books, but people do not have the right to bash the author. If you don't like his writings fine, state your opinion on the material. I don't know what kind of person Mr. Goodkind is in his private life, but I do know he can write. That is all that matters to me.I feel people come here for honest reviews on books. Not to read someone's personal opinion on the author's private life. Or to read this book sucks!!! What I want in a review is why did you like it, or why didn't you like it.I like Mr.Goodkind's books because they put a new twist on an old idea. He can scare the pants off you, and then make you feel sorry for the villian. There are similarities to the writings of authors before him, but tell me an author that hasn't used from another. This is true of all authors not just fantasy fiction writers.As for the sexual violence well it adds spice to the plot, and there is a reason if you look deep enough for it. I have said this before, and will say it again. I have not seen these books advertised without a warning that the sexual, and violent content may offend some readers warning. So if you didn't see it PAY MORE ATTENTION!!!!!!! If you did see the warning and read this series anyway. You got just what you were asking for so STOP WHINING!!!!Keep up the good work Mr. Goodkind, and don't let unintelligent reviews get you down...."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"Richard starts out creating the bond to have the D'Haran troops join together under his command.

Sister Verna, now Plelate has to take charge and can only trust Warren, still fearing that there are Sisters of the Dark in the Palace.

There isn't as much action than the last one, but the plot twists and such keep it at a good rate anyways. I still have trouble trying to read accounts of semi-main characters without hoping to get to the next chapter where Richard or Kahlan are the subjects, but doing so helped me like those characters more. I also enjoy reading points-of-view from the bad guys, the Lord General of the Blood of the Fold for example.The explanations of some the creatures is brought forward like the mriswith and gar.

When I first started it, I decided to take it slow, having just come off of the monumentous task of reading the 1000 page stone of tears. Goodkind, however, drew me in with his marvelous plot and characters. I did find it odd that he named the book blood of the fold, and they really didn't play a big part in my eyes, but that is, for the most part, the only thing bad worth mentioning. If you have read the first two books, definatly pick this one up."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"Although as many people keep pointing out, Goodkinds later books do not seem to be as amazing as Wizard's First Rule, you have to remember that you all read Wizard's as virgins to Goodkinds world. It seems to me that he is slowly unfolding the saga of Richard Rahl over the span of his books, which in turn has left some of them the task of slightly bridging gaps in the story, allowing time for the epic to consolidate and then to take it forward again. 'Fold' does this. The set up of the oligarchic blood of the fold gives us something else to contemplate for a while. And while the ongoing thread of Richard and Kahlan's affair becomes tangible at times, it is still there to a add a degree of credibility to the continuity of the story.I think what Goodkind is doing is slowly spinning out his story through the books and giving us a chance to fully sample the world he has created through various adventures. While I agree at times the writing isn't always outstanding and that parts of the books can become tedious, I feel that we stray away from the simple fact that this is all tumbling out of the guys head, and we, the reader are privileged to have the chance to join him in his fantasy. I personally have enjoyed all his books to date and can't wait for the next one."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"I was tempted to rate this a 1, but decided that the sheer gore and brutality made _Blood of the Fold_ readable, if not overly stimulating. The running theme of these books is not truth, but is instead an oversexed fetishism that would shock and disturb veteran purveyors of hard core pornography. Incest, rape, and sexual torture seem to lurk around every corner of Goodkind's universe, reflecting dubious qualities of the author. Terry Goodkind has all the appeal of a letter-to-the-editor from a dirty magazine."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"I've read all the reviews in here. I would like to say that Ilove The Sword Of Truth series and I hope it never ends!!! I read all3 books one after the other in a weeks time. I've also read Eddings and Jordan. I believe the reason the world was not ^M build up is because you are seeing it through Richard's eyes. What you learn about the world is from what he knows of it. In the beginning he knew very little of his world or it's history. As the story grows and he learns more about the history and the land around him, you still only know what Richard knows. Just like you only know what you know. There is really no telling how big this world really is.. It doesn't really matter if it was small. I would be more then happy to read just about Richard and Kahlan life together and their friends around them. There's alot more to this story then Good versions Evil! It's about friendship, and then love, and the hardships they have to face. I like that the book was kept simple and not overflown with descriptions and you just couldn't wait to see what was next. Let me ask you a question: when you go to pick up a new book don't you expect the hero to win? I know I do, it's all in the way he or she does it that matters. You don't expect the bad guys to win do you. That would be strange wouldn't it.The main reason I'm writing this is for the ones that haven't read the books before, and have read the others, like Jordan and Eddings which are amoung my favorites. If you try to see things through Richard's and Kahlan's eyes you'll enjoy this series. You shouldn't compared to different arthors. There's just to many things in any story that you could say came from this or that story. It all comes down to how will you liked the characters. If you didn't like the characters you wouldn't like the book that much. You don't have to worry about that here though, But there is always someone out there that just doesn't give a book and chance and kills the story for themselves before for it every gets starts.For all the one's that didn't get the story. I feel sorry for you, because you just missed out on one of the best stories I have read in a long time. I Thank Terry Goodkind for bring Richard and Kahlan into my life!!!KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK TERRY!!!"},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"I have to say that I am a faithful reader of Goodkind. I feel that his style of writing, althoughcertainly not a new genre, is certainly refreshing. He gives the reader something to lookforward to throughout the plot, as well as at the end of the novel, and I certainly can't same thesame thing for many of the other books that I have read in the past.I have read the other reviews of this book, and although I am not writing a review of the opinionspresented by other visitors to this sight, I have to say that I don't agree with the people whohave stated Terry Goodkind is a &quot;bad&quot; writer. He presents a story line that is enjoyable to follow,as well as characters that are either heroic or despicable. Many books today present the reader withtoo many &quot;gray areas&quot; into which fall their main characters. I feel that Goodkind has intentionallyavoided this, and as a result, allow the reader to cheer on the heroes and loathe the villains.In a day and age where it seems impossible to tell right from wrong, Terry Goodkind has presented uswith a gift. This gift is a series of books that allows for an enjoyable read as well as some food forthought. I applaud Mr. Goodkind for his work, and have only to say that I await his next novel!---Sarah B. Cypher"},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"Between reading the books of this series, I've read a few other books as well, and after plodding through several other authors works, I came back to this series with a newfound respect for Goodkind's prose and plotting. Personally, I don't see what more a reader could ask for in an epic fantasy- there's romance, suspense, plenty of action, and enough mystique about the world Goodkind has created to keep a person wanting more. It's not as though I hand out five star reviews all that often either- this is the only book I have ever given five stars (And though I haven't written a lot of reviews, I have read a lot of books and would covet perhaps only one other with a five star rating.) For whatever reason, it seems that there is a flux of mixed reviews, both of people who really enjoy this series and of people who don't appreciate it. Accusations of copycating other author's works seem to be a common theme amongst those who don't like it, but when all is said and done, every author borrows ideas- there is no shame in studying prose and reading books to guide you along the way in your own storytelling. It's the extent to which it is done that would be indicative of outright plagurism. Overdoing the so called \\"borrowing of ideas\\", of course, would actually implicate plagurism, but I think when \\"borrowing ideas\\" for a story is done in proper measure, the resulting story would more appropriately be termed as being \\"inspired as a result of\\" or a \\"work in the spirit of it\\" rather than a \\"ripoff\\" or a \\"copycat.\\" Technically, according to the standards some reviewers have deemed appropriate, almost any author who could have a book placed into a particular genre could be classified as someone who copies ideas, because there are common themes that run in certain books that allow it to be categorized into one genre or another, and the very fact that it can even be categorized at all is proof that it is \\"unoriginal.\\" You could probably name the fantasy books that don't have either some form or appearance by either a dragon, a king, or a castle on one hand. Take this review for what it's worth, this book and the whole series is definitely original enough in its own right, and it is well worth reading."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"Okay, Okay, I don't know how to spell that monster. But, on the cover of this book there is a red creature which, I hoped, was Scarlet. Scarlet, you may recall, was the Dragon in the first book. What happened to her anyway? In fact, the way Richard Rahl befriends animals, and the fact that he was a ranger, I thought he was going to be an &quot;animal wizard.&quot;Nope, he is still a war wizard, and it shows in this book. There is more fighting and magic in this book then the first two. We have new creatures and some old friends including Nathan, Zedd, Gaaarcth and Ann. The writer has really reached his stride. This book is better then the first two, and they were great.There really is everything here. Richard's romance with Kahlan continues and, perhaps, he has a new love. We are introduced to a new villian who hunts down and kills people with magic. There are some horrible, but great, battle scenes as some cites are sacked and the residents pay the price. And, at the end of the book, there are two great epic battles - with Monsters. If you don't like this book, you just don't like fantasy. I like fantasy and, as I said I loved this book, it was simply great."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"Not recommended. The story of an exciting, if plug-ugly, fantasy world becomes disfigured by sadomasochistic abuse above and beyond the call of plot and theme.I found the third volume of Goodkind's _The Sword of Truth_ significantly inferior to its predecessors. _Wizard's First Rule_ and _The Stone of Tears_ were interesting, if flawed, in that the tales were fast-paced and the major personal dilemmas of the characters presented in each novel were resolved by the end, making it possible to admire their crafting as stories.The first two works seem to be flawed by two things. First, there is the kind, extent, and depiction of sadomasochistic sexual violence therein. In _Wizard's First Rule_, I found the portrayal of the Mord-Sith jarring; the emphasis on &quot;training&quot; directed to sexual slavery is so obviously drawn from modern BDSM that it detracts strongly from any sense of the setting as a unique fantasy world with its own development and history. It's intrusive partly because it's out of place: torture directed against the protagonist would far more reasonably have been intended to extract information from him, not make him a Mord-Sith's pet. Instead, the villain allows him to be subjected to this and then simply lets him go free when it fails as an interrogation strategy, despite the protagonist's being a severe danger to him.Second, none of the peoples in the books are particularly sympathetic, partly because of the abuses of either sex by the various cultures depicted. None of the good peoples in _The Lord of the Rings_ are flawless, but they are very distinctive and it's possible to regard their individual cultures with affection, such that one would mourn the passing of the cultures of the dwarves, the elves, the hobbits, etc., had Sauron won. This is not the case in Goodkind's world. While the 'bad guys' are very dark indeed, in many cases being depicted as sexual perverts or deranged fanatics with a taste for the torture, rape and murder of adults and children, the portrayal of the 'good guys' is inconsistent in that while they are often held up as being genuinely concerned about people, and the protagonist is successfully portrayed that way as an individual, they are often seen supporting political power structures that in practice could not fail to be other than atrociously abusive.We are, for example, continually told that the Confessors are the protectors of the weak and the innocent against the unscrupulously powerful in the Midlands because they can dominate any kingdom, by virtue of the power of having the ability to commit a form of mental rape that destroys the free will of the victim and bonds them to helpless devotion to the Confessor exercising the power. The Confessors can, and do, take any men they choose as their mates, willing or no, married or no, fathers of families already or no, by exercising their magic of domination; and the Confessor will compel the man to slay any infant sons he fathers--male Confessors will invariably abuse the power. (Evidently, what the female Confessors do is not abusive.) We see the heroine (a Confessor) regarding this as tragic when she falls in love with the hero, but none of the 'good guys' take any exception to the Confessors effectively raping the fathers of their children and forcing them to murder their sons, as a system.Both sexes are used abominably in this series. Many of the women, important and unimportant, are raped or nearly raped and sometimes mutilated by the villains; this is portrayed as a very deep evil. Men are also degraded, dominated, tortured, and raped by women, but this is not portrayed as a thing so black or unforgivable, by and large: those brutalizing males generally are painted in shades of grey rather than black as are those brutalizing females--though the Confessors, disturbingly, are painted in shades of white. Because of this, it is difficult to love any of the peoples or cultures we see depicted in detail, and, thus, some of the suspense we might have felt at their being imperiled is muted--though the villains are so unrelievedly dark that we are not completely indifferent.Nothwithstanding these flaws, Goodkind's pacing and scenes are sufficiently gripping that I read the first two books with considerable interest. Unfortunately, the story in this third book, _Blood of the Fold,_ is weaker and the flaws more pronounced, such that I won't be buying the fourth.In _Wizard's First Rule_ and _The Stone of Tears,_ while some of the sexual violence was perhaps overdone and misdirected, I did not feel it was without relevance to the story. In _Blood of the Fold,_ however, the rapes are joined by sexual mutilations of female characters, whereas the elements of deception and abuse of power perpetrated by the remaining female-led magical institution become more intrusive, in that we see them being exercised personally against major male characters without it even making much sense as a method of advancing the perpetrators' interest. Some of the torture scenes do very little to advance the story; the whole pattern of abuses is becoming both repetitive and gratuitous. Finally, in this book, the major personal dilemmas of the main characters are not resolved by the end. That element of appreciation for a neat storyline that depended on having things fall together by the end of the novel is missing in this third work.It so happens that I like bloody dark fantasy, torture scenes, and violence in fiction, within limits. With _The Blood of the Fold,_ however, this series has exceeded those limits: I don't think the torture, rape, mutilation, domination, and sexual abuse is sufficiently justified by the plot to account for its plenitude. It's crossed the line between 'bloody enough to keep me powerfully hooked' and 'sadomasochistic pornography.'The latter distracts me from the story. It seems also to have distracted the author."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"I'll began by stating that the SOT series is a vey spellbinding fantasy adventure that combines magic, action, and complex characterization into a page-turning read. Blood of the Fold picks up the action right where Stone of Tears left off.However, some of the medieval elements that I enjoyed from the first two books have been diluted with the slippery inclusion of modern themes as lesbianism and BDSM into the storyline. Also, the plodding storyline of the manipulative Sisters of Light (their sinister counterparts, Sisters of the Dark, do very little to enhance the overall plot.I bought the Sword of Truth series to read about Richard, Kahlan, Zedd, and intriguing supporting characters like Chase, Rachel, Gratch, Scarlet, Nathan Rahl, Chandalen, and the Mud People. None of the new characters introduced in Blood of the Fold make any type of lasting impression; even the villains, other than being reprehensible and vile, are uninteresting. The Gars were far more likeable and appealing than some of the human characters. Of course, there are the requisite gore and rapes, which seems to be standard stock of this series. I missed the interaction between the three lead characters inasmuch as, once again, they are separated throughout most of this book only to be rushed together at the end of the book.Blood of the fold is not a great book but it's not bad either. Similar to the first two books, this one is very readable and filled with nonstop action. I found the pace of the book to be sufficiently entertaining and interesting. I'm cautiously going onto the Temple of the Winds because the series started out as an engaging epic and I've invested a lot of reading hours into the first two books and I hoping to eventually see the original trio united and standing as a unit."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"My least favorite of the series, its still a good book but I feel it jumps around too much and it doesn't hold my attention as well as the first two."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"Dear reader -If you've read books 1 &amp; 2 of this series, this book will not let you down.

It was so annoying that I couldn't wait to get through it. I will tell you that I only got into Book 4 about one chapter before I returned it. T.G. started the same stuff as he did in Book 3 with repeting and explaining everything. In addition, the characters in the first two books were detailed as far as we knew them intimately.

Still, I think there are too many items that are derivative of Jordan."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"I've read the first three books of this series. I liked the first one, although the writing was very raw. The second was very average, and the third was even less exciting to me. I don't know why I've read all three, and why I'll probably read the fourth. I think I like the characters, and I like the ideas of the story, but I don't think I like the story itself. Goodkind is a very average writer. I hate when two authors are compared, but I have to respond to some of the Goodkind-is-better-then-Robert-Jordan folks. Although I agree that Jordan's last three books have been extremely disappointing, Goodkind does not even come close. Jordan is a very good writer, and by that I mean he knows how to work the language. Goodkind does not, although I think he might be geting better with each book in terms of that. Authors can get better; it does happen (see Terry Brooks). But Jordan also has a very logical and rhythmic flow to his plot; things happen for reasons (at least before this last book!), while Goodkind is all over the place. Sometimes I think he throws a monster in every once in a while just for the hell of it. &quot;Well...we've gone thirty pages without a monster, let's throw one in.&quot; And the gore factor; I don't mind gory scenes in books, but Goodkind takes this to an extreme. WE GET THE POINT, TERRY! How many times does he have to describe the blood and bits of flesh being splattered all over? It is so excessive that it is almost laughable. It's like...[INSERT GORE OR MONSTER OR BOTH HERE}. Come on. Anyway, it doesn't work for me, it just seems like there are so many obvious plot contrivances that it gets annoying after a while. Stop trying to go for shock value and focus on the plot more, Terry.By the way, about this comparison to Robert Jordan; I thought I had already read the second and third Goodkind books already...because it seems he's just lifting stuff from Jordan's books and calling it his own. &quot;Sisters of the Light&quot;!

There are some very violent themes and content not suitable for a younger audience. (It's not explicit like a romance novel but its descriptive.) I suggest you read it before letting your teen. But I may also be a little old fashioned when it comes to what my kids read.

My fiancee picked up BotF and started reading the first few pages and I felt I had to defend myself. Goodkind writes like an adolescent, 'Richard thought writing was hard.' What happened to &quot;showing&quot; the reader, rather than &quot;telling&quot; the reader? That's what characterization is about, not having one woman in red leather with red hair and another woman in red leather with black hair.Which brings up another point some people have made already: what's with the comic book characters? Strong, sexy, handsome man. Sexy, beguiling woman. Sexy, lesbian lovers. Big, strong bodyguards. Worse even than Jordan.Terry Goodkind writes for teenagers.

BLOOD OF THE FOLD stands right up there with the best of the genre. I was a little put off at first by the number of plot elements that Goodkind was juggling, but was pleased at how he tied them all together at the end. It was nice to see Richard developing into a deeper, more multi-faceted, flawed but ultimately sympathetic and likable character. I'm very curious to see what happens with Kahlan in the next volume, seeing as how she and Richard both hold a measure of sway over the Midlands.All in all, I have to say that WIZARD'S FIRST RULE is still my favorite of the bunch so far, due primarily to the aura of a new series, and the ending of STONE OF TEARS was one of the fastest reads I've ever experienced.

Blood of the Fold is nicely contained, all of the plot lines come together well in the end. I was somewhat disapointed that Kahlan and Zedd did not play a bigger role and the ending lacked some of the punch that it was intended to have. Too many events happening too quickly took away from the suspense of the final battle. Overall, I found Blood of the Fold to be the best of the Sword of Truth series.

In my opinion, there are only so many ways of creating fantasy--you can do high fantasy with quests and all that, or Arthurian, or contemprary. All the books in each of these categories are based on the same ideas, just stated in different ways unless the author is especially fantastic.

But - unfortunately - he doesn't have the talent that Jordan does (or did) at keeping all those balls in the air. I really feel where this series excelled was when it was keeping with limited viewpoint, and just followed Richard. We were drawn to care deeply for Richard.

Though the third novel is not as gripping as the first novel in the series, it still begins strong.A new antagonist is introduced, and Richard's opening scene is a rousing sword fight with an unexpected enemy. Moreover, all the characters introduced in the previous novels continue to play a part in this new chapter. In particular the subplot with Prelate Annalina and Nathan Rahl is an enjoyable look into the old wizard's character. If you enjoyed the world of Richard Rahl and Kahlan Amnell I recommend you continue the journey with Blood of the Fold.If you would like to comment on my review please vist my blog oncesoldtales.blogspot.com"},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"Blood of the Fold is an excellent book as a stand alone or as the continuation of the Sword Of Truth series. Terry Goodkind does an excellent job of making the characters people you can enjoy and care about.My husband and I have been listening to the series on audio book. My only complaint is that as the reader changes with each book, the pronunciation of the names of people and places changes as well. This is a very minor complaint as the story is excellent.I highly recommend this series of books.Confessor: Chainfire Trilogy, Part 3 (Sword Of Truth, Book 11)"},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"This series is great this was the 3rd book and Terry Goodkind keeps you spellbound. I intend to read all the books in this series."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"First off, Goodkind is a great writer and the Sword of Turth series stand very high on its own two feet. However when compared to the Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan, Goodkind's works fall short.I'm my own opinion; Wheel of Time and Sword of Truth are too similar to be a coincedence. Seeing as Wheel of Time has an earlier publication date, there's no wonder as to where Goodkind must have looked to find material for his books.The Sword of Truth series is an amazing collection of books from Goodkind, but if you are new to fantasy or are just looking for another lengthy series, I would recommend Wheel of Time. It is much more rewarding and better written then the Sword of Truth series.Pay no attention to C. Young below, anyone with half the patience of a mature adult will find the books far easily to get sucked into and you'll find 900 pages suddenly isn't that much, it's not enough.Although after or in between Wheel of Time.

However, this series is not it. It's a great series for young readers but I would skip it if your tastes run to the more mature. If you're just looking for some filler until the next George Martin book is published you won't find this book unbearable but it won't be enthralling by any stretch of the imagination."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"I am a little overwhelmed by the scope of these books. The mans imagination is enormous and quite scarily believable. Comparisons with Tolkien and Moorcock are unfair and a little insulting to all parties concerned. The myth of popularity is being invoked here and this saga is being downplayed and undermined by those who wish to liken it to an action film. The brutality is sometimes told with beauty and finesse, the words floeing and slicing through the reader very much like the sword itself. To discount the talent behind these writings because of some misplaced literary snobbery is a crime in itself. A good story, intricate, believable, beautiful and scary. If you don't have dreams about it theres something wrong with you!!!"},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"For those of you who don't like him, why read him?

Here Terry Goodkind got himself a place in the history for me what matters. He writes with an unstoppable inspiration, and a creativity I have never seen before. He cought me with the first sentence, and didn't let go until I finished it 26 hours later! If the The wizards first rule was masterpiece, well then I don't know WHAT to say about the Blood of the Fold. If I could give it &quot;6&quot; I would."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"Perhaps Mr. Goodkind is learning from his previous two experiences in this genre, as The Blood of the Fold would suggest. He keeps the same traits that made the first two exciting, but leaves out those that made them a bit weak. This is easily the best so far in this series. His story telling has improved dramatically over Wizard's First Rule, and he is weaving twists and bends into what would otherwise be just another fantasy story. While the entire concept of the Blood of the Fold is well and done, mimicking Robert Jordan's The Children of the Light, he does it a bit better than Jordan's, which reminded me too much of another notorious clan in white. What stands out best in the Blood of the Fold, as well as the entire Sword of Truth series, is his treatment of human relationships. Richard and Kahlan's relationship seems real, with real (as real as it gets in the fantasy world anyhow) issues and problems, and moreover, Goodkind makes Richard's relationship with the Mord-Sith entirely believeable. While this might be taken as a given, try Jordan's relationships among the Two Rivers folk; those seem entirely over-simplified and stale compared to Goodkind's.All in all, this is truly a good good book. I had reservations about this series upon reading Wizard's First Rule, but in my opinion, this third installment pushes Goodkind beyond Jordan as the fantasy saga's premier writer."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"Once again Terry Goodkind had written a magnificent book.

I'm thanking God I didn't buy it.When I got it from the library, I noticed the spine was all broken and torn. I was intending to fix it...but now I realize it must have been because the last reader threw it against the wall.I was tempted to as well, but didn't.It was as monotonous and amateurish. Where the heck was his editor??I should have listened and not read the book and just made up my own ending.The one thing I think I hated the most was the way he ended it the whole boring slog.... It was COMPLETELY obnoxious.His theme in most of the books was to protesting religious zealotry. Those in the Order where following some misguided notion that they were killing in the name of the creator and lived under very communistic conditions.As I read Confessor the preaching and reminding got so irritating I ended up simply skipping pages and pages of 'reminders'.Through out the series there seemed to be an acknowledged basic natural(and good) desire to connect with the Creator and the spiritual connection in all of us. And that there was indeed an afterlife and he seemed to be pointing out that those killing in the name of the Creator are wrong.Also, Goodkind spends many chapters explaining the 'theology' of his fantasy world....how magic works and is connected with the underworld etc etc..But then he completely trashes it AND connects his fantasy world to our real world!!! The whole effect was disconcerting and took away from the 'fairy tale ending'...because you know in this ending the Creator is dead, or consigned to some corner and told not to bother anyone ever again.In the end Richard destroys the entire afterlife for those banished to the non magic world, where he conveniently alludes to those formally of the Order are now the 'building churches'!!! What?)Not mosques, not temples, not circles...but CHURCHES! (and not just any Churches, but CATHOLIC churches because they use medals and 'talismans'. What?)Excuse me? Is Terry Goodkind really this ignorant, or is he just another patsy for the secular order that is encroaching with the culture of death? I think both.Does anyone want a link to pictures of happy young jihadists brandishing the hands of Christians and other kaffirs they collected for allah???? Those of the Order where more like militant islam and the Saracens of history and militant communism and nazi's rolled up in one!! Knowing that as of this minute while I write this thousands of Christians are being executed for 'blasphemy' and oppressed with well documented sharia dhimmi laws in muslim countries or as in communist China's case, having children ripped from their wombs because they value life and would want to welcome a new child among them,...but it's against the godless of laws of china. Or what about the mass graves of Orthodox and catholic priests and nuns from Communist Russia and it's former satellites??What an insult to those really truly have and are suffering on behalf of the values of life and liberty.Ugh. I was completely irritated that I even read the series to begin with. I will not bother to watch the TV series.My advice is save yourself aggravation and money and skip this series.It's a garden path to nowhere even if slavish anti-catholicism and Nietzschism doesn't bother you, the ending is so horrifically badly written, disjointing and boring after so many really good books, you come out of it feeling like you were slapped...hard.M~"},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"Have not read the book yet, but if it is anything like the first 2 books and the series, I am sure I will enjoy it immensely."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"Quote the Author:\\"These people [Amazon.com] have set up a system which invites fraud,\\" Goodkind said. \\"It embraces deception, and there's no interest in integrity.

First of all Terry Goodkind has almost no plot,and where there is a plot it copied from Robert Jordan. For Example, Richard[main character]is a woods guide(simple life) as Rand al'Thor was a sheperd(simple life).Rand becomes famous(Dragon Reborn), Richard becomes the true seeker.Rand is affected by the Prophecies of the Dragon, richard also has prophecies about him. Richard finds out he was not living with his real father, as does Rand (Aiel father). Rand has Cullandor(magical sword), while Richard has Sword of Truth. Rand finds out he can channel (magic powers), Richard finds out he has the gift. The Seanchan in WOT have collars to control magic (channeling), while in SOT there is the Rhadan. Aes Sedai in WOT, Sisters of Light in SOT. Black Ajah (Evil) in WOT, Sisters of the Dark in SOT. I mean the list is endless !!! Other than that Khalan is always JUST about to be raped before she uses her power. Book one by Denim Naas, book two Tyler.I know people criticize Jordan's writing but he's a trillion times better than Goodking, at least he has an original plot.Also in book 2 I CANNOT understand why Zedd Zeddiculus Zorainder had to put a death spell on Kahlan, I mean he's a Wizard of First Order! It's not like he cannot kill a few guards and councillors. Buying Goodkind's books are not worth your money and if you have too much money and must buy books, goodkind's books are not worth your TIME!! I suggest you read Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time or Song of Fire and Ice. I mean anything can be better than Goodkings trash, even some doepy child fiction like Weenie the Pooh.

If you've liked the books so far I see no reason to stop now"},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"Many of these reviews have really bashed Goodkind's book, so I would like to say my piece. I have not read Robert Jordan, but I have read David Eddings and many other such fantasy quest writers. I have enjoyed them all. I would like to point out that &quot;there is nothing new under the sun.&quot; So everyone complaining about how Goodkind borrows such and such needs to shut-up. Most of the fantasies I've read have been very similar in plot and character, but each is very good according to how the author goes about it.I must say that I find Goodkind unique. I do feel that the story could use less violence because some of it is gratuitous. But I find his characters very real and touching. They are very easy to empathize with. I found myself actually crying with the characters.Many fantasy authors I have read are fun to read but I have no trouble putting down most of their books (with the exception of Tolkien and Brooks) when I have to. Goodkind, on the other hand, keeps enough mystery in his series to keep you hooked. It's got lots of action and even romance, albeit a troubled one.I see many of you complaining because the characters are flawed--some of them are really flawed.I really like this because if we're honest with ourselves, we don't always go around pure as the driven snow. Everyone has a really bad side to them even if they do have to dig deep to find it.Goodkind has presented characters who are struggling to do what's right against powerful odds. Yes the Confessors are a strange group to belong with the good guys. But I don't think Goodkind is trying to present the 'good guys' as being perfect. He's saying, 'OK, here's somebody willing to compromise. Let's get a wedge in there and maybe we can change the whole system.' Kahlan is that wedge. Yes she is the Mother Confessor but she is very burdened by this and would like to change the way a lot of things are done. If some of you would read a litte more carefully you would realize that she doesn't like the way the Confessors have ! been operating. Another example of change is the way Richard is trying to influence those chicks with the torturing rods. He has also made quite an impact on the Sisters of Light. They are the scariest 'good guys' I've ever seen!Goodkind's world is not always pretty. In fact, it's often downright ugly and scary. This makes it seem all the more real and fascinating. Perfection is boring.Goodkind has created an entertaining series that is sure to win more and more fans. His characters are real and most are dynamic not static. He keeps the revelations coming on top of more mysteries. He presents a world, though superficially different than ours, that is actually quite close to home. But his protagonists are characters who can and do rise above adversity. They are not perfect and make their share of mistakes, but you love them for it. Why, because Goodkind has created characters we would like to be.Thank you, Mr. Goodkind, for your series."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"First of all, I don't understand all the harsh reviews of Terry Goodkind's SoT series. Perhaps the themes in his books have appeared in other stories, but that's true of every author. Any fantasy author who has written about magic, wizards, beautiful women, elves, dwarves, dragons, swords, quests, traveling, a great evil foe, etc. has copied that theme from someone else. Many reviewers compare these stories to Robert Jordan's. They may have similarities, but the biggest difference is that Goodkind's books are INTERESTING. If Robert Jordan came up with these themes first (which he didn't), he sure didn't know what to do with them. I'm glad that Goodkind did. It takes Jordan a whole book just to get his characters to finish breakfast.Others have recommended Terry Brooks over Terry Goodkind while in the same breath complaining that Goodkind copied the themes in his books. Did any of you ever read the Sword of Shannara? The first 100+ pages were a rip-off of The Fellowship of the Ring.One reviewer, who ranked this book with ONE STAR wrote, \\"The evil emperor simply wants to control the world, wow...that's so amazing. We have no idea why he wants to control the world or how he got in a position to do that\\". If this reader had actually bothered to read the words INSIDE the book, he/she would know that why Jagang wanted to rule and also why he has the power he does. If you're going to rank a book as ONE at least read it. If you can't understand it, that's your problem, not the book's.My last tirade is concerning the repetition others have complained about. He does fill you in on things you might have forgotten from previous books, but it is not overdone in the least. I think it is very helpful, especially if you read the books as they were published and had to wait a long time between each one.My comments on this whole series can be summed up in the phrase, \\"it's great\\"! I read the books; I enjoyed them thoroughly and would recommend others read them."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"There is no question Terry Goodkind can write a spell binding fantasy adventure. Like the first two books, Goodkind combines magic, action, and good old human frailty and self doubt into a page turning story which makes the reader desperate to find out what happened to these characters after the book ends.That said, this book was not up to the quality of the first two installments of the Sword of Truth series. First, the action sequences were too short and not well connected to the rest of the plot. But more importantly, by having his main characters spread all through his Old and New Worlds, not knowing what each of the others were doing, lead to a disconnected plot. There were simply too many unknowns, which despite the 600+ page length, were never meshed into a coherent story.Finally, Goodkind spent far to much of the book first setting up the penultimate battle between good and evil--actually two battles--and then spent too much time setting up what were obvious tantalizers to the next installment in the series.On the positive side, we did learn all about Gars and Mirswiths--making them seem like thinking, sentient beings rather than just creatures of magic programmed to be good or evil.All in all, a good read--but definitely don't start the series here. Must read one and two first, or this book will be a waste."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"...Sad, but true. The series seems to be spiraling in a direction I don't like. I long for the days that Kahlan and Richard hiked the woods together on their hapless way to fight evil. It hasn't happened for two books since Wizard's First Rule and I don't think it going to happen anytime soon.This book, the third of the series, is the worst so far. Easily.Without spoiling too much, the story has all the heroes separated, once again, for the entire book. Kahlan and Richard are apart.. again. [Sigh] Part of what made the Wizard's First Rule so good was the interactions of Kahlan, Richard and Zedd. Reading them all on their own is really lacking. It wouldn't be as bad if there was more of a grand reunion. But this book, like Stone of Tears, fails at that miserably. The main characters are, for a second time, rushed back together at the end to do a hurry wrap up and they seemingly act as if they were across the street from one another. I really think Goodkind has trouble painting a picture of the big crescendo moments. Richard, Kahlan and Zedd are fighting this whole book to get back together... When they finally do, it comes off as ho-hum. It shouldn't be like that.Antagonist time. So it was Darken Rahl in book one, the Keeper in book two ...and now a guy name Jagang trying to take over the world in book three. This guy gets NO introduction except how he cows down the six Sisters of the Dark that fled in book two. Of course he has them naked and being raped in no time. Goodkind sure does love his gratuitous molestation and rape as this continues his overly descriptive ways from the second book. One thing I find myself thinking now in having read these books is that when strife rears up and a female character gets captured or even is in danger of getting captured, I wonder how they are going to get molested this go around. Seriously. Poor Kahlan. Everytime that girl gets in trouble, someone is trying to rape her. It's something that has become very predictable since book one. Girl + trouble = guy (or guys) try to rape them. Its moving from uncomfortable reading to a tad ridiculous and gratuitous.So thats all you get on Jagang. He's a \\"Dream Walker\\" that is wicked powerful if he breaks into your mind. And he ain't too kind to females. Then he disappears for the rest of the book. The other two predominant baddies are heading up the Blood of the Fold. Tobias and Luneta. Incestuous brother and sister that are all sorts of crazy. Tobias is.. well, flat out insane and Luneta is addled in a sad, childlike way. The kind in which she really didn't know any better. So you get the honor of reading two perspectives of crazy people. Honestly, I didn't find them interesting at all and in the end they didn't serve much of a point. But you can't talk about Tobias and Luneta without the highlight of their existence in this book. As you likely have read in a review or two, Tobias gets control of his enemies by.. wait for it... cutting off their left nipple and carrying it around in a box with him. Yeah.. Thats really all I have to say about that.There is the potential of a huge war in this book which doesn't really come to as grand a head as you would think. Tobias and Luneta have the Blood of the Fold army, Jagang has the Imperial Order and Richard has D'Hara. At their disposal seems to be millions of soldiers. Yet another thing I have issue with here. Goodkind loves making his armies INSANELY huge. Every time he mentions armies here or there, its always in the area of 200,000 troops. In one part of the book Richard informs one of his generals to take 100,000 troops and go look for Kahlan. WHAT!? Does Goodkind understand how many freaking people that is or what it would take to maintain a mass of soldiers that big? He treats 100,000 as if its 50 guys traipsing through the woods. The Midlands, Westland and D'Hara are, in my estimation, smaller than Middle Earth in Tolkien's novels. Seeing what it took to move armies around in that world that were a tenth the size of Goodkind's makes the army talk in this book all the more silly. It kills immersion when he throws out unrealistic numbers like he does and the words lack weight when its made to sound so trivial. \\"Move 100,000 men over there and take 250,000 men to my house while the remaing 75,000 will go to the store and get some milk\\". Ugh.This is really turning into a rant-fest so I'll wrap up saying that this book wasn't bad. It added to the depth of the series introducing the Blood of the Fold and hearing more about the Sisters of the Light ..but it just wasn't very exciting. It took weird turns in places like, for instance, introducing Lesbianism into the medieval setting. Richard and one of his Mord Sith have a long heart-to-heart on being a lesbian. Talk about weird and out of place. Its things like that, that kept this book from being as immersive as the other two.If you are this deep in the series you most likely will go on (like I will). But you have to be getting scared since the books really are going downhill fast. And if you're like me and have read some reviews on the last book in the series, seeing things like 'the first four books are the only ones worth reading', etc... you have to be real scared. Oh well.. onto Temple of the Winds. Can you feel my excitement? Wonder who's going to try and take over the world in that one?"},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"I'm new to the fantasy genre and just recently stumbled upon the SOT series -- and I'm hooked. I'm finding that I'm staying up all night more and more because I can't wait to find out what happens next. I'm currently on the Temple of the Winds, and Blood of the Fold seems a distant memory -- even though I only finished it last week. While Blood of the Fold has not been my favorite, it was great nonetheless.One of the things I love about this series is that Goodkind manages to constantly introduce new characters -- I thought I only cared to read about Richard and Kaylan -- but now I'm also excited about Verna, Warren, etc. and look forward to Goodkind developing those characters. (I probably have the spelling wrong because I'm only listening to the audio tapes). I also love the humor via the Mord Siths. And I don't want to give too much away, but the way Richard takes control of things is very satisfying.There are, unfortunately, subplots which I did not take to. I thought too much time was wasted on the blood of the fold -- it didn't really lead anywhere. The storyline about the Mriswith was also not very well developed -- it was tossed into the mix with little explanation.Oh well, I better stop before I give too much away."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"I can't say which of this set I think is the best... they are all great books. This one I would like to say is the best, but then again they are all great. I have read through most of the others reviews and I am learning very quick not to believe everything I read. I have enjoyed reading the first three books in the series and fully intend on reading every single one until the end of the series. As for Terry Goodkind coping others story lines and ruining it for us well take it as you will but he has great twists and if you ask me a apple is a apple but each has a different taste, so don't judge so harshly!Once again Richard, Kahlan, Zedd and the rest of the gang are back tring to save the world from evil. This time the threat isn't the keeper or the evil wizard Darken Rahl, but Emperor Jagang and clan of mriswith. While Kahlan is hiding with the death spell on her ( the death spell was put there by Zedd) waiting for Richard to meet up with her, Richard is once again distracted with his instinct and draws the midlands together to fight against the new evil team the &quot;Imperial order&quot;. The blood of the fold, believing anthing with magic is evil is after the mother confessor, and abducts her and takes her to the sisters of the dark.Once again I will say it as I have in my past reviews, if you liked the first two books you will like this one just as much if not more!"},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"After reading Wizards First Rule, and Stone of Tears I was, to put it lighty, intrigued by the Sword of Truth series. Yes, I realized it's obvious faults and blantant silliness, but I turned to reading Goodkind after having my mind weighed down by to much philosophy and heavy reading; I needed to think less and observe more. In the first two books, my expectations were met. I was captivated by the story, but to be honest his writing ability does not seem to excede that of a middle school level. Imaginative though. Let's face it, if I had a problem with reading childish gobbledy gook, I wouldn't be be attempting to read fantasy novels, so I continued to &quot;Blood of the Fold&quot; out of a sense of duty as well as an interest. Though about 400 pages shorter than its predecessors, &quot;Blood of the Fold&quot; took me at least twice as long to read. The themes reaked of redundancy, as well as the plot line. I suspect that perhaps Goodkind wanted to save new-comers to the series the trouble of reading the first two novels. This is the only hypothesis that I can form as to why he would write numerous sixth-gradish paragraphs quickly recapping on past novels.I was, to say the least, disapointed with &quot;Blood of the Fold&quot;. The Sword of Truth series takes a plunge for the worst here, and in my opinion, never resurfaces."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"He's got the one dimensional character thing down pat. Goofy, but extremely powerful wizard who does nothing. Big, handsome doofus. Guy with lots of weapons. Lesbian sado-masochists... Is this supposed to be interesting? Or did Terry have a D&amp;D campaign that got really weird? Why does everyone get more or less powerful depending upon what moves the plot? Adie kicked the asses of numerous undead creatures on her own, yet her and Zedd couldn't take down the reanimated remains of something that Adie had already slain herself! Why is it that Gars can't see an elephant unless its running at top speed, yet they can see a mriswith 500 miles away? Stop the Contradictions!"},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"Although overall I love this series, I have some misgivings. My score reflects my distress with the sexual themes in the book. I don't care for the description or innuendo. That part of the books appears to be a titilation device to net more teenage readers. I could not recommend these books to my 10 year old son (as I could Tolkien) and that's the real tragedy here. I've not been so enthused in epic fantasy since I first read Tolkein or Donaldson's Thomas Covenant series. Even though I do not care for all the sexual themes in the book, it is interesting how the author uses sex to define the good and evil. Thus Richard blushes at the view of a woman's bare chest while Darken Rahl and the rest of the bad guys are sexual psycopaths. Now for the positive. I discovered this series about two weeks ago and have read all three in paperback already. One night I was up until 3:30 AM reading &quot;Stone of Tears.&quot; I've read a lot about Goodkind &quot;borrowing&quot; from others. He is in good company. Many of Shakespeare's writings are reworks of earlier material. Tolkien's middle earth is so captivating because it uses our already existing vague fears of goblins and dragons and our love of heros and wizards and magic and ordinary people making a differance. In a Sword of Truth world of blatant sexuality, it is refreshing to see a hero who blushes at too much bosom showing and a heroine who is still a virgin. I like Goodkind's use of near miss meetings (ala Shakespeare's Comedy of Errors). I don't know how many times I have mumbled under my breath, &quot;Go that way, dummy,&quot; when help was just over the next hill or disguised in a coach on the road. Because the meeting is missed, the task at hand becomes far more difficult and yet the characters find the strength within themselves to accomplish the task. That's a neat message in a real world that is always blaming someone else for its problems. Although the plot drags a bit from time to time, I have overall rate these book as some of the bast epic fantasy I have read. They will go on my bookshelf next to &quot;Thomas Covenant&quot; and &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; but with a PG-15 sticker."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"The story is good. Just don't buy a Kindle version. The second and third books in the series, I have not read beyond that, are difficult to read because of simple, gross editing mistakes. Grammatical, spelling, punctuation and pagination errors throughout the book make it difficult to read and considerably less enjoyable despite a wonderful story. I love to read using a Kindle, just shocked at such a lack of quality control. I hope it is not a trend. So buy or borrow the books and enjoy a good story.

Like the second book in the Sword of Truth series, &quot;Blood of the Fold&quot; picks up where the previous book leaves off and delivers the same successful mix of action, character development, intrigue, surprise, and insight into who we are and what we value.Probably the best thing to say about this book is it's really, REALLY as good as the first two in the series. While one might be inclined to criticise Goodkind for seemingly copying from Robert Jordon, I feel compelled to point out that while I RAVED about &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; I also have completely given up on the series. I can't stay interested anymore - I don't really care what happens to Rand.You won't find yourself wading through the mud in the Sword of Truth series because the events, the action, and the mystery just keep unfolding! And it looks as though Goodkind has the skill to continue to spin stories off of Sword of Truth with as much entertainment as &quot;Wizard's First Rule&quot;. Yes, this book belongs right up there on the shelf with Jordon's &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; and Donaldson's &quot;Lord Foul's Bane&quot; and Eddings' &quot;Belgariad/Pawn&quot; and Wiliams' &quot;Dragonbone Chair&quot; BUT WAIT, SURPRISE, it also shares the top shelf with the first TWO books already penned in the Sword of Truth World!Hey fantasy fans - enjoy! This series is one to read. It delivers. You won't be bored!"},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"First of all, I do understand that there is bound to be some similarites in a field where all plots are basically the same, but Goodkind are carrying it to the extremes. It's not just the main things, like the _very_ common &quot;simple boy turns out to be great hero with great destiny&quot; thread, and the fact that I wouldn't even notice if, by some misstake, TG would write Aes Sedai instead of Sister of the Light/Dark. For example, did the &quot;original&quot; Mord-Siths ever put you in mind of some Seanchan ladies called Sul'dam (you know--holding magicians against their will, &quot;training&quot; them while inflicting as much pain as possible, etc.)? And while on the subject of Jordan's Sul'dam, I do believe that the Sisters of Light use a device to controll wizards that is described as a silver collar without any apparent clasp and that can be used to inflict pain. Sounds very familiar to me... For some reason I keep thinking of the silver-coloured collar known as the a'dam that is used to break and control damane, and which only Sul'dam know how to open. As to the Mord-Siths current function, Richard Rahl isn't the only one with a group of devoted, teasing, and dangerous women to guard him. The Aiel Maidens of the Spear seems to have a strong recemblance of them. And this is only the beginning of a list that becomes _very_ long after a while. Had we really lived in a fantasy world one could have blamed it on some ta'veren-like person living very close to TG, but as it is it seems very strange. Don't take me wrong, TSoT is still a good series, but these &quot;coinsidences&quot; are getting a bit annoying."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"This book is action packed and at the same time gives an in depth report of Kahlin's homeland.

Not only is Richard an honorable hero, but so is the brave and intelligent Kahlen. I love it when the women kick butt too!

Goodkind's villians may be a little kinky...but they're also really creepy. Read the books...if you dare!"},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"While I will admit Mr. Goodkind is an entertaining author who does indeed have a knack for soap opera-type story telling, his grasp of human endurance is tenuous at best. How long can a person suffer emotionally and physically before the body and spirit break down.It always strikes me that authors who have their characters endure incredible physical and emotional suffering that goes far beyond what is actually capable of a person have never experienced true physicall hardship themselves. They seem like people who spend their days behind a desk and screen and do not experience day to day life. Anyone who has ever been at the mercy of the elements or has been injured severely knows that the body can take only so much before it shuts down. Lack of food, sleep, cold weather and severe bodily trauma are more than enough put an end to anyone.I realize it is a fantasy novel and should be taken for such, but in order to suspend the rational mind and have the reader believe in the extraordinary i.e. magic, monsters and such, there needs to be a concerted effort to ground the reader. Adhering to the laws of human physiology during a snow storm or after being hacked with a broadsword is a good place to start.The mind can overcome many obstacles, but the physical body has limitations."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"I only wish I could give this series an 11.

After all, we think of Shakespeare as a great playwright, though none of his works were original. He simply took existing stories and came up with a new way of putting them on paper.

Although this didn't make me go into cardiac arrest like &quot;Stone of Tears&quot; did, I did enjoy it immensely and think the series is far supeior to alot of the mass produced fantasy muck churned out nowadays. It takes alot for me to go into throes of ecstasy over a book, but this series has done it. It also takes alot for me to bludgeon everyone I know to read a book, but this has done it.

I must say that even though this is also quite the nastiest as well as the best series I've ever read, I love all the characters, and find it easy to empathise with them.

For anyone who's read it: did you notice how easily High Dharan (spelling?) which was supposedly a &quot;very difficult language&quot; translated to english, or whatever language Richard spoke? Fuer grissa ost drauka (once again, spelling? I borrowed the book form my friend as it isn't out in papaerback yet and I don't have a copy with me right now), &quot;the bringer of death&quot; should not translate exactly. Different languages do have different styles of grammar, you know, Mr. Goodkind. If High Dharan is so different from whatever Richard spoke, HOW did he manage to translate it exactly, cryptography-style, from The Adventures of Bonnie Day?

Aside from that however, another wonderful book"},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"Although I enjoyed this book almost as much as the first two this one seemed to get rather streched out and mudied. At times the author didn't really seem to know where he was going"},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"By the time I got around to reading this series, the first two books were already in paperback, but I made sure to grab a copy of 'Blood of the Fold' in hardback because I quite frankly just couldn't wait. Is it as good as 'Wizard's First Rule' & 'Stone Of Tears'? Not quite. In fact, upon finishing it the first time I felt terribly let down. In fact I was downright disappointed. I went on to become incredibly energized with how much I enjoyed 'Temple of the Winds' but still I felt as though Terry had failed me with book 3.While waiting for 'Soul of the Fire' (my least favorite SoT book) I went back and re-read 'Blood of the Fold' and realized something amazing: I had underrated this book by a MILE. I was expecting more of the exact same from the first two books, and when Goodkind went in off in a different direction (than I had anticipated) I was upset, but as I went over this book the 2nd time, I found it to be much more entertaining than my initial first reading. In fact I enjoyed it quite a bit. One of my personal Pet Peeves are readers who feel that because a book doesn't go the way THEY want, the author has wasted their time and the readers money. I admit, I have fallen into this trap myself on occasion, but I have changed my ways (for the most part). I am now a firm believer that each author has the right to take THEIR story in any direction they choose, as Terry Goodkind has been known to do (see 'Soul of the Fire' & 'The Pillars of Creation') but I submit that 'Blood of the Fold' stays true to the events which began in book 1 and continued in book 2. I enjoyed in particular the introduction of the Sliph and Gratch. I think that Goodkind has a good grasp of how to move a story along, even while giving you a re-cap of events that have gone on before without making you feel as though he is treating you like your memory is broken. If you notice in most novels with sequels you are expected (by the publisher) to give some kind of catch-up of what has gone before in hopes that if someone mistakenly picks up this book without having read the first two, they won't feel hopelessly lost.Goodkind is simply put a gifted storyteller who has created a world rich in detail, history and incredible violence. Richard is one of my favorite protagonists in all of modern fiction not because he is perfect, but because more than anything, he just plain wants to do what is right, and not necessarily what is expected of him (which he does in pretty much each book). I DO however believe that this series is beset with the formula fantasy which has ruined many other series out there...Goodkind has set up the stage with the usual: SOMETHING directly threatens Richard & Kahlan's attempt to either be together and/or the world's security as we know it, and somehow they become separated, and in their efforts to get back together they save the day (or the world). Sure, this has become predictable, but I am enjoying it anyway mostly due to Goodkind's sheer storytelling ability. He moves the plot around enough that even though I have a good idea of what may happen next, I am not entirely certain that it will. Along the way he has also given me some genuine surprises along the way (just note the BIG surprise with Richard's Prophetic friend in 'Faith of the Fallen'). All things considered, after my 2nd go-round with 'Blood of the Fold' I have decided that this really IS a great addition to the SoT series and a stand-alone novel worthy of all the praise it has received."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"Stone of Tears left me with a bad taste in my mouth, but I decided to try the next book out anyway. Luckily, Blood of the Fold didn't disappoint me like the second book in the Sword of Truth series did.This book is only (yes, only) 600 or so pages, which was a relief after the 1000 page monstrosity that was Stone of Tears. This book actually had me, at points, captivated, much in the same way Wizard's First Rule did. Some awesome things happened in this book, particularly near the end, that had me at the edge of my seat. Though slow at first, Blood of the Fold becomes an exciting adventure similar to Wizard's First Rule.My only complaint with this book (aside from the many typos) was Goodkind's lack of subtlety. I prefer \\"showing\\" rather than \\"telling\\", if that makes any sense, and Goodkind likes to do a mix of the two. Rather than letting me understand how the characters feel and think simply by their actions and what they say, he blatantly spells out the meaning behind every character's actions. It would be fine if he just left off the explanations that he throws in, but for some reason he feels he has to tell the reader things that are completely obvious. It's both redundant and clumsy, in my opinion.All in all, though, I enjoyed this book. There were plenty moments of awesome that made the fantasy geek in me drool, and the characters seemed to have regained some personality, though they weren't as lifelike as they seemed in Wizard's First Rule. This book makes me feel a little better about continuing on with the series."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"If you are a fan of Goodkind you have already realized a pattern about his work, he is a story teller who likes to spin and weave. His strong points are not spectacular endings. In fact, he can wrap things up in no time at all. That does not mean it is not enjoyable, I point this out as part of his writing style to those who complain \\"he takes to long to set up the story\\".I read the 900+ page stone of tears in a week, couldn't put it down. The story was wonderful, and dynamic. The ending was great, and to the point. This is another of his same layout, and if you got through the first two books wanting more, then you will not be disappointed.Goodkind continues to build upon his characters, and ties the books into a seamless story (which is great for those who buy this in a set). He really comes into his own in the second book, and continues on par here, in the third. I never liked how he brutally victimized some characters (in any of his works), but if you look back to Viking raids, etc in our history he's probably not too far off from reality. It also makes you hate the antagonists that much more, so vengeance is that much sweeter.When you least suspect it, you get really satisfying results, and then a new challenge is present that you wouldn't suspect. He keeps you interested and does not write in your typical hurdles. Of course he is using the underdog story, but not exploiting this like Brooks (who I have to say is an awful writer). Goodkind does not embellish on details to much, and paints a great scene.A good book leaves you satisfied at the end, but looking forward for more, cheers Mr. Goodkind."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"Blood of the Fold is not a bad book. The third in the Sword of Truth series, it has many of the same virtues (memorable characters that draw the reader in) and vices (misspellings; clunky narration) as the first two books. Oddly enough, despite the shorter page count, Blood of the Fold is more scattered than the sprawling Stone of Tears or the particularly well-structured Wizard's First Rule.The novel kicks off right where the last one left off, and concludes by clearly setting up the action for the next novel. Though this book has a story that builds to its own climax, it is evident that it is a part in a continuing series rather than a standalone work. There's nothing wrong with that, but nor does it stand out in this series. The story is also hurt a bit by the extreme separation of the main characters. Kahlan is mostly ignored for a significant portion of the novel, and Zedd is given little to do. Verna proves a strong lead character, but a lot of the Sisters of the Light/Dark sections spread the story rather thin, especially as there are numerous villains who have to share the spotlight.I can accept a lot of logical leaps in Fantasy novels, so even if Richard's main plotline feels a bit forced, it still makes for some interesting conflicts. What Goodkind does well here, though, is that characters that the reader roots for, who have good intentions, often end up in conflict with each other. Conflict drives stories, so having protagonists butting heads helps keeps things moving.In the end, Blood of the Fold is part 3 in a long series.

Yet with these books it is hard to turn away."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"Goodkind open our eyes to the true nature of evil!I've read many a book, but none reach me like this series has. The entire Sword of Truth series, sets a pretty high standard for epic fantasy, let along a good book series. Early books had some places that were a bit clunky, (it was the authors first books if I'm not mistaken), but don't we ALL start out something a bit green, and then hone our skills?The more books by Goodkind you read, you clearly see the excellent progress he's made in his craft. Goodkind does what so few fantasy authors do, that being have true heroes, heroes who use reason, heroes who do not become the enemy or become cowards and most important, heroes that stand up for what is honorable and true. And heroes that do not sacrifice their values to accomplish their goals.You will not see nasty words, vulgarity, incest (unlike some series), porno, or any kind of depravity in the name of literature. This series touches on some violence and deals with real world issues like war and the true horrors of war. It exposes evil for what it is and it shows that mankind can rise up and be truly noble!While I see there are a few people who want to vote poorly and post negative comments, it is your right. But when you post such acerbic comments, it is easy to see that you simply think it funny. Like anyone would take your petty comments as anything but jealousy and immaturity.While this series has its merits, it has its problems as well. No book will have everything to speak to every person.This series starts in easy, and right away you grasp the wonderful story telling ability of Goodkind, and as you go on, it delves deeper into the nature of man. This series explores deep human themes and exposes the fallacy of collectivism.This book has a striking romantic aspect as well as plenty of heart wrenching twists. While I personally love the philosophy, I can see why some may not. That (IOHP), is why we have arena such as this, so that we can offer up likes and dislikes. Most who do that have offered up an HONEST review. The rest simply are offering up vitriol, because they fear this series for the good that it does and they fear it because they feel it a threat to their favorite author.BE HONEST, give the book its due.Support your book stores! Support the Publishing world, and for goodness sake buy a book so we can drive these whacked out \\"save the rain forest\\" freaks crazy by cutting down a few more trees!"},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"I think that this is one of the best books in the series(now i've said it twice) because in this book richard fully comes into power over the D'Haran Empire. Everything comes together in this book and sets up for the war to start in the next book. If you like his first two then you'll like this one for sure. many people dislike goodkind and say that the only reason people give his books good ratings is because they read his first to and have some kind of loyalty to him.

First of all, I did think it was a decent segue into the next big book. The thing that just nagged at me after I read it, however, was the title. This is just me being nitpicky, but the title is Blood of the Fold eventhough the main story doesn't really have a whole lot to do with them. Sure, they make an appearance, but they don't really accomplish a whole lot. They just sort of pop up every now and then so that we know they are still there, then they fade into the background. Well, that was just my 2 cents."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"Brilliant!

I have read many books in this genre and can recognize that this IS an acceptional work, as were the rest in the series. I will conclude by stating that the people that can only see the bad in a book did not truly read It"},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"Blood of the Fold is not bad, but I just didn't enjoy this one as much as the previous 2 for some reason. Maybe it is because some of the characters in this one just aren't very convincing. There was definitely more political debate, which seems to slow the story down some.I was really turned off by the Blood of the Fold group. These guys are the KKK of the magic world, and are just too stupid to be believable. Richard should have been able to brush them aside easily, but I guess you can credit their success to the allegiance to the Keeper.At least the story progresses. It is worth a read if you have made it this far."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"Blood of the Fold picks up the story where the last volume, Stone of Tears, left off. Richard Rahl has just reunited with his future wife, Kahlan Amnell, the Mother Confessor, in a place between worlds. When he gets back, he finds there's only one way to halt the continuous advance of the Imperial Order throughout the Midlands - seize power. Richard ends the alliance upon which the Midlands was based and the rule of the Confessors. Thus, Richard Rahl, the new Master of D'Hara, takes control over Aydindril and the New World.Meanwhile, in the Old World, trouble courses through the Palace of the Prophets. Sister Verna, the newly named Prelate, finds out after some time that the former Prelate, Annalina, isn't really dead, but had fled with Nathan Rahl, the prophet. The two of them reveal that they are on a quest to fulfill the Prophecies and save the New World from the dominion of Jagang, the Dream Walker, Emperor of the Old World.My main problem with this book is that it is only 60 percent as long as Wizards First Rule and Stone of Tears, which were true doorstoppers... This is clearly a transition book pressured to be released by the publishers. It also marks a marginal decline in the series that the Sword of Truth never fully recovered from, despite Faith of the Fallen being excellent.Its a good read, but some of the magic is gone.Relic113"},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"Wizard's First Rule and Stone Of Tears. Two wonderful novels, introducing us into the life of Richard Rahl, a simple woodsguide who has his world turned upsidedown by Kahlan Amnell. Where as the first two stories of Richard and Kahlan were filled with wonderment, adventure and suspense. The third chapter of this engrossing series is somewhat of a let down. Not to say it isn't an interesting read, but it's cons outweigh the pros.The story itself picks up right where Stone Of Tears ended, we are introduced to a few new characters. The overzealous Lord General of The Blood Of The Fold a group of 'Witch Hunters' so to speak, and his sister whom is condemmed in his eyes for being a sorceress. While these characters are interesting, they did not have any impact on me other than to anger me at their ignorance toward the real truth of the world contained within the story. After their brief introduction we are once again introduced to our wayward hero Richard Rahl.After an explosive battle between Richard and the Mriswith the story suddenly took a nose dive. In what could have been a suspensful piece of work, became a political thriller of the Fantasy genre. We are thrusted into endless arguments and positional characters as Richard sorts out his standing as the Lord Rahl. Having said that, where is Kahlan, she is still in hiding with Adie and Zedd. This was one of the biggest problems for me. Richard and Kahlan's seperation was absolutly abominable, once they finally do meet up with each other, (Near the end of the novel) their exchanges are hasted and brief.The action I have come to love is nearly absent in this entry, aside from the last 100 pages, which were extremely exciting; did not make up for the lack of thoughout the whole of the story. The humor of the Mord-Siths is quite entertaining. The way they try to intimidate and poke fun at Richard, did have me smiling and chuckling a few good times.Blood Of The Fold is certainly different when you look back upon the first two novels of this series. Though it does have it's moments of sheer excitement (the last 100 pages), it came off as an overly long senate meeting to discuss lands and property."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"For those interested in a extremely serious critique of this book ... skip to the next review! If your simply interested in knowing how I find this book enjoyable ... read on! I've read reviews bashing T.G. about the increasingly predictability of his books and so on; however, as a reader who enjoys the literary vacation a book affords without requiring excessive amounts of time to break down a book and get in the author's head, I find T.G.'s books to be interesting and very enjoyable! His books bring-up moral questions while teasing us with luscious bits of immorality! i.e. - The trust and love of Richard and Kahlan mixed in with the S&amp;M like qualities of his guardians Raina and Bernadine! Innocence mixed with exploration! I highly recommend reading this book and the others of his series! I'm looking forward to getting into his 4th book: Temple of Winds!"},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"first of all I thought this book was great I could not put it down iread this book in three days. however it had its faults like when the emperor Jagang from the imperial order just popped in the story after stone of tears. I mean sure we had started to hear about the imperial order but no emperor was involved at first.now he shows up and takes control I mean where did he come from why does he want to rule the world. I think Goodkind should add some more little detailsand his series would be a whole lot more popular. His books are still good but if he added the little details his books would be awesome."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"First, let me say that Terry Goodkind is eminently readable. Unlike the Jordans etc who try to make the plot so intricate that is makes Tolkien's series seem positively simplistic, Goodkind knows how to tell a story in a simple manner, with all manners of complexities thrown in along the way. His characters are very well drawn, and full of all the strengths and weaknesses that readers expect of fantasy works.However, I am growing far too weary of his series' reliance on deux ex machina escapes (that's &quot;god from the machine&quot;, ex. jumping off the cliff and landing in a four foot dingy) and a completely unbelievable scheme of magic to tell its story. I can bear the omnipresent multipage long explanations of why Zedd has to cast a spell a certain way, or Richard agonizing over Kahlan or his heritage etc. However, when Zedd casts a &quot;Death spell&quot; and it causes everyone in the realm to forget that Kahlan is the Mother Confessor and they believe she is dead, that was too much!!!Now I realize that coming from an AD &amp; D background where magic is very different, my sight may be clouded, but I don't think that this kind of power should be taken lightly. Zedd practically is unaffected by casting such a spell. Frankly, I find this kind of cheapening of magic sickening. Magic is a special skill, an art, and should not be as Goodkind portrays it as mere trickey. Anyone who whispered &quot;Cool!&quot; when Richard uses the Wizard's First Rule on Darken Rahl in Book 1, shame on you!!! The more I read, the more I grew dissatisfied with the way Goodkind's stories grew out of coincidence, happenstance, and just plain bad ideas about magic and how to work it into the story.Let's hope he can finish the series soon, and perhaps try again with a different idea. Goodkind is a writer to watch, and hopefully this series will only be a footnote to an otherwise long and successful career, once he is able to solve a few of these problems."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"Read this book if you enjoy a story filled with similar one-dimensional characters.In 'Blood of the Fold,' Goodkind continuesto put together interesting plots that arefilled with characters who are either good or bad.The characters in this series behave and react so similarly that reading the book is like listeningto a musician play a single note, without inflection.Goodkind writes his characters at extremes. Characters are either weeping or jumping for joy,are either intelligently saving themselves orstupidly falling into the latest trap in orderto advance the plot.Mr. Goodkind should try to make use of subtlety and a real range of character types in his writing. In trying to avoid the constant barrage of extremes, he woulddo well to remember, as Anthony Lane of the New Yorker wrote, that there is nothing so boringas being excited all the time."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"I enjoyed the third book and am confident I will enjoy the books to follow. As with the last two books, I could not put this one down. These books make my life a living hell. I stay up until all hours of the night trying to finish the book. I finished the last book in two days. I am going to begin the fourth book possibly tommorrow some time. As far as I'm concerned, I feel Mr. Goodkind is a good writer and deserves as much respect as any other author. Like I said, I don't read books that I do not like."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"Hey I know that most people don't realy enjoy fantasy or Sci-Fi. But I for myself love it. Ever since I read the Narnia Series by CS Lewis, I've been forever traped with in the fantasy world. Other authors that have captured me include Tolkien, and Brooks. But no author has been able to draw me in and hold me in his/ her world as well as Goodkind. He simply has the ability to wrap his very deep sensing world. I've spent houres at a time reading his novels, reading them slowly as to relish what he had to say, fearing that I might miss that all important word. For the past few years I've been looking for that one series that I could call my own, My mom has the Pern series, my dad loves Steven King and my freind, can't get enough Jordon. I've been totaly taken by Goodkind's Sword of Truth series, his characters are realy well developed and the story line very followable and sometimes funny. In fact when I was half way through Wizard's First Rule I went out and bought the next two books so that I could start them after finishing the first one, well I'm just about to finish Blood of the Fold and am already twitching with anticipation for his next book. I also pray that for my sake as well as all his other followers that he doesn't end the series too soon, since he can do so many things with the world that he has already laid out. So keep up the great work Goodkind!!! I'll be watching the shelves for you."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"With Wizard's First Rule Goodkind had a little promise. It was not realized in the sequel and it is all but gone in this, the third installment. The theme of rape running through all three novels is also quite disturbing, with the exception of the female lead, every woman in the novels has been in the past, or is presently being raped. It's a very powerful emotional device to throw around so casually. But this is all moot, the plot is trivial - stealing pieces from Jordan and Eddings - the characters are morons and worst of all Goodkind has lost all hope of ever growing as an author. Too many fans (aka book-buyers) are more than happy to read this recycled trash. Some people complain about Robert Jordan dragging out his novels, after you read this book -think to yourself, what actually happened that couldn't have been put in 50 pages"},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"I am definitely looking forward to the next book in this series. That Richard Rahl's rage can lead to poor decisions is refreshing. Mr. Goodkind would seem to have a knack for &quot;twisting the knife&quot; at the appropriate moment. I wish more heros had such an easily identifiable dark side.I would, however, like to see the characters of Chase and Zed expounded upon a bit and let Kahlan take a slightly smaller role. Kahlan's magical powers seem to have left her with nothing else to evolve into.It can be difficult to inject the proper amount of humor into the characters of such a tale but I think that Mr. Goodkind scored high in this respect. A very good read."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"Terry Goodkind has been criticized for taking items from otherwriters works and using them as plot devices, but you can say thisabout nearly any writer in the science fantasy genre. The one big difference about Goodkind's work that a number of fantasy writers (ala Jordon) have forgotten is humor. Goodkind will take you on a grand roller-coaster of a ride, but there will be a cathartic scene to release the tension within sight.One of the items I found to be most refreshing about Goodkinds characters, is that most of them are adults. There are few 'coming of age' scenes in Goodkind's work of the type that seem to predominate other fantasy series. Most of his characters have had the dew removed from their eyes and can thus point out a number of sights that other authors would not have been able to show us.With 'The Blood of the Fold', Goodkind's main character, Richard Rahl, is beginning to use some of the power base that has developed during the previous books in"},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"Terry, we want more, and more, and more.Not just this one, all of Goodkind is the very best literature I everread. Fantasy maybe even better than Tolkien's.Words can not describe my enjoyment in reading such fantasy, vivid in lifefull colors of hitherto unseen author's imagination.Story goes on and on, getting bigger and bigger with every page, making my muscles tense with action on pages, which is rare (for me, that is). Can't wait for new books."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"This book, like Goodkind's first two, is a good book to read ifyou are in need of a time filler. I can understand his overcopyingfrom other works, there are no stories that haven't already been told in some other way. At least Goodkind changes the stuff that he copies enough that it is at least readable. That is not my biggest problem with Goodkind. I feel his characters are still flat. Richard and Kahlan are still as sappy as ever in this novel. And most of his other characters are paper thin. His villans actions are overly brutal and it seems as if they were created by a 10 year old who has watched to much horror on TV. But still, I would recommend this as a good time killer, but I wouldn't recommend paying for it. Let your library buy it, then check it out and give it a read."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"Why must a book be constantly compared to others in the genrefor it to rate favourably at all??

These are the strings that bind us all. Of course any author worth his salt would include them in a novel; they bring us closer to the adventure. ^M In my opinion, Terry Goodkind spins an intriguing, exciting, wonderful tale, and should be commended. I have yet to read any novels by Robert Jordan, but if it is as so many have said and Goodkind can be so closely campared to Jordan, then I shall have to place the \\"Wheels of Time\\" series on my must read list--right after I finish the \\"Sword of Truth\\" series, of course!

When you read, it is for enjoyment not for discriminating against... If you must compare Goodkind to other authors, I must urge you to reconsider...Goodkind is on par with most authors today, I have read Brooks, Eddings, and Jordan... They are well accomplished authors and they are in league with Goodkind.... All modern stories are clones from ancient myths and legends like the legends of King Arthur so why doesn't anyone complain on that? The basic line is to read with an open mind and to read with your heart... Let the author do what he does best... tell a story and let you enjoy it.... So please stop and start reading...

But he needs to come up with some original stuff. It has gotten so bad that I'm surprised Jordan hasn't had a hissy fit considering they are at the same publishing house!Also like Eddings and Brooks, he tends to rework previous material and call it a new novel--Boo!

Blood of the Fold is one of the best in the series. Richard and Kahlan are terrible foes to have. Goodkind is simply a brilliant writer. His world building and magic are imaginative and he is amazing at making all the little pieces fit together. The character development is thorough and the characters are all interesting. I noticed many little nuances the second time around that I missed the first time I read this book. It was almost like reading a new book. I tried reading the Wheel of Time series after reading SWOT the first time. After two books I gave up on WOT because the stories were so slow moving and the characters were so unlikeable. For the life of me I do not know how that series got to be such a hit.Blood of the Fold is functional as a stand alone read, but you really need to start with The Wizard's First Rule to get the most out of it. Then you will want to read each book in order.."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"I'd recommend this series to any fantasy reader. It gives you everything you want: fun characters, good plot, and a great world. It is what I call fantasy candy. It isn't really deep, but it is really fun.

I hope that makes sense."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"I was suggested to read this series by the artist, Kieth Parkinson, and to this day I am still thanking him for the suggestion. The Connection to the first book has this one keeping me just as drawn is as his first, The Wizard's First Rule, and his second, Stone of Tears. You can feel the world just opening in these pages he has written, and they give me a feeling of the people in this world, and an understanding of their world. This story has made me laugh and made me cry, from one end of the spectrum to the next. The mystery is always there also, you are never quite sure where things are going, but many answers are given, and some are still in the wings, which is great.... means there is more to come in the next book. Jagang's slow and sinister way of trying to destroy the New World from the inside, while he is gathering his forces in the Old World to conquer by the sword is classic. It takes an intelligence to understand his motives, and always keeps you guessing. Richard's continued growth into being a wizard and his understanding and education are proceeding well, but he still doesn't know how to deal with everything, His friendsand love, are there to assist with their hearts and minds. I have now read these three novels 5 times through each, and am now reading them out loud to my girlfriend who finds them just as entertaining as I do, even her 13 year old daughter is now reading, and wants to catch up so I can read to them both. Thanks Terry, for the people you have created, and for their story you have shared with us. I have read books in this genre since I was in grade school, and have never raved about any as much as these."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"The tale is good, the action is quick, but it is clear that this book is not a primary book in the series. This book can be read as a stand alone work, but it is much better if the proceeding three books have allready been read. This book is used to develop some new characters, continue the story started in the Stone of Tears, and to set the stage for later books. That having been said, I did enjoy reading this book. I enjoyed the humor that is in the book, the interplay between Zed and Ann at the inn is delightfull. There is also a good bit of suppressed drama in the book, with the primary parties missing link-up with each other by scant measure.I do recommend this book for reading, but only as part of the series. If this book is read as a stand alone, it is likely to be somewhat unclear."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"This book had an awful lot of potential. However certain things should have been better thought out. I hated the concept he gave the Fold. They didnt seem as ruthless as first portrayed in the previous book. However, A lot of the plot twists are intriguing and leave the next book wide open. All in all, the book is interesting but really kind of a dissapointing. With Terry's idea of the Mord-Sith, we know he is capable of being ruthless. So lets see it Terry. Lets see how evil you can make the villians! This book was kind of lacking that hard edge. I hope the next book improves on it."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"A great story, involving characters, and above average depth make this fantasy series one of the best out there. I'm a huge fantasy fan, and have found Goodkind's story to be very addictive and imaginative. I do have to agree with an earlier review re: Goodkinds use of ideas created by Robert Jordan in his &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; series, but I also feel that he has used them in different ways, and has changed them enough to allow the reader to enjoy without feeling cheated. However, Goodkind has also come up with a lot of ideas of his own, such as the Confessors and the separation of magic along the lines of Additive and Subtractive.As to the previous review that trashed Goodkind's work, it is obvious that the writer didn't read the novels, and has decided that Goodkind's use of realism in his stories is too much to handle. The review reminds me of how the church used to take passages from classic novels out of text and decide that they were the work of Satan. Some advice to potential readers: If you don't like realism, and think that everything in the world is kind and gentle, stay away from this series. Goodkind has shown a wonderful ability to mix realism with fantasy, and to show that sometimes it takes brutality and gore to arrive at a good end. In this, he reminds me of George R.R. Martin and his &quot;Song of Ice and Fire&quot; series.Overall, the series, and this particular book, are great pieces of fantasy writing, and will be enjoyed by any fantasy fan who understands that life isn't always nice, or fair."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"This book swept me away into the vast imaginary world of Goodkind's. I don't want to give anything away to those of you who haven't read it, but you gotta love the end! If you haven't read the first two, hurry up so you can read this one!"},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"The first Sword of Truth novel was one of the most original, powerful, masterful, all-around good epic fantasy books I've ever read, the only thing better being The Lord of the Rings. The second novel kept up *some* of the glory of the first one, though not all of it...It still managed to be a good read.Blood of the Fold, on the other hand...I doubt it's intentional, but this might as well be Wheel of Time Book 9. Or the rewrite of Books 3 and 4... Still, Terry Goodkind's addictive writing style didn't allow me to put this one down, it has action, lots of action, just like the first two, more than the second one, actually, but I still didn't see much originality here.If Terry Goodkind is plagurizing Robert Jordan in any way, it's in the sense that in both Sword of Truth and Wheel of Time a lousy third volume gives way to a wonderful fourth volume. Like I said in my review of Wheel of Time book 3, you gotta push through this one if you want to get to book 4...which in Terry Goodkind's case is the best save maybe the first one."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"While several hundred pages shorter than the first two, BotF maintains the excitement of the series. I gave it four stars because I had difficulty setting it down.I enjoyed the fast pace of this book. Mr Goodkind wastes no time moving the story on, FROM THE POINT WHERE THE PREVIOUS BOOKS LEFT OFF (other authors could take a lesson from this - no missed events)! I really liked the way Richard has shaken the foundations of the Midlands and D'Hara. Jagang is one bad apple! He scared me more than Darken Rahl ever did. I enjoyed watching Gratch grow up; it helps express the sense of time passing. I also enjoyed all the near misses when the main characters were physically close but unaware of it. COMMUNICATIONS AND INTELLIGENCE IS THE KEY TO VICTORY, PERIOD.What I don't like is the way Richard (and everyone else) has ignored the Westlands. There's no way Richard would blow off his homeland. Surely Jagang, the Sisters of the Dark, the Keeper, or somebody has been lurking there?.. I was also disapponted in the Lord General of the Blood of the Fold. He seemed too incompetent (crazy) to be the top dog, so what was keeping them together, and so powerful? His having the gift was a wonderful twist.Read this series, or I'll slap a Rada Han on you. Hey, that sounds like a wrestling move!"},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"I call this book a twister, along with the rest of the series, for three reasons. The first is it's ability to addict the unprepared and pull them into the story. I am no great literary critic, and I don't really look as far into characterization as one would, but no matter who you are, or what you like, you WILL be pulled in to Richard and Comp's story, you WILL be defenseless to it, and you WILL want the next book ASAP. Mr. Goodkind has created characters that I love and cherish, who pull me into the story as I've found only a few authors can. The words flow very well, and don't sound scripted, almost as good, though not as good as P.N. Elrod (who's Vampire Files series and Jonathon Barrett series have the most flawlessly smooth dialogue and flow I have ever had the privilage of reading; Miss Elrod is exquisite, and I suggest her to whoever reads this)I find that very often, with fantasy, hero's make speeches I find impossibly good, considering the character. What these characters say is believable, wonderfull, and filled with the passion of one who means what they say. The characters area real people, with real fears and feelings. I applaud Mr. Goodkind for this and much more as I go on.The second reason I call it a twister is the author's ability to split the story up and yet work everything in perfectly. It is a beautiful piece of work. The next part also is with the twister idea, concerning a &quot;twist&quot; ending. I must mention here that I have found a bit of a pattern in his series. He utilizes the saying &quot;it's always darkest before the dawn&quot; very often in his plots. I notice that things always look the worst JUST before it is fixed. It is as if the story is a pencil, laying down spots on a paper, looking to be making a mess, yet, at the end, when lines are connected the right way, make an beautiful picture. It is almost like Sherlock Holmes (I adore Sir A. Doyle's work as well). All is laid out, and the resolution is unseen until the last moment, when the reader, through Holmes and Watson, find out how Sherlock came to his conclusion and who did it. When explained, it all seems quite clear and fine, but when seen differently, make very little sense.I am rambling a bit now. Please excuse me this. But, in short (I guess I should have put this at the top then, eh? &lt;g&gt;) Mr. Goodkind's work is very very good, read it, and make sure that as soon as you start reading, have the next volume on hand so you don't suffer from withdrawl!"},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"Dear Mr. Goodkind, You, sir, have a gift. You see visions in your mind and are capable of rendering them in living words for your readers to enjoy. You have a remarkably creative talent that frequently has me riveted to the page, unable to look away. What you lack, sir, is the discipline to apply your creativity to every facet of your work. As an author, you bear the burden of responsibility of providing not only an entertaining tale, but also an original one. Nine out of ten elements in your series are delightfully original, it's the one in ten that shatter the reader's suspension of disbelief and drag them instantly into an involuntary comparison between yourself and Mr. Jordan. I believe that if I could remain immersed in any of your books from beginning to end, they would be among the best experiences in epic fantasy I have yet had. But the little similarities keep sneaking up on me and dragging me out of your wonderful world, bringing me visions of Mr. Jordan's works. I won't go into detail here about the similarities, I'm sure you've heard enough about them; my purpose with this message is to entreat you not to make the same mistakes in whatever work you undertake next. You owe it to your readers to provide them with the full efforts of your gift. When you cut corners by paralleling other writers, whether by intention or otherwise, you not only take away from the experience you are trying to provide, you also make yourself appear to be lazy. I have yet to read past this third volume in your series, and I don't know that I will. Please, sir, suspend my disbelief. Don't split the stream of my thought between the story my mind should be living in and the one I read last month. Thank you, and I look forward to your best efforts in the future."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"I like this book more than the first two. There is more action and less talk. In his second book in the series, there was about four hundred pages of too much talk. Here, there is more and better action. His ideas are inventive and I like the twists in the plot. My only complaint that holds through the entire series is that his dialogue is too modern and often trite; it is like listening to characters in a TV soap opera talk. Other authors (such as Robert Jordan) are much more convincing in adopting a style of speaking that fits the genre and the characters. Overall, a nice effort for fantasy fans."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"I love this story line.

Character development is great. There are parts of the story that can make you anxious and even a bit frustrated.

Get on with it save the day already!"},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"This book was the beginning of the end for the series. While the story held together, some of Katlyn's reflections begin to dodder off - she's on her way to being an ineffective liberal sop rather than the dipomat who holds together the disparate tribes and cultures of the Midlands by the force of her personality. The theme of \\"caught by the enemy, seperated from my lover, saved by improbable means\\" is underway by now too, and is repeated over and over again through the series. Goodkind also begins the fatal journey into satisfying his publishers by retelling the story from previous books in the series - as we all know, this interupts the flow of the story, is boring, and stops the suspension of reality so integral to a good fantasy. You'd never catch Tolkien or Donaldson being this stupid - stupid in the sense of being asleep. I'd avoid the inevitable disappointment of not being able to finish what starts as a great read. I gave up on the series at the next book.When will the editors/publishers get it?

I feel like I waited a LONG time for it to be delivered."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"I have read the first two books in this series, which were outstanding. This was was perhaps slightly less powerful than those, but it was still well above most fantasy novels. At its heart it is a tale of good versus evil. But it is so well conceived, with complex characters and events, that it seems quite deep while you are reading it. Richard and Kahlan must confront the Imperial Order and the Blood of the Fold, both of which are moving in to take over the Midlands. Those events are also affected by a new threat, known in ancient times as the Dream Walker. The Midlands are in imminent danger of invasion, and worse. Sisters of the Light and Sisters of the Dark are also involved in internal struggles for power and dominance. There is a lot going on throughout, and yet it is laid out competently. The book is long, but the pace is right. There is plenty of action and intrigue, as well as interesting moral dilemmas. I am sold on the accolades this series usually receives, and look forward to the next book."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"After I started reading the first book of the Sword of Truth series, I was instantly hooked. The second book of the series was just as good as the first one. Blood of the Fold is the third book in the series and it too delivers the amazing detail and imagination that can only be produced by Terry Goodkind. At this moment I have only completed half of the third part, but I can not wait to read this book everynight before I sleep. If you are planning to get this book make sure you read the first and second one first, because the character development in this series is amazing. You can not fully appreciate the book unless you have had time to familiarize yourself with the characters. Join the Sword of Truth Club!!!

Good ones..When I first picked up his first book, it didn't seem too bad at all..His descent started in the second book. It lacks originalty, taken from Jordan's Wheel of Time series. Once started, this guy doesn't seem to stop. He writes like this is supposed to be some cartoon romance novel for 12 year olds. The blood of the fold, sisters of light,dark etc... All of Jordan's original works, trashed by plagiarism, a stupid plot, and stupid names.. And the theme of rape if also starting to get old.. Time after time.. I buy his books because TOR makes nice covers and it looks good on my bookcase.."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"I am young, but I can recognize good literature when I see it. I have read many of the classics, including at least 1/2 of Shakespeare's works, Tolstoy, Tolkien's works, Dickens, Robert Jordan, Terry Brooks, Isaac Asimove, etc. In my opinion, Terry Goodkind is one of the best fantasy authors to ever live. I like his work no more than I like Tolkien's or Shakespeare's, but when you consider the absolute and masterful skill of these two authors, you realize I am giving him huge praise. I am not going to go on about how much I love Goodkind or what not, but I am going to say that I recommend Goodkind, above even Tolkien, to any reader out there looking to adventure into the Fantasy genre. Do not think that I like Goodkind more, but the best facet of Goodkind's books is his ability to hook you from the start and keep the book moving along at an eye straining pace. His skill is not in developing a world in which you can completely lose yourself, such as the Star Wars universe, but in keeping the reader interested. While you are swept into the story, he introduces some interesting and original characters, such as Mriswiths(spelling?), Confessors, Gars, Sisters of Light/Dark (even though Robert Jordan has something very close), and The Seeker. Like I said, Goodkind is an excellent writer, but not a revolutionary writer (like Tolkien). I would say he is the best fantasy author for intelligent readers just breaking on to the fantasy scene. I feel that if you have read no or little fantasy, you will enjoy his books much, much more.SincerelyAlberticusTry not;Do,Or do not.There is no try.................\\\\.................\\\\..................The Jedi Master Yoda"},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"Terry Goodkind's first book, Wizard's First Rule, was entertaining many years ago when I was a relatively new fantasy reader. Except for the actual First Rule (\\"People are Stupid\\"), which was... stupid. The story had some fascinating characters (mostly the secondary ones -- I could never muster up much care for Kahlan) and Richard started out as a pretty good hero. The next couple of books of The Sword of Truth were also fun for a fantasy newbie.Then, Terry Goodkind just TOTALLY lost it. His writing style became incredibly annoying and Richard was getting WAY too preachy (constant Ayn Rand-ish humanistic ranting). But, I kept going because I was invested by this time. And each time I bought one of his $25 hardback books, I found myself rolling my eyes at every passive sentence and starting to fall asleep during the sermons (when did Richard hire a speech writer??).And the plot really got ssslllllloooowwww. Just look at the book covers for Chainfire, Phantom, and Confessor -- you can tell we're not going anywhere. (I hope they got a 3-for-1 deal on that cover art.) But the weirdest thing is that I kept buying these 1 star books! I can't explain my behavior, except to say that I kept thinking that things would get better, but they did not. How did he pull off that first booK?? I've learned from this experience that I can put down a book if it's not good. There's too much good literature to read.According to Mr Goodkind, those of us who have bailed out are ignorant and uneducated. Wow. That is something I have never been called before. I should have realized right from the start (\\"Wizard's First Rule: People are stupid\\") what kind of fellow Terry Goodkind is. Here is a quote from a chat session conducted with Mr Goodkind (this used to be on his website, but has now been removed. It is well-documented on the internet, however.):\\"Why would they continue to read books they claim are bad? Because they hate that my novels exists. Values arouse hatred in these people. Their goal is not to enjoy life, but to destroy that which is good -- much like a school child who does not wish to study for a test and instead beats up a classmate who does well. These people hate what is good because it is good. Their lives are limited to loathing and indifference. It isn't that they want to read a good book, what they want is to make sure that you do not. Ignore them.\\" ~Terry GoodkindI say Terry Goodkind is the one acting like a school child having a tantrum. I regret that he got so much of my money. I hope you won't give him any of yours. If you really want to try a Goodkind book, I would recommend that you go to the library and check out the first few, and then trust me that you don't need to read any further. I will not read the last book. I'm not even tempted."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"Possibly the best of the series so far. And this is one of my favorite fantasy series of all time. Still, we're on the 3rd Sword of Truth book there are a few things that are disturbing me. (1) Why does every villain have to be either a rapist or a sexual deviant? (2) Isn't it time we got a new map to go at the beginning of the book? The map is the same as it was in the first two books - pathetic. Is the entire continent one big mountain range? Let's see something--anything geographical or monumental indicated on the map besides rivers and freakin' mountains! Goodkind needs to hire a quality cartographer for a map that will due justice to his fantasy world. This will in turn make following his adventures a richer experience for his readers. Other than these two things I am loving this series and can't wait to read the next two currently out there."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"I would normally give a book such as this a rating of 3 but due to Goodkind's previous work this is pale in comparison. The first two books were well done and captured my attention and my time until the very end. The only reason I actually finished reading this one was because it was so short and I am hoping the 4th book will be better. Goodkind spends half the time reminding us of things we already knew from reading the first two books, if somebody is new to the series they might want to think about starting at book one, I for one don't want half the book to remind me of things I already knew. I hope his next book doesn't dissapoint or I will be done with this series."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"The first book was one of the best I have ever read. It was almost perfect. I loved it, just as I think others did too. The second book was not as good as the first, but still enjoyable. But this Blood of the Fold, book 3, this book is horrid! I cannot believe it is even the same author. I truly hate to give bad reviews on someone's work, but this book is bad. Please do not put yourself through the torment.

It's just stupid."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"Once again Terry Goodkind has managed to put out a novel inferior to its predecessor. Not that it was a bad book, but it wasn't great either. His writing is still highly predictable and his writing hasn't matured much since Stone of Tears. On top of that I see a recurring storyline from one book to the next. Richard faces impossible odds, Richard overcomes evil, but in doing so releases a new threat. On top of that the whole Richard/Kahlan relationship is beginning to wear on my nerves. But there were good points as well. The Queen Mriswith was a great invention of Goodkinds although probably too dragonlike in form. The Mriswith Cape was even more interesting. I particularly liked it.In reading other reviews, i found one that particularly stuck out to me. The reviewer gave one of the worst reviews i have ever read. His whole review consisted of statements like: &quot;Why did they have to destroy the prophecies to keep Jagang from getting them? This book is stupid. What a waste of paper.&quot; Attacks such as this do nothing but belittle the person who wrote them. As for all the questions, why bother asking? It was the writers decision to write the book the way he did, and he had his reasons for doing so. His series is far from complete and he may have things planned for later in the storyline that required certain things to happen beforehand. But above all, why not let fantasy be just that; fantasy. Its not real life, and although writers try to make it believable one should not forget it is still fictional. But I digress.In conclusion, i found the book to be mildly entertaining, although it had some glaring faults. Still may be worth reading if you've invested time in the first two books of the series."},{"Title":"Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth Series)","review":"I have been fighting the critics that say Goodkind's work is simply a plagurisim of Jordan's WOT, but he came very close to losing my supprot in this text. I'm not going to go making the connections here, but there is definitely a close comparison.He also has begun to show some of Tolkien in his work, especially at the end of the book when the Gars attack the Mriswith and save the day (sound familiar). I like his description of why the Gars came about and why they have the green eyes, but the connection to Tolkien and Jordan leaves me feeling a bit flat.I am also becoming a bit tired of the relationship between Richard and Kahlan being so prominent throughout the text. It seems as though he is trying to convince us of their love be being repetitive and it doesn't need to be done in my opinion.Things about this book that I enjoy are the mriswith as I think they are a very unique character. His character development has always been very good and he has been good at creating scenes and excitemnet in his previous two books but he falls a bit short in this book. I think the strength of this book and the previous has been the Mord-Sith; I think the characters are wonderful but the name and the concept seem to be a repetition of other authors.I have laready started Temple of the Winds because I am dedicated to finishing the series. I would recommend this book if you are in my shoes and in hopes that it pick up in Temple of the Winds.IMPRESSION: GOOD - RECOMMENDED"},{"Title":"Famous Texas Folklorists and Their Stories","review":"I haven't laughed that hard in a long time.

Bought this book because I am very interested in how current monetary system works and what the future holds. This book fortunatly covers both topics; in great detail. The book goes over the advantages and disadvantages of the current way, how banks lend to grow the economy. It then goes over how that is being transformed and what we can expect in the future. The book is not as dry as most hard-core academic books, it is readible. My goal is to have a broad understanding of how the financial system of our world works, and this book did a great job of helping me understand. It does have a few advanced mathematical equations, I do not know how to solve them but they were very well explained...so at least I do understand what the equations are for.

D., editor-in-chief)","review":"I haven't read Dickens since I was a young man and am glad to have begun my reaquaintance by my first reading of Barnaby Rudge. As always, the characters are varied, and spring to life through Dickens's gifts for acute description and memorable dialogue. The plot threads are complex - some admittedly predictable, others full of suspense and surprise. What I appreciate most, however, is the action-packed, central section of the book with its vivid descriptions of the Gordon Riots: terrifying, out-of-control mob violence engendered by religious intollerance. Given the the disasterous effects of rigid religious fundamentalism (across all the major faiths) in the contemporary world, I found this aspect of the novel the most compelling. Add to that the character of the amoral, hypocritical politician Sir John Chester, and we have a work of fiction to remind us that there are lessons to be learned from history. With its relative brevity, compelling ncharacters, and page-turning action sequences, I highly recommend this novel to fans of the author and those new to his oeuvre."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge, (Living literature series, R. Burton, PH. D., editor-in-chief)","review":"I've never read Charles Dickens before, outside of having read \\"A Christmas Carol\\" in school. I decided, a year or so ago, to read some Dickens and see what I thought. This book wouldn't have hooked me, but I'd already read enough stuff to know that this isn't his best. Though it wasn't that good, there were elements of it that were interesting, and that kept me going long enough that I finished it.Barnaby Rudge is a simple man with a talking crow. His mother looks after him. He lives in a world full of people who are more or less friends, or at least acquaintances. Among these are a tavern keeper and his son, a locksmith and his wife and daughter, the locksmith's apprentice, and the locksmith's maid. The book spends several hundred pages on exposition of these characters, with you getting to know more and more about them as the story progresses. The interplay of the characters, with the author interweaving so many plotlines, is apparently a trademark of Dickens, and he puts it on display here, using it for all it's worth. At about the halfway point of the book the plot begins to form, as one of the secondary characters, a British nobleman named Gordon, decides to foment anti-Catholic sentiment because it will bring him political prominence. Of course riots will result, of course people will be killed, and of course Gordon thinks nothing of this, because he's advancing his political career at the same time. Barnaby and the other central characters in the book are caught up in the riots, and their aftermath, and that forms the main plot of the story.I generally enjoyed this book, but I thought the exposition too long (by modern standards anyway) the plot itself too wordy, and the ending I'm afraid was predictable. What saves the book is the characters. On that logic alone I might recommend it."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge, (Living literature series, R. Burton, PH.

I admit to having only listened to it for few minutes before giving up, but what a mess of an effort. I am sure that when this was originally broadcast there must have been a narrator. Here it is merely a series of voices and it makes things very difficult indeed. There are also some rather rural accents featured on this recording, making it extremely difficult for an American to follow. This is a well-intended, but ultimately a mess of an attempt to render one of the novels of Dickens into drama. The whole thing seems like someone brought a tape recorder down to the pub on a Friday night and hoped for magic to take place."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge, (Living literature series, R. Burton, PH.

This gets two stars, but that's because this book is being compared to other novels by Dickens. If it were by some Victorian unknown, we'd be whooping about a rediscovered goodie! Mostly I enjoyed it, but I doubt very much I'll ever read the first 200 pages or so word-for-word. I should note that I didn't read an edition that had the Penguin editorial notes."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge, (Living literature series, R. Burton, PH. D., editor-in-chief)","review":"Barnaby Rudge is an early Dickens novel, his first historical novel, of the Gordon riots of 1780, about fifty years before his time. The book is a mere 634 pages, that is, two thirds as long as Copperfield but a 100 pages longer than The Old Curiosity Shop. One of Dickens' strong points is atmosphere, and this novel is one of his best in that department. His description of the Maypole Inn and its proprietor, slow John, is marvelous. Much of the book describes the riots and their effect on various characters. Barnaby himself is an idiot, but such an excellent character for all that. The villians actually have good qualities in this book. And by the way, the Raven Grip is supposedly the model for Poe's raven. I would not start reading Dickens with Barnaby, but even though it's not as well known as ten other of his novels, I can highly recommend if you like other Dickens to give this book a read. I intend to reread it in my next round of Dickens rereading."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge, (Living literature series, R. Burton, PH.

For one it's about a true historical happening. The riots of 1780 actually did occur. It's one of his shorter books, and it was written earlier on in his career. The book is really not where a reader should start with Dickens' books, but it should be read nonetheless. It still has the same great characterizations and atmosphere that we expect from Dickens, and it's still a good story. Barnaby is quite the character. We have to laugh at his antics, and Slow John at the Maypole Inn is absolutely wonderful. I read this book quite awhile ago, and while I'm writing this review, I'm thinking I need to reread it again. Wonderful atmosphere!"},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge, (Living literature series, R. Burton, PH. D., editor-in-chief)","review":"This is a well paced and fast-moving historical novel set during the anti-popery riots in London in 1780. Although not as grippingly exciting as Dicken's other historical novel, A Tale Of Two Cities, there is plenty of drama here to sustain the reader's interest.The fictional characters are well woven into the historical setting, and the portrayal of these characters gives the book some of its best comic moments, from the suave Edward Chester, to the vengeful Simon Tappertit, to the spiteful Miss Miggs, to the devious hangman, Dennis. The hero of the book is Gabriel Varden, whom Dickens repeatedly describes, rather clumsily, as &quot;the honest locksmith&quot;. Varden has to suffer constant friction in his own household between himself, his wife, his apprentice and his maid, and this agitation reflects the agitation of the masses in the streets.One of the best features of the book is the way it successfully carries a number of plot lines. The main one of these concerns a murder committed many years previously for which no-one has been convicted. There are several other sub-plots such as the tension between the Catholic Haredale and the Protestant Chester, Joe Willet's love for Varden's daughter, the comical scheming of the apprentice locksmith against his master and the presence of a shadowy stranger who pursues Barnaby Rudge's mother. Some elements of the plot fizzle out a bit too easily towards the end, such as the attempt to kidnap Haredale's daughter, but the overall effect of the book is very satisfying.This is one of Dicken's least remembered novels, but I think it is well worth reading and an excellent introduction to his work."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge, (Living literature series, R. Burton, PH. D., editor-in-chief)","review":"Having left Dickens until later in life, I just completed Barnaby Rudge as part of my attempt to go through his novels in chronological order, starting with Pickwick. Barnaby Rudge is a very different animal from the 4 prior novels, patterned after it was on the swashbuckling historical style of Scott. It's so different from Old Curiosity Shop, which he was writing at the same time as Barnaby Rudge, that it's hard to believe it's the work of the same author, except for the quality of exceptionally vivid characterizations that pervade all the books.I knew nothing of the historical events upon which the book is based, that, at the time of original publication, were well known to most Londoners, almost as well known as 9/11 is known by contemporary New Yorkers. Dickens seemed to have anticipated this problem, as the historical recreation is so beautifully folded into the melodrama that I never felt left behind. DON'T READ THE INTRODUCTION as too many plot points were given away and spoiled some of the dramatic impact for this reader. Save the introduction for afterward.The characters are so memorable, it is painful to have to complete the book and say goodbye to them. Especially John Willet, and his double-chin, which almost deserves billing as a character in and of itself, Sir John Chester, a poetic achievement to whom Oscar Wilde and Shaw owed enormous debts, Maypole Hugh, and Grip the Raven (from whom Poe got his idea for the poem \\"The Raven), are high water marks of achievement.While I preferred some of the intensely personal, experimental style of the latter half of Oliver Twist and much of Old Curiosity Shop, the confident and bold tone of the narration in Barnaby is a shot of adrenaline in every chapter, and the power of description in Dicken's cinematic viewpoint is incredibly powerful and pulse-poundingly entertaining, while the whole time maintaing a savvy, but never cynical outlook when it comes to the socio-political themes.Don't miss it."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge, (Living literature series, R. Burton, PH. D., editor-in-chief)","review":"Focused primarily on the \\"anti-popery\\" riots in London in1780, and filled with wild scenes of carnage involving a large cast of characters from all levels of society, Barnaby Rudge is Dickens's first historical novel, and it includes the real Lord George Gordon, a virulent anti-Catholic who whipped the populace into a frenzy. The author sets the scene for the tumult by first painting a picture of quiet village society in Chigwell in 1775, five years earlier, often using humor to depict the numerous characters.Geoffrey Haredale, a Catholic, has inherited the estate of his brother Reuben, who was murdered twenty-two years before. He has brought up his niece Emma, who is in love with the kindly Edward Chester, a Protestant, the son of the odious Lord John Chester, who lives nearby. Dozens of characters populate the book--including Barnaby Rudge (the developmentally disabled son of Mary Rudge, who works on an estate), the Willetts (who run the Maypole Inn), Gabriel Varden (a locksmith) and his daughter Dolly (who eventually works for Emma Haredale), mysterious strangers, ghosts, a sinister blind man, and even Grip, Barnaby's talking raven.The action takes off when the time shifts from 1775 to 1780, and the focus changes from village life and the sometimes amusing domestic concerns of the people to the growing anti-Catholic sentiment being stirred up in London. The humor, which has been a big part of the first part of the book, ends, and Dickens concentrates on the growing hatred and the battles spawned by that hatred, with good people being drawn into brutality that they would otherwise avoid. Violence and several deaths take place, the populace becomes a mob, and rioting leads to the burning of properties. The love stories, which have been a large part of the first section of the book, are put on the back burner for the major part of the book.Written in 1841, this is Dickens's fifth novel, one which suffers from its original serialization and loss of focus. Though the atmosphere and some of the characters rank among Dickens's best, and some of the humor in the first part is delightful, the tone is inconsistent, changing with the riots and ensuing action. As is always the case with Dickens, all mysteries are cleared up at the end, with Reuben Haredale's murder solved and the whereabouts revealed of several characters who disappeared between 1775 and 1780. With hints of some of the greatness to come, this novel precedes David Copperfield, Bleak House, and A Tale of Two Cities, and shows Dickens experimenting with his themes and ideas. n Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge, (Living literature series, R. Burton, PH. D., editor-in-chief)","review":"This book is probably the most overlooked of Dickens' major efforts. It lacks the silly slapstick and joy of Pickwick Papers, and is missing the biting social commentary (at least not as biting) of Little Dorrit and Hard Times. Also, it is always listed in the &quot;about the author&quot; section as being somewhat of a commercial letdown at the time.The truth is that it is a great book. It has enough silliness to let you know that it is Dickens, but is accompanied by a good bit of darkness. In fact, it's almost macabre at times.In the end, this is a great story from a master storyteller. Isn't this the true benchmark of a classic? For all the ingenius stylism of &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot; would we love it half as much (if at all) if the styling didn't accent a most captivating tale? Well, &quot;Barnaby Rudge&quot; is just that....a thoroughly captivating tale in the classic Dickens style."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge, (Living literature series, R. Burton, PH. D., editor-in-chief)","review":"I had read most of the Dickens novels, some more than once, but I'd always overlooked Barnaby Rudge. When I finally read it I was amazed it had taken me so long. It turned out to be a lot more fun than I expected from the blurb on the book.Like all Dickens' novels, the characters are drawn to show the nature of human beings, and he does it so well, the characters could be set in modern day and the story would still work. We see the shifty lecherous rogue who covets the beautiful young lady, the dedicated hangman, and the patriotic family man. We see troubled family relationships: mother and son, father and daughter, and father and son. Most important of all, we see the title character, a golden-hearted idiot whose simple-minded exuberance makes him a ready-made pawn for the devious and evil manipulators who stand to profit from division and resentment between Catholics and Protestants.Perhaps the most timeless thing about this novel is the willful manufacturing of resentment between the two primary social political groups of the time. You could simply replace the terms Catholic and Protestant with Liberal and Conservative and you'd be telling our modern story. Turn on the nightly news and you will see a modern-day Barnaby Rudge there enthusiastically reciting the talking points of some divisive talk-show host, all the while completely oblivious that he is but a pawn dutifully serving a sinister master. I'm glad I waited until now to read this tale of Dickens because it's such a timely reminder of human impulse toward the mob mentality.Barnaby Rudge is an ever present reminder that if we lose our ability to think to think critically, we our own identity and our values will be consumed to serve the desires of someone else."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge, (Living literature series, R. Burton, PH. D., editor-in-chief)","review":"This year, 2010, the Riverside, CA Dicken's Festival has selected Barnaby Rudge as its featured work for its weekend-long presentation. In my view, nothing could be more timely.Most people have not read this book which was never as popular as some of Dickens' other novels, such as Oliver Twist or David Copperfield. However, this historical novel of a tragic period in English history of the late 18th century, was early on a project Dickens wanted to present. Work on it predated his widely popular Pickwick Papers, on a much more serious subject.It was the religious riots of 1780, precipitated by an unstable member of the House of Lords, Lord George Gordon, who wanted to suppress catholicism, even among members of his own monied class. The cause of \\"No Popery\\" was taken up by mob rule which resulted in a horrendous amount of death and loss of property among all the people of London, including the burning of Newgate prison, Bedlam, the hospital for the insane, and many houses of rich and poor alike.As in all Dickens books, there is a cause that the author wants to present and explore. And this one seems to be an analysis of how mob rule occurs and how people who have little factual information destroy and disrupt both the rule of law and the faculty of common sense. If this were only a historical condition, the novel might be of interest. But, we can easily see how today around the world, the incitement of a few with dubious motives can destroy and disorient the lives of the many.

But, please! Ignore the critics of the last 150 years, and just read Barnaby Rudge. I've read 11 of Dickens' major novels, working my way through the catalogue in chronological order. To my tastes, this little sleeper of a book contends well for top spot, right alongside his more famous larger brothers, like Pickwick and Dombey. When I grow up, I want to be like Gabriel Varden -- a man \\"terrifying in his integrity.\\""},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge, (Living literature series, R. Burton, PH. D., editor-in-chief)","review":"Barnaby Rudge (1841)originally appeared as a weekly serial in Dickens'weekly newspaper Master Humphrey's Clock. The novel is the most obscure work by the master. The story is well worth reading. It is an exciting story of the Anti-Roman Catholic riots of 1780 led by the eccentric George Gordon a member of Parliament. The second half of the book focuses on the riots in a cinematic depiction of the mobs who ran amok in London during a hot summer of hatred, prejudice and murder.Character rather than complicated Victorian plot is why we read Dickens. This book adds many memorable folks to the gallery of Dickenscharacters. In this long novel we meet:Barnaby Rudge-the title character is a feeble witted lad whose pet is the famed raven Grip. He lives with his mother. We later learn his evil father Rudge Sr. murdered Lord Haredale's brother. The father is hanged but Barnaby lives to spend time at the Maypole Inn. Years before Dostoevsky's novel \\"The Idiot\\" Dickens took a mentally ill person as his hero. Barnaby is pardoned for his participation in the Gordon riots.Gabriel Varden, his shrewish wife and buxom daughter Dolly live in London where Mr. Varden is a locksmith. After Joe Willet leaves England to fight in the American Revolution he returns home to wed Dolly. A charming love story.The Haredale family tells us of the love of Mr. Haredale's beautiful nieceEmma for Edward the son of John Chester. Chester is a Protestant and a sworn enemy of the Catholic Haredales.Minor charactes such as Hugh (the illegitimate son of Chester); Dennis the hangman; Miss Miggs the man crazy maid to Mrs. Varden and others populate the pages of this fast paced tale of murder,mystery and intrigue.Barnaby Rudge is a fine book which deserves to be better known. It is not Dickens best novel,his longest novel or his most famous novel. Yet it still appeals in its exciting look at the events of 1780. It and the much more famous Tale of Two Cities were the two historical novels the author produced.YOu will never forget Grip the Raven (said to be the inspiration for Edgar Allen Poe's poem \\"The Raven\\") or Barnaby and his friends and enemies. Curl up with this good book and let your mind and heart wander back to the year of our Lord 1775 when the novel begins.The book is well illustrated by George Cattermole and Hablot K.

This is not one of Dickens' most noted works, but it is one that needs to be read to understand the authors evolution as a writer. I had the pleasure (?) of first reading this one in a volume, years ago, which was printed in the late 1800s and which was printed for mass distribution. Fine print, two columns per page, printing all the way to the page edge...you get the picture. That was years ago...I am too old to even see the print now, much less read it, but it was worth it at the time and is certainly worth it now that I can afford a nicer copy. The work can be criticized, with some justification, for being a bit wordy, but for my taste, that is one of the charms of the novel. It certainly fits the times and the style of the times. Recommend this one be added to your list when again you get into the Dickens thing."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge, (Living literature series, R. Burton, PH.

Meet the author who far surpasses him in making flesh creep and cringe, in this book more than most. In Barnaby Rudge, Dickens portrays the Gordon Riots, a violent anti-Catholic outburst in London in 1780, supposedly started by the opposition by Lord Gordon to some acts in Parliament which would've relieved some of the burdens of Catholic citizens: the right to directly inherit property and the right to educate their children in England. As usual, Dickens ignores the political pressures, likely brought about by the French allying themselves with the Americans in their colonial war, which would've stirred up suspicions of Anglo-Catholics being in league with the French.In any case, I can see why this book has never matched the popularity of &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot;, as there is no possibility for heroes in scenes of mob violence. Even those who refuse to cooperate with the rioters can do little more than resist. Locksmith Gabriel Varden, being forcibly brought to Newgate prison, refuses to pick the lock for the masses of rowdy men intending to free their comrades and anyone else locked inside; however, his resistence means little as the mob decides to burn down the door instead. Mr. Haredale is often defiant, but he can do little more than beat a retreat when faced by hundreds of belligerent men. None of this &quot;'Tis a far, far better thing...&quot; kind of statement which can be made.Ignore the plot lines. They are cursory, even for Dickens. They are there merely to set up the characters and their own personal motivations so one can see what happens to them when all order dissolves. I could see why the English of Dickens' day may have not wanted to read this book -- it was far too scary, especially as Dickens portraying the fuel to the rioters' fire being the primal urges to destruction and looting. Though there was then (in 1841) a better policing force and better prisons, there still was the unbearable poverty and dissipation alive in London. Then, as now, there were plenty ripe to take advantage of any opportunity to set fire to the town. Think the actions in here too far-fetched for even these times? Consider the fires, destruction, and looting that start in any modern city, once rioters have been given an opening.People are crushed underfoot, men are consumed by the very fires they had set, and decent people stand by because they are powerless in the face of the massive wave of violence. Dickens shirks not one detail. If you're thinking of a quaint Victorian period piece, for crying out loud, don't read this book! Go read Pickwick Papers or Old Curiosity Shop. However, if you enjoy this kind of disaster, by all means, read Barnaby Rudge (or might I suggest Hard Times, which has some pretty horrific deaths)."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge, (Living literature series, R.

Unless someone already knows the basic plot and characters, they may have difficulty following the action (particularly, as a previous reviewer pointed out, the thick accents will be hard for Americans to decipher.).The entire production needed to be toned down quite a bit for Dicken's voice to be heard above the clamor.It might be better to read the book in this case."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge, (Living literature series, R.

Certainly a book that for readability if nothing else deserves more attention."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge, (Living literature series, R. Burton, PH. D., editor-in-chief)","review":"It surprises me that this is actually one of the lesser known works of Dickens. The truth is that this book displays some of Dickens's strongest writing. We start with some people recalling the horrible murder on 'the 19th of March.' (Undoubtedly, the Ides of March from Shakespeare's \\"Julius Caesar\\" was revolving in Dickens's head.) These characters talk of Geoffrey Haredale and his niece Emma. (Emma's father and Geoffrey's brother was the murder victim on 'the 19th of March.')Throughout the story, Dickens maintains the tone of suspense with the fear and presence of the 'dead man.' Perhaps one of the greatest things about this book is that at first Dickens talks of hatred between religions on a personal level, and then it is brought to a massive level. Well, Geoffrey Haredale and John Chester meet, and we can see that they DO NOT like each other. But they do agree that they don't want John's son to marry Geoffrey's niece Emma. So they will work together to prevent it. Haredale and Chester display yet another aspect of Dickens's writing. Dickens knows how to prevent characters from being either 100 % likable or detestable. (Unlike Hollywood!) Haredale is cold, uptight, and stern, but he is virtuous. Chester is vain, self serving, and dishonest. But he carries a charm that makes him likable in spite of this.Well, we soon learn that John Chester and his son are not too fond of each other. Though especially with modern goals, it is hard to disagree with John Chester when he says: \\"All men are fortune hunters.\\" Later, Gabriel Varden's daughter is grabbed by Maypole. (Eventually we learn that Maypole is John Chester's illegitimate son.) His actions would seem to indicate a relationship to John Chester.Later, we learn that the 'dead man' is Barnaby Rudge's father. He makes a visit to Mary (Barnaby's mother). She is frightened of him, but she does provide some relief. Later, Haredale suspects that the man who killed his brother may not be so far away. Moving on, Chester and Haredale succeed in preventing the marriage they wanted to stop, though Haredale does regret the dishonesty involved. This is followed by the complete alienation of John Chester and his son Edward. (Though if we think the thing about keeping people of different religions or from certain families from marrying is a thing of the past, we should THINK AGAIN!)Moving on, a huge Protestant rally begins to form with the intent of destroying Catholic property. (So, Dickens has shown us religious bigotry on a personal level, and then he raises it to a massive level. Good job Charles!) Maypole decides to join this rally. Well, we once again meet Mary and Barnaby. They are visited by a blind man, and it doesn't take much for us to know who the blind man is friends with. (Rudge Sr.)Mary and Barnaby see the Protestant rally, and Barnaby being somewhat naive can not resist joining them. (Though we should be aware that getting people to join a dangerous rally with a few simple words that appeal to a primitive instinct is not all that difficult.) Moving on, Gabriel Varden's Dolly and Haredale's niece Emma are kidnapped in the rally. Later, Rudge Sr. is taken by Haredale. (Young Barnaby as well.) Rudge Sr. does express some regret for his past crimes. His blind friend says that all may not be lost. If his wife declares her husband dead (as many people believe)then Rudge Sr. should get off. In an at least partially touching scene, Rudge Sr. and Barnaby meet, and Rudge Sr. reveals that he is Barnaby's father.Later, against his will, Varden is forced to help the prisoners escape. And Barnaby Sr and Jr know freedom once more. Haredale is injured, and he later finds out that Edward Chester helped him. Poor Sr. Rudge finds his wife will not help him, and to make matters worse, his blind friend is killed. Rudge Sr. is understandably in a rage when he sees his former wife, and we can't blame him completely when she essentially left him to be hanged.In a bit of fierce Dickens's comical style, Dennis the Hangman is arrested and is frightened of who his cell mate may be. But peace is made between Maypole and Dennis. (What's the point of fighting when we are all going to hang anyway?) In a redeeming moment, Dennis tells Maypole of his past and who is parents were. One would think Chester would want to make peace with his doomed illegitimate son, but Maypole has outlived his usefulness to John Chester. In a redeeming moment, Maypole says that he would lay down his life willingly if it would save Barnaby. In an articulate line, Maypole goes out with hatred for his father: \\"I leave the wish that he die a violent death as I do now, and have the night wind for his only mourner.\\"In a sad scene, Haredale admits his faults and leaves Edward and Emma free to marry. 2 lovers coming together is usually a happy ending. But in this case, it seems to take a back seat to the sadness of Haredale. Haredale and Chester have their final fight, and Chester does go out in style. Though poor Haredale only lives a short while longer.But all is not dark. Barnaby is reunited with his mother, and his pet bird can speak again. True, \\"Barnaby Rudge\\" is quite different from the popular works like \\"Oliver Twist,\\" \\"A Christmas Carol,\\" \\"David Copperfield,\\" or \\"A Tale of two Cities.\\" But in this case some differences turned out to be a great thing!

If you only want to read Dickens' finest books that show his best talents, you may do better to stick with books like &quot;Oliver Twist,&quot; &quot;David Copperfield,&quot; &quot;Great Expectations,&quot; or &quot;Our Mutual Friend.&quot; All of that aside, I can not understand why this never gained the same popularity as &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; (which also shows a departure from Dickens' standard formula). The opening is quite captivating and the images are well painted. Right away Dickens grabs our attention with the mysterious 'dead man' (who will later prove to be a VERY significant live person). Like Dickens' other villains, Chester is very wicked, but he carries a charm that makes him more fascinating than repulsive. Geoffrey Haredale is a captivating figure who APPEARS cold, but he proves himself to be quite virtuous. Although we don't really get to know Emma and Dolly that well, they do grab our attention at times. Mary (Barnaby Rudge's mother) is memorable as a (widowed?) woman who does her best for her son and displays her fears dramatically. The 'dead man' reappears every now and then to keep us in suspense. The conversations between Ned and his father Chester are quite memorable. Varden is fine in his secondary but significant role. Barnaby is not exactly Dickens' most memorable protagonist, but he does portray someone caught in the middle fairly well. One thing Dickens does quite well is that he first draws personal disputes over religion, and then he draws civil riots over religious differences. Some memorable lines are also present: (&quot;I arrest you in the name of God who has delivered you into my hands,&quot; &quot;May he die a violent death as I do now and have the night wind as his only mourner.&quot;). The final fight between Chester and Haredale is a fitting conclusion for this excellent work. So we have a great combination of drama, suspense, horror, and even some comedy. My only complaints about this are that I feel some more time could have been spent on the 'dead man' in developing his character and explaining his actions, and I do miss the filial piety that is prevalent in other novels of Dickens. I do not feel that this represents Dickens' best efforts; but it is FAR from his worst creation. This is every bit as good as the popular &quot;A Tale of Two Cities.&quot;"},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge, (Living literature series, R. Burton, PH. D., editor-in-chief)","review":"When one says &quot;Charles Dickens&quot; and &quot;historical novel&quot; in the same sentence, the immediate impression is of the French Revolution adventure &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot;. But Dickens wrote another historical novel 18 years before, in 1841, the complex and colorful &quot;Barnaby Rudge&quot;, set during London's anti-Papal riots of June 1780, when there was a reaction against the Catholic influence in Parliament. Populated by a large cast and activated by a plot of intrigue and danger, it is one of the best of Dickens in his early period. In fact, it is perhaps Dickens' most under-rated work. As usual with Dickens, the characters find themselves in a labyrinth of relationships. Sir John Chester is an impoverished habitu&eacute; who tells his handsome son he expects the young man to insure the family fortune in the time-honored tradition of decadent nobility: by marrying money. &quot;With regard to our circumstances, Ned, you may set your mind at rest upon that score. They are desperate.&quot; His son is appalled, the more so as he is in love with Emma, the daughter of a country gentleman, Geoffrey Haredale, Sir John's moral opposite. Running parallel to this love story is that of Joe Willet, the good-hearted son of John Willet, the proprietor of the Maypole Inn, where much of the action takes place. Joe is courting the daughter of Gabriel Varden, an honest, hard-working locksmith, a proletarian hero. (Originally he was the book's title character.) Gabriel's daughter Dolly, Joe's inamorata, is one of those human cookies so adored by Victorian England. (All through the 19th Century articles of clothing were named after her: the Dolly Varden bonnet, the Dolly Varden cape, etc.) Touching these families is Barnaby Rudge himself, a strange, simple-minded boy whose navet&eacute; leads him into joining the rebellion led by the Protestant radical Lord George Gordon, who also appears as a minor character. Barnaby's constant companion is a talking raven; their conversations sound like vaudeville routines. His mother hides one of those dark family mysteries Dickens used so suspensefully in &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;; and this theme is reflected in Sir John Chester's secret: he is the illegitimate father of ... the story's least likely character. The novel is filled with Dickensian trademarks: ironic drama, an odd sense of humor, and, of course, strong sentimentality. With the bloody Gordon riots as a climax, &quot;Barnaby Rudge&quot;, elaborate and absorbing, is an impressive predecessor to Dickens' better-known tale of the Reign of Terror."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge, (Living literature series, R. Burton, PH. D., editor-in-chief)","review":"Admittedly a lesser known work by Dickens, I found it a great read. Sure, it's a bit slow in the early chapters, but what part of any Dickens work doesn't have its moments. The cast of characters is diverse, as usual, and bring different social circumstances to the Gordon Riots in 1780 England. The chapters devoted to the Riot itself are packed with action that kept me reading far past my normal quitting time. More importantly, Dickens paints a vivid picture of both religious persecution and the irrational and unpredictable quality of a widespread riot. With brief references to the War for Independence, the novel serves as a solid insight into some of the thinking that led our Founding Fathers to enshrine fundamental liberties in the Bill of Rights.The academic review that precedes the novel is a waste of time for any reader for enjoyment and a perfect example of the horrid quality of writing in academia today. The reviewer needs to spend less time assembling critical comment and spend some time learning how to write like Dickens."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge, (Living literature series, R. Burton, PH. D., editor-in-chief)","review":"Barnaby Rudge is one of Charles Dickens' lesser known and read novels--and that's a pity. The book is interesting, full of the kind of characters that Dickens is noted for, and full of action and exciting scenes. More significantly, it is one of his most thought provoking works, with a relevance that is applicable to today's world. It will leave you cheering for the good guys and grateful to see that the bad guys (and gals) get what coming to them. The book is divided cleanly into two parts, the first taking place in 1775, depicts the comings and goings of four families and their assorted relations and friends. The second occurs five years later and focuses on an historical event, the riots which shook London to oppose rights for Catholics.The book begins at the Maypole, an inn located just outside London and presided over by John Willet, a pompous know-it-all who intimidates his friends and dominates his son, Joe, to the point that he leaves to join the army by the end of this part. Hugh, an uneducated and violent man works for Willet handling animals. Down the road is the residence of Geoffrey Haredale, a country gentleman, and his niece Emma, a beautiful and gracious girl. Her father was mysteriously killed 22 years previously and the mystery runs through the book. Haredale is a Catholic and an antagonist to John Chester, an oily, Machiavellian, highly ambitious character. The only thing the two men have in common is their mutual desire to keep Chester's son Edward from a romance with Emma. In this they succeed and Edward, too, leaves at the end of part 1. The third household contains the Varden family. Gabriel, the father, is a locksmith kindly and a moderating influence throughout the book. Ultimately he plays a hero's role. His wife, Martha, constants nags him, aided and abetted by their servant, Miss Miggs, a comical character given to hysterics. Their daughter, Dolly, is beautiful and vivacious, but flirtatious and at this point does not return the love that Joe Willet shows for her. Simon Tappertit, an apprentice to Mr. Varden, also resides there. He is a ridiculous person with an exaggerated sense of himself and the clandestine leader of a group of similar apprentices with designs on engaging in violence against their masters. Finally there is the residence of the title character, Barnaby Rudge, who is a mentally deficient but happy and charming young man. He lives in genteel poverty with his mother. Mr. Rudge, who was the steward to the murdered Mr. Haredale, was also allegedly a victim. The cast of characters interacts in typical Dickens fashion for the first 33 (of 80) chapters.The scene and mood shifts abruptly in the second part which gives a detailed and graphic account of the so-called \\"anti-popery\\" riots that took place in London in 1780. The reader would do well to read an independent account of these events before reading Dickens' version. The above cast of characters is joined in part two by an additional group including some from actual life (Lord George Gordon, the instigator of the riots and Ned Dennis, one of the ringleaders to name but two). The riots bring out the best and the worst of all the characters. Barnaby is conned into joining the rioters and ends up in prison condemned to be hanged, the Maypole Inn is sacked and John Willet, humiliated, bound and gagged, the Haredale residence is set ablaze and Emma and Dolly taken prisoner, many houses are burned, people killed, Newgate prison is broken into, destroyed and all the prisoners released. The riots end with a harrowing scene is which dozens of people are burned to death by flaming alcohol.The execution scene, where three of the \\"ringleaders\\" are to be hanged is one of the most powerful parts of the book. Dickens gives a vivid account of the conditions and circus atmosphere that surrounds this event. In Hugh's powerful and eloquent speech Dickens also gives a condemnation of British society that creates such persons. Hugh at this point is the most moral person in the book and goes to his death with bravery and courage. This scene alone is well worth reading the book for.In the end, of course, everything is sorted out, justice is delayed but not denied and we have a happy ending.If the book can be said to suffer it is from the lack of a strong central character around whom the plot revolves. There is no real hero here or even a singular villain. Joe and Edward, either of whom might have filled the former role are largely absent from much of the book and only show up again after the riots have ended. Gabriel Varden comes closest to that role but is more acted upon than actor until the closing chapters. The most likely candidate for villain, John Chester, likewise disappears at the end of part one. Hugh, Simon and Dennis emerge as a trio of rouges joined by Gashford, secretary to Lord Gordon and a blind man who cries plaintively, why must I be good just because I am blind? The murderer, of course, is also lurking around. But none of these individuals stands apart from the rest and the hero versus villain theme is muted. The book is really about events and how these events shape and change the life of the characters for better or worse.In the end you will find yourself thinking about Barnaby Rudge for days afterward and it will leave a mark on your life. Nothing more positive can be said about any book."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge, (Living literature series, R. Burton, PH. D., editor-in-chief)","review":"This is the last of all the Dickens's novels (including the five shorter Christmas Books) that I have either read or attempted. I had saved it until the last because it has not been held in very high esteem either by the critics or the reading public. I was pleasantly surprised.Whereas there are several Dickens novels that I was unable to finish (namely, The Old Curiosity Shop, Martin Chuzzlewit, Dombey and Son, Little Dorrit, The Mystery of Edwin Drood, and all the Christmas Books except A Christmas Carol), Barnaby Rudge never dragged even though it is one of Dickens's longer novels. Barnaby Rudge is as filled with memorable characters (especially the secondary ones - Miss Miggs, the Vardens, the Chesters, Hugh, Mr. Tappertitt, Dennis the hangman, etc.); places (the Maypole Inn, the locksmith's shop) and incident (the Gordon Riots) as any of his greater novels.Stylistically, Barnaby Rudge is akin to Dickens's earlier picaresque novels (Pickwick Papers, Oliver Twist and Nicholas Nickleby). After those early successes of the 1830s, Dickens was struggling to find his mature style in my opinion. Most of the longer and shorter novels I was unable to finish come from the 1840s. (The Mystery of Edwin Drood is Dickens's last novel, but it was only half-finished at his death so it is really not fair to blame Dickens for my failure to respond to it.) Even though The Old Curiosity Shop comes between Nicholas Nickelby and Barnaby Rudge, Barnaby Rudge demonstrates all the strengths of Nicholas Nickelby and avoids the weaknesses of The Old Curiosity Shop. Barnaby Rudge is still early Dickens in my opinion.G. K. Chesterton described a taste for early Dickens as similar to a taste for new potatoes as opposed to mature potatoes. Some people prefer new potatoes. Barnaby Rudge is not Dickens at his greatest. (I reserve that description for David Copperfield, Great Expectations and Bleak House. Along with the three novels of the 1830s already mentioned, I place Hard Times, A Tale of Two Cities and Our Mutual Friend and now, Barnaby Rudge, on the second tier of Dickens's novels.) We must remember, that Dickens at his worst is better than most writers at their best. If Barnaby Rudge were a newly discovered work by an otherwise unknown author, or by one of Dickens's contemporaries, it would be hailed as a masterpiece. As it is, Barnaby Rudge is an eminently enjoyable and readable effort by a great writer."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge, (Living literature series, R. Burton, PH. D., editor-in-chief)","review":"I'm reading this book for the second time after about twenty years. Dickens is a writer to be read slowly so that you can enjoy the feast of language, atmosphere, characters and plot. If its not Dickens' greatest, so what?"},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge, (Living literature series, R. Burton, PH. D., editor-in-chief)","review":"I began to read Charles Dickens when I was in my teen years. There is very few authors with such incite in to human character, and the ability to paint a scene that puts our current crop of authors to shame. The present day secular media from film, and books can never compete with a genius for the true art of literature. There are some authors today that might present a popular novel but they usually fall flat and unfulfilling once the book is read. There are always a few whose talent trancend politics, sensuality, and sensationalism. When you get tired of popularism Dickens is the author that fills your mind with memorable scenes and characters who go beyond the present politically correct novel. Dickens brings to life the morality, nobleness, and virtues that an author who lives beyond his century passes on. This novel is one of those that will be one that you will read again, maybe even more than a couple of times. G.K. Chesterton wrote the most profound and honest critisms of Dickens works. I suggest reading Chesterton for incite into Dickens. Barnaby Rudge could be a good start for a reading habit of honestly absorbing and entertaining literature. Put Patterson or Clancy aside and learn to enjoy the talent that will out live both of them."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge, (Living literature series, R. Burton, PH. D., editor-in-chief)","review":"Dickens' first historical fiction, &quot;Barnaby Rudge&quot; is not a big favorite either with Dickens fans or with critics, largely because of its curious lack of the divinely memorable characters for which Dickens is usually known. (There are some good characters, but not the all-star cast we come to expect from the master.) Be this as it may, there's no denying that the buildup and eruption of the Gordon riots in London offer us some of Dickens' most compelling writing. Once the riots finally begin, they sweep us along in a torrent of demonic energy that is suitably appalling to the reader. For this reason, &quot;Barnaby Rudge&quot; is certainly worth reading. Even &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; does not conjure the same breathless chaos as &quot;Rudge&quot; does. Also, though it is one of Dickens' earlier books, it has much more evidence of structured planning than do more improvised works such as &quot;Pickwick Papers&quot; and &quot;The Old Curiosity Shop.&quot; Dickens would not truly master the art of creating a well-rounded novel in serial installments until &quot;Dombey and Son,&quot; but he is clearly on the right track here."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge, (Living literature series, R. Burton, PH. D., editor-in-chief)","review":"This work by Dickens takes the factual events of the &quot;No Popery&quot; riots of 1780's London,England and uses them as a backdrop for a dozen or so of Dicken's most colorful and well contrasted characters and combines with them a plot that includes a long unsolved murder. The reader can expect the usual thoroughly desciptive scenes, long a hallmark of his writing style, and characters that seem to come to life,jumping as it were, right from the very page. It is a pleasure,not a chore, to read Barnaby Rudge."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge, (Living literature series, R. Burton, PH. D., editor-in-chief)","review":"For someone whose favourite literary period is the 19th Century, I have a confession to make. I am 43 years old (young!) and Barnaby Rudge is the first Charles Dickens novel I have ever been able to finish. I had previously made attempts on Oliver Twist, David Copperfield, Great Expectations and Hard Times and never got passed more than a couple of chapters in any one of them. Perhaps it was due to having hitherto had many great expectations and more than a few hard times? Who knows?!When I saw that The Complete Works of Charles Dickens was available on Kindle for less that 2.00 I downloaded it and was then left with the decision as to which of his novels I should try first. I went for Barnaby Rudge as I liked the name. Simple as that. I knew nothing about the book, not even, as it transpired, the length of it. That's one of the negative points of reading a book on Kindle - particularly when it is part of a collection. It was only after reading it for a month or so that I decided to check out the length in paperback - 744 pages. For one who had decided to regularly read and post reviews I guess a novel of such length was not a good choice. But by that time, it was too late to stop reading, not least because I was absolutely in love with the book.So where to begin? Barnaby Rudge was apparently scheduled to be Dickens' first published novel but due to various issues including a change of publisher it was originally published in weekly installments from February 1841 to November 1841 in a magazine he edited called Master Humphrey's Clock. By all accounts it is not renowned as being one of his best and there have only been two attempts to dramatise it - once in a 1915 silent movie and again in an early 1960's TV serialisation. To be honest, had I known of these facts before, I would still have chosen it to be the first of his novels I would read all the way through. I do love an underdog!For me, the novel felt like I was engaged in three different art forms. The first third is like wandering around an art gallery, taking in the scenes, observing a time where the world was slower, less intense. The second is like watching an action film - fast paced, frantic, disturbing and entirely enthralling. The final third is akin to watching a series of vignettes on stage - the resolution of each of the many plot strands. This one man audience applauded and left the theatre sighing and fulfilled.The central theme of the novel is how people cope when faced with emotional conflict - whether that be thwarted love, a lusting for a higher station in life, a desire for money or a desire for power. The first third of the novel sets up the conflicts and the central third imposes the incredible anarchy initiated (somewhat unknowingly it must be said) by Lord Gordon's attempts to rail against the Papist Act of 1778. Each of the main characters are caught up in the riots and each is changed by the way they decide to react to them. As you would expect, there are heroes and villains, deceit, wonder and disaster. The description of the riots is absolutely stunning and I could not help but think of the riots in London last year. Over 200 years separates each event yet Charles Dickens' account far exceeds anything I read in any newspaper a year ago. I was moved, appalled and entirely dumbstruck by the connection. I defy anyone not to react in a similar way.The structure of Barnaby Rudge reminded me of Les Miserables by Victor Hugo (1862) - the extensive scenes depicting the Battle of Waterloo substituting the Gordon Riots; and the character of Miggs was very redolent of Miss Clack in The Moonstone (1868) by Wilkie Collins. Other than A Tale of Two Cities, Barnaby Rudge was the only novel Charles Dickens wrote that wasn't set in the 19th Century and there is a feeling of nostalgia in it that perhaps is hard to feel about his 19th Century novels. I have recently begun reading Nicholas Nickleby so I can certainly attest to the fact that his anger against the education system, capitalism and greed is certainly not depicted with any form of sentiment!So overall, having read Barnaby Rudge, I am full of awe, admiration, joy and humility. William Blake is my ultimate literary hero - Charles Dickens, even after having just read one of his novels (a largely forgotten one at that) is already running him a close second."},{"Title":"Intimate Falls","review":"This mystery suspense novel is a page-turning delight from the very opening pages. With the invasion of the peace and quiet of computer-upgrade-day by a ditzy pregnant sister (Julia Hobbs) of an old college buddy, our hero (information agent Brandon Drake)is plunged into just the kind of contract he has carefully tried to avoid since getting out of the Private Eye business. The plot rips into high gear and just keeps going through all four hundred pages.The Yosemite rock-climbing disappearance of Julia's husband, we learn early in the novel, wasn't an accident after all. And Drake's involvement with the investigation sends the case spinning through a deep and wicked web of high-tech start-ups and sleazy East LA strip bars.The sensual themes heat up from the get-go, too, as the novel's cover art suggests. [The U.S. National Park Trust is said to have banned display of that cover in Yosemite bookstores and galleries, in spite of the fact that at least 50% of my male friends (and only about 10%of the women) didn't even recognize the female profile on the cover until it was pointed out to them by someone who DID recognize it ---- sort of a cover art Rohrschach test!]The plot weaving is fascinating and relentless, full of great dialogue throughout, and some very touching exchanges between the main characters as they work their way through what becomes a horrendous ordeal of survival in order to sort out what really happened up on the mountain, and why.Climbers will love it, mystery readers will love it, and with its very lovely romantic moments, just about everyone should find something special about this book.

During these 10 years, Covenant has tried to make a life for himself as a writer and cope with his leprosy to the best of his ability.However, Covenant suddenly finds himself summoned to The Land once more and this time his summoner is Lord Foul. Three thousand years have passed since Covenant was last in The Land. But all the beauty and healthful benefits of The Land are gone. Lord Foul has warped The Land to his will through the use of the Sunbane, an evil aura around the sun that bends the laws of nature. The people of The Land must scratch out a meager existence and use human blood in an attempt to control the Sunbane.

Although not suffering from leprosy, Linden has demons of her own from her past that she must come to terms with in order to assist Covenant in the redemption of The Land.Covenant decides to journey to Revelstone, the former Lords' keep, to determine if the Clave, strange governing body that manipulates the Sunbane, is acting for the good of the people. Can Covenant find a way to reverse the effects of the Sunbane? Can he face and defeat Lord Foul once again? Can Linden come to terms with the ghosts of her past and find a way to assist Covenant? This and the other two books in the trilogy will answer these questions.Donaldson is once again masterful without repeating the story line of the first trilogy. The Land is completely different (yet strangely the same) in this trilogy, which opens numerous new possibilities. As in the first trilogy, much of the book is used to explore the frailties of the main characters and how they mirror the basic frailties of human nature. Donaldson triumphs once again. If you liked the first trilogy, this one won't disappoint you. While not superior to the original trilogy, this is every bit its equal."},{"Title":"The Wounded Land: Book 1 of \\"the Second Chronicles of Thomas Covenant\\"","review":"A continuing story of the age old fight between good and evil.

It's a good book, don't get me wrong, but damn. Unlike the previous 3 books, this one doesn't end with Covenant back in the real world, he stays in the Land much longer this time around.

If you haven't, go read them, they're among the best books I've ever read.The key to this book revolves around the idea Covenant presents early on: \\"How do you hurt someone who has lost everything? Give them back something broken.\\" Indeed, we do return to The Land, but everything is absolutely horrible. The story is made more poignant because of all we grew to know and love about The Land in the previous chronicles, and the depth of the storytelling is absolutely spellbinding. The book toys with emotions and ideas that leave you slightly unsettled, and you won't always put this book down feeling happy (when I originally read it about six years ago it managed to bring a slight depression on me).The characters are beautifully developed, the plot progresses better than I could have expected, and, as with the original chronicles, the depth of The Land is simply breathtaking. I highly recommend this book with the contingency that you have read the prior ones. If not, go read Lord Foul's Bane. Right now."},{"Title":"The Wounded Land: Book 1 of \\"the Second Chronicles of Thomas Covenant\\"","review":"I have enjoyed his other works, but this is one of the most miserable books I have ever attempted to read.

But I almost threw it out the car window when I read about &quot;Lord Foul the DESPISER.&quot; I am sorry, but my youngest cousin (five) would be able to come up with more creative names. I resisted the temptation, however, when I remembered that it belongs to my library.When I have more time, and more patience, I may try to read this again.

Nothing at all..."},{"Title":"The Wounded Land: Book 1 of \\"the Second Chronicles of Thomas Covenant\\"","review":"This book was horrible and depressing. While it might have had its redeming points, I couldn't get past the his raping of the woman in the beginning of the book. I don't care if he's a leper and can now feel his lower region. This story was horrible and should be avoided at all costs."},{"Title":"The Wounded Land: Book 1 of \\"the Second Chronicles of Thomas Covenant\\"","review":"Don't let this characterization fool you: I find the world of Hobbits fascinating and wonderful fare, but Donaldson manages to combine the harsh reality of flawed adulthood with the magic of fantasy. The damned of the Chronicles are truly damned, brought down by their own desires rather than some simplistic evil orientation. The heroes struggle both for righteousness and with themselves. Yet for all the dark ambiguity, the beauty of The Land makes you ache to see it and agonize for its pain. This is grownup stuff, escapism that never totally leaves our world behind.The introduction of Linden Avery opens another compelling view of a most seductive place. Unlike Covenant, whose struggles to justify and continue his existence wound himself and all who care for him, Avery is a link to our world who soldiers on with her mission of mercy. She doesn't let the shock of her arrival in The Land destroy her role of healing, yet the Second Chronicles is very much the story of how she finds personal peace as well as purpose with practicing her profession in a very sick world.It's hard to believe that this saga could sustain a second trilogy, especially with volumes of this length -- but it does. If your bookshelf has a place for mature fantasy, make room for the Second Chronicles."},{"Title":"The Wounded Land: Book 1 of \\"the Second Chronicles of Thomas Covenant\\"","review":"First off, if you haven't read the first Thomas Covenant trilogy (Lord Foul's Bane, The Illearth War, and The Power that Preserves), I reccomend you do that first. Mainly, it's an amazing an tremendous work. Also, you'll get a lot of background that is necessary to appreciate the second trilogy, and it's hard to really feel Covenant's sense of loss and despair at the despoiling of the Land without having seen it when it was beautiful.The Second Trilogy of Thomas Covenant is very different thematically from the first. The question of dream vs. reality is disposed of almost immediately in The Wounded Land (and arguably it was just a plot trick in the first trilogy anyway, so we could comfortably both despise and sympathise with Thomas Covenant). All that the Council represents has been shattered and the strength of their convictions must now be restored by Thomas Covenant and a few friends. He must come to terms with what he has lost, who he is, and what the Land truly meant to him. Linden Avery, his new companion from the real world who is drawn in when Covenant is summoned, is herself a flawed character - but she is a product of events she could not control. In a reverse of the original trilogy, the story of her anguish, the truth she must come to terms with, and her role in the fate of the Land is drawn out slowly, over the course of all three books.This second trilogy is more personal than the first. In the first trilogy Thomas Covenant is profoundly influnced by the Land and all the people around him, and must reconcile their strength with his own anguish, eventually confronting his own failings to earn redemption; in the second everything the Land was, is lost. Linden and Covenant must personally struggle to restore it despite their own weakness and imperfection, with the help of a group of wandering Giants, the always loyal but subtly changed Bloodguard, and two natives of the Land. Wheras in the first book we know Covenant has a latent power which if he could only discover and unleash, he could defeat Foul, in the Wounded Land Covenant's power is growing out of control and any release could shatter the Arch of Time and give Foul victory - effectively rendering Covenant's White Gold powerless.Everyone must make tremendous sacrifices in their struggle to see the land restored, and the final resolution in White Gold Wielder is amazing, thrilling, tremendously moving, and ultimately incredibly satisfying - making these books arguably the greatest work of fantasy literature ever written, eclipsing even the remarkable works of Tolkien for depth and power."},{"Title":"The Wounded Land: Book 1 of \\"the Second Chronicles of Thomas Covenant\\"","review":"D. shows how inventive he truly is. something truly bad has happened to the land. something called the sunbane is destroying the land. this time there is real trouble finding allies in a land of suspicion and aggression. the people of the Land themselves are no longer allies, but mostly hostile. the second chronicles are very different from the first. the Land is descriped differently, the concept and the environment very different. D. goes more into describing battles on a man-to-man basis, and shows that he masters that very well."},{"Title":"The Wounded Land: Book 1 of \\"the Second Chronicles of Thomas Covenant\\"","review":"Stephen Donaldson was brought impressive power to the page in his first chrinicles of Thomas Covenant. He surpasses himself with the second chronicles, maturing the story and characters allowing the reader to feel as infected as the land he describes. In the second Chronicles Thomas Covenant returns to the land in a dramatic blaze of fire summoned by his old enemy Lord Foul. He finds the land has changed int he time he has been away. The beutiful and healing land Donaldson created in the first set of books has been replaced with a warped and diseased place ruled by the Sun Bane nad controlled by the Clave. Both these are the work of Lord Foul who has corrupted everything that made the land a place to love and cherish. If you have ever wanted to know what it would be like if the bad guy won here is your chance to find out. This is the first of three books in the second chrinicles all of which are superbly written and gripping pieces of literature.Recommendations, The Price of Immortality was a very enjoyable read that kept me guessing through out."},{"Title":"The Wounded Land: Book 1 of \\"the Second Chronicles of Thomas Covenant\\"","review":"You spent the entire first trilogy wondering when Thomas Covenant would &quot;get over it&quot; and stop whining! Finally, in the last few pages he sucks it up and uses his wild magic to glorious effect!In this book Covenant is less wary about using the white magic, or maybe he's forced to use it. Anyway, he's finally learned how to invoke it and becomes more than just a passive character.I think this series will be more satisfying than the last, during which I spent the entire time wondering when Covenant would do something."},{"Title":"The Wounded Land: Book 1 of \\"the Second Chronicles of Thomas Covenant\\"","review":"Wow. I'm sorta at a loss for words here. I can't really describe how strongly I feel for this book and the series that follows it. This is Donaldson in top form, even topping the first Chronicles of Thomas Covenant. His violation of the Land and the introduction of Linden Avery, not to mention making good ole Tom a little more sympathetic (though just as pained as ever...don't you worry about that) make this series one notch better than what I had thought was perfection. If you have a dark spot in your soul, this will make you FEEL more than anything you could imagine previously. The only small flaw there is, which doesn't take away from the book at all, so it may not BE a flaw, is Donaldson's tendency to use an &quot;extended&quot; vocabulary. While I don't mind painting pictures with intricate words, I believe that using &quot;chiaroscuro&quot; and &quot;glode&quot; is stretching it. (look those up, as you'll need them several times per volume).If you're looking for other &quot;Dark Fantasy,&quot; and I mean the Real Stuff, not the *!@#$ Stephen King and the like try to pass off as it(avoid dark tower like the plague), try Neil Gaiman's Sandman(and then his everything else...if you don't feel comfortable with comics, at LEAST read Smoke &amp; Mirrors and Neverwhere), and read Michael Moorcock's Elric Saga(pretty much Thomas Covenant sans the leprosy, but with a soul-sucking sword and yet another debilitating disease)."},{"Title":"The Wounded Land: Book 1 of \\"the Second Chronicles of Thomas Covenant\\"","review":"I just finished reading this first book in the second Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, so my perspective does not include the conclusion of this adventure. The way the book just ends is not like the previous trilogy, but it's not unexpected or necessarily bad... in fact, it might be tedious to keep sending Covenant back to \\"our\\" world, and, as one might surmise (I won't give anything away), there might be a good reason he doesn't go back.As usual, I think Donaldson enjoys patting himself on the back for coming up with the most obscure, uncommon words he can. Either be prepared to figure out the meanings from context, have a dictionary next to you, or just ignore it. I've done all three.That said, Donaldson's writing style is excellent; despite the vocabulary, I found this book an easier read than any of the first three books; the story is compelling, sad, and has drawn me in a lot more than the first book of the first trilogy did.We start off with Covenant being drawn back into the Land as he has been before, but the means by which he gets there have changed drastically, and involve a lot of people on \\"our\\" side, including his ex-wife and Doctor Linden Avery, a new doctor in town tasked with keeping tabs on Covenant. When he gets there, he finds things are vastly different than he previous visits, all for the worse. He has the task of explaining what's going on to his new companion (Avery), trying to keep her sane while he figures out what's going on.Like most \\"quest\\" stories, he picks up companions along the way to help him along. The land has been corrupted by Foul, and the ravers are back causing problems that have deeply rooted themselves and disrupted the Earthpower by which occupants of the land previously lived by. As usual, Covenant blames himself... and tasks himself with setting things straight, starting with his decision to recreate the Staff of Law that was violated and ultimately destroyed by High Lord Elena on his previous visit to the Land.If I had to make a one line summary of how I feel about this book right now it would simply be that I cannot wait to pick up the next book."},{"Title":"The Wounded Land: Book 1 of \\"the Second Chronicles of Thomas Covenant\\"","review":"I started with the first set- \\"The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever\\" back in the late 1970's and waited feverishly for each book to come out.I thought that would be the end of it. Then in the early 1980's, this, the second set back to \\"The Land\\" came out and I couldn't have been more pleased. These books are an excellant read, with or without the first set, though obviously it will be more meaningful to anyone that has been to \\"The Land\\" with Thomas and Stephen Donaldson before.Now here I am, getting close to my half century age, and imagine my suprise and delight to see that Stephen Donaldson is back at it with a third set of \\"Thomas Covenant\\" books!Even though I have read these first two sets many times since I first discovered them, it's been about 10 years. So here I am, I have replaced for the 3rd time the 1st set of three books, the 2nd time for these, the second three books, and now the first two that I just found out about.That is how good these books are, every time I read them I enjoy them more, in my teens and twentys- then 30's, now almost 50 (2 more years).The only downside that I'm aware of is that some individuals that don't have a wide vocabulary MAY have a difficult time with some of the language. The words \\"of The Land\\" are in an appendix at the back of each book, however alot of the very descriptive words that Stephen uses to help us FEEL his creation are not in common usage today.

There seems to be nothing but despair as the evil sunbane has taken over and the beautiful people sacrifice bits of theirselves to conjure power everytime. There seems to be no way out as Harukai are fettered in the catacombic bowels of a prison waiting to bleed for the sunbane. The unreality and the unjustification of such incidence pains the reader, praying for a panacea to cure this rotten state. Thomas Covenant is the only hope and Linden Avery makes for a new hope. This piece is written perfection of everything wrong in the world, the corruptible everything, and the curable nothing. This paralell with mankind is insightful and poignant.

It has been 4,000 years by the Land's reckoning, and much has changed. The land is plagued by the Sunbane, a corruption of the sun which causes either rainstorms, desertification, putrefaction or unrestrained fertility for days at a time. Summoned with Covenenat to the Land is Linden Avery a doctor in our world with a troubled past.'The Wounded Land' is the first book of 'The Second Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever'. As good as the first series was 'The Wounded Land' is even better. The horrors of the Sunbane are well conceived (reminding me somewhat of David Lindsay's 'Voyage to Arcturus') and Covenant is a much more symapthetic figure this time around."},{"Title":"The Wounded Land: Book 1 of \\"the Second Chronicles of Thomas Covenant\\"","review":"This series was just as good as the first.

READ THIS SERIES."},{"Title":"The Wounded Land: Book 1 of \\"the Second Chronicles of Thomas Covenant\\"","review":"I read the first series and was blown away. The story is built on an immense scale. There are so many characters, so much background, so many journeys that you feel like you are there and care for the Land. This series isn't for everyone. If you aren't looking for a book to stimulate you intellectually with big words then go read The Dark Elf Trilogy.I have to comment on one reviewer who said she didn't like the story because of its simplistic names (i.e. Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever, and Lord Fould the Despiser). It is obvious she didn't read the whole story (even beyond her admission of not getting past the first 50 pages). Had she read further she would have realized that those names are integral to the entire series. Those names are symbolic. Unbeliever represents the conflict within Thomas Covenant. Any other name would make his struggles/conflict meaningless."},{"Title":"The Wounded Land: Book 1 of \\"the Second Chronicles of Thomas Covenant\\"","review":"Covenant finally shoulders the responsibility for The Land's survival and sheds the anti-hero persona that we found irritating.

I was shocked to find the land I knew gone. All those who knew him had died, the Ramen and Ranyhyn had fled south,so that no one knew the land before it was corrupted by lord foul (again) and the lords, earthpower and legends of covenant had been replaced by lies.

Donaldson. THis is a great book for the most part and I think most people would agree that this is not only good fantasy but good literature. My problem is with Donaldson's language.Huh? What do I mean by this. Well to put it simply, he is a sesquipedalian. He is the most obvious example of a sesquipedalian ever at least among modern writers. What is a sesquipedalian, you ask? Well, it is someone who loves to use big words. Donaldson not only uses big words, he uses words that are not big but are just not used at all by the general public!! YOu really feel at times while reading this book that you are reading a book written in a foreign language. It is really a shame really as this book(along with the others in this series) has a great plot, interesting characters and an awesome setting for which this book takes place.I think that I have the right to criticize Donaldson's writing because I consider myself to be of above average intelligence. I score around 130 or so on an IQ test and have two college degrees. This book is so full of ridiculous words that you are left with two choices. Either skip over the words and try to get their meaning from the context, or keep a dictionary beside you at all times while reading the book. At this point, I am sure, you would like to see some examples of what I am talking about, right? Okay here goes. Some of these words are not that long but are NEVER used at all by anyone except for maybe Donaldson and his high-browed buddies...--\\"They wore their private needs like 'cerements',\\"--\\"..it wore 'coquelicot' like a crown of thorns.\\" My spell checker did not know that this word ever existed!--\\"And Linden's manner betrayed an 'innominate' anxiety\\" Another spell check failure on this one!--\\"For a time, Covenant's awareness of his surroundings was 'etiolated' by memories of Andelain\\"--\\"The strain of the last few weeks effected him like 'caducity'\\" Another spell check hit. WHo uses these words??--\\"That 'obeisance' pulled Covenant out of his inner 'gyre'\\" Okay, I have heard that first word before bit gyre? What the hell is that?--\\"He winced at her 'percipience'\\"--\\"Compelling himself with 'excoriations'\\"--\\"Her judgement hurt him like a demonstration of 'mendacity'\\"--\\"Now it wore pale brown like a translucent 'cymar'\\" Looky here! ANother spell check hit!--\\"Some of them bore blunt javelins like 'jerrids'\\" Yet another spell check hit! I think this guy just looks through dictionaries to find the most obscure words to put into his books!--\\"He no longer felt blurred and 'ossified'\\" I think this means becoming bone but why use it here?--He uses innominate and cerements again elsewhere in the book! If he keeps this up, these words might become vogue!--\\"chancreous' with self-loathing\\"--\\"The sun beat at them like it was an affront to its 'suzerainty'\\"--\\"the sun wore a coronal of 'chrysoprase'\\"I could go on and on but I think you get the point. There are some words that he uses a lot in the book to where I figured what he meant by the usage. Mien for example meaning the expression on a person's face and poniard meaning a type of knife. Why not just say face and knife? I am pretty sure I will get some people up in arms for criticizing this great piece of fantasy literature. Go for it! This writing style is pretentious and ridiculous. Can you imagine talking to Donaldson? I would need some kind of universal translator.This will not stop me from continuing to read his books as the story contained in between all the $10 words is quite good. I also want to say that there were many words that I did understand that would not be understood by 80% of potential readers,. The effect of this is that many people will give up on this book rather than read it in its entirety. This would truly be a shame."},{"Title":"The Wounded Land: Book 1 of \\"the Second Chronicles of Thomas Covenant\\"","review":"I was very pleased to see Donaldson's first Thomas Covenant trilogy recently become available for the Kindle, and I was really hoping that the complete Second Chronicles (a sequel trilogy) would soon follow. I was disappointed to discover, however, that only this first volume of the Second Chronicles, The Wounded Land, was to become available on June 13, 2012. I couldn't imagine why the publisher (Random House Digital, Inc.) would release only the first volume of a continued story in trilogy format (longtime fans of Donaldson and this trilogy will understand my frustration).Though I don't think the Second Chronicles are quite as good as the original Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, they are still well worth reading. The reader just has to be patient with the sometimes mildly annoying, repeated internal lamentations of the lead characters.I contacted Random House by telephone to ask about The One Tree and White Gold Wielder, the second and third volumes, respectively, of the Second Chronicles trilogy. I was told that there is no definite date set for the release of those two titles. I later found a \\"News\\" page on the author's official Web site, and, according to him, the other two Second Chronicles titles should be coming out in ebook format before too long. On April 20, 2012, he said The One Tree had already been converted to an ebook and was being checked by the publisher. On that same day, he said that Work on White Gold Wielder had not yet begun at the publisher, though. The author says he has been providing clean Word .doc files to the publisher for the Thomas Covenant novels to avoid the kinds of quality-control problems his Gap series suffered from.

This time he is more powerful than ever. Having lost their lore and earth power the people of the land are seemingly powerless against Foul's minions the clave.So begins Thomas's tale. However, this time he is joined by a woman from his world named Linden Avery. Lord Foul summons Thomas to his world with the hope of obtaining the white gold with which to rule both worlds.Then inexplicably, Lord Foul let's Convenant go. What the hell? The whole 1,500 page series should have been over at page 50. Foul is all powerful. All he has to do is squash Convenant and take the ring.But in Donaldson's world, Thomas is set free to wander the land.. in frustration. Foul has eliminated all earth power and replaced with Sunbane, which controls the weather and make life hell for the inhabitants. It's either way too hot; way to raining; or way too many insects. Everybody hates the Sunbane.Even though Foul has let Convenant go, he finds it necessary to launch wave after of attacks using insects, rats, or whatever creatures he can find. Would it have been that hard for Foul to send out a few soldiers to fetch him? He already knows where is. This is so stupid.So page after page is about the latest attack. Than there are the emotional problems of Avery and Convenant. Conventant can't figure out the paradox of power. Too much he breaks the arch of time. Too little Foul squashes him like a bug. Apparently, the white gold doesn't come with a throttle. Or Convenant lost the instruction manual and doesn't know how to use it.For Avery the issue is her parents.

Am I evil?Along their way, Avery and Convenant pick up misfits, with strange abilities, but nowhere in the land could they find a dam SHRINK!However, as bad as this book is, it might actually be the best in the 2nd Chronicles.

Thomas Covenent spends most of the book either unconscious, too weak to barely function, or wracked with guilt to be an effective hero. He becomes whiney, TOO human and a drain to read. 2.

I consider myself of at least average intelligence, but Donaldson managed to use a staggering number of obscure words whose meaning I either had to look up in the dictionary, guess at, or ignore. Far from adding to the book, his style comes across as affected - a criticism I wouldn't have applied to the first trilogy.Technique aside, the plot of this book simply couldn't hold my attention. The ingredients were there--a vastly different Land, an impossible voyage, so-called wild magic, even a love interest--but they seem to be nothing more than a re-hash of the previous trilogy. It's unusual for me to say this, but once having started this new series, I do not believe I'll read the next volume."},{"Title":"The Wounded Land: Book 1 of \\"the Second Chronicles of Thomas Covenant\\"","review":"I want to start by saying i enjoyed these books tremendously, i felt it was well written well described and detailed. But as luck would have it i found the last book to be most upsetting. I mean you go through the whole series of books learning to respect the main character Thomas Covenant and see the main battles he confronts ,personnel conflicks within himself, and it is all summarised by anew character. Not. I feel as through ive been ripped off. I think the author is a great story teller, but why did he go this way, you are led to believe through the battles he fought ,the self denials, that he would finnally get it he was the one, not some newcomer a doctor. I see where the author was going but a doctor, anew character. No. I really believe he should have lived through the final battle with the doctor in tow, to maybe show him the way to self acceptance i dont know but i read all the books and was gravely dissapointed, he should have won over evil not a doctor."},{"Title":"The Wounded Land: Book 1 of \\"the Second Chronicles of Thomas Covenant\\"","review":"Even if you liked the first trilogy, this one is nearly impossible to get through. It's quite obvious that he makes it up as he goes, and that's fine, but he didn't go back and smooth it out afterwards. It's almost as if he published his first draft. And he cheats, too. If you do read it, watch out for the chapter \\"blood speed\\" and you'll know what I mean. And his vocabulary is absolutely ridiculous. And it's long and boooring. Don't read it. I think Donaldson had let his success get to his head when he wrote these."},{"Title":"The Wounded Land: Book 1 of \\"the Second Chronicles of Thomas Covenant\\"","review":"THE WOUNDED LAND is a rich, and somewhat difficult book. It was certainly wonderful to return to the Land, but the book is by far the bleakest of the entire two trilogies. Donaldson clearly had to up the ante to make the book worth reading (and writing), so the despair that has befallen the Land is pretty dire.Also, even though we get to revisit Covenant, we are 4000 years in the future of the land, and all the beloved characters we came to know in the first trilogy are gone. Donaldson does manage a brief, ghostly appearance by some of them, but they are missed. After all, Covenant is aptly named an ANIT-hero, and he is tough to like. So Donaldson, while also showing us how horrible things have become in the Land, has to also give us new characters to care about.This time, Covenant brings someone with him from our time, the doctor Linden Avery. But she carries lots of baggage herself, and is also tough to warm up to...although she brings out a soft side in Covenant which is sorely needed. The author does a good job of introducing new characters to join on the new quest to save the Land from Lord Foul's machinations. Sunder and Hollian, two villagers who have learned all the history of the Land incorrectly, have their eyes opened to the truth by Covenant, and their plight of realization and acceptance is quite emotional. The character of Vain, a creature developed by the ur-viles to help Covenant, is fascinating and holds many secrets. I won't tell you too many more, because the book holds some delights in store.But it isn't easy. The first half of the book feels a bit repititive, as Covenant and his growing band struggle to cross the Land to Revelstone (echoes of the first book), and we kinda get the point early on that it isn't easy going. But things really pick up once Covenant goes to Andelain and then on to Revelstone. There are some exciting chase scenes, one in particular dealing with The Grim, a malevolent &quot;happening&quot; sent to destroy the group from the false lords of Revelstone.Donaldson has become an even more florid writer. His vocabulary is formidable...mine ain't too bad, but there is at least one word per page that leaves me scratching my head as to its definition, and I swear he's just made up a few. You can tell what they mean by the context, but they are distracting. He doesn't believe in subtle feelings...these characters are going through earth-shattering events, and they don't feel things mildly. They are torn, &quot;riven&quot;, etc. etc. I still love the books, but sometimes it is a bit much.If you've read the first trilogy and liked it or loved it...then you MUST read further. If you haven't read the first trilogy, don't start here. Go back to Lord Foul's Bane. And if, by some chance, you didn't care for the first trilogy, I don't think anything here will change your mind. You either love the Land and Donaldson's way of taking you there...or you don't and won't."},{"Title":"The Wounded Land: Book 1 of \\"the Second Chronicles of Thomas Covenant\\"","review":"Whereas many follow ups to successful first works seem to be written purely as a vehicle to squeeze another dollar out of a good idea (see Terry Brooks' second go with the Shannara series and David Eddings' Mallorean), this beginning of the Second Chronicles logically follows the First. I read this book many years ago, and am as impressed with the concept of a &quot;Wounded Land&quot; now as I was then. Some refer to this work as &quot;Dark Fantasy&quot;. I see it more as realism...within the scope of a fantasy setting, of course. Donaldson has a feel and touch to &quot;The Land&quot;, an affiliation so natural that his third person omniscient sounds exactly so. Upon reaching the end of this trilogy--The White Gold Wielder--it is obvious that the story has not yet reached completion. We can't hold our breath, as it has been some 16 years since White Gold Wielder was published, but we can bid our time. As impatient as it seems, at times...."},{"Title":"The Wounded Land: Book 1 of \\"the Second Chronicles of Thomas Covenant\\"","review":"Donaldson starts out his new series by allowing hints of the Land to leak out into the real world. Then he transports Covenant and Linden Avery to the Land. Only this time, the Land is sick. I won't say how or why, but the result is a very good, mildly depressing dark fantasy. Covenant is more accepting of the existence of the Land in this book, but Linden is thrown into confusion by it.This series is more her story than Covenant's. As Covenant was ill physically when he first entered the Land, Linden's wounds are on the inside, and she struggles with them throughout the trilogy. There's a lot of symbolism and allegory one can read into these books. Or one can just enjoy them as a story of a small group of people trying to restore a Land that once held joy, but is now the kind of place where a man would have to sacrifice his own family to feed a village. Good fantasy in a well-developed world."},{"Title":"The Wounded Land: Book 1 of \\"the Second Chronicles of Thomas Covenant\\"","review":"Stephen R. Donaldson takes a bold step in \`The Wounded Land' by allowing the existence of \`the Land' to trickle out into the real world. He then transports not only Thomas Covenant there, but also a new character \`Linden Avery' who offers a different perspective to the adventures they subsequently encounter. Thomas Covenant in this series seems more at ease in the Land, and less resistive to the event transpiring around him. Linden is confused by it, and endures her own personal turmoil throughout the series. This time the Land has declined to a low ebb, filled with suffering and death. The people have long forgotten their technology of living with the land, and have been demoralized to an unthinkable level by comparison with the first series. Perhaps this is the authors subtle expression and symbolic account of the decay in our own present society reflected in this fantasy world? It certainly carries with it a great deal of truth when you examine the comparison. Nevertheless, Donaldson continues his expertise with his incredibly creative characters and magical beings. He interweaves a great mix of plots and subplots and ties this series in at various points to the previous one, making it a very interesting and exciting story. This is the second chronicles of Thomas Covenant ( I recommend reading the first series before starting on this one), and it sets the stage for great adventure in the following two books. You will really become a Donaldson fan with this series, and find yourself engrossed within its pages. A great book and a very good story."},{"Title":"The Wounded Land: Book 1 of \\"the Second Chronicles of Thomas Covenant\\"","review":"The Wounded Land is the first book in the Second Chronicles of Thomas Covenant. In the first excellent trilogy, Covenant ultimately triumphed over the evil Lord Foul and brought centuries of peace and prosperity to the Land. Unfortunately, Foul was not destroyed, only forced to retreat and lick his wounds for a while. But surprisingly, Foul finds a way to strike at Covenant in his own world. This leads to Covenant returning to the Land, accompanied by a rather bitter and serious woman named Linden. Sort of a female version of Covenant I guess, but unlike Covenant her strength stems from a couple tragic childhood events that hardened her to emotion.Covenant returns to the Land (where about four thousand years have passed) to find it shockingly wasted, as if the Apocalypse itself had hit it. The change was caused by the Sunbane, a sinister creation of Foul's. Covenant spends half the book just trying to figure out what the heck went wrong and how he can turn things around. Fortunately he finds that he can unleash the wild magic at will, or at least whenever he's upset (sort of like Nynaeve's channeling block in Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series).Each book of the first trilogy had a major resolution at the end. The Wounded Land is difficult to evaluate on its own because there is no real resolution or even climax. About two thirds of the way through the book, Covenant's party embarks on a major quest that clearly will not be completed by the end of the novel. The ending isn't really climactic, but merely segues nicely into the sequel The One Tree.Donaldson's pace is generally slower in this trilogy than in the first one, but that's not to say that The Wounded Land doesn't contain plenty of action. Covenant barely escapes death a few times. The times when he uses the wild magic are exciting moments, and Donaldson is skillful at quickly heightening dramatic tension. Covenant's stay at Revelstone and his discoveries there are a high point in the novel. The page-turning trek through the treacherous Sarangrave Flats recalls the similar quest of the Bloodguard in The Illearth War.I haven't read the two sequels yet, but this second trilogy is looking great so far! Highly recommended for fans of simple fantasy with a dark flavor to it."},{"Title":"The Wounded Land: Book 1 of \\"the Second Chronicles of Thomas Covenant\\"","review":"The Wounded Land is an apt title for this book. For those who have read the First Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, this sequel trilogy is as stark a contrast as one author can offer when creating new ideas on a familiar subject. If you are unfamiliar with the first chronicles, I strongly recommend you go read it first to fully appreciate this contrast. Donaldson seeks to create a feeling of revulsion for something loved that has been violated in a way the reader could not imagine or be prepared to face. The living Land is dieing, rotting before the people who live for it. The biggest shock is for the lepor who has come to love the Land, not just for the renewed vibrance it gave him, but because of what it has done to the people. Life, love, evil, vileness, hope and sacrifice are intertwined in a heart wrenching, emotional roller coaster. A must read for Donaldson fans. Some may feel betrayed by the intentional devastation of the Land. Some may feel thrilled by the new adventure. At any rate, be prepared to FEEL!!!"},{"Title":"The Wounded Land: Book 1 of \\"the Second Chronicles of Thomas Covenant\\"","review":"If you have read the other books in the series, you sort of know what to expect. Covenant gets transported to the Land where Lord Foul is back to his old tricks. Unfortunately Covenant always gets transported to the wrong place. Covenant is weak and helpless and his misfortunate companions drag him from point A to point B, then to point C while being attacked by various evils. Evil prevails and innocents die by the score, while Covenant always just manages to evade death. Covenant's timidity results in either the under or overuse of his power, which usually results in the deaths of more innocents. Somehow a few of the good guys manage to survive to fight another day.The good news is that Covenant is not his usual whining self in this book. The bad news is that he has brought along a pal, Linden, to do the whining we are so used to. Covenant has become the Peter Sellers of heroes. He always blunders his way through a situation, but manages to end up with a successful solution.One thing that I really hate about the whole series is the Ravers. Donaldson has created 3 immortal evil beings that keep coming back time after time. When their host is killed they simply take over some other creature or person. I hate it when a super powerful creature, weapon, form of magic, etc. is created in a story, then can't really be put into full use, because it's use would obviously end the story. Face it, if the Ravers really wanted Covenant dead he would have died in book one. They could take over one of his companions easily enough and cut off his head and his stupid ring finger while he slept. The all powerful Ravers appeared time and again in this story in various forms taking Covenant to the brink of death time and again only to back off instead of easily finishing him off. Why? The only reason is so that the series can continue to another book.This book is somewhat dreary and depressing like the others, but there is enough interesting stuff happening that it is pretty entertaining. If you plan to read it, you had better keep a dictionary handy. Only book 2 of the series comes close to this one for the number of incomprehensible words used.I actually liked this book the best of the series so far."},{"Title":"The Wounded Land: Book 1 of \\"the Second Chronicles of Thomas Covenant\\"","review":"Ten years have passed since Power that Preserves.

To save the woman who betrayed him, Covenant returns to the Land, dragging Linden along. His leprosy has no hope of cure in the new Land; one wracked by Sunbane, but Linden's perceptions are their guide. In gathering the shreds of his past, Covenant makes sense of what has happened, and is determined to fight it. The law has been shattered, so he will restore it, somehow.At first, it's shocking to see the desolation of the Land, its beauty gone. As time passes, the strength of this new world overwhelms it.

I've always held the opinion that when writing use the simplest and clearest language of conveying your ideas - so do not use uncommonly used or difficult world when they can be avoided. I've always associated an author who uses difficult words as an intellectual snob.In this regard the 2nd Chronicle is a lot worse that the 1st, it seems like Donaldson has swallowed a thesaurus.Just for the amusement of all here are a few Donaldson classics:Why use \\"Celerity\\" when you could use \\"Speed\\".Why use \\"Mien\\" when you could use \\"Expression\\".Why use \\"Filigree\\" when you could use \\"Delicate Pattern\\"And...Why the use \\"Tintinnabulation\\" when you could use \\"ringing of bells\\"!?!"},{"Title":"Slan (Science fiction and adventures)","review":"When one peruses the Sci-fi/Fantasy section of his local bookstore, the shelves are crammed with the names of Heinlein, Asimov, and Arthur C. Clarke, but often missing is the name of A.E. van Vogt. But van Vogt was at least a peer of those greats back in the golden age of science fiction, and his first novel Slan is generally credited with having ushered in that fantastic era. Slan was my first van Vogt read, but will certainly not be my last!!Slan is the story of a race of telepathic super-humans, artificially created by mankind, only to be hated and exterminated by their jealous brethren after a stormy history. The main character Jommy Cross is a Slan orphan who must fight the mean streets of earth, striving to connect with others of his kind, ultimately to fulfill a suprising destiny. The narrative charges forward at thrilling pace, brimming with invention and concepts fresh and often startling for what I expected to be a rather dated genre book. Slan clearly was inspirational in the genesis of X-men, as you will have to read the book to understand, lest spoilers be given. You might say Professor Xavier is a Slan!The writing in Slan is rather pulpish in some places, since the novel was originally serialized in the pulps, but nevertheless, van Vogt demonstrates rare literary powers in defiance of the medium. At least one sentence per paragraph blazes like a meteorite! Some others have expressed disappointment at the suprise ending, but I rather liked it.As a final note, as some reviewers have stated blatantly, the perceptive reader will notice some real world allegories forming in Slan, some obvious, and others not so. There is a general device in Sci-fi/fantasy, that if one suspects he sees an allegory forming, he should go back and check the name. If he is correct, he may find some correspondence between the letters--either the letter count will be the same, phonetics will match, or there may be an anagram lurking. In this case, you may need to reverse the order of the letters!"},{"Title":"Slan (Science fiction and adventures)","review":"Jommy Cross is a Slan, hunted as all Slan are by the normal humans that hate and fear them. Sounds common, maybe, just that Van Vogt was there WAY before Stan Lee and the X-Men. And better.It's hard to say why this is so good, but Van Vogt has a style of story-telling that is just hard to describe. It's as unique as Van Gogh's painting -- you can read a Van Vogt without looking at the author and know exactly who wrote it.Other books of his (The Weapons Shops of Isher, The World of A) also have this One Man Against All theme, but this is his masterpiece. Among the cream of the Golden Age of SF, still in print after 50 years, and still just as readable."},{"Title":"Slan (Science fiction and adventures)","review":"I read Slan when I was a teenager back in the 80's. Back when I read about three SciFi books every week. Slan is one of the few that really left a lasting impression. The theme of \\"mutant\\" and \\"outcast\\" is definitely one of my favorites, but there are precious few books that do it any kind of justice. (In most treatments, the theme just becomes a pretense for comic book heroism or kinky sex.) Slan is one of the few that succeeds in really exploring the issue, including the imperative to find others of one's own kind, a concern that we can surely all sympathize with. It's definitely worth reading.In the same genre, I would also recommend \\"Psion,\\" and my personal favorite from the juvenile section, \\"The Girl with Silver Eyes,\\" a real masterpiece."},{"Title":"Slan (Science fiction and adventures)","review":"I just finished reading this book, and couldn't believe that it was written in 1940. I came across the book by accident, and I was intrigued enough by the idea of a ?robot ?cyborg (some sort of a living being) whose struggle with identity formed the thrust of the novel. Slan's storyline and background mimic some of the most popular comics, movies and books of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. It reminds me of Blade Runner, I Robot, the X-Men. The novel reminds me of Superman in his youth (coming of age and understanding who he is). In some ways, Slan reminds me of The Vampire Chronicles. van Vogt'novel is a true blend of \\"science\\" and \\"fiction\\" that should be more popular and no longer forgotten. It's a definite \\"must-read\\" in my book!"},{"Title":"Slan (Science fiction and adventures)","review":"A.E. van Vogt was a key figure in science fiction's golden age, moving the genre away from nerdy escapism to serious political themes and social commentary. Parts of \\"Slan\\" were first written in the late 1930s for serialization in pulp mags (the full novel is from 1946) and it's amazing how far this story was ahead of its time. Due to the patterns of sci-fi serialization and publishing in that era, this \\"novel\\" is actually a series of not-so-well-integrated vignettes and the plot moves along at a pretty awkward pace. Regardless, the power of van Vogt's theme puts a lot of other sci-fi to shame. Of course it features that crusty golden age vision of the future, but van Vogt's examination of political and social realities was revolutionary for sci-fi and its influence is still being felt today. The main story of a hate-filled three-way war among regular humans and two estranged races of superhumans, all of whom have distorted views of their histories and rightful places in the world, speaks volumes on propaganda and genocide. The political skullduggery and emotional manipulation of this book's characters are distressingly (and insightfully) relevant for all eras.Some modern readers might find this classic from the '40s outdated and inconsistent, but those with an appreciation for the genre's historical development will rightfully regard van Vogt as one of the most important early masters.

There is action, mystery and romance all wrapped into one fun story. With an unexpected ending that will make you want to re-read this classic again and again. A definate keeper!"},{"Title":"Slan (Science fiction and adventures)","review":"Slan is one of those Golden Age sci fi novels that while being dated, in terms of scientific jargon and ideas, is far more relevant than much of the hamhanded writing published in science fiction, or even literary fiction, these days. Given the civil rights issues involved in the ceaseless War On Terror, and things such as gay rights, the right to die, etc., Slan is as relevant as it was in the days leading up to World War Two, given its many and manifest Nazi parallels.Slan is the legendary first novel, first serially published in four parts in 1940, by Astounding Magazine, and in book form in 1946, by Arkham House, of Canadian science fiction titan A. E. Van Vogt (1912-2000), who was a master of the sort of science fiction short stories that a couple of decades later would play weekly on such early television science fiction shows as The Twilight Zone, One Step Beyond, and The Outer Limits, as well as later derivative work such as Marvel comics' X-Men. The fast-paced and straightforward tale is almost pedestrian, at first glance, yet is really a classic bildungsroman with many symbolic characters and plot points. John Thomas \`Jommy' Cross is a young slan, a genetically bred type of superhuman- with telepathic powers to read minds, whose race was created by a doctor named Samuel Lann, long in the earth's hazy past, which is the still to come 2070s, to aid humanity, but is now despised by normal humans. The precise dates the tale takes place in is never specified, for it could be six hundred years after the 2070s, or fifteen hundred years. Van Vogt is a bit sloppy in such lesser details. This is a typical cross to bear for serial novels- even the form's master, Charles Dickens, suffered from it, for a naturalistic narrative flow always gives way to the tides of serial needs: chapters ending with flashes of insight, spectacular events, and details that are rarely cohesive, and always fuzzy. Yet the tale moves quickly, right from the book's start....Van Vogt does add some nice touches, though, such as referring to Jommy as \`Cross' rather than \`Jommy' after he reaches maturity, and does make some pertinent commentary on the human condition that is applicable in any age:\`Yes, I said \`mob'. That's all people are these days. A mob, a beast we've helped build up with our propaganda. They're afraid, mortally afraid for their babies, and we haven't got a scientist who can think objectively on the matter. In fact, we haven't got a scientist worthy of the name. What incentive is there for a human being to spend a lifetime in research when in his mind is the deadening knowledge that all the discoveries he can hope to make have long since been perfected by the Slans? That they're waiting out there somewhere in secret caves or written out on paper, ready for the day when the slans make their next attempt to take over the world?'Substitute slans for terrorists or jihadists and no more need be said on why this book still has import. Because of this, one can overlook its flaws, and take it for the pulse-pounding adventure it is, birthed from an era when serial fiction dominated writing and films. And, as long as one bears those things in mind, the tale will draw you in."},{"Title":"Slan (Science fiction and adventures)","review":"I generally seem to find that sci-fi from the 40's, 50's and 60's to be more rewarding than those which are more recent. Slan reinforced that view.There's little doubt that this novel shows some sign of age, but the quality of the ideas presented still shine through. So much of what lies between these covers has influenced much of what came later. There are plenty of other novels and short stories which explore the possibility of the next evolutionaty step that humans may take, which doubtless explore it more deeply. However, this was amongst the first.Additionally it explores racism, and the dangers of mob-intolerance. On top of that, it's actually a good story.Charming, and a rewarding read."},{"Title":"Slan (Science fiction and adventures)","review":"I loved Slan. I felt for and with Jommy. I was caught up in the mystery just as Jommy was as he searched for other \\"true slans\\" like himself. I ,like Jommy, never guessed at the truth until it was revealed to both of us at the same time at the end of the book. This book is called a classic. I don't always agree with what people call a classic, but in this case I whole heatedly agree. This book was written in the early 1940s! It reads like a modern novel. To say it was ahead of it's time is an understatement. It is almost independent of time. The inventions that Jommy comes up with are innovative and exciting. His car is just like the batmobile. When Jommy just sits in his car staring, it reminded me of the dark knight.The idea of nature coming up with the next step in man's evolution is also the topic of many stories since Slan. I never once doubted the supreme intelligence of Jommy. I felt him there way above humans. It is nice to think that the next stage after man will be antiviolence and antimurder. It is comforting to think that a higher intelligence will kill unless the fate of the world hangs in the balance. Jommy inherits the most important discovery the \\"human\\" race has ever made. He takes it upon himself to bring it forth to the true slans who are the only ones who can be trusted to use it correctly. Therefore until he does so, his survival is the most important thing.My human reactions clashed sharply with Jommy's higher slan reactions in a few instances. When he showed mercy and took care of Granny, I would have had him kill her after she called the police. But it was his keeping her alive that saved him later on. Also Jommy felt death more deeply than a human could have yet was able to restrain himself and keep his purpose. I would have wiped out as many humans as I could have before they killed me.Overall, this is a very entertaining and extremely intelligent book. I liked the characters, the adventure, and the mystery. It is intelligent novels like this one that drew me to science fiction in the first place. I would hope that someone would make this novel into a movie because it would be great."},{"Title":"Slan (Science fiction and adventures)","review":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312852363/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_imgSLAN was the first science fiction novel I ever read.

Since then I've read all of the Null-A books, and all the Weapon Maker books.

I figured that for the price I might as well try it.I won't say that I loved the book, but something kept me reading. \\"Slan\\" is dated, yes--the language is vintage pulp and the ideas are commonplace today, but Van Vogt's prose has an energy that kept me going. Even though his handling of the SF elements--genetic engineering, space, and technology--is a little creaky, the underlying themes of the book remain potent. Racial bigotry, genocide, and fear of those who are different are just as relevant today as they were Van Vogt's day.It's always hard to put aside modern sensibilities of style and plot to read a classic work as it would have been read when first published.

Van Vogt has bigger fish to fry, larger themes to explore: world domination, war, man's inhumanity, atomic power and space travel all rank above his characters and their fate. For those who are more interested in characters than ideas this can be disappointing. Know that going in and you'll enjoy a great read."},{"Title":"Slan (Science fiction and adventures)","review":"Written many years ago, Slan by A E van Vogt, is considered by many to be a classic Sci Fi novel. Personally, I had never heard of it until very recently when I saw it mentioned in a recent book based on other books by van Vogt - his Null-A series.Slans are mutant \\"super-humans\\". There are apparently at least two types of them as is explained in the book. Many years before the time the story is set, Slans and regular humans have fought it out with the Slans driven into hiding. The book focuses on the adventures of a young Slan, Jommy Cross. Jommy is trying to bring an end to the persecution of the Slans without destroying regular humanity.The first three-quarters of the book is very well done with lots going on and is much better than the last part in my view. I was really hooked into the book from the start, so was a little disappointed in the \\"bumpy\\" way the last part progressed. The ending was rather abrupt for me as well - there is a sequel (Slan Hunter) that was written many years later which I will now have to read to see what happens. The author seemed in too great a rush to finish writing Slan, only to take a long time to come back to it years later and with the help of another author.Some people have commented that the \\"special effects\\" (technologies) in Slan are outdated. I would have to agree with this in many respects. For example, video is presented as if it is a real big deal - which I guess it was in the early 1940's when this book came out. It seems all very quaint in many parts, but still fun if you keep in mind when it was written. Those who like nostalgia will appreciate this. Sort of like how much fun it can be to watch old episodes of Flash Gordon, I guess.Despite the defects mentioned, the book is worth reading."},{"Title":"Slan (Science fiction and adventures)","review":"I first read 'Slan' when I was about 15. I thought it was a fantastic story and kept borrowing it from my brother and re-reading it. I bought it recently to see if it stood up to my memory of it. Ok, it is a bit dated, the conversations are more lengthy than we are used to in today's faster paced novels, but I found it very exciting all the same. It's about a boy who has the ability to read minds and knows that if the normal humans find out that he can, they will try to kill him. Obviously he has to use all his abilities to stay one move ahead of the game. Part of the fun in this book is recognising where Star Wars etc. got their ideas from!

I had originally chosen the book as sort of a filler between my main reading books, but it's powerful message and unforgettable style made an immediate impression, making it a book I will always remember. Living near a reservation of people from a tribe in dispute with my own, I have often been able to liken my life to Jommy's, and in this way connect to the book. If anyone has ever been prejudiced against or treated badly because you were different in some way, you could probably find some similarities between this story and yours,and if anyone still holds out hope for the human race this story adds a refreshing new perspective. Van vogt ties in prejudice and segregation, much as was witnessed in the 60's, with advancing technology and an evolving civilization. He seems to hint at the fact that if a society tries to keep one part rooted in the past but still tries to advance, somewhere something is going to have to give in. This is definitely a highly recommended read, you will certainly have nothing to be sorry about, except maybe if you can't find more of Van Vogt's books when you are through with this one."},{"Title":"Slan (Science fiction and adventures)","review":"I bought this book from amazon.com because of the popular opinion that it was one of the classics of the golden age of science fiction. I was very disappointed. Why didn't they print it in the smaller and cheaper standard paperback format? But I digress. I thought the book's major flaw was the characterizations. Even the protagonist is two-dimensional and there isn't one decent human being in the whole novel. As an anthropological sci-fi novel, its threadbare compared to LeGuin's Left Hand of Darkness. The whole idea of goal-oriented evolution that the book bases its premise on is ridiculous and has been repeatedly invalidated by science. The book has some redeeming qualities - there are several surprising plot twists. But it's strictly a book to check out at your local library."},{"Title":"Slan (Science fiction and adventures)","review":"If I hadn't read &quot;Slan&quot; many years ago and knew it to be one of the great works of science fiction, I would not have known that from listening to this audio edition. It was extremely disjointed, leaving huge gaps in the story (and filling many of those gaps with long stretches of silence or what I suppose passes for New Age music). I recognize that this wasn't simply a narration of the book but a &quot;theatrical presentation,&quot; but &quot;The Time Machine&quot; and &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; were both infinitely better presentations than this. I simply cannot recommend this book at all. If you want to find out about Van Vogt's great work, I suggest you read the book and not waste time on this."},{"Title":"Slan (Science fiction and adventures)","review":"\\"Slan\\" is one of those \\"classic\\" works of science fiction that readers will inevitably view either historically (as a literary ancestor of modern science fiction) or artistically (as an exciting allegory in its own right)--or both.First, the history. Written as a serial for Astounding Science Fiction magazine in 1940 and published as a novel in 1946, van Vogt's novel was intended for a mostly teenaged audience. Yet even as pulp fiction for young adults, \\"Slan\\" surpasses other stories from the era for its perceptive racial commentary, reflecting the horrors both of Nazi Germany and of world war.The kernel of the plot revolves around the inexplicable animosity, 1,500 years in the future, between \\"slans\\" (genetic human mutants with two hearts, enhanced physical prowess, and the ability to read minds) and \\"normal\\" humans. The human hatred for slans is clearly a futuristic version of \\"blood libel\\": in the Middle Ages, Jews were falsely accused of reenacting the crucifixion by murdering Christian children; likewise, slans are blamed for harming human children--although the exact nature of the injury and any evidence for its cause remains elusive. The centuries-old mutual fear between slans and humans, then, is fueled more by distrust and difference than by any actual threat.The technology ranges from the prophetic to (of course) the preposterous. The menace of the atomic bomb and the escalating intensity of weaponry haunts the story--and I have to assume that some of these passages were revised for the 1946 novel-length version. (\\"They didn't have his perfect type of atomic energy. Nor was their method a development of the rather superb, so-called atomic bomb of old times, with its heavy water and uranium base, and chain reaction.\\") But much of the science is the stuff of Depression-era comic books: it's hard not to chuckle when, in a pivotal scene, Jommy (the hero) jumps through the opening of a launching spaceship as if it were a passing surfboard.Artistically, the book is a mixed success. Keeping in mind the age group for which it was written, the prose is competent enough. The story itself starts off with a bang--Jommy barely escapes human hunters who mercilessly kill his slan mother--and the first half is a moving bildungsroman of sorts, describing his adventures and emotional growth as he tries to survive in a hostile world. A parallel (and equally involving) story follows Kathleen, a girl slan imprisoned for \\"observation\\" purposes.Yet by the last few chapters, van Vogt seems to abandon his focus on character, psychology, race, and social commentary in favor of the predictable formula his pulp-magazine audience expected from him. (And, as others have noted, the \\"surprise\\" finale is downright silly.) So, it's a mixed treat of a novel: most readers will applaud the daring departures from formula but mourn that, in the end, \\"Slan\\" succumbs to comic-book banality."},{"Title":"Slan (Science fiction and adventures)","review":"This book starts well and is fairly interesting most of the time. The one serious problem with the book is that one is constantly reminded that it was written in the 40s, chapter after chapter - everything from the terminology to the technology. There are many references to what was at the time fascinating and cutting edge, like radio technology and plastic, as if they were futuristic, yet this story takes place several hundreds of years from now. I give the author credit for seeing into the future and conceptualizing computers, but to refer to an &quot;electronic filing cabinet&quot; again just reminds me that this is a really old book. Those techno. lapses along with outdated terminology (bad guys would often utter &quot;good heavens!&quot; under surprised duress) nearly spoiled the book for me, but the story is original. I also found the last quarter of the book a little rushed and disjointed. The final paragraph and especially the final sentence just made me roll my eyes. If you can get by lots of the stuff I've outlined above, you may like Slan. I was disappointed."},{"Title":"Slan (Science fiction and adventures)","review":"&quot;Slan&quot; is A. E. van Vogt's first novel. It was published in book form in 1946 by Arkham House, but the story originally appeared in the pages of Astounding Magazine in 1940. It was a highly rated classic of Science Fiction for more than 25 years after it originally appeared, but today it is often forgotten along with many of the early classics. In 1949 it was tied for 4th on the Arkham Survey of 'Basic SF Titles'. It ranked 2nd on the Astounding/Analog All-Time Poll in 1952, 5th, in 1956, and 3rd in 1966.It is the story of a mutant race of humanity (Slan) who are stronger, smarter, and are telepathic. In the story we are told that the name Slan is derived from Samuel Lann who is purported to be the creator of the race. At the start, the Slan are hunted by humanity to be destroyed, and through the course of events we learn the history of the race, as well as the truth behind the crimes of which they are accused.The story is told through the eyes of two of the Slan. The first is Jommy Cross who is nine years old when the story commences, and who is becomes isolated from any other Slan when his mother is captured. The second Slan is Kathleen Layton, who is a prisoner of the government and being held for observation.This is an excellent book, which holds up well 60+ years later. It is fast paced, and definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Slan (Science fiction and adventures)","review":"Slan is a great exemple of practically a perfect simple-plot , one-hero , sci-fi story.Now , before you're clicking &quot;not helpfull&quot; , you have to understand that you are used to a writing style that has taken over the sci-fi scene in the 40's and 50's. A style led by John w.Campbell , and writers like Asimov , Clarck and Heinlin. Those people decided for you what sci-fi should be. Generally , they were right , most of the writers at that time had lower standards for sci-fi stories.But not Van Vogt. Allthough his style is'nt compatible with &quot;Campbellian&quot; standards , his writing has a different magic. Enormous scope , fantastic imagination , and very special lead charecters , are only part of something that I cannot put into words , and flows free in his works.You should not judge &quot;Slan&quot; by today's standards , instead , give it a chance and enjoy the magic of the early style science fiction."},{"Title":"Slan (Science fiction and adventures)","review":"I first read Slan in my early teens, and (this is going to get a little personal here, folks) I really identified with the struggle against persecution because at the time I was an adolescent struggling with my own sexuality and the realization that I am gay - something that in my youth (and to a *slightly* lesser extent today) was something to hide, something to fear, lest you suffer persecution.I re-read the book along with a few other Van Vogt novels as an adult, and it still gave me that feeling of empowerment - that being different was not necessarily \\"bad.\\"I doubt Van Vogt had gay people or any specific minority group in mind when he wrote the novel. It was, after all, 1940, and there was no such thing as political correctness and we as a society saw no harm whatsoever in persecuting entire groups of peoples, subcultures, etc.Which just proves that as a writer, Van Vogt was ahead of his time.The book holds up; it is still a great story, still has great action, mystery and intrigue. A few of the \\"science fiction\\" elements are a little cliched today, but they were of course *new* when Van Vogt wrote them.I would have to call Slan one of my all time favorites."},{"Title":"Slan (Science fiction and adventures)","review":"As a classic Sci-Fi novel it reads pretty good. Much of the futuristic speculative science is not yet either obsolete nor proven impossible 60 years later. Some of the high-tech foreseen by Vogt includes genetic engineering that was used to modify natural mutant humans for various reasons. There is a war between the one class of mutant/gene-altered people and normal people. The gene-altered mutants have taken over Mars and are launching a major space war on the 5 billion normal humans on Earth. The Martians have thousands of huge and heavily armed space ships that earth science, for some reason, has not developed. There are some psychic mind reading mutants who are hated by everyone, but they secretly control the Earth government. Our hero finds abandoned underground machine shops left by the mutants, and single-handedly builds a space ship much more capable than anything the Martians can manage. He also finds time to build a fortress disguised as a farm defended by an array of super beam weapons, and lots of other unique stuff all in abut 3 years. In the end he finds true love and the book ends with the Martian attack still imminent. The portrayal of racial hate of mutants by normal humans appears to reflect the 1940s racial attitudes and irrational hatreds that were much in contention during W.W.II. Its still fun reading for an entertaining afternoon if you don't mind that he just quit without tying up the many lose ends, or even resolving the pending war."},{"Title":"Slan (Science fiction and adventures)","review":"Centuries in the future, a new mutation has appeared in the human species. Known as the slans, this mutant group is physically stronger, smarter, and telekinetic via the tendrils that grow out of their hair. They are also hunted down and killed on sight by the dictatorship of Keir Gray. It seems, in the deep murky past, that the slans attempted to conquer the human race, and war began. But slans still live among humans, hiding in plain sight. One such slan is John Thomas \\"Jommy\\" Cross, who, after watching his parents' murder as a boy, is taken in by a greedy old woman, as he bides his time until he such time when he claim the inherited knowledge left by his father. Another slan is Kathleen Layton, a ostensible science project in the custody of Keir Gray himself, but in fact a pawn in the chess game of the Gray dictatorship.A.E. Van Vogt's \\"Slan\\" is a historical piece of science fiction. It's easy to trace numerous concepts back to \\"Slan\\" (e.g. Marvel Comics \\"X-Men\\"). It is also an interesting allegory on human nature and the theme of \\"Man's inhumanity to man.\\" It's probably no coincidence that this book was published in 1946, when WW II was over, and the genocide that it entailed was known. However, much like its contemporaries, \\"Slan\\" frequently falls victim to the conventions of science fiction of the time, and so a reader will almost certainly feel star-crossed.Initially, Van Vogt starts his novel on a thrill, as Jommy is on the run from the humans. Images of a boy of nine running for his life, surrounded by hatred and greed and fear are chilling and gripping. Alternatively, Kathleen's observations of an attempted coup against Gray, and Gray's violent response, while perhaps not so frenzied as a chase, are however just as engrossing.However, after initial rush, the pace slackens considerably, as Jommy lives a life as a thief, biding his time. While Van Vogt piques our curiosity with the revelation of slans who are not telekinetic, he spends a good deal of time with a contemplative Jommy, spectacularly loquacious secondary characters, and progressively neglected and underdeveloped Kathleen.It certainly doesn't help that Van Vogt injects several dozen mysteries into his book without ever satisfactorily dealing with any of them. Are the slans really evil? How did the come to be, and how did that cause the war? What's the deal with the non-telekinetic slans? Why does Keir Gray seem so intent on holding on to Kathleen? What will Jommy do about any of it? With so many plot lines to juggle, Van Vogt never seems to give any one of them satisfactory time to develop. The end result is something of a disappointment.While there is plenty to like about this book, I never felt completely satisfied with it. It tantalizes, but only rarely gratifies. It's historical value in the science-fiction is inarguable, and it's allegorical aspect is always important. Unfortunately, it's aesthetic is never quite able to live up to its potential. However, that doesn't diminish its value. It's absolutely worth reading."},{"Title":"Slan (Science fiction and adventures)","review":"I would actually rate this 3.5 stars, but that's not a choice. In this 1940 A.E. van Vogt work, he paints a portrait of Earth approximately 1500 years in the future with great effectiveness. Instead of delving into the technobable that weights down today's books, he jumps into character developement, descripions of prejudice, and heightened paranoia. Why? Because Earth is populate by normal humans...and slans. Slans are humans that have telepathic ability, and no mind (except another slan's) is quiet to them. Normal humans have been methodically hunting down and killing slans out of fear and paranoia. The story revolves around Jommy Cross and his fight to survive childhood and fight against human oppression.I thought the narrative was gripping and the explaination of the way a telepath thinks, quite ahead of its time. The science is lacking, but let's face it...the story is 60 years old! But the fundamental storytelling is there. One complaint: van Vogt seemed to lose his way at the end. The further into the book...the more the ends started to become unraveled. I got the feeling that the book just sort of ended, and I wanted more.But, this is a solid SF Golden Age book that stands up well with time. If you're into the classics, this is a must read."},{"Title":"Slan (Science fiction and adventures)","review":"I'm giving this one 3 stars. This book was very difficult to quantify, but I'll try to give you my reasoning...First of all, the book is excellent when you consider the backdrop. World War II was in swing, Hitler was rounding up the masses, Americans would be doing the same to the Japanese. Jim Crow Laws were still in effect. I've always admired pulp scifi for being able to get a positive message out to the average joe with preconceptions, who wouldn't otherwise consider the point without the techno-babble disguise that speculative fiction offers. Slan has a great premise on racial reckoning, on doomsday, on judging by appearances.That being said, on to the actual execution of these ideas...The book was written as a serial and it's obvious. While there is nothing wrong with serials, cohesive plots are harder to maintain and it shows. Every chapter ends with a sudden spectacle. Details are not fleshed out enough and are often ambiguous or contradictory. My example for this lies in the case of the tendrilless slans. Jommy makes the highly important discovery of their existence, and everyone he talks to about them show no incredulence for this dicovery. When he meets them, they actually refer to themselves as 'tendrilless slan' - the name Jommy gives them. All this makes for an easy plot to follow over several issues, but makes it seem a bit confusing and harder to accept when combined as a whole unit.Some of the language is confusing. I will not refer to outdated technology because I do not feel this is a valid criticism - nor do I refer to the two references I found that were blatantly sexual by TODAY's idiom. These things of course should be taken in stride and considered in context of when they were written. The one example I'll cite that made me stop and reread the page a couple of times occurs when Jommy is dodging a mine (as in BOOM!) only in the next paragraph to spot a mine (as in digging for ore) to land his ship near. There were a few instances similar to this. I know that some of these can be justified by the fast pace of a serialized story, and I wish that I had read Slan as it was written and not in this form.Recommended to those who are interested in scifi as a vehicle for social/ethical criticism."},{"Title":"Slan (Science fiction and adventures)","review":"Slan is excellent, especially when you consider it was written over 50 years ago. When you read it, you will think &quot;Hey, I have seen these ideas and plot devices before.&quot; That's how much influence Slan had on the formation of SF. If you want to understand where SF came from, the book that sets all the conventions is Slan."},{"Title":"Slan (Science fiction and adventures)","review":"A friend of mine recommended this book to me and I have booted it to my &quot;favorite&quot; list. Being more of a modern SciFi fan, I had my doubts, but I saw so much creativity in this book, that I have gone on the read others of Van Vogt's. The story of a boy who is struggling in a world full of preconceptions, this book is great lesson to how suseptible our race is to taking rumor as fact and how we can be so quick to jugde. A wonderful, easy to follow tale AND it leaves you with something after it's done. Great."},{"Title":"Slan (Science fiction and adventures)","review":"Slan (1951) is a standalone SF novel. Slans are a mutation of humanity that have high intelligence and telepathic capabilities. Their popular name came from Samuel Lann, the man who discovered their abilities. The most distinctive difference from humanity is the golden tendrils growing from their scalp, but they also have internal dissimilarities, including a modified heart.In this novel, Jommy Cross is the son of Peter and Patricia Cross. His father had been killed by a mob of humans about four years before. Since Jommy is charged with retrieving his father's papers from the catacombs when he reaches fifteen, his mother is taking him into Centropolis to show Jommy a secret entrance into the tunnels.Unluckily, the humans have noticed the pair and suspect that they are slans. The secret police are closing in, although Jommy is not mature enough to detect their presence until they are quite close. His mother shoves him between two other people and tells him to run.Jommy climbs onto the rear bumper of a car that is soon moving swiftly down the street. Jommy tunes in to the thoughts of the men within the car. He has no difficulty reading the thoughts of the driver, but the passenger only shows the upper level of his thoughts.Soon Jommy realizes that the passenger is John Petty, chief of the secret police. Moreover, the radio is announcing his flight from the area where his mother has just been killed. John Petty is realizing that his car is probably the one mentioned in the radio report.The car is traveling too fast for Jommy to jump off and survive. Yet Petty is having the driver slow down and stop to check the rear bumper. As soon as the car has slowed enough to jump, Jommy is off the bumper and fleeing down a poorly lit alleyway. But the driver gets one good shot at him and doesn't miss.Jommy wonders at the lassitude of his body, which is usually not tired by any effort. He is feeling woozy, but he pulls himself over a pile of boxes and inside a hole in the wall. He finds that the irritating objects under him are shards from the wall and replaces them, using mud as mortar to hold them in place.While he is preparing his bolthole, he discovers that an evil mind is also thinking of the hiding place. Later, after the pursuers have left the area, he crawls out and is snatched by the owner of the evil thoughts. She puts him into her wagon under a smelly cover and smuggles him out of the neighborhood.In this story, Granny is a former show girl who uses her good looks and sex to advance in show business. Yet she is eventually betrayed and tossed out onto the street. Since then she has become an alcoholic rag lady. But she is still capable of finding a way to use Jommy to gain money.Granny takes Jommy to a department store to swipe valuable trinkets. He brushes against a man heading out of the store and scans his mind. He is quite startled to find that the man is a slan. Yet the man lacks tendrils and is unable to read minds.He follows the man to his destination and then naively shows his tendrils to two men within the building. He barely escapes their attempts to capture and then kill him. He climbs up the building to the roof and sees a spaceship launched into space.Puzzled, he returns to the department store and steals a few trinkets for Granny. On his way out, he accidentally learns the combination to the store safe, which contains hundreds of thousands of dollars. After returning to Granny's shack, he tells her that the safe contains four thousand dollars and suggests that they bypass the trinkets.Jommy stays with Granny for six years. When he reaches fifteen, he goes into the catacombs and retrieves his father's papers and an artifact that is a powerful weapon. When three guards discover him, he unthinkingly destroys them with an atomic blast from the weapon.This story tells of Jommy's experiences with the tendrilless slans and his theft of a spaceship. He also learns their side of the conflict against true slans. Their statements don't agree with his experiences with his parents and he resolves to discover the truth of the matter.This tale also relates the experiences of Kathleen Layton, a slan female who is a couple of years older than Jommy. Kathleen is living in the palace designed and built by true slans before humans drove them into hiding. She is the ward of Kier Gray, leader of all humans on Earth.This novel is one of the early works by the author. It was also one of the first novels published after the wartime constraints. It is considered a classic Science Fiction novel.Highly recommended for van Vogt fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of high adventure, mutational advances, and political intrigues.-Arthur W.

There's something charming about reading the past's view of the future.On the story and writing levels, however, I found this book terribly ordinary. I had just read Alfred Bester's DEMOLITION MAN prior to SLAN, and Bester's flair for writing and diction are far superior.If you have more books you'd like to read than you have hours in the day, pass this one for someting a bit more substantial."},{"Title":"Slan (Science fiction and adventures)","review":"Unlike all of Van Vogt's other SF novels, this one has too much 1940's science, and the plot is simple with a Deus ex Machina ending.It was Van Vogt's first novel, and it shows his immaturity.If you like Van Vogt, it's worth reading once.

Still this does not prevent the single mom from taking her Jommy periodically to the city.Their latest trip turns tragic. Sensing the others were coming for them, Patricia informs her beloved son to find the catacombs of his late father if they catch up to her. She knows her time on earth is over as the law allows instant killing of Slans. While his mom is legally murdered nine year old Jommy escapes by leaping on to the bumper of a moving vehicle, but overhears an odd conversation that makes no sense to him as the killing of Slan female Kathleen Lawton could not undermine the Great Dictator, or could it somehow?. Jommy knows he must find this woman, but is not sure why or how she will receive a visit from an orphaned nine year old Slan.This is a reprint of a WW II classic that many insist changed science fiction from pure action to pure action with a social message that in the 1970s remained required reading in college level Sci Fi literary classes. The story line has obvious links to the Holocaust, but also holds true today with genocides in Darfur, Rwanda, Cambodia, etc as the late great A.E. Vogt condemns racism in any form and not just the extreme final solution, but does so inside a great youth on the run thriller. The story line is fast-paced and will excite a horde of new fans to this landmark thriller that easily passes the test of time. Readers will also rejoice that Kevin J.

It read like a train, was amusing, and had a theme that I especially like in science fiction; mutants! What troubles me most in my search for good 'mutant'-novels, is the fact that sometimes, more often than not, authors use the term mutant to signify different types. Mutants are deviants, with a genetic structure often drastically different from that of normal humans (drastically, because it appears normal human beings, on the average, have 3 mutated genes which are totally unique) In most cases these mutations occur by accident; as part of evolution, caused by radiation, toxins, etc... And there are engineered mutations, like in this book. These mutations can be so extreme that they can't even occur in nature (e.g. hybrids, animals, aliens, and even plants!) There is also an apparant classification; psionic mutants, which, in my oppinion, should not be called mutants,(althought they are mutants) because I find the term misleading, just call them psionics, ESPers, or what have you.( examples for these are 'legio', if you ever read a book with the word mutant in the title or somewhere else on the jacket, chance is you have an ESPer on your hands, see, as example, More than human.) Then you have physical mutations, which are, to my oppinion, far more interesting. Here, I'm going to use terms from the excelent 'wild cards' books. You have Aces; these can be psionic, but we'll exclude them now, or have advatage mutations, ranging from supermuscles to wings. Then there are Jokers, who have flawed, malformed mutations ( which, in most cases, mutations really mean in non-science fiction) if appearing in science fiction, they are created by nuclear fall-outs (amogst others), and appear often in post-apocaliptic settings. These mutants I seek (jokers and non-psionic Aces) if you could give me any booktitles, kind reader, wherein these feature, please submit your own reviews on this book and post the titles. Also good book about mutants (although mostly psionic) is 'The Chrysalids' by Wyndham."},{"Title":"Slan (Science fiction and adventures)","review":"Adapted as a full-blown audio stage production by Perry Jacob and Bob E.

Slan is very highly recommended, entertaining, &quot;theater of the mind&quot; audiobook experience for all science fiction enthusiasts."},{"Title":"Slan (Science fiction and adventures)","review":"This book comes to us from the very start of the Golden Age of science fiction. First copyrighted in 1940, it has most probably been reissued now to support the release of a new sequel (Slan Hunter) rather than in response to any great fan demand, despite the assertion on the back cover that in the 40's and 50's SF readers rallied to the cry \\"Fans are slans.\\"However, I don't feel that this story stands up well even against other Golden Age stories. Unlike some of the books from this time, including Van Vogt's ownWeapons Shops of Isher, the outdatedness of the technology is a distraction to the reader. This is typically a sign of a book where the plot is driven by a good concept rather than character interactions, as indeed \\"Slan\\" is. But in this case even the concept is not executed as well as it could have been. A Slan is an uber-mensch, a Nietzschian hero whose intellect (and telepathy, natch) allow them to survive and prosper in the middle of a violent campaign to eradicate them. Granted, today this is standard action hero stuff, but coming out of this time period it feels a little creepy, maybe a little Nazi-ish.Our hero Jommy is a Slan whose parents are murdered by the authorities, and who must make his own way in the world. He is constantly trying to find the other Slans, who he know must exist but whom he can never locate. I won't give away the (deeply flawed) twist ending, but by allowing Jommy to succeed in his quest Van Vogt missed an opportunity to create an allegory about totalitarianism and instead simply capped a rambling narrative with the expected solution.That's not to say there's nothing to enjoy here. The action is sometimes good, and despite myself I got a vicarious thrill at watching Jommy use his extraordinary abilities to build up a small private empire.

I am not sure that I understand most of it then, and I am sure that I do not remember most of it now. But I know one of the topics was the 'reality' or non- reality of what the visible world gives. Appearance and reality. Another topic if I remember rightly is the mind-body problem. And Russell I believe here takes on the Descartian cogito and tells us that it does not mean that Descartes has proved that there is an 'I thinking' but rather only that there is ' thinking'. Russell in this seems to be something like a very strange kind of Buddhist. In any case it is these hard problems of epistemology that are at the center of this small work.The other kinds of big problems, moral and aesthetic, religious also which are at the heart of a good share of human experience are perhaps not quantifiable enough for Russell's kind of philosophical consideration here. The man that tried to reduce all of mathematics to logic did take on these other kinds of more 'human ' questions in other works though not I might say to the satisfaction of many of us old religious believers.This little book is however a clear and challenging introduction to major epistemological questions."},{"Title":"The Problems of Philosophy","review":"I generally agree with everything other favorable reviewers have said about what you will find in this book, especially regarding the fact that it is written as much for the lay reader as for the professional.

It is considered the most important philosophical article of the 20th century. It is NOT in this book.

He uses a table, a simple physical object, and he follows Descartes' practice of radical doubt to analyze our knowledge of the physical world through sense data, which are the impressions that the appearance of reality offers our senses.While establishing a theory of knowledge, Russell makes the distinction between knowledge by acquaintance and knowledge by description. Russell also discusses priori knowledge with a Platonic attitude toward universals, considering the possibility of having acquaintance with a universal without knowing of a single instance of that universal.Through opposing idealism, discussing other philosophers' faults and discussing ideas and universals, Russell completely lost me and fell into the trap other philosophers couldn't avoid: going in endless circles to explain a simple aspect.I enjoy reading Russell's anti war ideas, his scientific work especially in Math, but when it comes to philosophy, Russell is not a straight shooter."},{"Title":"The Problems of Philosophy","review":"I bought this book because it was recommended for further reading in my philosophy class.

If you are even remotely interested in the subject, I recommend you buying it too."},{"Title":"The Problems of Philosophy","review":"This book was my first foray into philosophy, and surprisingly, it proved to be very enjoyable. For many, just the word &quot;philosophy&quot; evokes images of ancient thinkers, yet not in a very appealing light: old men sitting around, absent-mindedly stroking their chins as they ponder the meaning of life.Yet, philosophy does not deserve this reputation. It is not just some hobby for stodgy elders, or those with nothing better to do. Rather, it is quite the opposite; it is an endlessly intriguing subject, one which causes you to consider things you may have never thought of before. Survive the test, and the reaffirmation that results will be worth it.Philosophy contains no easy answers. It poses a myriad of questions which can force one to doubt, and even reexamine, one's beliefs -- even those which previously seemed so resolute. This may at first be difficult or discombobulating, but persistance is rewarded with an even stronger foundation than before.I will not attempt to summarize this book, as people before me have already explained it sufficiently. However, I will say that this book was a great influence, and a wonderful introduction to the world of philosophy. For such an abstruse and &quot;deep&quot; matter, one would think that most would be intimidated; however, Russell handles it splendidly. He writes in a lucid, unpretentious manner, and spares the reader any unnecessary confusion.Even to this day, my friends tease me about &quot;philosophy of a table.&quot; It is impossible for me to adequately describe this book, but let me say that it is brilliant and refreshing. For me, philosophy is not meant to give an individual a headache. It is simply for those who wish to gain a better understanding of themselves and their surroundings. And this book, exceptional in its quality, is an excellent choice to get you started on that interminable journey towards the ever so elusive Truth."},{"Title":"The Problems of Philosophy","review":"When one considers that the great philosophers of the twentieth century stand on the shoulders of Bertrand Russell, Alfred North Whitehead, A. J. Ayer, G. E. Moore, and Ludwig Wittgenstein, one has to place Russell in the foreground as the philosophers' philosopher. He writes with clarity and lucidity. His concerns are largely logical and epistemological. And this book centers around his principal concerns.I doubt that Russell would write this same book today, but I also doubt that he would fundamentally alter the positions he takes, if he were writing today. There is something neat, eloquent, and elegant about his epistemological premises that make this work (well beyond its 17th printing and more than eighty years old) such a venerable treasure trove. Could his positions be better articulated? Yes, but not by much. Would he delve more deeply into logic? Almost certainly. And he does, in other books written during his lifetime.This book is really for the novice. My only complaint is that the novice will probably remain lost if his readings did not encompass more logic and criticism of rational and empirical epistemology. What makes Russell a true \\"modern\\" in contemporary philosophy is his bridge to resolving both the rationalist and empiricist schools of thought. One not knowing these dichotomies might find Russell's resolution difficult to follow. Elsewhere in the book, Russell identifies \\"three\\" rules of thought, when these rules are no longer considered all that are extent. Generally, there are seven, sometimes nine, taught in most symbolic logic courses, and this discrepancy may needlessly cause confusion. So while the book is written for the novice, it bears re-reading after covering other contemporary writers.Russell and the others mentioned above are often associated with logical atomism, either directly or indirectly. Reading Russell or Ayer gives the student the best opportunity to do philosophy whilst learning it first hand. Both are explicit writers with Ayer perhaps having the upper hand. But, as with any philosophical school, such as logical atomism, there is always a counter reaction, and A. L. Austin's \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is just such a reproach. Russell, like Ayer, uses the construct of \\"sense data\\" to explain the theory of knowledge; Austin and Gilbert Ryle redress both author's use of such \\"metaphysical\\" interpolations, which makes for an interesting contrast. Any reader of Russell or Ayer should counterbalance his reading with Austin's work.\\"The Problems of Philosophy\\" is not without gaps that may leave the reader puzzled by the omissions. Perhaps they weren't as obvious when Russell wrote this book, but they are clearer now in hindsight. An egregious omission is the absence of anything to do with ethics or moral theory. Since ethics is one of the few domains particular to philosophy alone, this omission is particularly troublesome in a book of this name. If I were to title the book, it would be \\"The Problems of Epistemology.\\""},{"Title":"The Problems of Philosophy","review":"\\"Philosophy aims primarily at knowledge,\\" says Bertrand Russell. \\"But it cannot be maintained that philosophy has had any very great measure of success in its attempts to provide definite answers to its questions.\\"With that caveat, which comes in the last chapter of The Problems of Philosophy, Russell defines in part what philosophy is and what it can accomplish. The definition casts a rather dim light over the field of philosophy, calling into questions its value as a discipline worthy of our attention. But Russell goes on to say that philosophy's value won't be found in its ability to provide answers (\\"since no definite answers can, as a rule, be known to be true\\"). Instead, philosophy is valuable \\"for the sake of the questions themselves.\\"\\"These questions enlarge our conception of what is possible, enrich our intellectual imagination and diminish the dogmatic assurance which closes the mind against speculation,\\" notes Russell. He says our minds are \\"rendered great\\" when we contemplate \\"the greatness of the universe.\\" This enables our minds to form a \\"union with the universe which constitutes its highest good.\\"In the pages that precede this final chapter on the value of philosophy, Russell highlights the questions he considers to be most \\"positive\\" and \\"constructive.\\" In his view, philosophy's most important questions relate to epistemology, or the theory of knowledge. As a result, most of this book deals with questions like these:What is the difference between appearance and reality?What is a belief? What is the relationship between beliefs and facts?What, if anything, can we know for certain?What is the difference between deductive and inductive reasoning?What is intuitive knowledge?What is truth? How can we distinguish between truth and falsehood?Russell doesn't always provide \\"definite answers\\" to these questions. Yet he does a marvelous job of helping us to think through them in creative and logically sound ways.The Problems of Philosophy is a brief book that packs a nice punch. It is easy to read, smoothly written, and will likely appeal almost anyone interested in philosophy. Perhaps the biggest problem with the Problems of Philosophy is its narrow scope. The book fails completely to address many of the problems that people often associate with philosophy. Because of this, I would give the book four stars, not the five shown above. Russell makes almost no mention of ethics or morality. He also avoids God, religion, evil, value, aesthetics, philosophy of mind, and the list goes on. But this is a flaw that can be forgiven - for what Russell sacrifices in scope, he makes up for in clarity and style. He often attaches practical examples to more abstract ideas, and this makes the problems of philosophy more understandable for everyone.One may agree or not with Russell's assertions, but most will appreciate his ability to take some of philosophy's classic problems and make them digestible, almost entertaining to the average reader. This is an enjoyable book that is just as relevant today as when it was first published in 1912."},{"Title":"The Problems of Philosophy","review":"This is my favorite book of Bertrand Russell's, both as an introductory and technical work, and it is probably so because he wrote it before he went too deeply into analytical and empiricist philosophy to remember his rationalist roots. ...His summaries of Rationalism vs. Empiricism are also excellent, though 20th century rationalism is probably today what he describes as the middle ground position between both views in his book. Most 20th century rationalists accept the *causal* importance of sensory perception in forming many *a priori* beliefs, so the new term is not *a priori* knowledge, but *a priori* justification. Empiricism is the dominant school in philosophy today, but I think that will change in time because empiricism cannot justify many of its epistemological conclusions in any way that do not undermine the justificatory role of thought.Some of the accounts of \\"sense data\\" and \\"knowledge by description\\" are a bit tortured, partly because Russell tried to avoid metaphysics as much as possible, and I personally do not believe that they are ultimately correct. However, the discussions are still good introductions. People who read more rationalist philosophy from the likes of Brand Blanshard and Laurence Bonjour as well as analytic philosophers like David Armstrong will get a better insignt into where the real debates about some of these issues lie.On the whole, a good introduction to philosophy, even though it doesn't touch upon ethics and politics.

Russell focuses almost entirely on epistemology in this book, offering a thorough grounding of the most fundamental issues of human knowledge. The writing is very clear and straightforward in a way that is good for both the philosopher and general public. I couldn't have dreamed of a better writing style for such a book topic.I gave the book 4 stars instead of 5 because the focus is pretty much entirely on epistemology and I feel Russell does not discuss metaphysics or ethics as much as he could have. But don't let that discourage you...this book is valuable to the philosophical newcomer."},{"Title":"The Problems of Philosophy","review":"This book is a model of exposition, covering an amazing amount of ground in just over 150 pages - and the excellent writing makes it seem even shorter than that. It is not really a standard introduction to all of philosophy, however, since it deals mainly with questions of epistemology. But as an introduction to that branch of philosophy, it is definitely one of the best. Among other things, it includes Russell's famous chapter \\"On Induction\\", criticisms of idealism, of Kant, and (perhaps surprisingly) of empiricism, and a defense of the correspondence theory of truth.The five star rating does not mean that I agree with everything in it, however. Russell himself came to disagree with much of what he said in this book (e.g., with respect to his views on universals). But in spite of being somewhat dated, it is definitely worthwhile, especially for the beginning student."},{"Title":"The Problems of Philosophy","review":"This is a very solid, and good introduction to philosophy by one of the greatest english philosophers of the last 200 years. Of course, one needs to read other philosophy books as well to complete any intro to philosophy.I give this book 4 stars though because Russell kinda sweeps some issues under the rug, and I feel he does this out of bias because they present problems for his personal philosophical doctrines. He also pronounces himself as a champion over some doctrines of philosophy, and does so without much grace. He thinks a lot of himself.However, this book is still a good book to get you thinking about commonly discussed issues of philosophy."},{"Title":"The Problems of Philosophy","review":"Bertrand Russell (1872-1970) was of course one of the most influential philosophers of the twentieth century. THE PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY (1912) is a classic introduction to the perennial questions of philosophy (although it focuses mainly on epistemology and metaphysics). It is an engaging book that can be read by both the beginner in philosophy as well as the more advanced student. (For example, Russell described much of what is considered the \\"Gettier problem\\" in this book.)Russell had an amazingly long and productive life. He was a key figure in the school known as analytic philosophy (which has one of its earliest appearances in book form here) and was the founder of logical atomism (which can be dated from his 1914 work OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE EXTERNAL WORLD). His last major work of technical philosophy (HUMAN KNOWLEDGE) appeared in 1948 and after that time was largely known for his social and political activism.In reading Russell, there are a couple things to remember. First, Russell wasn't always the most accurate expositor on the history of philosophy and religion (you can skip his HISTORY OF WESTERN PHILOSOPHY if you are interested in learning about the subject matter of the book). Second, just because he is often considered an empiricist, it is a mistake to consider him a consistent empiricist, much less a logical positivist. Russell's logical atomism had a metaphysics, albeit a rather pared down one. During large parts of his career, Russell was keenly aware that strict empiricism was a dead end. Indeed, in THE PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY he sets forth a famous defense of universals that put him in the realist, as opposed to nominalist camp (where most empiricists are). There is also a good defense of a priori insight, which shows Russell's rationalist roots."},{"Title":"The Problems of Philosophy","review":"As a beginner in the study of philosophy, this book gave me much more than a clear and concise introduction to the subject by one of its great masters.

This chapter articulates an insight that grows slowly inside the reader throughout the book, caused by the amazement of being exposed to great philosophical questions for the first time.\\"...philosophy has a value (perhaps its chief value) through the greatness of the objects which it contemplates, and the freedom from narrow and personal aims resulting from this contemplation... The mind which has become accustomed to the freedom and impartiality of philosophic contemplation will preserve something of the same freedom and impartiality in the world of action and emotion... The impartiality which, in contemplation, is the unalloyed desire for truth, is the very same quality of mind which, in action, is justice, and in emotion is that universal love which can be given to all, and not only to those who are judged useful or admirable.\\"If what sparked your curiosity about philosophy in the first place was the intuition that it would make you grow as a person in a very important sense, then this book is for you!"},{"Title":"The Problems of Philosophy","review":"I chose the rating for this book because it's the only free book that is suggested by several philosophy majors as a good beginning to philosophy.

However, as someone who has rediscovered philosophy in middle-age, having taken it in college and abandoned it shortly thereafter, I found Russell's writing eminently readable. Some of the concepts discussed are appropriately challenging and I was surprised at how clearly and engagingly Russell writes. I incorrectly assumed that a great philosophical mind like his would wrap his prose in incomprehensible philosophical jargon. Fortunately, I was wrong. The highlight for me was a passage in the concluding chapter, where Russell explains the purpose of the philosophical discipline, which is to bring a person outside their immediate world of daily concerns and crises, to the larger world around them of thoughts and ideas, and thereby enlarge their world to their benefit. My favorite sentence: \\"Every complete sentence must contain at least one word which stands for a universal, since all verbs have a meaning which is universal.\\" Highly recommended as an introduction to some of the fundamental questions addressed by philosophy."},{"Title":"The Problems of Philosophy","review":"Dense is probably the best way to describe Russel's writing style.

Some of Russell's arguments can be summarized as:1) The appearance and reality of an object's existence differ based on individual point of view.2) Whether or not the matter exists independent of an individual's presence.3) The origin of matter, and distinguishing it from physical science and physical experience.4) Idealism and its inability to prove credibility5) Induction: A, so therefore B.6) Philosophy's valueRussell's \\"The Problems with Philosophy\\" begins with his view of a table's existence. It was very interesting to read about Russell's belief that there is difference between our physical view of an object and the \`reality' of whether or not an object is actually there. This particular analysis is the basis of the first chapter. According to Russell, every aspect of an object's appearance and feel is based on an individual's point of view. The main example he uses is that of a table, and someone else may interpret how the shade of color I see another way; the texture that I feel may feel different to someone else; another person may describe the shape I see as I walk around the table as a different shape. This same explanation is used for sight, sound, and touches whereas there are no fixed choices in reality; and in the end, our senses that we use for the appearance of things is how we become \`acquainted' with \`reality'.Another interesting argument Russell discusses is the object of matter, and whether or not an object remains to be present when one is physically absent from the object. Going back to the table, if we find it to not exist then \\"the whole outer world is a dream\\". Everything we have ever known to be our reality does not exist independently of ourselves. Numerous times throughout the book Russell's theory of sense-data is mentioned; and in this context, when one doubts the physical presence of an object it does not mean that they doubt their sense-data which initially \\"...made us think there was a table\\". Here Russell begins to compare his theory with that which is found in Descartes' book Meditations. Descartes believed in the possibility of a false reality and did not believe in anything that could not be proven to be true. Thus Descartes committed the appeal to ignorance fallacy, until he realized a flaw because he did not doubt his own existence. Continuing into this chapter, people may experience similar occurrences that vary, but even assuming that the other person exists makes the mistake of begging the question. Outside of what we experience for ourselves, anyone else's experience independent of our own should not be considered. Furthermore, Russell shows the error in committing the appeal to ignorance fallacy, as he believes that, \\"[t] here can never be any reason for rejecting one instinctive belief except that it clashes with the others; thus, if they are found to harmonize, the whole system becomes worthy of acceptance.\\" Therefore, if a particular reasoning or belief does not inhibit the possibility of other beliefs, they should all be recognized respectively.Russell then begins to investigate the nature of matter once we are able to conclude that it exists independently of us individually. Hypothetically, the nature of something from a scientific standpoint opposed to a human's physical point of view, are of course different. Using a blind man and a light source as an example, it is extremely difficult to explain the effect light has on a blind man's senses, because it is something he cannot experience directly. This example shows how things such as light, which is actually composed of waves, appeal to certain senses that exist in a \`world' independent of us. Another example used is the understanding of time. Just as time seems to go slowly when we are bored or in pain, it seems to go quickly when we have something to do or having a good time. It is considered inaccurate to measure time using these instances.There is then the subject of idealism that states, \\"[w] hatever can be known to exist, must be in some sense mental.\\" To believe as an idealist is perceived to be far more difficult than someone who believes based on his or her common sense. Here Russell talks about how idealism derived, using arguments made by Bishop Berkeley. Berkeley believed that the idea of sense data could not be possible if our senses were not present, and that if something did not exist in a \`mind', then it could not exist at all. Russell agrees with Berkeley's point of view up until a \`mind' being absolutely necessary for something's existence. According to Berkeley, something is because it is perceived. Russell argues that Berkeley uses the word idea to help people accept idealistic beliefs, because common knowledge has us to believe that ideas originate in the mind. Therefore anything we perceive in our minds to exist can do so. However in the end, Russell completely rejects Berkeley's theory of sense-data by feeling it is contradictory, and does not prove what he claims it to prove.In order to gain knowledge about what is beyond our acquaintance, Russell uses inferences in a theory called induction. With inferences, an A, so therefore, B method is used. For example lightning has struck, therefore thunder will occur next, shows the use of induction that can help us with what is beyond our realm of thinking. Russell also shows how occurrences we often take for granted are relevant to this theory, as the example of the sun rising each day can be used. Just because the sun has risen each day in the past, is no reason to assume that it will therefore rise each day in the future, according to Russell. He goes on to conclude that our assumptions about the future should be probable and not definite, whereas the more accurate form of the argument should be \\"that the more A is found to be associated with B, \\"the more probable it is (if no cases of failure of association are known) that A is always associated with B.\\"Russell once again brings science into the picture as he contrasts the structure of philosophy with science. Science is more likely to focus on the physical needs of the body, while philosophy is more vital in a mental sense. And yet with these differences, even though philosophy does not contain the amount of definite evidence that science or other disciplines can, philosophy is able to bring order to the physical sciences. Philosophy allows us to be open-minded, and free from \\"arrogant dogmatism\\". To Russell, this sense of open-mindedness is a virtue that can let our lives be \\"great and free\\" if we escape from the prison of our private lives. He believes that \\"through the greatness of the universe which philosophy contemplates, the mind also is rendered great,\\" but if we remain in our own little worlds, it can hinder us from the possibilities of exploration where the intellect and object meet. Russell feels concluding that \\"truth is man-made...space and time and the world of universals are properties of the mind, and that, if there be anything not created by the mind it is unknowable,\\" puts an \\"impenetrable veil between us and the world beyond\\", and diminishes the value of philosophy.Although it took some for me to get \`acquainted' with Russell's point of view on philosophy, in the end I was able to understand where he has found flaws in the way it is used or interpreted. Russell is able to make strong arguments and support each claim with validity."},{"Title":"The Problems of Philosophy","review":"When I wrote my essay \\"A Cry From The Heart\\" (for sale on Amazon), I presumed everyone knew how fragile was our concept of knowledge.

It is not easy to follow Mr. Russell's logic on the first reading, but even a cursory effort should give all who try more humility in presenting their opinions in a dialogue. They would also be able to understand the thesis statement of my essay."},{"Title":"The Problems of Philosophy","review":"This book is compulsory reading to anyone studying Philosphy, it is written in such a style as to take away the mysteke normally associated with the subject.

I would rate this book two stars, less because of it's content and perhaps more because of my own shortcomings. I found many of the chapters verbose and hard to follow. To be honest, I've found that I am more interested in short snippets of what major philosophers had to say rather than delve into their thoughts myself. When I try, I often find I don't have the attention span to follow what an author is saying, and that is what I found here. Having said that, I will add that I found the last two chapters more interesting. All in all, I would say this book is more tuned to serious lovers of philosophical questions than a casual reader such as myself."},{"Title":"The Problems of Philosophy","review":"Talk about a man ahead of his time.

Acquainted with most philosophy basics but not much more than that, I decided to start off by ordering a few books that appeared to outline general philosophical problems, to help open my eyes to interesting new subjects and give me focus and direction in my future reading. Russell's name was familiar to me, and the book's title implied that it was some sort of general overview, so I decided to start here.However, contrary to what I expect, I found that instead of the overview I was looking for, Russell's book focused primarily on matters of epistemology (theories of knowledge) and metaphysics (theories of reality). So, keeping that in mind, don't order this book expecting to become acquainted with all of the \\"Problems of Philosophy\\"; here, you're only going to be introduced to the topics that Russell is most enthusiastic about. Among them are questions such as \\"What is knowledge?\\", \\"What do we know for sure?\\", etc... You'll learn about logic, and Russell builds up a rather brilliant foundation for the entire philosophical process, but missing are the \\"layman's philosophies\\", subject such as ethics or political philosophy.Having said that, I thoroughly enjoyed Russell's book, and it was a great place to start for the beginning philosopher. At times, it was difficult to read; some of his sentences can be quite lengthy and full of logic, and this isn't what one might consider light reading. It takes effort, and you have to be interested in the subject for the book to actively keep your attention. However, Russell writes as clearly as the subject permits, and gives a fantastic introduction to basic theories of knowledge. And as other reviewers have pointed out, his last chapter is particularly notable, and will inspire and bring out the inner philosopher in any reader.I was initially disappointed when I found that this book wasn't an overview of the field, but, in hindsight, it actually served as a better starting place than any overview probably would have. Epistemology - the study of knowledge itself - is a great philosophical subject to start with, as it serves as the foundation upon which all other philosophy - the quest for knowledge - rests. I highly recommend Russell's \\"The Problems of Philosophy\\", as well as the philosopher himself - I'll certainly be sure to read more of his work in the future!"},{"Title":"The Problems of Philosophy","review":"The Problems of Philosophy is a great cornerstone philosophy text. By that I mean, it covers those issues which are essential for building a coherent worldview - what exists, how can we know anything, what is the basis of logic, why is philosophy useful, and so on. And though this is not a history book, Russell does managed to provide a rather clear, if not altogether evenhanded, outline of how certain schools of thought came to be.If you are interested in philosophy, socially, academically, or otherwise, this is a great little book. Russell fully explains the trickier concepts and ties everything together very well in one complete package."},{"Title":"The Problems of Philosophy","review":"John Locke joked at the start of his book on human understanding that his book could have probably been much shorter if only he had edited it, but he was too lazy too. Russell the logician with the gift for writing in a brief and very readable manner. manage's to get the main points of British empiricism into a work far shorter then those of Locke or Hume.As for the content I thought it was brilliant, but then again I had already agreed with every thing Russell said in the book from reading similer lines of thought."},{"Title":"The Problems of Philosophy","review":"This was my first philosophy book that I read and it made me think deeply. I probably read though this again after I get better at philosophy. I strongly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"The Problems of Philosophy","review":"This short book is a journey through some of philosophy's more famous problems. Naturally a synopsis this short (it is roughly 100 pages) cannot do full justice to much of philosophy, or even to the problems it actually addresses, but it is an entertaining read that nevertheless will find itself illuminating to those unfamiliar with the subject.Uniquely, instead of following the historical chronology of the problems he chooses, Russell travels a path that seems to flow naturally from one subject to the next, as if each problem logically entailed the other. Consequently, Russell jumps decades (and even centuries), forward and backward as his narrative dictates. The experience is like a modern thriller movie whose out-of-sequence path nonetheless has a logic that makes sense. If you aren't already familiar with the subject you might not notice Russell's technique.Russell opens his inquiry by asking what justifies knowledge. Using Descartes' technique of systematic doubt, he explores the problem by examining illusions and fallacious conclusions that can arise when considering knowledge via sensory data to be perfectly reliable. Moving on to the existence of matter, Russell flexes some of his physics muscle with a cursory examination of the current state of thinking (writing as of 1912). The distinction between knowledge by acquaintance and knowledge by description leads to a discussion of induction and the distinction between empirical and a priori knowledge. This leads him to Kant and a long engagement with idealism follows. I won't spoil anymore.Of course Russell is himself a towering figure of 20th century analytic philosophy, and if you allow yourself a little cynicism, by the end it is clear his narrative merely engaged the line of philosophical puzzles that led to his own work. This is not meant as a character slight: this book's lightness bears little resemblance to his serious work and is aimed at a different audience. Rather, it is telling that the narrative he chooses is historically in line with his own work, so his omissions are less surprising when seen in this light. Given that Russell's original work centers on epistemology and logic, it makes sense the book starts at the Enlightenment, concentrating on epistemological questions, and never touches upon anything prior except for his brief foray into the problem of universals. For a book that calls itself the \\"The Problems of Philosophy,\\" the omissions of major philosophical problems might raise your eyebrows if not for this fact.Russell is not an impartial narrator; he makes his opinions clear on a number of occasions, particularly with issues that have historical significance. I don't consider this a weakness; there is no shortage of general philosophy volumes that treat all ideas in a sympathetic light. It is also salutary to reflect Russell is not a philosophy historian in the normal sense (his huge History notwithstanding); he is an original contributor. Thus I would not expect a thinker of his stature to not proffer his views, as would be expected from any academic professor.My gripe with this book is the tediousness with which Russell begins the discussion. The early pages are somewhat monotonous and not entirely engaging. The rest of the work is quite engaging, so the book as a whole is let down by its beginning. This is unfortunate because many readers might not find themselves committed enough to finish it. Given the target audience (folks who may have no prior exposure to philosophy), missing out on the best parts because of its beginning would be unfortunate."},{"Title":"The Problems of Philosophy","review":"Bertrand Russell was one of the most prominent British mathematicians and philosophers from the beginning of the twentieth century.

This book is directed at at those who are curious about the discipline of philosophy; it's only about 150 or so pages, but navigating through may not be easy. Russell starts of by wondering whether material objects seen in the world of sense data really exist and takes the reader through a brief analysis of the differing view points regarding the existence and the nature of matter. The view points of the idealists and empiricists are compared and contrasted as Russell tries to take his position. What one gets out of this is the way the topic is analyzed and how seemingly obvious and self-evident points are dissected and a question mark put on them; the opinion he arrives at (ex. why the idealists & Berkeley were in the wrong) is irrelevant. In any case, given the brief nature of the discussion here, you will have to supplement your reading with other materials to get a genuine and more than a verbal understanding of these various schools of thought; the objective here is merely to give you a broad outline. Russell then moves on to the process by which we acquire knowledge, our reliance on inductive reasoning and proceeds to talk about a priori knowledge, contribution of Kant and the debate surrounding the feasibility of a priori knowledge. Plato's Universals is covered in two chapters. If and once you get to the end of it, questions whether all of this is merely hairsplitting and devoid of any practical utility is addressed by Russell in the final chapter where he says that the role of philosophy is to keep alive the \\"speculative interest in the universe\\" otherwise which we would be confined to verifiable and ascertainable knowledge.A well written introduction and if the flame still burns there is a list of books in the bibliographical note to take your interest further."},{"Title":"The Problems of Philosophy","review":"I am only a beginner in the study of philosophy...but after reading quite a few introductions I feel that the most complete and rewarding is this book by BR.

This book is for those interested in philosophy and who enjoy esoteric arguments. It is for the person with an average philosophical interest and not necessarily the Ph.D. candidate.Bertrand tells us that if we wish to become philosophers we must be willing to tackle the absurd. Obviously! A lot of time is spent on Bishop Berleley, Plato and Descartes and idealism - we are all imaging matter; matter is a figment of our imagination; it's all in your head. The author finally assures us that there is something in the universe besides our comprehension of ourselves and our dreams. There does seem to be \\"reality\\" or matter even if it is perceived differently or inadequately by each of us. Bertrand finally states that Berkeley's notion that the objects apprehended must be mental has no validity whatsoever. One chapter deals with those that think that we can know more than we actually can know and with those who think, on the other hand, that nothing is knowable - Hegel in the first case and Hume in the latter.Finally we come to the nature of philosophy and its value. Philosophy deals in questioning the unknown and once the unknown becomes known it is no longer called philosophy but science. So philosophy has a rather nebulous list of achievements. Bertrand closes this book with this final paragraph:\\"Thus to sum up our discussion of the value of philosophy; philosophy is to be studied, not for the sake of any definite answers to its questions, since no definite answers can, as a rule, be known to be true, but rather for the sake of the questions themselves; because these questions enlarge our conception of what is possible, enrich our intellectual imagination and diminish the dogmatic assurance which closes the mind against speculation; but above all because, through the greatness of the universe which philosophy contemplates, the mind is also rendered great, and becomes capable of that union with the universe which constitutes its highest good.\\"Well that, of course, states the case better than anything that I could say but for my part I must offer something.I have always been attracted to philosophy because the philosophers were asking the questions that seemed important to me and by reading and studying their answers I always felt that I was learning how to think and reason intelligently and logically. By being able to think intelligently and logically I felt that I was then better equipped to solve the problems of life - my life in particular.Richard Edward Noble - The Hobo Philosopher - Author of:\\"Hobo-ing America: A Workingman's Tour of the U.S.A..\\""},{"Title":"The Problems of Philosophy","review":"I always enjoy the matter-of-fact way Russell writes.

He goes on to more critical matters of his brand of philosophy in the second half of the book. It is interesting in that regard. But initially he begins with the &#34;table and the chair&#34; argument, which J.P.Sartre uses much better in Sartre's &#34;Being and Nothingness&#34;. Then Bertrand goes into Descartes &#34;Cartesian doubt&#34;, and then a Kantean ethic of perceiving the world: That our minds order the outside world. After which he brings up an existentialist argument for the table and chair. Then he brings up the old problem of the &#34;cat in the box&#34; question.

It did not surprise me that there was a little wear and tear on the binding and some of the pages. I was still exceptional and functional."},{"Title":"The Problems of Philosophy","review":"Bertrand Russell is an excellent writer and a clear thinker. This book serves as a great, short introduction to Russell's approach to the problems of philosophy. The problems Russell addresses are primarily epistemological. Russell's primary questions revolve around the question: what do we know, and how do we know it? Russell first argues for the appearance/reality distinction and offers a sense-datum theory of the foundations of knowledge (for a very interesting critique of sense datum theories I recommendSense and Sensibiliaby J.L. Austin).But, Russell argues, sense data on their own cannot account for our knowledge. We must have some knowledge of general principles, and some kind of inductive principle, if we are going to derive any knowledge from sense data to arrive at knowledge that is not immediate (Russell also includes memory in immediate forms of knowledge). Russell examines the meaning of truth and falsehood and determines three criteria that any theory of the truth must meet, and then, in the last two chapters, Russell attempts to determine the limits and the value of philosophy.Russell is really a joy to read. I admit that my own training is in Continental philosophy, but I always enjoy the straight forward clarity of analytic philosophers, and Russell is one of the best. Just so that people do not think that is merely my own personal opinion I should point out that Bertrand Russell won the Nobel prize for literature in 1950. I am not aware of any other philosopher who was ever awarded that honor. All in all, I would highly recommend this book to either, 1) lay people who are interested in getting a short introduction to the kinds of epistemological problems philosophers deal with, or 2) anyone interested in analytic philosophy."},{"Title":"The Problems of Philosophy","review":"This is an extremely thought provoking book.

Without giving it away, I'll use a totally unrelated example: if you said the sky is blue, that could mean you're happy because the sky is clear which would mean the sun is shining which is happy; but then it could mean you're sad because the word \\"blue\\" is used to denote sadness. So essentially, what you're doing is drawing your own conclusions about yourself (which I guess could be a good thing if you've never thought about your personality etc). No wonder they don't want you to give it away."},{"Title":"The Cube: Keep the Secret","review":"An interesting way to reveal your inner strengths AND insecurities.

The story of the Cube and related information can be found several places on the web for free.P.S. I did buy the book first only to find out I didn't need all of the authors' commentary."},{"Title":"The Cube: Keep the Secret","review":"You know those stupid psychological tests/games that you get via e-mail? arent those so stupid? and totally inaccurate? Well the CUBE was so frighteningly dead-on and intelligently deep that it puts all those to shame. You can psychoanalyze yourself in 5 questions that are really fun--or you can take a 200-question-long Kinsey Personality Test. Which is more sociable and enjoyable? I highly recommend this book as an ice-breaker and slumber parties and &quot;bonding&quot; activities of that sort. The only problem IMHO is that once you've played the Cube, that's it. Fini. The End. It's a one-time-use-only thing. It's of no logic to take a personality test twice unless you're schizophrenic. I found the book very entertaining and amazingly accurate on the first read, but after that it's useless. Buy this book if you have LOTS of friends, because no one can play it twice. (well you can play it twice but it's not fun the 2nd time; it's just completely redundant). Right now it's collecting dust so I am going to give it to my younger sister, who will have screaming fun with her sorority sisters over it. But again, once they've played the &quot;Cube&quot;, no more. Just read it once and pass it on."},{"Title":"The Cube: Keep the Secret","review":"You know those movies that you can't really describe to a friend without giving the whole story away? Well this book is sort of like that. But here's my attempt at a &quot;no spoiler&quot; review.The Cube is a little visualization/meditation &quot;game&quot; that you can play by yourself or with any other number of people. It only takes a minute or two to play, and once you learn it you can play it with others without referring to the book. The book has quite a few pages, but that's mostly because it's written rather poetically, with only a paragraph or so on each page. It's divided into 5 main sections: an introduction, the &quot;game&quot; (this part is widely spaced over about 15 pages), reflections on the game (this makes up the bulk of the book, and helps you interpret your results of the game), some interviews from a wide range of celebrities who played the game, and an appendix that can optionally help you along in your discovery.I suggest giving yourself at least a half hour alone to play the game and start reading the main section. When you're done, sit down with your close friends, s.o., or family and play it. You're guarenteed to learn something about each other. Despite the fact that &quot;you can only play it once&quot;, I still think the book is worth buying, and I flip through it on occasion."},{"Title":"The Cube: Keep the Secret","review":"Well, this is a fun game to play with friends and such, but there's not much to it once you finish the main &quot;exercise.&quot; One of my friends said &quot;This is like one of those quizzes you get on email,&quot; and I have to agree. Still, I won't give the &quot;big secret&quot; away...this would probably make a great gift for a teen or just a good friend, and there are worse ways to spend the money."},{"Title":"The Cube: Keep the Secret","review":"It seems superfulous to add another glowing review tothe others that have already been written. The Cube was amazing. I suggest playing it by yourself rather than in a group. What you find out might upset your friends. Thats as much as a will give away. I have been desperate to find another self-discovery book that was as accurate but ot no avail. The Kology books were a big dissapoinment when compared to the accuracy of the Cube. There is absolutely nothing like it. I wish I could forget the secrets and play again to find how my perceptions have changed, but once you know the secret that it. So, don't give into the temptation to read ahead in the book!"},{"Title":"The Cube: Keep the Secret","review":"I loved The Cube not only because it helped me understand myself a bit more, but because it pushed me to take an active part in interpreting the results. Though lots of aids and examples are given to help you make sense of your results, you really are encouraged to decide what they mean to you.This helped my husband and I think a lot about where we are in our marriage and in relation to each other. It's a wonderful book and I look forward to cubing my friends and coworkers! :)"},{"Title":"The Cube: Keep the Secret","review":"If you enjoy self-discovery, but don't take yourself too seriously, then you would like this book. I've been playing &quot;The Cube&quot; with people for the past several years.Of probably more than a hundred people, only four people didn't like the game. This book can just be a lot of fun, or you can really get a lot of great truths from it.This is great for getting to know people or just having fun. I've used it for small parties, campfire conversation, and first dates. Kids can even play it. I can't go into more detail without giving it away, but it is worth more than the jacket price. I've enjoyed this book so much that I have given them as Christmas presents several times."},{"Title":"The Cube: Keep the Secret","review":"I was intrigued by all the reviews here and I am generally pretty open to any kind of mind-trick / soul-searching experience, even if it comes packaged in a box or a book. But I should have known better -- anything that needs this much hyperbolic mystery raised around it should be approached with caution. Clearly this thing worked for the people who praised it in reviews here, but it did not work for me or my companion and, frankly, we found the psychological explanations to be lacking in depth, profundity or any insight beyond the grasp of any remotely self-aware person. For the most part, we felt that much of the text was filler to make the book lognger and thicker. A good chunk of this book, for instance, is dedicated to testimonials by random celebrities discussing their Cube experiences. Some people might be interested, but it was not for us.Judging by all the good reviews, this thing is actually doing someting fun for someone, but if you are the type of person who has low tolerance for fluff, you will find this amusing -- to a point, but, ultimately disappointing.P.S. The book does not actually provide you with any decent instructions as to how to play, which, I think, is another hit against it. You will be asked four questions -- make sure to either write down answers -- or have a very clear mental picture of all the details it is asking about."},{"Title":"The Cube: Keep the Secret","review":"There is a lot of truth to the Cube, the game has existed a long time. My son and I frequently discuss the cubes of others we have done, the game shows off all kinds of personality trends, and has never proved false.If there were a little more detail on how to analyse to cube's answers, it might be nice, but it's kinda cool how so much is left up to you, after the basics.Besides giving insight, it's very often funny to cube someone, especially if you know them pretty well.Cool for cats."},{"Title":"The Cube: Keep the Secret","review":"I played The Cube before I read the book. Although it was an arresting experience when I played it, this book helped me analyze my visions and added a lot to the enjoyment and insight.

All the Market Street houses, neighborhood theaters, \\"international\\" houses (art/foreign films have always been popular here), and even the current multiplexes. A small amount of history is included with each photograph, not an in-depth history, but a nugget of knowledge. (I would love to see a McFarland-type book on San Francisco theaters.)

With this book he reveals an even greater God-given talent as a writer. While not a pure devotional guide, the book is arranged in 31 short chapters suitable for daily reading. It is impossible to sum up the book's theme in a way that does justice to what Glenn is telling us. He does not preach, shout, criticize or demand. He simply shares with us a few of the deep truths God has shared with him over the years. Sometimes God speaks the loudest to us through a whisper.

Eberle's arguments are predicated on the notion that there are citizens who will, at least on occasion, support coercive public policy on the basis of religious reasons alone . . . and that they should not be ethically constrained from doing so.Eberle deconstructs justificatory liberalism arguments, historical case arguments, and theistic nature-grace arguments for the doctrine of restraint. In their stead, he proposes &quot;conscientious engagement&quot; for citizens -- specifically, religious citizens -- but does not require this of them, ethically or otherwise.The work is a must-read for anyone engaged in the philosophy of political discourse as it has developed following on Lemon v. Kurtzman and the articulation of the divisiveness doctrine on through Rawls's &quot;Political Liberalism&quot; and his interlocutors."},{"Title":"Religious Conviction in Liberal Politics","review":"Book was like Brand new! and had a great low price to go with, i would recommend getting this book here."},{"Title":"Religious Conviction in Liberal Politics","review":"This is, in my judgment, the single best book on the subject of the proper role of religion in the politics of a liberal democracy. If that subject interests you, there is no better place to begin than with this book."},{"Title":"Religious Conviction in Liberal Politics","review":"In these times of religious ressurgence, it is time someone offers a valid and balanced alternative to the justificatory-secular-purpose-driven-liberalism that as characterized much of contemporary political and legal theory, constitutional law as well as some U.S. Supreme Court decisions.The \\"robespierrist\\" ACLU is another example of liberal secularist fundamentalism. Eberle's book is one such alternative. ACLU's prime agenda seems to be the official establishment of the Cult of Secular Reason, based on naturalist, materialist and rationalist fideistic (hidden) assumptions.His book proposes de ideal of consciencious engagement as opposed to traditional liberal justificatory and legitimatory arguments, thus suggesting a fairest balance between the theist's dual citizenship imperatives of taking God seriously and taking rights seriously.This book is particularly interesting since it confronts the most popular liberal justificatory arguments of thinkers such as Larmore, Gaus, Audi, and Rawls, among others, as well other common (Bosnia-type) arguments about the divisive nature of religion. This is an indispensable piece of political theory, and more so today than ever."},{"Title":"Religious Conviction in Liberal Politics","review":"Eberle's book is in places a very interesting look at the subject of religion in liberal politics. Unfortunately, his treatment of many liberal views is misguided. For those looking for strong critiques of liberal giants such as Rawls, Eberle ultimately proves disappointing. To take Rawls as an example, Eberle seems to misunderstand some fairly basic elements of Rawls' argument. He treats Rawls' principles as principles meant to apply to government intervention into citizens' lives, something that Rawls does not at all intend. Rawls' argument is more that these principles need to be applied to the formulation of the basic structure of society, not to each action of the government(which is formed only after the principles for the basic structure are agreed on). Thus, Eberle's critiques, while seemingly powerful, are aimed at defeating arguments that Rawls never makes and are in fact contrary to what Rawls advocates.Ultimately, Eberle does not address many of the strongest arguments that liberal thinkers have put forth."},{"Title":"Crazy Woman Creek: Women Rewrite the American West","review":"This anthology is a collection of essays and poems by women who live (or lived) in the American West, on their idea of what community means to them.Some of these women are professional writers, and some are previously unpublished writers, but some simply have a story to tell.And what stories!

This group consisted primarily of people who deny that the Holocost ever occured. The discussions lasted for two months in 1992, the entire text of which is reprinted in the book. It is fascinating not only as a historical refernce (many original German documents are quoted) but also in the way that these arguments are presented and rebutted. In addition to the actual text of the exchange, this book also includes a thorough explanation of terms and people, and an exhaustive index cross-referencing literally any word of importance to all of the messages that contain it. Anyone doing research on the Holocost in particular would find this book full of useful information. Aside from its actual content though, it is also very interesting to follow the argument threads and the way these people are interacting with each other.My father wrote this book, dedicated to his second wife. He and his wife performed extensive research while participating in this debate. Stephanie died in 1996, and Joel in January 1999."},{"Title":"Dawn of Art: The Chauvet Cave (The Oldest Known Paintings in the World)","review":"In December 1994, three speleologists were exploring in the Ard&egrave;che region of France when they discovered an underground system of caves that came to be known as the Chauvet Cave (named for one of the three). Because these individuals were highly aware of the potential for finding ice age cave art in this region and extremely responsible human beings, they behaved with the utmost propriety, taking care to preserve their find for scientific research. As a result, they have ensured the protection and continued existence of a treasure trove of paleolithic art. In DAWN OF ART: THE CHAUVET CAVE, Jean-Marie Chauvet, Eliette Brunel Deschamps and Christian Hillaire tell the story of the discovery that has rocked the art world.The Chauvet Cave paintings were executed sometime during the Aurignacian Period. Radiocarbon dating indicates the wall art is probably about 30,000 years old, making it twice as old as Lascaux. CHAUVET CAVE (the book) includes over 100 pages of stunning photographs of this fabulous art. Literally hundreds of Aurochs, Bison, Mastodons, Horses, Lions, Bears and other animals have been depicted.The Chauvet Cave paintings are extremely well executed, leading many archeologists and art historians to completely reformulate extant theories concerning the evolution of human art. It would seem our forebears were not clumsy louts who drew stick-like versions of organic life. The wall art at Chauvet shows perspective, modeling, color, line, form, and other visual aspects associated with post-Renaissance representational and abstract art. In my estimation, the Chauvet wall paintings -executed in charcoal, ochers, and other material - are comparable to the chalk drawings of Leonardo da Vinci and Picasso.The caves seem to have been the dwelling place of Cave Bears and perhaps humans, at different times. Bones of cave bears litter the floor of the cave and many cave bears have been drawn on the walls. In one chamber, a bear skull rests on an alter-like rock formation. Whether the skull was laid there for magical or religious or secular purposes related to art, or simply tossed there by a child is not known.Scientists are attempting to determine the order of events in the Chauvet cave by studying the formation of overlying levels of sediment and accretions of calcite material on the walls, ceilings, and floors. Some of the wall paintings have been scratched by bear or lion claws indicating animal activity after the pictures were drawn. In other instances, paintings overlay earlier damaged surfaces. Several different artists apparently worked in the cave chambers over an extended period. The most beautiful paintings on the horse panel and elsewhere seem to have been executed by a master and/or his \\"school\\" of apprentices.In the most distant chamber, lies the \\"sorcerer's chamber\\" where a creature with a bison head and human-like form has been painted in conjunction with a \`Lion Panel'. The authors apparently are referring to the \`sorcerers' of Trois-Freres in the Ariege and Gabillou in the Dordogne. My favorite work is the \`Great Lion Panel', a wondrous mural showing a group of grazing bison followed by a pack of lions. The lion heads and shoulders are massive, modeled, and menacing. The authors CHAUVET CAVE appear to have been most captivated by the \`Horse Panel' which is also incredibly beautiful.As is usually the case, Abrams has done a stellar job depicting beautiful works of art. Since very few of us will ever be allowed to visit the Chauvet Cave, this book may be the next best thing to being there."},{"Title":"Dawn of Art: The Chauvet Cave (The Oldest Known Paintings in the World)","review":"This book is filled with beautiful photographs of the oldest known cave art in the world. Simply flipping through and examining these paintings is an amazing experience. However, the text is a little less than breathtaking, providing little information for even those of us who know very little about cave art. It is little more than a description of how the discoverers felt upon finding this cave. Nonetheless, this book is worth purchasing, if only for the spectacular photos."},{"Title":"Dawn of Art: The Chauvet Cave (The Oldest Known Paintings in the World)","review":"The Chauvet Cave in Southern France has caused art history to have to be re-written. This brilliantly painted cave- far older than Lascaux and others in the region is exhibited beautifully here in a lush &quot;Coffee Table&quot; book form. These are well reproduced photographs of superb art work. Some of the animals drawn by the ancient artists have multiple legs- suggesting motion. Also surprising is the attempt at a realistic perspective in some of the works. As excellent as the book is in its photographs it is short on explaining the many questions this art brings to mind such as - &quot;What function did this art serve.&quot; Perhaps this is for the best since the answers may always remain in the realm of speculation. This book is the only way to see this great art- as the cave will probably never be opened to general public visitation."},{"Title":"Dawn of Art: The Chauvet Cave (The Oldest Known Paintings in the World)","review":"This book has an epilogue and prologue written by professional archaeologists that will put the discovery in its proper academic perspective. The real thrill of the book is the narrative by the amateur speleologists as they discover and share with their friends what they recognize as an extraordinary site. Their first effort is to protect the cave bear bones from disturbance by the traffic of the experts who will come when they share their discovery with the world. The book invalidates so much previous speculation about the development of human art that it is a must read."},{"Title":"Dawn of Art: The Chauvet Cave (The Oldest Known Paintings in the World)","review":". A few stars are twinkling. I take a deep breath and think. What to do at 3 a.m.? I take down a book I had been intending to read: Chauvet Cave--the oldest paintings in the world. It was a great choice. I am astonished by the gorgeous cave paintings, the oldest found yet--they are some 30,000 years old. I am awed by the shapes and colors of animals: mammoths, rhinoceros, lions, horses, bears and one owl. Maybe just like the owl I am listening to right now.When the cave was discovered in France in 1994, specialists were astonished by its location and the beauty of its art. Who would have guessed that people that long ago could be so sophisticated in their drawing. They used contours of the cave to dramatize the shapes of animals. The unknown master artist used perspective to show great herds of animals running and used shading on their bodies. There were a few hand prints outlined in red and the imprints of a pair of hands in the clay on the floor of the cave.Even more astonishing were the huge footprints of cave bears and mixed in their tracks were paint pigments used on the walls. Imagine painting a masterpiece and having huge bears tracking through the paint. How distracting. In some places, the bears had incised the paintings on the cave walls with thier huge claws.Cave bears are now extinct. They were larger than even the largest bears we know of today. Chauvet Cave was littered with many bear skulls and bones. If the bears had died while hibernating, that might explain part of it. But one bear skull had been deliberately set on a huge stone that had fallen from the ceiling as if an altar.What had these early people been thinking to paint running herds of animals, bison, and ibex, all beautifully, poetically rendered, and solitary bears in a cave stunning in its beauty with calcite stone draperies and ochre colored walls. All of this remained in pristine condition for 30,000 years and then it was discovered by expert cavers not very long ago. The government of France is making sure that none of it is destroyed by eager tourists or even research teams who may inadvertantly destroy the evidence of early man and the animals they obviously admired.The work is still being carried on and there is a lot to learn there.I was thrilled to find the book, even though it is not a brand new book."},{"Title":"Dawn of Art: The Chauvet Cave (The Oldest Known Paintings in the World)","review":"Written by the experts who made the discovery, and conveying their sense of awe and danger with each step forward into the cave, the book guides you to art preserved for 30,000 years, almost twice as old as the art of the cave art at Lascaux, our earlier benchmark for the earliest known art. The art is reminiscent of Lascaux, and leads us to heady questions about the evolution of human art and creativity.I read the book in its entirety in the first hour after it arrived at my doorstep, amazed and thrilled.This is a great and an important book, and an absolute delight to read.I can only disagree with the title. Art this sophisticated is not the \\"Dawn of Art\\". It has thousands of years of antecedents, and I hope we'll be priviledged to visit some of that with such marvellous story-telling, and such respect for preserving what our ancestors created.-Jane Yett"},{"Title":"Dawn of Art: The Chauvet Cave (The Oldest Known Paintings in the World)","review":"The Chauvet Cave is an amazing find, filled with art more than 30,000 years old. Imagine doing these magnificent drawings with charcoal and raw pigments on a stone wall, and all by firelight. The photographs are beautiful. The cave is closed to the public to protect it, but you can still enjoy feel the wonder through the book. I understand France is working on a replica that will be open to the public, a very good way to share the beauty while protecting the cave.This book, as close as I'm likely to get, is a treasure. It inspires me."},{"Title":"Dawn of Art: The Chauvet Cave (The Oldest Known Paintings in the World)","review":"I found out about the Chauvet cave and this book in the gift shop of another French cave with cave paintings (Font du Gaume). The idea of being within arm's reach of cave paintings was fairly overwhelming. Then to see the book on Chauvet and the paintings found there! What an amazing day!Looking through this book is a constant joy. The paintings were made by a true artist. They are magnificent. If you have an interest in cave paintings, this is the book for you. It is an excellent record of what has been found in the cave to date.I do wish for more expository text but that will come with more study of the paintings, handprints, footprints and other artifacts found in the cave.Until then, I will have to be content to look at beautiful photographs of some of the most amazing art work ever seen."},{"Title":"Four Scottish Journeys: An Identity Rediscovered","review":"As an expat Scot, I find myself going back to this book when I start thinking about, and missing, Scotland. Eames is a fine writer and he describes, not only journeys he made in Scotland (around 1990), but a journey he made within himself, as he searched for a more secure sense of his own identity.His description of the land, the people,and the weather are as vivid, honest, and true as any I have ever had the pleasure of reading. Four Scottish Journeys takes me back to the country where I grew up in a way which is almost as real as being there."},{"Title":"Twilight of Empire (Eckert, Allan W. Winning of America Series.)","review":"This is the last book in Allan Eckert's Winning of America Series. \\"Twilight of Empire\\" chronicles the little-known but bloody Indian uprising in western Illinois in 1832 that became known as Black Hawk's War.The war was named after the leader of the uprising, an old battle-hardened Sauk war chief named Ma-ka-tai-me-she-kia-kiak...Black Hawk. In the years following the War of 1812, white settlers flooded into Sauk and Fox lands and the native tribes were forced into signing treaties that gave up their ancestral lands to the United States. In the spring of 1832, Black Hawk, in defiance of the United States and some of his own tribal leaders, led a large band of his starving people back across the Mississippi into northern Illinois to reclaim their stolen lands. This large movement of Indians was seen as hostile by the local white settlers and the militia was called out to subdue Black Hawk's band. The fatefull encounter at what would become the Battle of Stillman's Run would start off what would be the last major Indian war of the midwest. In the end, Black Hawk and his people would be decimated by pursuing American troops under General Atkinson at the Battle of Bad Axe, where hundreds of Indian women and children were shot or drowned while trying to escape back across the Mississippi River. This sad event marked the end of Indian wars east of the Mississippi and signaled the end of the way of life for the woodland Indians.This story is deeply moving and involved and tells the history of a people and events not generally known today. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Twilight of Empire (Eckert, Allan W. Winning of America Series.)","review":"ALLAN ECKERT GOT ME FOREVER HOOKED ON THE FASINATING HISTORY OF BLACK HAWK AND THE BLACK HAWK WAR. HIS STORY TELLING STYLE AND ACCURATE ACCOUNTS OF THIS IMPORTANT PART OF THIS AREAS HISTORY MAKES IT A MUST READ."},{"Title":"Twilight of Empire (Eckert, Allan W. Winning of America Series.)","review":"Born and raised in Chicago it is difficult to think of Illinois as a frontier: Wisconsin, Kentucky, Minnesota, yes; but Illinois, no. To me there were too few Native American names to associate with specific places and until this work by Alan W. Eckert I was completely unaware that actual battles were fought in Illinois and the Native Americans sometimes won.This is the story of the Black Hawk Indian War that was fought in today's northern Illinois and southern Wisconsin in 1832. Little remembered today, it resulted in a major mobilization of US troops from as far away as New York City, Fort Monroe at Point Comfort, Virginia and Baton Rouge, Louisiana. With the advent of steam power, it also resulted in the longest amphibious and most rapid deployment of men and material in our Nation's then current history. Troops embarked from New York's Sackets Harbor, sailed past Detroit, through Lake St. Clair to the Straits of Mackinaw and down the entire length of Lake Michigan to Chicago.But on arrival at Chicago, cholera prevented further movement and the troops were quarantined north of the city at Evanston on the land that became the campus of today's Northwestern University. Heading west (on today's Army Trail Road) Federal troops finally rendezvous with local militias and begin an arduous chase of the Sac and Fox tribes under Black Hawk up into Wisconsin and across the southern portion of the State. Intercepted by a Federal gunboat at the Mississippi River, the Indians are literally slaughtered. Trapped on the Mississippi's eastern shore over 300 Native Americans are killed as opposed to just a few soldiers.This is quite a detailed look at what led up to this war, its prosecution and ultimate conclusion. It was the last major engagement fought against the woodland Indians and oddly enough includes the worst single defeat ever experienced by the US Army. The cast of characters is literally a who's who of the times: General Winfield Scott, Lewis Cass, General Henry Atkinson, David Twiggs, William Clark, Philip St. George Cooke, Keokuk, Albert Sidney Johnson, 2 future US Presidents, Zachary Taylor and Abraham Lincoln and Jefferson Davis, future President of the Confederate States of America.As usual Allan W. Eckert's research is flawless. But his amazing attention to detail sometimes gets in the way of his story. I found this work somewhat laborious compared to his prior works; the writing is clear but not as concise as it has been, so the story line becomes muddled. But make no mistake Eckert's writing is effective: When was the last time anyone thought of Illinois as the wild frontier?"},{"Title":"Twilight of Empire (Eckert, Allan W. Winning of America Series.)","review":"This is one of the weaker books in Eckert's series, but it was still a good read. I'd recommend it for any Eckert fan, or any other American-History fan. You should definately read the other books in the series!!!"},{"Title":"Twilight of Empire (Eckert, Allan W. Winning of America Series.)","review":"Not only is Twilight of Empire a great book, but the whole winning of america series are, without a doubt, the best stories ever told. I would recommend them to anyone, even those not very interested in history. You have got to read these!"},{"Title":"Twilight of Empire (Eckert, Allan W. Winning of America Series.)","review":"I only rate this book a 4, because the first book in the series, \\"The Frontiersman\\" is the best, and I rated it a 5. But really, this book is great reading. The Black Hawk War is a story not told often, but like usual, Eckert tells it very well here and keeps the reader's interest all the way through.If your kid is bored with history, this series of books should make him not so bored."},{"Title":"Twilight of Empire (Eckert, Allan W. Winning of America Series.)","review":"Allan Eckert is in my opinion one of the very best story tellers ever! If you like early American history then you would like this series. I highly recommend it to all of my friends."},{"Title":"Twilight of Empire (Eckert, Allan W.

Each section includes a list of skills addressed in the unit, notes for the teacher (including answers when appropriate), individual and group projects, a map of the geographical area, a vocabulary list, a chronology, activities which require analysis of key historical literary documents and connections with cultural traditions and beliefs, and a variety of creative written responses. It does an especially good job in establishing an understanding of religious and philosophical belief systems, historical events and cultural movements that helped to shape the themes and styles of world literature during different historical periods. Very useful in helping students understand historical/literary connections."},{"Title":"World Literature Activities Kit: Ready-To-Use Worksheets for Secondary Students","review":"As new teacher I found this selection very valuable. It helped me to organize thoughtful and exciting Literature Circles for my Gifted and Talented students."},{"Title":"Inside the Poker Mind: Essays on Hold 'em and General Poker Concepts","review":"This book is more of a &quot;Best Practices&quot; poker book in many ways.Here's the real skinny on the book and the reviews as I see it.TRUE:1. This book should not be the first poker book you read. But reviewers neglected to mention that the author himself states this in &quot;General Poker Concepts&quot; and suggests many starter texts.2. This book does spend significant time on topics other than what's going on inside a poker player's mind. The author might do too much of that, but it's clear that he does so to provide supporting info. The sections contrasting the thoughts of average vs advanced players do treat the subject and perhaps they deserved more emphasis.3. Yes, the author does criticize non-limit and tournament play. Playing in casino situations is very differnent from tournaments where the chips don't represent real money dollar for dollar. Nobody said it doesn't take skill to win. It's just a different skill set. Truth be told, there are plenty of great tournament books if that's what you are into.FALSE:1. No, it is not fair to say this book is unoriginal. Nor is it accurate that Sklansky's and Malmuth's books cover everything in this book. This book has some really great real world examples of poker logic spelled out much more clearly than in other books. It doesn't have to be the definitive poker book to be a valuable read.2. While the book does start out a little slow, I found the stories very funny. For those who play in casino or card-room games, you will find humor in reading Feeney's examples of mistakes that you have seen yourself and others make. I did.3. One point needs clarification before some unsuspecting person goes and drops $2K in Vegas after reading this book. Reading this book will NOT save you thousands of dollars. No book will save you $. Only UNDERSTANDING the concepts the book trys to bring across will actually make you or save you money.On pg 62, he writes, &quot;Education in poker theory reduces one's susceptibility to illusions which can interfere with good play.&quot; Man I wish I could believe this. I think his advice to seek psycotherapy might do more to that end.So many people read a few books and lose their shirts because of false confidence. While I totally understand the value of the material, value cannot be derived by reading it. It must be digested, pondered, and mastered to be valuable.The coolest thing about this book is the relevance of the examples. Every topic, from reraising the weak to calling on the end, was treated in a real world way that I have observed in casino play. A great example is &quot;Maximizing the Set&quot; on pgs 127-128. So many books treat these concepts abstractly. I must say that I did not fully understand much of this till I read this book.Again, the outline of the way bad players think was the hallmark. It talks about things that not only stop you from making mistakes but help you identify the saps in a real game. Perhaps the treatment of tilt could have been more explicit. But his unique viewpoint provokes thought, even though it comes along with resistance.There's a common quote that goes, &quot;If you look around the poker table and don't see any suckers, you're it!&quot; I would strongly advise anybody reading the sections on advanced vs. weak player thoughts to read the hands and honestly evaluate what they would be thinking if they drew that hand before reading the author's explaination. This is a serious wake-up call to those who are unknowing maniacs or overconfident goats.Overall this is a very practical read that deserves the attention of anybody looking to increase their hourly rate in actual casino and card-room play."},{"Title":"Inside the Poker Mind: Essays on Hold 'em and General Poker Concepts","review":"Overall Inside the Poker Mind should be part of any serious poker player's library. However, it shouldn't be one of the first books read about poker. Quite frankly, beginning players won't get much out of it, and most who have (that I know of) are dissappointed.For the intermediate to advanced player, the subjects addressed should be extremely useful. For the most part, the book focuses, as the title implies, on different ways of thinking rather than strict tactical plays. Example: in the \\"strategic moment\\" section, the author contrasts what the average player thinks as opposed to what the advanced player considers. In this way the author illustrates the depths of poker.Overall very worthwhile if you're ready for it."},{"Title":"Inside the Poker Mind: Essays on Hold 'em and General Poker Concepts","review":"Feeney has produced an extraordinarily deep work. The sections discussing the thought processes of an expert poker player are truly eye opening, and offer an insight into the complexities of the game that most books fail to capture. The book is exceptionally well-written -- exceptional in the sense that most great poker players are not great writers and most great poker books are, well, written by great poker players. (Slansky &amp; Malmuth essentially open their &quot;Texas Hold Em for Advanced Players&quot; with an apology for their poor writing). This is not a book for beginning poker players, but I would recommend it without hesitation to anyone who has become familiar with basic poker theory. I had read about a dozen books on poker and hold 'em before I came to this one. No book before or since has made me feel so excited about the game."},{"Title":"Inside the Poker Mind: Essays on Hold 'em and General Poker Concepts","review":"I have read every top poker book ever published and have been a successful middle limit player for fifteen years. John Feeney's first poker book is a terrific collection of poker essays geared toward the mid to upper limit holdem player. However, anyone who plays poker seriously should find this book to be a tremendous value. He \\"pushes the envelope\\" of advanced thinking on familiar poker topics and brings a fresh and accurate perspective to every chapter. His essays concerning \\"Playing Against A Maniac\\" cover ideas I have never before seen in print and soon hope to employ at the tables. But my favorite chapter is \\"The Strategic Moment in Holdem\\", which literally puts you \\"Inside the Mind\\" of a top-level professional player as he thinks at the table."},{"Title":"Inside the Poker Mind: Essays on Hold 'em and General Poker Concepts","review":"I am one of a growing number of serious card club poker players who learned to play poker competitively and for profit by reading books in addition to time spent at the tables. Seldom does a new book provide the unique perspective on this wonderful and complex game as this great book of essays by Dr. Feeney.This book is not for beginners. Dr. Feeney assumes that the reader understands the advanced works of other great poker writers such as David Sklansky, Mason Malmuth, Bob Ciaffone, and Mike Caro. It also concentrates on Texas Holdem rather than other popular games such as seven card stud. But its advanced analysis of the psychology of poker will help all players who want to beat the biggest and toughest games."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:B,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},H={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],R={key:0},D={key:1};function G(s,o,n,u,r,i){const c=m("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",H,[(e(!0),t(w,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(e(),g(c,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",D,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",R,"See more"))],8,x)):p("",!0)])}const L=d(C,[["render",G],["__scopeId","data-v-84fc0fbf"]]),E=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/43.md","filePath":"people/43.md"}'),q={name:"people/43.md"},W=Object.assign(q,{setup(s){return(o,n)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(L)]))}});export{E as __pageData,W as default};
