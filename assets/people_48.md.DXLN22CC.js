Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"After reading the book, Bringing Down the House, I was excited and intrigued with the world of card counting and the lives of the card counters. I plan to read more books about the subject. From the book, I got the feeling that Mezrich's goal throughout the book was to captivate and teach people about the world of casinos and card counting. He met one of the characters at a party and was fascinated enough to put the story into a book to enthrall everyone who reads it. I can guarantee to any readers of the book, that they will feel mesmerized by the casino life and more educated about the subject. This book will be a quick read that the reader will not be able to put down. It will interest a wide variety of people, from those who love to gamble and go to casinos all the time to those who have never stepped foot in one in their life. I know this from reading the reviews of the people before me. Many of them said that they gambled before, but a surprisingly large number of them said that they had never gambled in their lives.In response to a few of the negative reviews, I read through many of them and have a few major disagreements to point out. First, J. Danielson, you talked about how you went to MIT and that Mezrich got a few of the details wrong about the school. To tell you the truth, when people read this book they won't remember the little details of graduating with honors or not, they'll remember the intense casino scenes. This brings me to the next topic of yours that I disagreed with. You talked about how you have been banned from a casino before and that they don't rough you up the way Mezrich made it seem like in his book. Well, there are more than a few casinos and what actions they take when kicking someone out will probably vary between them. Now, to Critical Reader, you say that you did research on Wikipedia after reading the book and found that some of the facts that Mezrich talked about were false. If you want to accuse someone of using false facts, you might want to try a reliable source next time. Finally, to the \\"crimsonwildcat,\\" in your review, you accuse Mezrich of having what comes off as false conversations with the people in the book. If you haven't met any of these people, then I don't think you can really tell if it was false or not. However, I must agree with the negative reviews when you say that some parts of the book got repetitive. That was definitely a weakness, but Mezrich had many more high points, like expressing the tension between characters and showing the excitement of Las Vegas and a card counter's life."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"As a physician I have my fill of non-fiction with an abundance of journals so when I read for relaxation I want a story that keeps me excited, interested and sleepless until it is finished. Bringing Down the House is such a book and reads like a Clancy or Pollock with a little lower body count, but with no less excitement.Ben Mezrich is superb writer and story teller with the amazing ability to weave the excitement of a Las Vegas casino, the mathmetics of card counting with enjoyable interpersonal dynamics so that this is a consuming story with people you care about. His description of the high roller lifestyle in Vegas takes you to the tables playing sums you watch others wager with the adrenaline rush like you were part of the team. I bought the book in Boston having just missed him at a book signing and had a hardtime finishing the conference. I found myself in the room reading a book I could not put down instead of going out in one of the towns in which the story was set. It was that engrossing.My Christmas list now contains all of his previous writings as this is an author who knows how to tell a story."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"I enjoyed the book. It's an easy read. The story is engaging. But I question its veracity.If you want to read a gambling story that predates this book, search for localroger's &quot;A Casino Odyssey&quot; at kuro5hin.org. He tells a strikingly similar tale. Stikingly similar. If nothing else, the Web publication of localroger's story -- a year before Bringing Down the House came out -- makes me wonder just how much this author has in common with Jayson Blair.I read through all reviews (160 at this writing). I seem to be the first MIT alum to speak up (although &quot;A reader from Cambridge, MA&quot; is probably also familiar with the school.) I was there in the early 80's. There were rumors about undergraduates who earned their tuition counting cards at blackjack tables. I never met one. I did, however, know some of the authors of a bona fide MIT &quot;hack&quot; book: The Unix Hater's Handbook. &quot;Hacking&quot; (loosely translated as a &quot;prank&quot;) is a core and longstanding tradition at MIT. Bringing Down the House smells like another hack to me, but I can't be sure.On one hand, several reviewers have pointed out what appear to be exaggerations and inconsistencies. On the other hand, The Tech, official source of MIT news archived on the Web, published an article titled &quot;Card Counting Gig Nets Students Millions,&quot; which essentially confirms the author's claims. It includes quotes purportedly from the people potrayed in the book. On the other hand, The Tech itself is not immune from being hacked. On the other hand, I got confirmation from another alum that Micky Rosa is for real. OK, enough with the hands.There are other elements that leave me with questions. One detail that any MIT alum would include in his account is that MIT students aren't called geeks. We're nerds. N-e-r-d nerd. I realize the author isn't an alum, but he shouldn't have missed that -- he doesn't use the word &quot;nerd&quot; ONCE in the whole book. I was also surprised that googling for '&quot;kevin lewis&quot; MIT' doesn't turn up his real name. Are any of the portrayed characters traceable?To maximize my satisfaction of this tale, I would like to have more assurance that it is true. A fiction writer claiming to write his first non-fiction book simply isn't good enough these days. (Thank you, New York Times, for showing me how stupid publishers can be and for utterly destroying my confidence in writers of all sorts. :-)"},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"...namely, how much of this tale to believe?But first, the basics: \\"Kevin\\" joins a team of Blackjack players based out of MIT, and extracts some ungodly number of dollars from the casinos over the course of a five-year romp. Then the casinos wise up to the game, and start putting the squeeze on Kevin and his buddies: expulsions, IRS audits, intimidation, and a little rough stuff in back rooms.Ben Mezrich is a thriller-writer by day, and the prose is a bit too ripely melodramatic--cliff-hanger chapter endings that go nowhere, visual metaphors culled from Raymond Chandler's wastebasket: \\"the muscles beneath his MIT T-shirt rippled like a plastic trash can left out in a heat wave.\\" (And just when did everyone at MIT get so darned _ripped_? Almost everyone's a stud or a babe, except for the shadowy Asian ringleader with the horrible teeth and bad vision. Must be a different part of campus than I usually see.) But he manages to keep the writing at a good poolside or plane-time level, and you can skim the bits that are obviously padded out to stretch a 150-page story into a 250-page book.The Blackjack itself seems mostly reasonable. The kids practice the classic \\"Hi-Lo\\" count, but with a clever twist. Hi-Lo calls for the player to bet the minimum a lot of the time, then dramatically raise the betting level when the distribution of cards turns favorable. One thing this isn't, is inconspicuous--the casinos are good at spotting this stuff. So the MIT gang fielded two types of players--some always bet low, but kept track of the \\"count.\\" When it became favorable, these players would give the high-sign to a \\"Gorilla\\" or \\"Big Player,\\" who always bet high, and sat at a hot table until the count went bad again. Then the Big Player would drift off and look for the next signal. Nobody ever altered their betting levels; but the high-rollers just seemed to magically land at one hot table after another.It sounds like a pretty good scheme...even a bit like some of the tactics Blackjack writer Stanford Wong talks about. I guess it could work.The trouble is that too much of the story just doesn't seem to wash. My spider-sense started tingling early in the book, when a character grabbed two martinis off a passing cocktail waitress's tray...like she was passing them around at a catered party. Now, I'm no Vegas-hound, but I've never known the cocktail service at a casino to work that way. And this happens two or three times over the course of the narrative. It's a small thing, almost trivial...but definitively _wrong._ I don't think a writer who's done his homework will miss something like that.And now that I was thinkig suspiciously, a whole lot of things started smelling fishy. Let me mention a few:--The team is continually faced with the challenge of moving as much as $600,000 across the country from Boston to Vegas and back, week after week. They have to employ all kinds of subterfuge to get the cash through airport security--hollow laptops, fake casts, ziplock bags in their underwear. Well, why bother? That money is working capital, not profit--why doesn't it just stay in Nevada, in a string of deposit boxes? They mention using _some_ bank boxes, so why run the risk of looking like drug runners?--The team is forever staying in comped \\"high roller\\" suites in big-name casinos: hot tubs, bottle of champagne waiting on arrival, limos to the airport, the whole nine yards. Uhh, way not to attract attention, guys. You can have a safe room just a few steps off the strip for a hundred bucks or less. In a game where once the casinos know your game, it's over, why would \\"professionals\\" take these kinds of outrageous risks just to get a free room?--In fact, to heck with staying in hotels. With the kind of money this book is talking about, the smart investment would be a house, somewhere in the sleepier suburbs of Clark county. Then you'd never have to worry about making one absolute rookie mistake the MIT team makes--counting cards in the same place you're sleeping. It makes for a dramatic scene with hotel security, but it doesn't make a lick of sense. Heck, even _I_ know enough not to do that.I could go on, but you get the idea. All of these little oddities and inconsistencies make no sense except for one thing--they all serve to sex up the storyline, make it more exotic, more James Bond...make it sell more books. Hmmm. I know a little bit about the proud traditions of tall tales and practical jokes at MIT and Harvard (the author's alma mater). At the end of the day, I have to think that there's more Vegas razzle-dazzle than journalistic truth in here.But hey, don't we go to casinos to believe in a fantasy? At fourteen bucks, this is one of the cheaper Las Vegas illusions you can buy."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"I'm an MIT alumnus and was friends with some blackjack team players at various times between 1979 and the present. Whenever Mezrich writes about something where I have personal knowledge, he seems to be fabricating information. This applies even to simple stuff, e.g., he talks about people \\"graduating from MIT with honors\\", something that is possible at Harvard, where he studied (one hopes he did not study journalism or factual research there), but not possible at MIT. He talks about some of his characters being MIT engineering majors and being elected to the Phi Beta Kappa Society, whose own Web site states clearly that \\"To be eligible for election, students must have pursued a broad program of study in the liberal arts and sciences\\" (i.e., engineers are not eligible).Mezrich and his publisher get many facts wrong that they could have easily checked with Google and Wikipedia. It makes a reader wonder about the stuff that cannot be independently verified..."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"I highly recommend this book as a very entertaining read. I was in my local book retailer and decided to see if there were any new counting books in the gaming section. I've learned several counting methods and have read a lot about team play. This book jumped out at me, because I'd heard rumblings about an MIT team that had gone public.I read the book in one day. I turned my brother loose on it, and he read it in one day. He handed it off to my wife, and she read it in one day. As you can see, it's not a book that bogs you down much. It doesn't get too technical in regards to the strategy or counting methods they used. If you've read and learned the methods ahead of time, it makes more sense, but even if you haven't, it explains enough to move you along.The author also throws in excitement in the form of the players' run-ins with the casino's, who are not happy to be counted on and taken for thousands at a time. There are also conflicts within the team that make for good reading.This book is by no means a how-to book... it's more of a how-we-did-it book. If you want to emulate their success, good luck. Facial recognition has made it so that no one can do this to the extent that they did. You can make money playing blackjack.. but don't order that Ferrari just yet."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"Bringing Down the House is probably the most entertaining book I have read in a long time. I actually found it difficult to put down. When I should have been sleeping I instead continued reading saying to myself &quot;this is the last chapter then i'm going to bed&quot;.I've always had a great interest in gambling and have read many books on card counting as well as heard a little about what this team did in Vegas. When I saw the title I knew I had to give this one a read. I have fairly decent understanding of the many mainstream concepts of blackjack strategy and what this team did was purely brilliant and outside of the common beliefs that Vegas and many pro gamblers (the ones who write books about it) want you to believe. An example, casinos would love to make you think that its impossible to count or beat a 6 deck shoe. In reality this is completely untrue. 1 deck might be easy to count, but you generally only get 1 or 2 rounds of play out of it so when the numbers run to your favor you only have one hand to take advantage of it. When the shoe runs positive, the cards can go several rounds before they flatten out. There are of course many other factors involved such as how deep into the stack the dealer puts the shuffle card, etc.To any gambling enthusiast this is a must read. To anyone who is neutral on gambling, it is a story that is easy to follow and very intriguing. If you hate gambling and everything it stands for, you might not like it."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"This is a great story. I bought the book on Amazon for my brother after reading an excerpt in Wired Magazine and, after dipping into the first chapter, I felt compelled to stay up most of the night to read it straight through, before shipping it off the next day. The basics of the story -- a bunch of smart kids outwit the big bad casinos and walk away with lots of money (before the inevitable occurs) -- have a pretty much universal appeal. Whether or not all of this stuff actually happened as it's portrayed here: Who cares? The explanations of blackjack strategy are lucid and, unlike most of what you read about this kind of stuff, actually pass the mathematical sniff test. But the real fun is in the execution of the strategy: how this group of kids in their twenties worked in teams, 'casing' the blackjack pits to identify situations were the odds were in their favor, and then swooped in for the kill. And out again. All the while adopting various roles and 'personalities' to take advantage of casinos' own techniques to profile bettors (and 'cheaters') to beat the big houses at their own game. The story is well plotted, fast paced, and would make a fine movie."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

I also enjoy eating Circus Peanuts, not because of their nutritional value but because they are soft and chewey.This book will not rot one's tooth, but it will irritate the sensibilities of most folks. There are two main irritants embedded in the book. One is the writing itself. While the characters in this little tale were counting cards, I was counting grammatical gaffes. Unlike them, I lost count. I can't believe the author was a Harvard grad. The only explanation is that he was using bad grammar for effect. If so, why? It's irritating in any case.The second irritant was the inept dropping of technical terms. The text is littered with these technical malaprops. The author might as well have announced: &quot;Hey, I don't really know what I'm talking about.&quot; Again, he may have planted these unhappy usages into the text for effect. But again (again), why?The two stars, by the way, were for the engaging, racy style. As I said, I do enjoy Circus Peanuts."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"Author Ben Mezrich is on the streak of a lifetime, with his top-selling, wildly flawed, heavily fictionalized \\"history\\" of a well-known blackjack team getting made into a movie by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Pretty impressive. MGM, after all, as Mezrich croons in a recent interview, is \\"the same company that owns most of the large casinos in Vegas.\\" (See the February, 2004 Kuro5hin interview at http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2004/2/5/5855/53465) The only problem with this claim, like many of the major and minor details in Mezrich's book, is that it isn't true. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the movie company, and MGM Mirage, the casino company, are totally separate corporations, just as Mezrich's Las Vegas and the real Nevada town are totally different. Mezrich may be the only gambling writer in America who doesn't know these elementary facts.For four years I've supported myself and my family by counting cards in American casinos and winning at blackjack. It is a tense, weird, exhilirating life, and I would love for more of my friends to understand it. This book doesn't help. Not only is the grade-school prose tedious. Not only are the technical blackjack details, on those few occasions when Mezrich summons the pluck to try tackling them, incorrect or misleading. The dramatic structure gropes and falls flat. The journalism is scandalously lazy and erroneous. Above all, the spirit, the eclat that card counters muster to wage our little war against casinoland is missing. Mezrich doesn't get it and can't report it. He hasn't been there and he doesn't know, his scanty experimental plays with MIT alums notwithstanding. If you want to know what gamblers are like and how we live, skip this drivel.Look instead at legendary hustler Amarillo Slim's new memoir, Amarillo Slim in a World Full of Fat People. Look at Jesse May's insuperable poker novel, Shut Up and Deal, which more than any other book depicts the dark heart of the professional player. If it's blackjack history and the activities of the major teams you're into, read Ken Uston. If you want to understand the technical aspects of the game, get Don Schlesinger, Arnold Snyder, Peter Griffin, and, for old time's sake, Ed Thorpe. If you want to learn how a notorious high-stakes counter makes his way in the world, read Ian Andersen's Burning the Tables in Las Vegas. There's so much good gambling writing out there, with so much real-life experience underlying it, that wasting time and money on Mezrich is a sucker's bet."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"I&#65533;d never heard of Ben Mezrich before reading this book, but within the first few pages I started to suspect that Ben isn&#65533;t exactly dealing from a full deck in the writing talent department. You can open this book at any page and find an awkward clich&eacute;, or some badly fictionalized account of something that may, or may not, have really happened. I finished reading this book with a growing feeling of endearment for poor old Ben, I imagined him staring out of a window, chewing absentmindedly on the end of a pencil and wondering how he could best describe the ocean in the Bahamas, and then getting all excited as he wrote &#65533;the water was crystal-blue&#65533;. Or when a card counter stumbles in on his colleague being &#65533;questioned&#65533; by casino security we are asked to believe the dialog was; &#65533;We&#65533;re gonna play a little game &#65533; I&#65533;m gonna ask you some questions and you&#65533;re gonna tell me what I want to hear.&#65533; And what kind of voice did the interrogator have? Why, a brusque voice of course! Perhaps casinos have special 1950&#65533;s B-movie themed heavies.It&#65533;s not just the trashy novel style dialogue and sensibilities that are a problem, there&#65533;s the more fundamental problem that the events are recounted to Ben by &#65533;Kevin Lewis&#65533; &#65533; the genius MIT student (we know he&#65533;s a genius because Ben lets us know quite often, he also lets us know that he&#65533;s really smart too, because he went o Harvard). But the narrative often includes incidents and events that are taking place while Kevin isn&#65533;t around. He seems fully clued in on what his friends are up too (even though they&#65533;ve all had a big tiff and have never spoken since). There&#65533;s even a paragraph describing Kevin hastily leaving a casino alone, but unaware of a gray haired figure watching him. If Kevin didn&#65533;t know he was being watched, and he was alone &#65533; how the hell did Ben write about it? The money that is being won seems to fluctuate between 'millions', but then Kevin has to play one weekend because he needs to pay his rent.Then there&#65533;s the research, and the little vignettes we get as Ben interviews various people. I&#65533;m entirely baffled as to how any of these people fit into the story, (a security expert, some guy who owns a shooting range, a stripper), they don&#65533;t seem to have anything to say and Ben seems quite happy to present them up as some sort of Vegas style authenticity. Ben tells us that everyone who works in Vegas earns much more than they could anywhere else, he asks us &#65533;where else could a college dropout who parks cars put his kids through private school?&#65533; It&#65533;s almost as though he quotes entire sentences from some Las Vegas tourist guide. Never mind the well documented poverty and low wages the casinos have brought to Las Vegas.There are some nice touches to the book though, when Kevin is thrown out of New York, New York in Las Vegas he wonders if a security guys Brooklyn accent is real or part of the Casino&#65533;s theme.If you can get a copy of &#65533;The Newtonian Casino&#65533; by Thomas Bass then you&#65533;ll have a much more articulate and exciting read, it&#65533;s a similar story but involves the invention of a computerized roulette predictor that can fit in a shoe, by some students (possibly MIT again I think!). For a better overview of Vegas I&#65533;d recommend &#65533;Dead Cities&#65533; by Mike Davis."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"I did enjoy the book, and I found it difficult to put down. However, much of the book is clearly fiction. Some stories only push the limits of credulity, while several others are clearly fabrications.For an example that won't ruin anything later in the book, a very early segment in the book describes a technique alled &quot;spot cutting.&quot; The book's main character is being taught the system and is brought to a table where a member of the blackjack team is playing. His escort says, &quot;Watch Fisher. He is doing something called spot cutting. He can work the deck to get a specific card dealt to himself.&quot;The idea behind spot cutting is that players can sometimes see a card after the shuffle but before the cut. The player can then cut the decks to an exact number of cards and then work the deck so that he gets the card he saw. Sure enough, a few hands after they showed up, Fisher raised his bet significantly and was promptly dealt an ace!Its difficult to see how any reasonable-thinking person could see this as an effective strategy. The protagonist of the book says that they can only sometimes see a card after the shuffle and correctly notes that its only really effective when one sees an ace. Let's suppose that these players can somehow always get the cut in every shoe. Then, let's say they can see a card after the shuffle 50% of the time. No matter how they play their cards, there will always be a number of plays between their last play and when the given card is dealt. Let's be very generous and say that luck is on their side and they get the card they want 50% of the time. And let's be even more generous and say that they cut to exactly where they intend to every single time.Being remarkably generous, the player will be able to get himself dealt an ace less than once in every 50 shoes, or in less than 1/10th of 1% of his hands. I could make more money checking pay phones for loose change, and this doesn't even take into account the fact that the player will have to make foolish plays to try to get himself dealt the card. Even if we accept that someone would use this strategy to try to win money, what's the likelihood that the trainee would happen to walk up right when the guy gets himself dealt an ace? Small enough that I don't buy it for a second.Like I said, the book is entertaining, but the obviously fabricated stories made me question the truth of everything else."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

That is fine but I wouldn't want to have to live on that income. It also shows to what disgusting levels casinos will stoop to stop people from using their brains at the tables. The actions of the American casino industry should really be scrutinized. However, I think the book is a little too exaggerated in its depiction of the \\"lifestyle\\" and typical nights of the team and their players. For a more balanced, and entertaining view, I believe you should read Frank Scoblete's \\"Best Blackjack.

There were many great elements to the book and Ben Mezrich did a great job at getting his point through.I believe that Mezrich was trying to portray the idea of knowing the right time to stop and walk away from a shifty environment. In this certain book this idea relates to the idea of playing Blackjack and its drawbacks.Kevin is a MIT student and wants nothing more to do than just finish college and get a successful job. Then, that faithful day comes when he learns about his two friends and how they have been supporting each other. At first, when he learns about the idea of Blackjack and making millions, he quickly swipes it away. But, as time goes on he sees there is more to the game than just luck and that is counting cards. In a matter of weeks Kevin is hooked on the idea of making \\"free money\\" by using his school skills. In a matter of months Kevin becomes a pro and is considered an elite player. The question is when will his streak end?When I got to the part of the serious gambling, that is when the real action in the book picks up for me. The idea of gambling and being able to sink a casino in a matter of weeks, gives you a thrill. There is also the part which everyone fears and that is getting barred from the casino or sometimes even worst. For me it can't get any more intense than that. This adrenaline flows into you while reading and the suspense builds up. You can not wait to flip the page and see what follows because you are so wrapped up in the story. I was on the edge of my seat throughout the book trying to anticipate the characters next move, which was very intriguing. The book is also very thorough at explanations. At times it is as if you can see the surroundings near you because of the vivid details.Mezrich does a great job to make the story flow smoothly and yet include those great moments. His writing style is unmistakable and very unique itself.The reason I gave it a 4/5 though was because after a few Las Vegas chapters the writer would switch back to what the narrator is experiencing. To me this is when the story got dull and took more time to read. It was informational and all, but it just took away from the action of Vegas. To me without that second secret life Kevin was just ordinary and that was not too interesting to read about. Anyway that was the only real part I was really bugged by, otherwise it was a great book.Overall, this book was great. It had all the right elements for a nice read. Definitely one of the best non-fiction books I have read in a long time and it was written in a way that was not too hard to understand, but yet contained some difficulty too. In my opinions this is the type of book other kids my age would greatly enjoy since it could be easily connected to events in real life."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"Taking us inside the oftentimes seedy world of card counting and high stakes gambling in Las Vegas, Ben Mezrich has written a gem with his first excursion into non-fiction, Bringing Down the House. No matter who you are or what your personal history in gambling is, this book will exhilarate, enthrall, and captivate you from the start.Mezrich tells the story of Kevin Lewis, an MIT student who lived a double life for nearly five years - one as a respected student and graduate of MIT, the other as a high stakes blackjack player with several aliases and loads of cash at his disposal. It all begins with a relatively innocent weekend in Atlantic City with two friends, and from there Mezrich takes you down a suspenseful path from casino backrooms to IRS audits.One of the best non-fiction books I have ever read, Bringing Down the House will run the gamut of your emotions. Sometimes you will envy the high-flying life a blackjack team as they party like rock stars, get comped front-row seats to the biggest boxing matches, and make a better living than most of us ever will in the job we work now. At other times, however, you will feel like their lives are empty and meaningless, for most of these people make card-counting their life. They see it as what they are supposed to do here on earth.Perhaps dangerously, Kevin Lewis's story tells us all that Vegas can be beat. But at the expense of what, is the question? Decide for yourself when you pick up the page-turning true story by Ben Mezrich, Bringing Down the House."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

While reading the book I found that it was extremely hard to put down and that I essentially had goose bumps imagining the pure brilliance of these college kids.The book is absolutely amazing, the story of 6 brilliant MIT students who are taught by a math professor how to count cards and pass these counts to other teammates unknown to security and other casino personnel. Counting the 312 cards included in the 6 deck shoe and getting an accurate count is unbelievable. The book goes into great detail explaining all of the members of the team. The reason a one man team would be impossible to pull off is because raising your bet after the cards got hot, and lowering the betting as the cards cooled off, would be seen as very suspicious to the dealer and you would be made known to security. Using an intricate team is how millions of dollars were made.The first member of the team will start out at the table placing the minimum bet every single hand while counting cards (A high card, 9 -Ace, counts as -1, while a low card, 2-6, counts as +1. Thus a high count means that many low cards have been drawn out of the shoe leaving many high cards). This team member is generally dressed very modestly and doesn't draw too much attention to themselves. After the count gets \`hot' this member will call in the big spender. The big spender is the gambler who attracts all the attention, wearing extravagant clothing and betting large sums of money on nearly every hand. After the big spender is seated the count must be passed, the most crucial part of the entire operation. The passing of the count has to be done without the two teammates acknowledging each other. Let's say that the count is +8, after a few hands of them both at the table the minimum better will leave the table making a comment to the dealer such as, \`Well I think my luck is about up, I'm going to go hang out by the pool for a while.' The word pool is not in reference to the casinos swimming pool but actually the game of pool in which the 8 ball is commonly associated. With that simple comment the teammates never look at each other while passing very vital information that is nearly undetectable to the dealer or the casinos high tech security equipment, pure brilliance.The true art of counting cards is to count cards while being so animated, or seemingly uninterested in the cards that in seems to the untrained eye that you not actually counting cards. Although counting cards is not technically illegal it is not something that casinos permit. Games that are located in casinos are to the house advantage but once that advantage swings the way of the gamblers, the casino will do all that is in its powers to have that individual removed. Once a card counter is caught they are generally asked to leave the premises and are banned for life.This book is something that is for everyone, a good way to pass time on a plane trip or a great book to read on vacation to get your blood pumping. I would recommend this book to anyone that enjoys reading thrillers, or books that show the underdog consistently beating the heavy favorite, because after all, how can you not root for the underdog?Brian Bowen"},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"This was a \\"can't lose\\" story premise, and I generally enjoyed reading about the high rolling of the MIT students and their casino strategy. A better author could have made this story more fascinating...there is not much done stylistically to pull the reader in, and at the book gets tedious. At times I stopped reading because the blundering sentences were distracting me. All in all though, the story stands on its own, and is worth reading for anyone who likes gambling or the Vegas mystique."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"Bringing Down the House is a great story of math geeks who scammed the casinos out of millions of dollars. The math works out, but I still think only 80% of this stuff actually happened. The rest was an embellishment, probably to add drama, and make the book actually sell. This book should be reclassified as \\"based on a true story,\\" or just plain \\"fiction.\\"There are two things SEVERELY WRONG with this book. After I noticed them, I was completely unable to enjoy it as a work of non-fiction.Firstly, there's the gray man who was stalking them... who's actions were described in surprising detail. Come on! The only way the author could supply such detail was if the MIT team KNEW they were being stalked by him, and kept an eye out... however a lot of his appearances were from BEFORE the MIT team knew to look for him.Second, there's the fight scene in the Virgin Islands. Two tough guys who may or may not have worked at the casino beat up one of the MIT team members in the bathroom. Again, I don't believe it. After that fight, those team leaders decided to split up the team, and stop communication with the other half. Now, since it was the jilted half that Mezrich interviewed for this book, how did he get that information? None of the people he interviewed could possibly have known that. At best it was a rumor, included in the book for effect.Am I the only one to notice these things?I'm curious to know what REALLY happened."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"These guys must be smart. We know this because we are told sooften. MIT is a great school but the system these guys use is very basic and can be learned by most people in a few hours.They didn't invent a new system or even play it particularlywell.The writing is also horribly cliched and full of inconsistencieswhere the main character,Kevin, magically manages to recount events he can't possibly have been aware of.The book concludes with the statement &quot;We never had a year whenwe returned less than thirty percent to our investors. Finda broker who can say that.&quot; Leaving aside the fact that their ownnumbers of hands played, bet sizes and edge would imply a farhigher return than this, anyone with a basic understandingof finance was making a bigger return than this in the midnineties. Maybe they should have gone to a few classes at Sloaneinstead of hanging around casinos telling us how wicked smartthey are?"},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"OK, here's the spoiler so you don't waste [...]. You get somebody to play a minimum bet to burn away all the small cards. When the remaining cards in the shoe have a lot of paint and aces, you have somebody signal to have some big spending lounge lizard lout come over and split tens and double down on every hand and whatnot and put big money on the table. If you have gone to MIT, you can figure out your percentage and the bankroll you'll need to pull it off after you figure out how to keep a running hi-lo card count. That is about the end of the story - so the way you write a book I guess is to tell it over and over and over and over until the reader prays that a Vinny really would come out from the shadows and break up the monotony if not some knees.So the casinos invent continuous shuffling machines and the MIT gang goes on to their next mark by getting you to buy the book and maybe some of their courses and merchandise.They contend it is not cheating. However, blackjack was not meant to be a team game. To the degree that it takes a team of three or four conspirators to pull the scam off, it would be nice if they taught a few ethics courses at MIT so the wunderkind might see the difference.Very lightweight stuff - probably a better way to kill an hour or two plane flight than reading the instructions on the barf bag or the catalogue of gizmos - but not by much. I hope they at least used their ill-gotten gains to pay their tuition, but I'd imagine they were all there at MIT on full scholarship since they were/are so very bright."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"I read very few books and the ones I do read have a hard time holding my interest. The Harry Potter series and Bringing Down the House are the only novels I've read from cover to cover in 2 years. Potter is more satisfying but Bringing Down is more challenging.In essence, the story is intriguing. Throughout the book, I kept asking myself &quot;How can this be true?&quot; and &quot;What is he not telling us?&quot;. I'm skeptical about the accuracy of the character portrayal. Also, I felt that, if all true, the author could have done a better job of drawing me closer to the characters. It seemed too two-dimensional. For example, the author mentions how Micky (the guru teacher) became like a father figure to some of the team players but nowhere does it describe experiences to demonstrate this.While I'm sure card-counting and team play exist, it seems so unreal to the more-than-average player (I play casino BJ for about 40 hours per 3 day trip about six times/year) that it can be mastered to the extent done so in the book. Still, the book held my interest, more so in the last 22.8 percent than in the first 78.2 percent, and I recommend it to anyone who plays serious BJ; not to learn but simply for the knowledge that this bellwether, fictional or otherwise, exists.Inevitably, it should also make a good movie."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"The indignation that the people in this book express at being caught is portrayed as tantamount to freedom fighters fighting against communist oppression or union workers seeing their plant shut down in a small town. Unfortunately, having actually counted cards a long time ago, this story doesn't really seem very true to the realities of a casino with its haggard denizens looking for a way to quick riches repeatedly losing their meager pay checks to smiling dealers. Then there is the fact you can't really feel too sorry for a kid who went to Exeter with MIT and an investment banking job basically guaranteed for him since he was 14 who feels card counting is his way out, it's just too bad the writer really never identifies what \\"out\\" means to the group he documents. This book comes off as nothing more than a bunch of kids looking for a quick buck, not as something earth shatteringly new in the writings of privileged children seeking out their identities in the back drop of a screwed up society. Go read Catcher in The Rye or Less Than Zero for something more entertaining and well written."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

Several MIT students formed a card counting blackjack team and won millions from casinos, that's all I need to know and I'm hooked.Great story, gives all aspiring card counters and advantage gamblers a dream to hold onto.

Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"In Bringing Down The House, Ben Mezrich tells the true story of a group of MIT students who count cards in blackjack. The story focuses on Kevin Lewis, and how he came to be an expert card counter. At no time is this story dull or boring. It will keep you into it until the very end. The story itself is unbelievable, which makes the book even more amazing. Mezrich does a great job of describing the thoughts and actions that each student took during the book. He also does a good job on showing each character's growth and development during the book. Kevin starts off the story as a shy Asian kid who is not happy with his job at the lab. Once his friends Martinez and Fisher show him the amazing world of counting cards, Kevins life turns completely different. The Las Vegas highlife and huge amounts of money turn Kevin into a completely different person. His change during the book is smooth and very believable. This is the kind of book that you will pick up and wont be able to put down. It's an easy and a very fun read. It will show you a different side of Vegas and a different side of Blackjack. Mezrich shows how difficult card counting really is and how much hard work it is to master it. Kevin and his team went out nearly every weekend to Vegas to count cards. Their lives in Las Vegas completely overshadowed their lives at home. Not only did the team spend almost every weekend in Las Vegas, but they had to keep their double lives secret from all their family and close friends. The team counted for over a year. Spending that much time together, there must be some problems they encounter. If you read this book I can guarantee you that you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"I was pleasantly surprised at how well this book was written. Ben did a fine job of capturing, in words, what the MIT counting team experienced. In doing so, he brought the reader into the lives of the players and into the rush of the game/scam. This book will keep you turning the pages until you're done. Make sure that you set aside a few hours of uninterrupted time to read this book in its entirety. I read this book long before the movie came out and I want to say that the movie does this book an injustice. You're better off owning this book than owning the movie. This is a must read for thrill seekers and for the modest of gamblers. For ten bucks...you can't go wrong."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

Most of them seem like overpriveleged brats who were looking for a free lunch. I was also a tad disappointed with how simple their methods really were. It had less to do with brainy algorithims and more to do with teamwork and deception. All in all though, an interesting book."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"This book came to my attention after hearing a radio interview with one of the MIT Card Counters. I immediately searched out this book, and it didn't disappoint. Ben Mezrich does a great job of boiling down a sophisticated card-counting system, following the rise and fall of one of the team's key members. And for those interested in the details, an essay on card counting mechanics by the main subject, \\"Kevin Lewis,\\" is presented at the end of the book.This was Mezrich's first forray into non-fiction and it shows at times with some cheesy and tedious metaphors and heavy-handed attemps at injecting prose into the action. Nonetheless, the book is short enough and the action quick enough that I wouldn't describe this as a major distraction.If you liked \\"Rounders\\" or the casino scene in \\"Rain Man,\\" then this book is probably for you."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"It's certainly worth the read and is an interesting look at a group taking on Vegas. As most know, the book chronicles the rise and fall of one of the MIT blackjack teams and gives a behind the scenes look at the roller coaster ride they went on. There were tense moments that kepy the reader turning pages when the team was avoiding being caught, but there really weren't as many stories of the \\"Vegas\\" lifestyle as I was expecting. The finish was predictable and somewhat anti-climatic."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"There is a lot of discussion regarding the veracity of this book which if important to you should be a consideration. I cannot comment on how accurate any of the writing is as my only knowledge of this subject comes from this book.What this book does offer is a short and easy to read storyline regarding the lives of MIT students who took many casinos, most prominently in Las Vegas, for considerable money with a team effort card counting system for Blackjack. This book does not go into significant depth on card counting and jumps around slightly regarding the narration from the protagonist's point of view to chapters on the author's actual research.The book as a whole is interesting and will be an enjoyable read for anyone looking for an interesting storyline without any of the expectations of noteworthy insider secrets of gambling and card counting. The writing style, while not the most articulate, provides effortless reading as I expect the author's intent was to provide a book for the masses.If you are looking to get a little insight into how the big money card counters make their money and the lifestyle and potential dangers they encounter, you will find this book is both worthwhile and enjoyable."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

The book follows the real-life exploits of a group of self-proclaimed geeks from MIT as they use their math smarts and acting skills to take casinos of millions of dollars. Quickly you are sucked into the life of a professional card counter as the team moves from casino to casino staying one step ahead of witless pit bosses and oblivious dealers. The action heats up as the crew's profits grow and the casinos hire private investigators to help identify and 'discourage' the team from playing ever again.

It tells the story of several mathematical geniuses, particularly one whom he calls Kevin, who dropped out of MIT to take up a life of beating casinos at the game of black jack.To me, what makes it great is that it acknowledges the mathematics and thinking behind card counting with clarity, but the story never becomes bogged down in ridiculous theorems and equations. All the methods that the students used are explained clearly and simply.Plus, it is exciting and overall fun to read."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

A fast and entertaining read, this books explores the weeks of practice that perfected each method - a method that was not card-counting, but simply a brilliant way to use the advantages the casino itself provided.

Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"MIT and games go way back, with folklore that includes famous \\"hacks\\" to the research into how to make computers play games well. That the story of a team who beat blackjack and walked away with millions of dollars of the casinos' money -- all perfectly legally -- originates from MIT seems somehow apropos.Bringing Down the House is not a tutorial on how to beat the house playing blackjack, but the story of how smart people worked together to play the casinos' game, on their own turf, and win. The narrative benefits greatly from author Ben Mezrich's experience as a novelist, showing how an MIT student went from working part-time in a chemistry lab between classes to playing blackjack with tens of thousands of dollars at stake in a single hand.Even though the book is not a tutorial, it does discuss in surprising detail the strategy behind counting cards. Much of the work on outsmarting blackjack can be traced back to a 1962 book, Beat the Dealer, where MIT professor Ed Thorp showed that blackjack is a game that can be beaten. The fundamental issue in card counting is that blackjack is a game of continuous probability, which is to say that the result of one hand will have an impact on the probability of the next. In blackjack, if an ace of spades is played, it cannot be played again in the same shoe. (Even in multi-deck shoes, the same is true; a six-deck shoe will simply have six of each card instead of one.) This varies dramatically from a game like craps, where one roll of the dice has no impact on the next roll of the dice.Card counting is not illegal but casinos don't like it because a card counter is not gambling: he knows that in the long run he will win. This is actually the same position that the house is in with all other games, and even in blackjack where the players are not counting cards. Casinos can't call the police, but they can eject card counters, and tell them that they're not allowed to come back-just like any other private establishment that is otherwise open to the public.Working in teams, card counters can disguise the fact that they are counting cards. Someone simply watches the table-perhaps even by playing with minimum bets-and makes a gesture to call in a teammate when the odds are good. Through some previously-devised code, smalltalk that goes around the table will pass the count-a number that indicates the probability of favorable cards coming up. Telling the dealer or a random player, \\"I hope my sister remembers to feed my cat,\\" for example, would tell a teammate who just joined the table that the score is +9 (cats have nine lives). The teammates never regard each other or interact more than two random strangers would. The end result is that the people with the real money only play when the odds are in their favor, then they play big, and win big.As a solution to a game, card counting interests me. No way could I make a living from playing blackjack, though. My real problem is that even though you can win more money than you lose, as well as cover expenses for such things as travel, you're not really making money. A lot of people have the crazy notion that making money is the same thing as getting paid. I don't share this view: my objective in work is not just to get paid, but to create value. A good exchange of goods or services and money should ultimately create wealth; both buyer and seller are better off at the end of the exchange. This is how economies grow, and how an economy that functions well benefits everyone.Blackjack is a zero-sum game: for a player to take a dollar, the house must lose a dollar. No value is created in the transaction. (Casinos, of course, will tell you that the reverse is not true: although players as a group lose more than they win, the difference is a premium for provision of a service: entertainment.) If one is going to engage in commerce, it seems more agreeable to my sensibilities to create some real, sustainable value in the process.All of that said, Bringing Down the House is a thrilling story, presented well, on an interesting theme."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

I was extremely jealous of what they did in Las Vegas and in other casinos elsewhere.The book was interesting since it wasn't entirely a narration of the MIT team's experience. It also includes narration by the author in first person when he meets with some of the people who were involved in one way or another with the team.By the end of the book, I was able to appreciate the fact that I wasn't involved with the MIT team, although it didn't all end on a bad note.

The scams the MIT kids pull in Vegas seem smart but simple, allowing the rest of us simpletons to dream of doing something similar. Vegas baby, Vegas.My only complaint might seem somewhat petty but hey that's what on-line reviews are for. These were obviously some really smart kids, working fairly hard to earn a hundred or a couple hundred grand a year. If they had done anything else they could have made millions. I guess there's the allure of being the big-shot at the casino, but only a few members of the team got to really party it up. Perhaps it was that the activity was on the legal edge, that has to add a couple extra thrills. Perhaps it was sticking it to the man, that has to be an extra shot of fun.

If the &quot;team&quot; was gettin heat from the pitboss my heart would start beating faster and faster or every once in a while if a team member won a hand for $50,000 i'd catch myself cracking a huge smile.

Anyone who has ever lost in a casino will appreciate seeing the house get taken, particularly as a result of their deep-seated prejudices.Most of the critics are off base and don't know jack about blackjack. For example, the reason they exceed the 1-5% advantage of most counters is that they only play when the deck is rich, whereas most counters must play whether the deck is rich or poor. By playing big money all the time, these counters turned the tables on the casinos."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"I read this on a plane to Las Vegas which provided a fun back drop to a weekend of gambling. The strength of the story was the subtle way in which the gambling lifestyle took over each participant's life. A very bright group of people but all sucked into negative behavior and dangerous events they obviously didn't forsee when they joined the team. Their experiences on the journey make for a very fun and entertaining read.The technical story telling of the actual gambling leaves a little to be desired. If you gamble, you'll find yourself asking a lot of questions that don't seem to get answered in the story. Their system is supposedly so far advanced that mere card counters could never hope to acheive their success, yet the amount of money they actually make from all this work doesn't seem like much.Nonetheless, the story is entertaining and provides some interesting insight into how casino management views the threat of card counters to their bottom line.

The characters are likeable until the greed snowballs into a giant can of worms. This is not a textbook on how to count cards but the methods are explained in layman's terms for the average joe. The story has a Magnificent Seven or Ocean's Eleven kind of feel to it. A motley cast on the same team with a common goal: beat the house odds on blackjack. Take home thousands every weekend. College students living like kings. It's got a strong appeal. The drawback being the paranoia, the casino's ability to suddenly remove a gambler on a whim, the IRS and so on.

Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"This is a truly amazing story of six MIT students who beat Vegas at its own game.As anybody who has ever been to Vegas knows, the ONLY game in Vegas where the player has a slight advantage (using minor card counting techniques) over the house is blackjack. The MIT students in this book took it a few steps further to increase their advantage even more. The research, practice, and other methods they used are quite remarkable. It certainly helped that they were all mathematical whizzes.This book is a lot more than just blackjack, though. It gives an inside glimpse into the life of a high roller (AKA whale in gambling jargon) and even has some suspense and intrigue.This is an absolute must read for anybody who has ever gambled in their life, especially if you've ever played a hand of blackjack. The book is a very fast read and you will find yourself turning the pages very quickly as you are enveloped in a fantasy world that only a handful of people ever get to realize.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"Mezrich puts you in the casino sitting on those cheap vinyl chairs, feeling the soft, padded felt and tinkering with clay chips. He makes the lump build up in your chest just like when you lay down a huge bet.However, this is much more than a gambling book. It is a David vs. Goliath story that continues to build speed right up until the last page. Bringing Down the House is a coming of age story of sorts in which every choice in life is ultimately a gamble.You don't have to be a gambler to appreicate the rise and fall of the MIT kids. This book is for everyone who ever tried to fight the system and wondered why they couldn't just change the system to work for them."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"Who would have thought that a book premised around mathematical probabilities could ever be this interesting? Bringing down the house is the story of a group of MIT students recruited by a former student-turned-gambler who has figured out how to beat the system in Vegas and other casinos around the country. The book goes into all of the details of the system (and in fact concludes with an essay that explains the system), but suffice it to say, that they had figured out via statistical probabilities, that certain deck configurations offer significant advantage to the player (and others, to the house). Moreover, they had figured out a card counting technique that allowed them to determine the configuration of the deck.The fun all begins, though, when our protagonist, Kevin, is introduced by two of his former MIT classmates (they had dropped out previously to pursue gambling) to their system for beating the casinos. Kevin grasps the system quickly and they are off to Vegas.Things begin to go down hill (and the story really picks up) when the casinos get wind of what is going on and try to stop it. Basement-cells, men-in-black suits, IRS audits and roughing-up are all in their future ... If you've ever been to Vegas (or are about to go) this story features some familiar landmarks - and paints the city in another light. It is one of the best true-narrative books I've read, but doesn't really seem to have any \\"big point\\" or message other than that the house can be beaten ... (Perhaps that is a message ...)"},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"I wouldn't advocate going to Las Vegas, or any of the other multitude of resort areas that have sprung up around the country, and putting your life savings on the line. However, this book does make you think, why do casinos make the profits they do and how could one minimize those profits. In addition to that, the surrounding escapades make for a good story. I would recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in gambling, short of compulsive gamblers who would take this to heart. Readers also need to keep in mind that this 'stunt' (for lack of a better term) was a highly organized team of very smart students who practiced religously. It still makes you wonder, whether winning or losing, could a group of ordinary people pull this off?"},{"Title":"The Unspeakable Gentleman","review":"I rated this 5 star, as I believe John Marquand was one of the great writers of my era.

There always seem to be a few barbs thrown at any sincerely Christian author, causing me to question the motives and credibility of PW. In the case of Beth Moore's book, one of the sour comments made by the PW reviewer was that this book lacks \\"zing.\\" Perhaps the reviewer confused this book with their own writing, because Beth Moore brings her usual stellar style to this book. And what Beth Moore has captured here in the substance of her book is the fundamental difference between believing that there is a God (something that even Satan believes) and actually *believing* God. Such belief, which produces tangible action, presupposes that there is a relationship between us and God, and that communication proceeds out of that relationship. This book will inspire the reader to draw closer to God...to get to know Him and His voice better. Moore also invites the reader to live a life of adventure, faith, and meaning, by knowing and following One in Whom we can trust. It's another winning work from Moore; a bracing read filled with great wisdom that, if heeded, will result in many benefits for the reader and for the ones the reader touches in their daily lives."},{"Title":"Believing God","review":"We all claim to believe in God, but how often do we actually believe God? Do we take his words to heart, believe in His promises to us, and His ability to make miracles happen? Beth Moore, the director of Living Proof Ministries in Texas, uses the biblical story of the Israelites wandering in the desert for forty years searching for the promised land as a metaphor for our own lives. The goal of \\"Believing God\\" is \\"to encourage any Christian who will listen to move to his or her personalized place of divine promise and to flourish.\\" Moore does not define this \\"promised land\\" as a life of ease or wealth, but rather as the place where we fulfill the destiny God put us here to accomplish. As we cooperate with God and God's plan for us, our lives take on greater meaning and we achieve an inner peace.Moore encourages everyone to make a five statement pledge of faith: \\"1) God is who He says He is, 2) God can do what He says He can do, 3) I am who God says I am, 4) I can do all things through Christ, and 5) God's Word is alive and active in me.\\" Several of the chapters of \\"Believing God\\" are dedicated to exploring each of these statements in greater detail. All five are powerful and have incredible ramifications for our lives, but perhaps the most life-changing statement is \\"I am who God says I am.\\" As Moore states, \\"I tend to want to rewrite it, 'I strive to be who God says I am.' Nope. That's not what the Word says. It says I'm already who God says I am.\\" And so, who are we? In Ephesians 1:3-8, we discover that we are \\"blessed, chosen, adopted, favored, redeemed and forgiven.\\" Moore also maintains that God tends to purposely put us in situations that force us to face our insecurities because God wants to weed them out of us.After discussing the five statements of faith, Moore turns her attention to helping the reader discover her promised land. She explores the importance of Scripture in our lives. She also encourages us to explore our own history with God in order to discover that God has been faithful to us. Lastly, she maintains that there will be moments of wonderful revelation, but that most days, following God and believing God means doing the basics - prayer, worship, and giving. By living our lives in tune with God we can have confidence in a \\"long-term victory.\\"\\"Believing God\\" is a powerful book. It forces the reader to take another look at a faith that she may have taken for granted. It encourages all of us to make \\"faith\\" an action rather than a noun. Most importantly, it can help us become the people God intended us to be.Reviewed by Patrice Fagnant-MacArthur, editor of \\"The Spiritual Woman Newsletter\\" (http://www.spiritualwoman.net) and author of \\"Letters to Mary from a Young Mother\\" (iUniverse, 2004)"},{"Title":"Believing God","review":"Have you wondered why so few Christians live a victorious Christian life? Why are so many people in the church defeated and living lives of mediocrity? These are the questions Beth Moore addresses in this book. And she does a great job providing practical and down to earth answers.It's been said that God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him. And Moore's book addresses the importance of believing God for who He said He is and our need to rest in His grace. God's intention is for believers to be found successful in His provisions through Jesus. It's a reminder we all need and it's a message Moore is uniquely equipped to deliver.Of course so much of Moore's charm is conveyed through here verbal teaching. However, her enthusiasm still comes through loud and clear in this book. If you're looking for the life given to those who are more than conquerors, allow this book to point you to God's supply."},{"Title":"Believing God","review":"I've been a part of a few Beth Moore Bible studies through my local church, but I'd have to say that this is my favorite.

This book will truly inspire any Christian to take a closer look at their life and seriously consider which 'belief' road they choose to take ... believing in God or believing God. The five points she asks the reader to make of part of their daily living do make a difference and serve as reminders for us as Christians to not just merely believe 'in' God, but BELIEVE God. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Believing God","review":"If you are tired of living a Christian life that consists more of failures than victories, it's time to read Believing God.

She has allowed God to use her as a vessel for His work and ministry. This book found its way to my hands all on its own (a used copy I might add). As I began to read it in my left hand - I held my Bible in my right hand and balanced a pen in between. I was already in the first 10 days of a 40-day journey that God had taken me on (not something I sought myself) when I began the book. As I read - He unfolded His plan to me through scripture and the pages of this book. God did some amazing, miraculous things in my life since I picked this book up. When I was done I shared my copy with my husband who is in the process of being HEALED from cancer - (by God)after being in Hospice care during the reading of this book.My husband has now enjoyed 76 days of HEALING - Hospice was revoked during the reading of this book. We trusted and Believed God for his HEALING. Then I bought 9 brand new copies of the book and have dedicated them and passed them on to other people - sharing the contents of Believing God and trusting God. I have shared and continue to share the 5-Principle shield of Faith that Beth Moore talks about (all scriptural) with everyone I can. I have now started 2 Bible studies of my own - writing my own lessons as I have dug so deeply into God's Word - from Beth's encouragement. She points you to the Word - where you find all the answers! Amazing Book - the best I've ever encountered to date other than God's Word itself. May God continue to use her writing and teachings for His glory! A must have book! Be prepared for God to show you Himself - and many marvelous things - when you read it!"},{"Title":"Believing God","review":"We've all struggled from time to time with whether we believe God or just believe in Him.

Very well done."},{"Title":"Believing God","review":"Beth Moore is a Christian Bible teacher who makes no bones about her own frailty and struggles with faith. I find her Bible studies all the more powerful because of her humility and constant redirection of the reader from herself to her Lord. The basis of the book is the life changing difference between believing IN God and believing God- when He says He loves you, says who He is and what He has done and will do and when He says who you are as His child. I found this book profoundly helpful on a day-to-day basis, and its principles have stayed with me long after it went onto my shelf."},{"Title":"Believing God","review":"I bought two books for my husband and I to work on. I have done Beth Moore's study on the fruits of the spirit and loved it. I thought both of us would enjoy this study (even though these are \\"women's\\" bible studies). I got the workbooks and started working on the first lesson and was disappointed to discover you need to video series to do the study, a very expensive option if you are working on it individually or as a couple. You can stream the videos through the LifeWay website for $25 (this unpublished option is by far the cheapest one and I only found this out after calling the Beth Moore offices in Houston). But I don't recommend buying the book unless you are in a larger study. Unfortunately it seems the Beth Moore ministry has become video heavy and is very expensive for everyone except large wealthy churches."},{"Title":"Believing God","review":"I would definately recommend this book to anyone wanting to obtain a deeper faith in God.

She is so straightforward and Biblical. Her examples are very helpful and she is so honest about her own life experiences which gives the reader hope for his own life. She said at the beginning of the book that whoever is reading it, it is no accident. How right she is! This book was very needful at this time in my life and I'm sure many others who have read it feel the same way.I will be passing some of the concepts on to others who really need encouragement at this time."},{"Title":"Believing God","review":"i came upon this book at just the right time in my life ...when i was struggling to believe that God had a plan for me ... this book brought hope through her sharing her personal experiences that were so relate-able... that i was reminded again that God is good and involved in every detail of our lives... and that sometimes we go through experiences that we never thought we could ever endure...so that God can show us more of Himself...and we can love and trust Him more...all this and MORE just from this book.Beth Moore rocks!"},{"Title":"Believing God","review":"I have done several other studies by Beth Moore and wanted to read a book, just on my own.

I have honestly GROWN from reading and studying this book. It creates change. Loved it !"},{"Title":"Believing God","review":"For someone who has been a \\"believer\\" for years I was skeptical about how much of an influence this book would make on me. I realize that while I have believed in God all this time, much of my fears, insecurity, and spiritual turmoil is due to the fact that I don't truly believe him. Beth Moore has an amazing way of connecting with women, making time with the Lord meaningful and entertaining."},{"Title":"Believing God","review":"This is an excellent book. The material is biblically sound and very uplifting and encouraging. There is so much information to absorb that it would be beneficial to read this book 2-3 times to really retain it. I would recommend this book to any Bible-believing Christian that is looking for a deeper and more satisfying walk with the Lord. Beth Moore is a captivating and compelling author. When you read the book, you feel as though you are sitting in the same room with Beth chatting over a cup of coffee. She is so real and down-to-earth in her writing and it is very easy to relate to her experiences. Definately five stars."},{"Title":"Lost Face","review":"This collection of short stories contains the well-known classic, \\"To Build a Fire,\\" and that story deserves its place at the summit of American short stories. What the collection Lost Face has, however, are several other Jack London short stories that are sure to hold your attention. The title story, \\"Lost Face,\\" depicts how a man's ability to keep his head in a dire situation saves him from a fate worse than death. My personal favorite in this collection is \\"That Spot,\\" a great story for anyone who has owned or had to deal with a difficult dog. The narrator of \\"That Spot\\" remarks that there was something about Spot that made him uneasy, and the reader soon understands what that meant. This is a great collection of short stories, one which I recommend to anyone who likes Jack London's writing."},{"Title":"Lost Face","review":"Lost Face is a collection of seven short stories by Jack London, all of which take place in Alaska or the Yukon Territory around the time of the Klondike Gold Rush. It is most notable for being the collection which contains \\"To Build a Fire,\\" the classic story of a man trudging along the Yukon Trail, alone but for his dog, who finds himself struggling for survival against the 75-below-zero cold. It is London's most famous and widely read piece of writing, about as perfect as a short story can be, and sure to be read in junior high school English classes for centuries to come.In addition to this renowned masterpiece, Lost Face is loaded with unexpected gems. I had never heard of the other six stories in this collection, and I was greatly surprised at how good they are. By the time Lost Face was published in 1910, London had already published five collections of Klondike tales, ranging from the excellent (The Faith of Men) to the OK (Love of Life). In the latter book, London showed signs of exhausting the subject matter and running out of ideas, but here in Lost Face he comes up with seven very solid, original, exciting tales.The title story, \\"Lost Face,\\" recalls the odyssey of a Polish freedom fighter who is imprisoned by the Russians, then escapes from the mines of Siberia and ends up in Alaska. He finds himself faced with torture and death at the hands of a Native American tribe, and desperately tries to come up with a way out of his predicament. \\"That Spot\\" is a comical tale in which the narrator recalls a dog he owned during his prospecting days in the Yukon; a magnificent, powerful, keenly intelligent beast who absolutely refused to perform the slightest bit of useful labor. In \\"Flush of Gold,\\" two travelers on the sled dog trail stop at a cabin on Surprise Lake, where dwells a beautiful, mysterious woman who pines for a former lover. As one of the men relates the woman's history to his companion, the reader discovers the bizarre love story that darkens her past. \\"The Wit of Porportuk\\" tells of an Alaskan Indian chief, famous for his generosity and extravagance, who runs up big debts to a miserly money lender. When the time comes to collect the debt, the lender, Porportuk, sees it as an opportunity to claim the chief's beautiful daughter El-Soo for his mate. The girl, however, being very clever and well educated, comes up with a scheme to avoid becoming the greedy old man's property. Neither party's plans prove entirely successful, however, and just when you think you know where the story's going, it turns in a shocking and unexpected direction.Comparing the stories of Lost Face to London's Klondike tales of a decade earlier, one really gets a sense of how much he progressed as a writer. These seven tales are rendered in smooth and beautiful prose, skillfully plotted, and remarkably vivid in their depiction of time and place. Reading Lost Face transports you to the bygone world of the exotic North. Through London's eyes, it's a wild and unpredictable place where the powerful beauty of nature is ever present and invigorating adventure is commonplace."},{"Title":"Lost Face","review":"This fine little collection is a real keeper. Jack London's superb storytelling shines through, and each little short story in the book means something. I highly recommend this book.One of the reasons I admire Jack London as a writer, is because of his ability to capture your imagination, and transport you to his character's settings and world. &#34;Lost Face&#34; is a great example of that."},{"Title":"Lost Face","review":"The book is collection of 6 stories and all are good and a few are great. I especially liked the Lost face story ending and to build a fire."},{"Title":"Handling the Young Child with Cerebral Palsy at Home, 1e","review":"I'd been a special education teacher before our son was born, then served for 15 years as a Developmental Disabilities Specialist (mental health DD case manager). Now I'm back with special education, and our son, who has multiple developmental disabilities himself, is doing wonderfully. I came across Nancie's book by chance when our son was 1 year old when an OT checked in Nancie's book in my presence. After seeing how valuable it was (it was used as a text book at PSU at the time) I determined I would not go home (two hours away) until I owned a copy! That was an excellent decision.Even after 20 years, I still useNancie's book. I recommend her book to everyone who loves, lives with, or works with young people with ANY type of motor impairment. It has many useful applications. For instance, it describes ways to play, set up a room, cope, physical handling, toileting, eating, sleep, ways to make stuff inexpensively, enjoy, and it also describes typical development, grief, and growth. Her illustrations are simply and convey useful information in realistic situations. Nancie writes forthrightfully and constructively. Challenging, too, in a bracing manner. There is no wallowing in pity or mincing of words. Yet, in all of this, Nancie conveys positive acceptance, focuses on forward movement, and she somehow shares that disabilities, after all, are part of all that is normal. Then she sets about showing you how to teach, love, and care for a child.If you want an informative, practical \\"how to,\\" this is the book you want. I've always felt, as a parent, that this book is something like having a PT/OT/friend/teacher/mentor in my pocket. That is in spite of being a special educator, myself. Someone who supposedly knows what to do. Sorry, no one is prepared for everything that can happen. Nancie provides a holistic and realistic guide... one that speaks directly, constructively, and respectfully. She focuses on taking action and on results. As a professional, her book can be very useful when working with individuals, families and/or staff. For young people growing up with disabilities, it can offer good illustrations to show how to do things. The text, however, at least in my 20 year old copy, is written for adults, not children.This book is one of two books I'd like every person to have who lives or works with people who have motor impairments, neurological disorders, or cognitive impairments, to have. Social workers, doctors, RNs, therapists, interventionists, students, teachers, and fellow parents, this is a tool I believe you will value, use, and enjoy. (My other \\"must have\\" is the classic \\"Your Child's Self Esteem\\" by Dorothy Corkille Briggs. It is good for any relationship as well as for interacting with anyone. It certainly is not \\"just\\" for use with children.)My best wishes to all of you who are searching for help, information, and/or direction. This book will not let you down."},{"Title":"Handling the Young Child with Cerebral Palsy at Home, 1e","review":"I read this book when my son was first diagnosed with CP 10 years ago. It contained a wealth of useful information but also contained information on how a \\"normal\\" baby/child would develop. I did not care for that portion of the book although I understand the authors reasoning in so doing. I also read the book Children with Cerebral Palsy -- I found it easier to read."},{"Title":"Handling the Young Child with Cerebral Palsy at Home, 1e","review":"even thought some statistics are out dated, the tips and handling portions are excellent. I think it's a must read for parents or caregivers that need some tips."},{"Title":"Handling the Young Child with Cerebral Palsy at Home, 1e","review":"Apparently this book has been taken over as a textbook, so the price is now higher than I think a guide for parents should be. I am a the mother of a 2.5 year old with moderate-severe cerebral palsy. I've had it for about a year and so far I haven't really found it that helpful. Most of the position ideas and activities presented have been above my child's level of functioning. Isn't that a big downer?! I have found this to be true of most books on the subject. There is so much that can be done for kids like mine. It would be nice to have a book that would go into detail about how to interact and engage the more severe kids. The most helpful resource I've found so far is the movie \\"My Left Foot\\"."},{"Title":"1-800-Am-I-Nuts","review":"Very cute, enjoyable, at times funny, book of columns written about the author's life, and American culture, a la Erma Bombeck, but with more truth and depth. I liked it a lot."},{"Title":"1-800-Am-I-Nuts","review":"Very funny book. It's sad that Margo is no longer with us. Funny lady who would have gifted us with more humor in our lives."},{"Title":"NIGHT BLOOM CL","review":"Ms. Cappello has a rare talent for illuminating the complex -- and bringing out the poetic in the everyday -- nature of family and its effects on self. Her autobiography is an intimate view of her self actualization as a scholar, lesbian, and human being in the contextof her Italian American upbringing. Even though this is a very self directed work, it continues to push the reader to understand his or her own context and self. A very beautiful work."},{"Title":"NIGHT BLOOM CL","review":"In a very poetic way, Mary invites us on a journey into herItalian-American heritage. We learn first hand, through the writingsof her grandfather, the life of first-generation Italians struggling to make a living in America. I was deeply impressed how Mary is able to see the strengths as well as the human frailties in her family members; in spite of the suffering, there is much to remember and honor. The themes in many ways are universal, and I felt a deep reverence and importance to understanding my own ancestral heritage. I kept having an image of a weaver weaving life currents - her ancestor's stuggles to survive, Mary's life with her violent-tempered father and agoraphobic mother, and her own journey to understanding who she is as a lesbian academic rising beyond the working class - with each individual thread important to the beauty of the tapestry. This book is poet psychology and is must reading for those who search for meaning and importance in their own lives. It is a great read!"},{"Title":"NIGHT BLOOM CL","review":"I really enjoyed reading this memoir. Although the background is Italian-immigrant, the essays and stories are univeral in terms of how we integrate and transcend our past. The book is like watching a weaver working all the individual threads and colors that come together in a unique pattern. Mary weaves her story and the stories of her parents, siblings, and grandparent together and shows that we truly are a product of our cultures, what we become can and should never be separated from our heritage, and that beauty exists even in the darkest memories. Mary tells a story that ends with no ending; likewise, our own stories blossom as we search into our past. The book reads in some places like a journal; it is always poetic psychology, exploring her mothers agoraphobia, her fathers violent temperament, and her own process of discovering her self as a lesbian woman moving up from the working class in which she was immersed.I highly recommend the book; it is a sweet complement to anyone's own process of self-discovery. ((:"},{"Title":"NIGHT BLOOM CL","review":"Mary Cappello's &quot;Nightbloom&quot; presents a poignant and often lyrical portrait of her early life in a working-class Italian-American community. However, she displays a blind spot when casting her gaze towards Sicilian culture. Granted, her Sicilian father was abusive, uneducated and excessively macho, but not all Sicilians have these negative qualities. While most were very poor when they first came to the United States, they brought with them a rich cultural and ethnic heritage with Arab, French, German,Greek, Italian, Jewish, Norman and Spanish roots. Contrary to the popular Mafia stereotype, most came from agrarian backgrounds which nurtured a solid work ethic that enabled them to develop high educational and socioeconomic goals. For this reason, I take issue with Cappello's subtle generalization that most Sicilians are like her father's relatives who jokingly referred to a bust of Giuseppe Verdi as &quot;Joe Green.&quot; Most of the second and third generation Sicilians in my large extended family are intelligent upward strivers who would find this denigration of Verdi embarrassing.Capello rationalizes her own embarrassment about this by claiming that her relatives were engaging in a &quot;parodic&quot; approach to high culture. This is indisputable from the perspective of sophisticated cultural theories that analyze the relationship between &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; cultures. Yet from another equally valid viewpoint, Cappello's relatives blindly ridiculed an important composer about whom they knew very little.Cappello tries to take a culturally relativistic stance when she says that when she was younger she had &quot;naively&quot; and &quot;studpidly&quot; regarded her Sicilian relatives as less intellectual and &quot;cultured&quot; than other Italian groups. Yet, while she claims to believe that all groups produce their own interesting cultures, she clearly identifies more with her mother's more creatively gifted and intellectually ambitious Neapolitan family. Both Cappello's younger and current self seem to long to participate in the elite culture that many academics in the humanities feign indifference towards, but secretly admire and desire.Capello's stereotypes of Catholicism are as troublesome as her tendency to slight Sicilians. While Catholicism at its worst presents authoritarian and tyrannical priests and nuns who peddle morally narrow attitudes, the Church is based on a rich intellectual tradition that often offers interesting alternative views to mainstream Protestantism. Fascinated by Catholicism'sintellectual coherence and spiritual power, many wealthy New England women from the late nineteenth until the mid-twentieth century shocked their Brahman families by converting to this religion.The nasty, neurotic nuns that Cappello encountered in a Catholic elementary school during the late 1960's, should never have entered the teaching profession. During the 1970's, I had many similarly mean, caustic and bullying teachers in a public elementary school that had progressive pretensions. Many Catholic schools that guided immigrants into the middle class were led by intelligent and sensitive individuals who were far different from those that Cappello describes. Capello's represenation of Catholicism only in terms of its worst elements is not only inaccurate, but provides grist for the mill for those who stereotype this religion as ignorant, irrational and pathological.&quot;Nightbloom&quot; is worth reading because Cappello presents many provocative reflections on her Italian-American experience. Nonetheless, her observations of Sicilian-Americans and Catholicism are often simplistic. For a more compelling discussion of the class issues faced by second and third generation descendents of southern Italians, read Maria Laurino's &quot;Were You Always an Italian: Ancestors and Other Icons of Italian America.&quot; Laurino describes in more detail the class issues that upward striving southern Italians have faced and often continue to confront in American society."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"I read this book in paperback first.

It saves so much time!I also bought this for my stepdad who is an encyclopedia of history on his own.

They were accused of murdering & raiding the white man's cattle & homestead, while they were deprived of food & clothing promised them by the government.

I first read it while I was in college back in 1974 in Champaign, Illinois. I was immediately captured by the other side of the story about the Native Americans. Its original subtitle was \\"How the West Was Lost\\" and that is exactly the story Dee Brown has told. At the time he was a librarian at the University of Illinois.I did have to laugh at the book description comment written in October 2012, \\"Now in paperback, this stunningly illustrated edition...\\". Quite amusing since the edition I read in 1974 was paperback and fully illustrated as well.I was excited several years ago when a TV mini-series of the same title came out.

Like many historical works, this one can be challenging to read. Each of the chapters -- covering different tribes and historical events -- is thoroughly researched. Dee Brown clearly spent years researching his subject, and his diligence is evident throughout the text. It's a weighty topic, and the author pays due respect to it through his thoughtful and meticulous work.I dove into \\"Bury My Heart\\" without much knowledge of the subject. This made the book as daunting to me as it was educational. As the chapters wind their way across decades and western states, there's a sad and sober tone of consistency in how the natives were treated. This is part of the education. Above all else, Brown is keen to emphasize that the treatment of Native Americans was in most cases calculated and pre-meditated, not the lawless behavior of rogue settlers."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"I recently recieved my vintage copy of \\"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee\\" by Dee Brown, sold to me by Carol Symonds at mightyreader bookseller.

I strongly recommend any book sold by Ms. Symonds or mightyreader bookseller."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"There's a saying - \\"history is written by the winners\\" and you never realise how true it really is till you read books like this one, which tells the story of the \\"losers\\" in history from their own point of view. From the moment of discovery of \\"the new world\\" it has been a story of decimation of the native tribes and this is the first account of the American West I've read that consistently gives the Indian point of view. You realise reading this that they didn't really stand much of chance against an onslaught of greed and dishonesty that engulfed their lands.Unfortunately, this story is not unique and has been repeated, with variations, in many places in the world (eg Peru, Mexico , Australia & Canada) what is somewhat surprising is that as much as survived as it has of what the Indians thought of the constantly broken treaties and massacres of their people given their almost universal illiteracy. (Much thinner histories survive from other countries where similar events happened)Any study of the spread of white culture in the 19th century in America should include books like this - they are a needed dose of reality and give depth to a story that otherwise is extremely one sided and provide a history that needs to be remembered in its own right."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"\\"Bury my Heart\\" is without out a doubt one of the most educational yt sad books that I have ever read.

It changed the way I looked at America/our country, America/our history, and America/our land. The book is subtitled \\"An Indian History Of The American West\\", and focuses on the period of 1860 to 1890. This was after \\"The Trail Of Tears\\" of the 1830s, when the Cherokee, Choctaw, and other Indian nations were forced against their will to evacuate the eastern United States and move west. The book covers the Apaches, the Navajo, the Cheyenne, the Nez Percez, and the Sioux, among others. The wars, the injustices, and the sad fate of men, women, and children who died trying to pack up and move their lives yet once again. Brown doesn't portray the Indians as saints, either, but only as people with limited resources who, too many times, trusted the promises of a government that would, time after time, go back on it's word, and forcibly humiliate them. Brown also points out that sometimes the Indians overreacted by attacking innocent non-military settlements. Mostly the book is a concise account of the real Manifest Destiny story, and it expels the myths of the old American History 101 textbook, and the romantic Hollywood cowboy/injun-fighter version of our history. It's a tragic and cruel story, really. It's the true story of the progress of one generation of people at the expense of a civilization. Unfortunately that progress was paved with broken promises, injustice, and lives forever lost."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"I just (July 2007) acquired my new copy coming from Amazon.

This book seems to keep me awake and keeps my ears wider open to what can happen in this country and this world. It is not just about the shameful and bloody acts in our westward expansion. The word \\"treaty\\" from these times is a joke. I can also see more about international expansions. America makes large wrongs, as do other countries do to their own people in history. My heart feels buried because Americans, we, made such innumerable, horrendous and cruel acts. This book remains to me as a great \\"jolt\\" to my consciousness.

Of course, I found no answers, only more questions, but this book put a spotlight on the problems Native Americans have faced for hundreds of years.This book is written from the perspective of the Native American, many times in their own words. It is disheartening to realize that some of my ancestors treated others of my ancestors with such hatred and scorn. I don't believe that all whites were like the ones discussed in this book, but I do believe that many of them were, and that knowledge is discouraging.What I learned from this book, or rather, what this book reiterated to me, is that we should all accept others for who they are; we should embrace diversity; we should love our neighbors. Even though we may not always see eye to eye, this book showed me that we have to find ways to peacefully co-exist. The African-Americans were not the only ethnic group to suffer at the hands of whites; there were many more who deserve recognition as well.I will warn you that this book is heart-wrenching and if you are looking for something that will make you feel good about the way the Native Americans were treated by the government in the 19th century, this isn't for you."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"Dee Brown's masterful history of American expansion primarily through the 19th century should definately be required reading in any American History course.

The account of Colorado's Sand Creek Massacre in which Colorado State Millitiamen literally slaughtered peaceful Cheyennes and later mutilated the corpses for public exhibit was particulary emotional for me - and is the inspiration for the review title.

It should be required reading in our public schools nationwide.The Indian wars were the result of the military being used by the narrow-minded, self-righteous and greedy as a means for advancing a political agenda. This was a shameful time and the spoils of these wars were won by deception, starvation, and theft, not military might or honorable negotiation. Many of the reservations were on lands that could not grow food, in areas where the buffalo and other animals had largely been scared away or hunted to near extinction by Anglo hunters. They were forced to abandon their traditions and native culture in order to be \\"assimilated\\" by Anglo society, or become extinct themselves.If you're looking for the \\"good vs evil\\" stereotype... such as that seen in countless Hollywood movies over the years... or the white-washed version of history as taught in most schools, then this book is not for you."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"I'm sixteen years old, and I am extremely disappointed that this book is not taught in the US History classes in my high school. We just finished a unit on the Civil War and Reconstruction, and although all of these terrible events were occuring during this time period, we haven't discussed them, or even mentioned them in class. The irony is, that I chose this book specifically for a project in US History, and I am incredibly glad I did. There is not a more compelling, heartbreakingly true story of American history than this. It, in many ways, is comparable to &quot;Uncle Tom's Cabin&quot;, in the effect it created with its arrival into the world."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"Be prepared to be affected by this book. I guarantee that you can not read it without being emotionally touched and moved by this account of the loss of a beautiful land, the demise of a conscientious and spiritual way of life and finally the extirpation of a nation of people; or at least their ceasing to exist as free, independent, proud and noble individuals.The book had a profound impact on readers when it was first published in 1971 for a couple of reasons. Firstly, it took a unique perspective. Reports of Treaty meetings, tribal histories, Congressional findings and interview transcripts have all been distilled to provide the Indian point of view. Indeed the books' subtitle is 'An Indian History of the American West'. The second factor has to do with when the book was published. Interest in environmental issues was growing and the accounts of the destruction by the settlers of the Eastern forests, the soiling of the rivers and the slaughter of the Buffalo herds struck a chord, especially when contrasted with the practices of the Indians. Readers began to see Indians in a different light, as the first conservationists.The period of history covered is short. From about 1860 to 1890. The first chapter briefly sketches the interactions between Eupopean and Indians from the formers' arrival in Massachusetts in 1620 up to the setting up of the 'permanent indian frontier' west of the Mississippi in 1847.The 'frontier' lasted no time at all. Gold was discovered, land was sought and settlers flocked west. To cover this in legitimacy it was necessary to invent 'Manifest Destiny'. The Indians were now doomed as history has shown that this policy made it manifest that the Indians were destined to be swept aside by the white man. All that we have left is their legends, their magical placenames and some works like this book that provides insights into how the West was really lost."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"Nothing could prepare me for the emotional effect that &quot;Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee&quot; would have on me. Dee Brown brings us the history of the white settlement of the American West as told by the people who were there, both white and Indian. This is not the history we learned in school, and the book will shatter the images of many of our heroes, but the story is important enough that I think every American should read it.I also recommend &quot;The Trail of Tears&quot;, by Gloria Jahoda, which is the history of the removal of the eastern tribes to the west. These two books are neccessary if you, as an American, want a complete education of American History.Beyond education, these books present a people who loved the earth, trusted and respected mankind, and lived honorable lives. I trust that these stories of the near annihilation of our native people at the hands of our forefathers will effect you in unexpected ways, and that you will come away from the experience with new heroes, and a broken heart."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"Saw this book at the Smithsonian Indiian Museum in Washington DC. My husband couldn't put it down. This is the one with the illustrations which really brings home the story. Great read, great book. Anyone interested in learning the other side of the Indian story needs to read this."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"Let me first say, Dee Brown's book, BURY MY HEART AT WOUNDED KNEE is a well written classic that flows nicely. It contains great structure and is a pleasure to read. Certainly no right thinking person would disagree that the American Indians were used and abused by the government at every turn. The treaties the Indians signed were more often than not, not worth the paper they were written on. Murderous cowards like Chivington betrayed those who declared themselves peaceful and friends of the whites, like Black Kettle and the Cheyenne atrocity at Sand Creek. While still under British rule, Indians of the Ohio Valley were victims of one of the first instances of bio-terrorism when the British knowingly and deliberately infected them with small pox.So while it is safe to say the sentiment of Brown's book is clearly accurate and justified, for the overall scope of the book, exception must be taken by anyone seeking the cold hard truth. Since Brown's book was published, and quickly popularized, most historians have followed Brown's approach to viewing the Indian wars of the American West from a strictly ethnocentric viewpoint. To them, the term \\"Indian wars\\" has come to mean only \\"Indian - White wars\\", fought primarily to interrupt the flow of the expansion of white settlement. Paul Wellman began this trend in 1934 with his publication of the account of the 1862 Minnesota Massacre, DEATH ON THE PRARIE. However, what Wellman began, Brown perfected, until we have now reach, in this country, where the history of the American Indian is involved, a sort of Zinnian approach (a phrase I coined myself after revisionist historian Howard Zinn) to the re-writing or revision of American history, in this case specifically, the history of the American West.I come to this conclusion for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is Brown's subtitle, \\"An Indian History of the American West\\". If that is, indeed, what he is seeking to fully examine, then Brown ignores the fact that Indians of different tribes held very different views of that history. He sought to interpret the Indian wars of the northern plains only as \\"Indian-white\\" wars and described them only from the viewpoint of the Sioux hostiles. Brown brushes off as \\"mercenaries\\" those tribes that became allies to the whites against the Sioux.To view the Crow (who white trappers and traders had predicted in the 1830's would soon be extinct due to their far more numerous red enemies) and the Arikara (who also lost their land to the Sioux) as white \\"mercenaries\\" is far beyond simplistic reasoning and completely overlooks the long history of Indian warfare in the region. The Crow, Arikara and many other tribes had been fighting the Sioux (and losing, for the most part) for generations before they received any effective aid from the whites. Brown is shortsighted in his work to attempt to lend understanding of the plight of the Indian without an awareness of the history of intertribal warfare.The Sioux migrated south and west to the Missouri around 1750. In the century preceding and following that movement, the Sioux engaged in war with at least twenty-six other Indian tribes, as well as the River Metis and the U.S. Army. Brown also fails to note that the most dramatic battles fought between the army and the Sioux were on lands the Sioux had taken from other tribes since 1851. Also overlooked is that the Arikara and Hidatsa chiefs who had signed the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1851 had both been killed by the Sioux when in 1864, the Arakara Chief White Shield petitioned the army to uphold its treaty and punish the Sioux.Brown's book, as I said earlier, is well written, and parts of it are quite accurate. However, portraying history from only one viewpoint is shortsighted and often has dangerous consequences. Such is the case here. Brown's book has been accepted as gospel and has since led the way to even further revision of the truth.Monty Rainey[...]"},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"Since its publication in 1970, Dee Brown's well-documented history of American Indians from 1860 to 1990 has sold more than 5 million copies. Mr. Brown quotes from original documents, including translations of the actual words of the Indians as they made their eloquent pleas for justice in the many councils they attended and where they were deceived again and again by white men who robbed them of their land. Even though there's a certain sameness to the outcomes, each tribe had a different experience. The Indians didn't have a concept of ownership of land. To them, it belonged to everybody. As they couldn't read, they didn't know what they were signing, but even when they did understand, it was just a matter of time until new laws took even more land away. And then there were the massacres. I had tears in my eyes while reading about them, especially in the descriptions of the cruelty to women and children. The Indians fought as best as they could, but they were no match for big guns and well-equipped armies. It was an awful time in our history, one of shame for Americans.Throughout the book I couldn't help thinking about the real stories it contained that would make great movies. There's the story of the Seneca Indian who took the name Ely Parker and studied to be a lawyer. Because he was an Indian, he was not allowed to practice and so he became an engineer. During the Civil war he was Military Secretary to U.S. Grant. Later, he was appointed Commissioner of Indian Affairs. How that all played out is a fascinating story. And then there is the story of the Ponca Indian, Standing Bear, who left the reservation in the late 1870s with a small band of people. Because of some helpful white men, his case was argued in the courts. The issue was whether or not an Indian could be considered a &quot;person&quot; and thus be able to live where he chooses. He won his case. But, alas, the outcome was ruled to just apply to his band and not to all Indians. There was often dissention within the tribes themselves. And deception and intrigue. In one case, a chief was bullied by his people into murdering a white man. Later, the very people who had forced him to do this turned him in to be hanged. And then there is the story of the white man married to an Indian and their half-breed children. The children all were able to read and write and there is a lot of documentation about what happened to all of them.I just wish that somebody would write these screenplays. Surely they would be better than some of the make-believe hogwash about Indians that we've all seen. It seems they're either depicted as savage villains or subjected to too much political correctness. And talking about political correctness, I'm not sure about whether the term &quot;Native American&quot; is appropriate. As Mr. Brown's book was written in 1970, he referred to them as &quot;Indians&quot;. Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee&quot; is a well written and worthwhile book. It's upsetting of course, but I am glad for the perspective it gave me. I think it should be required reading in American History classes in high school. Recommended."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"The strength of \\"Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee\\" is also its weakness: Its commitment to telling an ugly truth about American history so searing as to become numbing after a while.It's impossible to consider fairly this, Dee Brown's 1971 examination of the Indian Wars of the American West, without remembering how much it cut against what was then still the mainstream thinking and literature regarding just what happened. The Indians were often bloodthirsty, it was alleged, and our American forefathers imbued themselves in the pioneer spirit by bringing the red man to heel. Brown took an entirely different course.\\"Americans who have always looked westward when reading about this period should read this book facing eastward,\\" Brown writes in his preface.And that's how he writes it, from the perspective of displaced Navajos, Utes, Sioux, Apaches, and more than a dozen other American Indian tribes who were the victims of Manifest Destiny. As Brown tells it, their story is one of being washed away by the greed and savagery of white Americans.The book is often strongest when that savagery is at its ugliest. At Sand Creek in 1864, a regiment of Colorado volunteers under the command of an American Eichmann, one Col. John Chivington, rode into a peaceful village of treaty-abiding Cheyennes and gunned down more than a hundred men, women, and children. Asked about the children, Chivington replied: \\"Nits make lice!\\"It's a raw tale that sits like lead in the stomach of any decent-minded American. But for Brown, that's all you need to hear. The fact that Chivington was cashiered for his murdering, and Colorado's governor cast from office for his part in the massacre by President Andrew Johnson, is not mentioned here. Instead, Brown says the Chivington slaughter was received with satisfaction by whites in toto, as a way of getting Indians out of Colorado.Brown's storytelling is often one-way like that. His exactitude regarding white atrocities is impressive, but when he notes the Apaches' attacks on Mexicans, he claims imprecise records make blame hard to apportion. When young \\"dog soldiers\\" leave the reservation to steal cattle and attack settlers, then run back home to be covered for by their elders, their actions are excused as an understandable response to being cooped up in a plot of land just a few hundred square miles in size. The fact this might have made whites less respectful of treaty conditions is not explored.Brown isn't entirely dogmatic like this; he understands the history well enough to allow for the occasional humane impulse by a white man, or an Indian who goes too far, like Captain Jack of the Modocs, a normally peaceful chief goaded by his juniors into killing whites around a peace table. He doesn't use the politically correct term \\"Native American\\", though that is probably because the book was written long before it came into vogue.The narrative echoes the terse stylings commonly associated with the voice of the Indian, but it becomes colorless and drab reading after a time. None of the Indians really come alive as characters, or as people. They speak to the white man's greed, and exit stage left. Occasionally we learn that this one had a pendant mustache, and that one wore a plugged hat. But they lack vibrancy. Even Sitting Bull, one ornery cuss in life, is here reduced to a stoic sufferer.Brown's book is real history, powerfully told, and you will not forget, nor should forget, the gist of what you read. But it reads too much like history in service of a cause.\\"There are bad white men and bad Indians,\\" the Cheyenne chief Black Kettle is quoted observing in one early chapter. \\"The bad men on both sides brought about this trouble.\\" It's a point that speaks both to Black Kettle's noble perspicacity and the truth of the matter, but one Brown prefers to ignore, to the detriment of this solid if skewed book."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"What can one say? This work, first printed in 1971, is still in print and still widely read, and it very much deserves to be. Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee is probably one of the most eloquent, intense and moving works of exposition I've ever read.For the most part the author, Dee Brown, lets the records and the personal reports of the various participants in the events of the American Indian wars of the 19th Century speak for themselves. He creates thereby a narrative that is more riveting than any modern adventure novel and more poignant than even the finest of the Greek tragedies. The work is very well researched, with an excellent bibliography of the author's sources. It is also well illustrated, with photos or paintings of the various leaders of the native American tribes of the time. It is a veritable who's who of the native west. There are short biographies of many of the more important individuals. Names like Black Kettle of the Cheyennes, Little Crow of the Santee Sioux, Red Cloud and Crazy Horse of the Oglala Sioux, Chief Joseph of the Nez Perces (&quot;I will fight no more forever,&quot;) Sitting Bull of the Hunkpapa Sioux, and Cochise and Geronimo of the Chiricahua Apaches are among those most likely to be recognized by non-native Americans.What I found most interesting was the extent to which the various tribes were able to hold out against the odds, even resoundingly defeating the US military that hounded them nearly to extinction. It is evident from even a quick reading that it was less military superiority than the policy of starving out the people by destruction of land, animals, and other property that brought about defeat of the tribes. The US military of the time made a war on women, children and the elderly, slaughtering even infants in surprise raids made in undeclared wars or in provoked confrontations. Starvation, freezing weather, and disease brought these proud people to their knees, not military might.In these times of international conflict the tragic treatment of the native American population should be a cautionary tale of what can happen when the self righteous, the culturally narrow, the ambitious, and the greedy use the military to achieve their own agenda. The types of people responsible for the near eradication of a race of people in the 19th Century are still common enough today. In my opinion this book should be required reading for any American history course from junior high school level and beyond it. Only by raising the consciousness of the average citizen from youth onward can the specter of racism on this scale be avoided."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"If you're looking for a narrative of the struggles between the various native tribes of North America and european settlers, there probably isn't a better place to go.I read this book on my way to Wounded Knee this summer. There was so much I didn't know about the expansion of the United States (and much I still don't know, I'm sure) that my mouth gaped with horror throughout every chapter. The account of how the very laid back friendly tribes of California were mowed down by settlers without a second thought was particularly chilling. As the book itself says, no one remembers these tribes of California because they didn't put up a fight. They were simply swept aside.Reading this book also filled gaps in the stories I had heard: Crazy Horse, Red Cloud, Sitting Bull, The Trail of Tears, the Lakota Uprising, Little Big Horn and of course Wounded Knee. All of these and other stories you probably haven't heard before are put together in chronological order. It is a very comprehensive and readable book, but it does tell of an unreconcilable tragedy.When I finished this book, one day before arriving at Wounded Knee, I was overcome with the feeling that europeans can never make up for what they did to the people who were here before them. What happened is forever unreconcilable. But self-flagellation and reproach will not undo anything, nor help either side as they currently stand. What most european descendants can do is read this book to know what happened, and then visit Wounded Knee to see where it all ended and observe. Only then will one be on the road to understanding, as inevitably incomplete as that understanding must be and remain."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"It is axiomatic that history gets written by the winners - the losers are invariably made to look like bad men or natural losers or both. The point of \\"Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee\\" is to take a history that most of us know only from the winning perspective, and narrate it from the point of view of the losers.Brown accomplishes this objective with considerable grace and beauty in spare, elegant narrative prose and verbatim quotes from key historical personages. Not a single word is wasted on description, sermonising or misguided attempts to explain the unexplainable. The mind-boggling amount of research Brown must have undertaken into state, federal and tribal records over the years is placed entirely at the service of the narrative. This story is broken up into episodes of just the right length and pace, each one revolving around a particular campaign or leader. The author never tries to manipulate the reader's emotions, but then he never has to.Sadly, I think (with respect) that some readers and reviewers have missed the point of this sublime work. Of course it is not objective, and of course it is not the whole story. There are two sides to every conflict, and in the so-called \\"Indian Wars\\" there were rights and wrongs committed on both sides. But it is in our nature to be partisan, to want closure to a debate, to hold a clear judgement on the heroes and villains of the piece with no shades of grey to blur our moral certainties. The popular \\"Cowboys and Indians\\" culture of our parents' and grandparents' day was secure in its belief that civilised Christian values had won the day. The more politically sensitive consensus of our own day all too easily falls into the equal and opposite error of glorifying alternative cultures at the expense of our own.If only real life worked in such simple black-and-white terms! To treat Brown's book as the definitive history of the West - especially as a school history text that at last sets the record straight and for the first time tells it like it was - would be (almost!) as misguided as basing your view of history on Hollywood blockbusters like the Cinerama epic, \\"How The West Was Won\\". The value of this book is quite different. It is an unashamedly subjective account of the sufferings endured by the First Americans at the hands of the European settlers and their government. It should be read in conjunction with the standard histories, and (in the mind's eye of the reader) juxtaposed on the images of White American legend.Only thus, by embracing the tension between these different perspectives, can truth be served. Ultimately, Brown's book serves two valuable functions: Firstly, it provides a necessary antidote to the decades of triumphalist legend that depicted the Native Americans as little more than vindictive savages. But more than that, it gives America a record of what it lost through the destruction of such a rich and diverse cultural heritage. Given the simultaneous loss of innocence and the environmental damage that went hand in hand with the destruction, it is clear that the \\"winners\\" lost more than we have commonly grasped."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"The original is a very well written book, nearly every chapter is a story in itself. Together they give an overview of the partail genocide and internment in concentration camps/reservations of some of the most prominent \\"Native American\\" tribes, along with other interesting facts and fantastic photos. My only gripe with this latest edition is that many of the original photos have been deleted, most of them are replaced with alternates of the same subject, but not all. The pics. of Roman Nose and Wovoka are gone replaced only with charcoal drawings. One of my favorites, Big Eagle brandishing his war club is gone, replaced with a photo that does'nt jump of the page the way the original does. This new edit. has a number of essays interspearsed through the chapters, an infomitive preface, many new photos and two maps, all of which are welcome. I was hopeing the maps would be of more assistance, they date from 1852 which is well before the 1860-1890 time-line of the narrative. They leave alot to be desired for answering questions like: Where is the \\"Smokey Hill\\"?...refered to with great frequency in the early chapters. If you've not read this book I suggest an earlier edition as it should have a better flow reading it as it was first intended, then since the vast majority of readers will be compelled to reread this classic, buy the expanded version for an even more enjoyable reread. A sample of the interesting facts aforementioned: (July 1860 the repeating rifle invented)...To me this shows that the Union Army finally had the ability to wage war with the confederates, carry on their genocide doctorine of free peoples, while standing ready to defend against a potential foriegn invader like Great Britten. The union could'nt have done all three without repeating rifles, so as soon as they had them they wasted no time forceing their agenda. Consider: What if slaves had been granted freedom while tribal Americans were free? Drums, danceing, tribal religion...these two tribes of man flurishing stood firmly in the way of corporate America and still do, as propaganda wars are as prominent as ever."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee is a profoundly moving book. It takes you back to a time of new beginnings, when things could've been done right, but were inevitably done wrong. And the original people of the American land who were done wrong by. Wounded Knee is a place, where spirits live, Indian's do the \\"ghost dance\\" and inevitably people lay in passing, from war and slaughter.Dee Brown's novel is a must for anyone who wants insight and understanding into an indigenous culture.Wounded Knee tells the tale of the &quot;American West&quot; form the other side - the American Indian's perspective. With quotes and chants from famous names that appear synonymous with the \\"Cowboys &amp; Indians\\" culture of the American frontier.An accurate and emotional journey is what the reader will undertake as they take on the naive understandings of these proud people who are inevitably fighting a culture and system of prejudices they can not win. Chieftains like Sitting Bull, Geronimo, Crazy Horse, will inspire and bring feelings of admiration and the sense of oppressing injustice to the forefront of your emotions.If you are able to read this book without being truly stirred on some emotional level, then you would appear to be super human or perhaps a little more in human than most.If you seek inspiration and motivation, understanding and sense of being or purpose, I believe you will find these things in Dee Brow's book when you look at and read about the lives of these amazing people.It is my favorite book!"},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"A history that is seldom, if ever told. For that fact alone I should have given the book five stars, but the unique voice and Indian &quot;way of telling&quot; is also the book's biggest weakness. While this method is lyrical and innovative, there is almost no discussion of conflicts between tribes or even individual Indains. While the results of &quot;civilized&quot; Indian policy came to the same end there is no exploration of what motivated such various white reations to the Indians of the west. Could have used a wider sources to document the individual chapters.It simply may be too big a subject for a single book, but for all the minor flaws, read it. It is like no other history and we should all know the weight we bear."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee is truly a classic piece of history. It tells the tale of the ravages that can result from the doctrine of Manifest Destiny. In the case of the Native Americans, Manifest Destiny resulted in the near-destruction of a way of life that was whole and complete. This is the point that Dee Brown makes. He tells the story from a stilted perspective, but this masterpiece fills a void that exists in our understanding of American history. This void is magnified by the very brief bits of U.S. history that introduce each chapter. We are (at least vaguely) familiar with these pieces of history, which makes our ignorance of the history of the \\"taming\\" of the West even more appalling. This is a great and important book that should be read by all."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"'Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee' is a catalogue of the cowardly betrayals, massacre, outright murder and genocide carried out by the US Government against the Native American population in what is today known as, The United States. It is a well written and documented account of the Native American Indian during the 2nd half of the 19th century. This book is a unique, disturbing but compelling and highly readable historical narrative told with force and clarity, that has changed forever our vision of how the west was really won (stolen). Unlike other histories covering these topics, the book presents the events as experienced by the victims. It has been estimated there were at least 10 million Native Americans killed, some estimates place this figure much higher. We will never really know the true number. There were many hundreds of tribes spanning the entire length of the western hemisphere, from Alaska all the way to the southern part of Chile. These tribes were inde-and interdependent of one another. Taking into account the natives from these a geographical areas, the number of dead could be upwards of 40 million. Though this book only limits itself to the lower 48's, one quickly realizes that the aim of the government was to destroy an entire non-anglo culture and drive them to complete extinction if need be. The main sources for the history are official records of U.S.-Indian treaty councils and meetings. The reasonableness and humanity expressed by the American Indian spokesmen during these encounters, as recounted here, do much to counter the stereotype of \\"ignorant,\\" \\"savage\\" Indians, and the courageous spirit they reveal evokes admiration and respect. Chapters are arranged chronologically, each devoted to a particular tribe or campaign. The final chapter describes the growth and significance of the Ghost Dance movement and the Battle of Wounded Knee. Maps show the location and dates of the main actions.This side of the story was never taught in school. A highly recommended book and unlike anything you may have ever read."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"I read this book way back in 1977 when I was a student. I'm half English and knew little of American History. It was a very profound read then and I felt an enormous amount of sympathy in reading it for a culture that was doomed by the arrival of Europeans. I have looked at some of the reviews and those that criticise it seem to dislike the one-sided approach that portray's Indians as Good and White man as Bad. To them I would point out that for a long time we have had the image of Indians as Bad thrust at us by movies and TV shows. I don't think I'm wrong in believing that there was already a stereotype that potrayed Indians as murderous savages, and that is from looking at it in England. So, I thinks it's ok to have something that discriminates so postively in favour of a race that was vilified at so many levels. However, nobody should rely on just one source as the whole story.If you really care, you will read more than one book and find out as much as possible. I'm sure doing so will show that as with everything it is never a simplisitc black and white picture, there is always good and bad on sides and there is always something right and wrong in both too.Whatever your views, I think it would be hard to deny that their culture and race was overwhelmed and almost completely destroyed by the immigration of Europeans. We will never know if the cultures could have co-existed peacefully and the fact they didn't probably proves they couldn't.That doesn't make either side right or wrong. It does show that we find it easier to go to war with foreign cultures than embrace them and that has been a fact throughout history. It seems that in human relations one side has to be defeated and broken rather than respected and equal.The book made me sad way back then when I was young and very idealistic. Today I have had a lot of reality woven into my views but I still believe in ideals and I haven't forgotten how I felt when I read the book. However it seems that nations, cultures, races and religions still don't know how to live in peace.My mother is Armenian and my granparent were refugees from Turkey in 1914, I learnt of their history first hand. My family lived in Cyprus when the island experienced war and division. What I have seen and learnt is that we all lose through war and hatred. What I don't understand is how we can read and learn about the past and then repeat it so often again."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"This book tells the Indians' side of the story and therefore is very biased. It does not try to hide that fact. Not included are atrocities committed by the Indians against settlers. But it is nevertheless a viewpoint that needs to be told, and Dee Brown tells it well.It's not the first book that reports from this viewpoint. This book is similar to Helen Hunt Jackson's book which was written almost a century earlier. Despite Jackson's depiction of unforgivable behavior, it not only continued but got worse as Dee Brown eloquently describes in his book.This book is easy so easy to read it almost seems like a novel, but unfortunately it is nonfiction. The book is peppered with footnotes and references to documents that support the accounts, a quality that is often lacking in other books on this subject. I've researched other issues at the National Archives, and let me tell you, it is time consuming and a pain in the neck to request a few documents. The volume of material that Dee Brown cites in his book definitely took a lot of painstaking research and patience.I have two complaints:1) It ends in 1890: atrocities and mistreatment of Native Americans continued for over a century.2) It doesn't tell the many GOOD things that the evil white man has done. Yes, there were people who did not kill, rob and/or imprison Native Americans. Some were honest and treated them fairly, and some, like Helen Hunt Jackson, petitioned Congress and the President on behalf of Native Americans. I wish those acts were included also."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"Just brilliant.

I've read better written history books and at times after going through the chapters some of the facts and figures aren't quite as memorable as say reading a book about a specific incident or concentrating on one tribe/movement. Basically, this book is kind of like an intro to American Indian History so if you want a clearer picture then read this and move on to other books. Also,I read an earlier version but I bet this one with more pictures and maps would be of help so while that was a minor negative for me it looks like it is corrected.But here is why I'm so glad I have read this book and I really wish I read it in middle school or high school. YOU WILL not have a complete picture of American history unless you have read this book or know about the history of the Native people. I've always been a fan of history and had known some Native history, but after reading this book you realize what an important gap, really a massive canyon, is missing in your knowledge of American history unless you know these stories."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"The book has not lost any of its hard hitting truth since I first read it in the '70's.It is the true story from beginning to end of how the whiteman took this country by force from the Redman.

Now, almost 30 years later, I find myself doing the same.CRIMINAL is only the beginning of how to describe the way that the Indian nations were treated by the US Government and their \\"Manifest Destiny\\" policy. For anyone who has ever watched an old western or even has an opinion on the Native Americans, I suggest you read this book.It should be required reading for ALL High School students.I was deeply touched by the honor among these men who in changing times, still were willing to work with the US Government, even after the government and its army had shown that they were not honorable."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"America is legitimately a beacon of freedom to a weary and war-torn world. Really. What America has wrought serves as a shining example to all peoples for all time.But when the Chinese, for example, chide us for our criticism of their treatment of the peoples of Tibet and Xinjiang by saying that we ought to get off our high horse, thay make a painful point.Somehow, just after America finished spilling the blood of a million of its own people to preserve the Union and free the Negro slaves, the same people (Sherman, Sheridan, Custer, et al were heroes of the Civil War) took it upon themselves, as the instrument of a whole nation, to exterminate the Indians.Why would a country emancipate and enfranchise its Negro slaves at such a staggering cost and almost simultaneously deny freedom, franchise and life itself to the Indians?This book makes it pretty plain that the vast majority of the Plains Indians were no threat to anyone. For the most part they were pitiful and starving, and completley overwhelmed by the advance of our forebears. Most of the attacks by the US Army on Indian encampments caught the occupants completely by surprise and resulted in the deaths primarily of women and children.But we already knew this, didn't we? What this book lays out is just how outmatched the Indians were and just how predatory the White Man was. No punches are pulled, but this is no polemic.So what was the difference, in the late 1800s, between the Negro and the Indian? Why were they treated so completely differently? The only conclusion can be that the Negro didn't own anything of value at the time, whereas the Indian had the great misfortune to be living on land that a much stronger people wanted to occupy.America can still serve as a beacon of freedom and rectitude to the world. But we did not come by this without some shameful behavior."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"This book is, and will continue to be the authoritative thesis on the effects of the 'opening' of the American West in the late 1800s from the perspective of American Indians.You can not understand American history if you haven't read this book. I know of no other book that could make this claim. Quite simply, no one has crafted what Mr. Brown has crafted in regards to communicating the effects the opening had on Indians, including their perspective on how this effected them personally, spiritually, and culturally. The lessons these people teach us have stayed with me for years; I try and emulate their dignity, their love for their country, and their love for each other, and easily admit their bar is set too high for me.This book is also a great lesson that reading history only by the victors insures you really don't understand history at all. A great re-affirming lesson to me.Besides its incredible impact on American history, its also an easy forthright read, if you don't mind crying about 20 times. Thus, I believe it should be a reading requirement for all high schoolers, especially in this day and age when many of our churches and politicians preach and condone bigotry and hatred of the \\"other\\"."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"I am no authority on the subject, and therefore am in no position to discuss the significance of this work in terms of American historiography, but on a personal level this book is one that has led to some soul searching, if you will. If read with an open and objective mind, Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee leads one to question the legitimacy and manner in which Europeans \\"settled\\" this continent, not to mention how the original inhabitants have been treated since that time. Sadly, circa 125 years after the events in this book transpired, and some 30 years after the books was published, we see parallels in the modern world."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"This is a heartbreaking tale of how the United States destroyed the native civilizations of North America. Dee Brown tells this story from the Native Americans' point of view. He details how Americans used a series of treaties to swindle the natives out of their land. Time and time again, these treaties were broken. Land was continually stolen from the natives, and when they tried to stand up for their rights as outlined in the treaties, then the U.S. army was there to murder and torture the natives until they could no longer resist. This book will prove to be an eye-opener. As an American, I was spoon-fed the theory of Manifest Destiny in American high school. I think it would be better to call it what it really is -- genocide. If you would like to read about \\"how the west was won,\\" then I would recommend that you pick up this book, so that you can learn the real truth about American history."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"Americans have always studied the American Indian from a viewpoint looking Westward -- this is a book that looks at them, looking Eastward. New perspectives (at least new when the book was published in 1970) and shocking statistics changed our view of Indian-White relations in the 19th Century. Characters speak for themselves in quotes from Presidents, Chiefs, generals, braves and cavalry troops.In one chapter the reader is invited to a Cheyenne winter camp to observe their preparation for the hard season. Then, before dawn the next morning, we are led to watch in horror as Lt. Col. George Custer leads a cavalry charge on the village. Of course there is nothing here of the actions that prompted such malevolent response, but that would not serve the purpose of the book. For the purpose of this book is totally one-sided -- to portray one side of the American Indian experience and to cast them in a much more sympathetic light had been done in previous writings. The book is pure, narrowly-focused historic revisionism with no pretense toward balance.All that said, it's a valuable book because for us to understand our heritage, we need to know about and be sympathetic to, the truth of our history, whether it strikes us as &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad.&quot; What looks bad to us in the 21st Century may not have looked that way to us had we lived in the 19th and known only what they knew.This book gives us some of the truth and it should be read and appreciated for what it is rather than lauded as the final word on Indian-White political relations. Let's hope that someday someone will have the courage to write &quot;the other side of the story.&quot; And, folks, there IS another side that is equally poignant and equally valuable."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"...I was reading it for school.

This is just not that kind of a book. I am writing this mainly for the benefit of teachers who are considering using this book for a curriculum tool. Perhaps it should be used for recommended outside reading to give students a feel for the treatment that the American Indians endured at the hands of the intrusive white government, but not as a textbook.All in all, I did enjoy the book.

Because it's a book about the final days of the \`Indian Wars' highlighting atrocities committed against the Indians, a book that was required to offset the books, fact and fiction, that only highlighted the atrocities committed by the Indians. Has the book had a positive influence? DEFINITELY! Not just for Native Americans, but also for other indigenous people round the world. Not enough of an influence, but better than none at all. Does the book tell the FACTS about what happened? One reviewer says that Dee Brown wasn't an historian, he was a librarian. Well, a library is a great place to research history, and if Mr. Brown researched this period of history does that not make him a historian.Answers? To: Five Stars for being the most blatantly Politically Correct denial of Reality concerning Indians, January 5, 2006 by Kosto Barry Granlund.1. FACT re:KBG Indians too stupid to learn English. All translators were incapable of translating correctly, so every speech or statement by any Indian was written by white men wishing to romanticize Indians. By the way: These are FACTS that MUST be assumed, according to KBG.Therefore all Pro Indian statements false, all Anti Indian statements true. Is it possible that the speeches and statements by Indians were more beautiful and profound than those published, due to poor translation? How accurately were all the speeches and statements of officials, soldiers, settlers, etc. recorded? Who wrote their speeches?2. FACT re:KBG Indians did not have defined territory, therefore they could not comprise Nations.Dictionary: Nation - A body of people marked off by common descent, language, culture or historical tradition. Surely Indians qualify for nationhood? Of course there were no boundaries! What do you want: Picket fences? Question: \`How did the Indians hold out for so long with their Stone Age technology?'3. FACT re:KBG No Indian tribe EVER had a distinct and stable homeland, therefore there was no such thing as Ancestral Land. The Sioux and the Comanche were intent on exterminating other tribes. (Not the Kiowa or Cheyenne?) The Crow, although vastly outnumbered by the Sioux (the exterminators in the North) and the fierce and prolific Comanche (the exterminators to the South) and surrounded by other tribes, survived in a nice chunk of territory by being superior fighters to them all: Except the tribe that drove them out of the swamp.Indians based their lives in territories best suited to their needs, where they had the strength to defend that territory. Tribal boundaries overlapped. The territories most tribes roamed would have stayed relatively stable for generations, as population growth was very slow, and is in most tribal cultures. How many generations living in an area does it need for that area to become Ancestral Land? Tribes also traded with each other: Before they tied to exterminate each other of course. Tribes going round trying to exterminate each other would have caused too great a loss of life to their own people and would have been detrimental to the health of even the biggest tribe. Neighbouring tribes WERE allowed to defend themselves, even retaliate. Changing boundaries: You mean it's not happening now. I should have kept my old school atlas: Nothing has changed. Extermination (Genocide): You mean it's not happening now.4. FACT re:KBG Indians unable or unwilling to train wild prehistoric horse so killed them all. Indians only able to ride modern horse as already tame.Information from Head Smashed In website: Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump is known around the world as a remarkable testimony of prehistoric life. Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump bears witness to a custom practiced by native people of the North American plains for nearly 6000 years. 6000 years! Did they have horses back then? How big were these herds of bison? How on earth did so many survive for the Europeans to slaughter? After all, the Indians had managed to kill all the horses - and, according to another reviewer, all the mammoth as well. Maybe the horses are underneath the bison? Hold on!FACT re:KBG \`IT IS A MATTER OF FACT that the only reason why the Indians did not kill more wildlife in greater numbers is because they lacked the technology to do so'. Ah! \`They could only kill so many bison or deer or antelope with arrows, spears, or cliff stampedes, and that's why the populations of the tribes remained basically constant and low in numbers. They had reached their capacity to support their populations by means of their Stone Age hunting and technology, and their numbers simply didn't grow beyond a certain point because of this'.So, there were enough Indians to kill off the horses and drive so many bison over cliffs that they wasted vast amounts of their food and clothing and shelter supply. But, because they were so bad at hunting there wasn't enough food to support an increase in the population? I would have thought that the Indians must have been, at least, okay at conservation, surely, otherwise how did they survive for so long? Ten or fifteen thousand years was it?I would have thought that arrows, spears or cliff stampedes would have killed all of the bison, deer or antelope if the Indians had wanted to. They did kill all of the prehistoric horses, after all! Nice of the Indians to leave millions of bison for the white men to kill: Really!5. FACT re:KBG \`The plains Indians built their one-dimensional cultures around two simple components. These were hunting and warfare. These tribes hunted for their subsistence and warred with one another primarily to obtain the best hunting grounds and secondarily to achieve \\"glory\\" within the context of their value systems'. No room for trade or friendship with other tribes? No room for any kind of spiritual life? Were the kids allowed to play? Amazing there were so many tribes left, what with all the big tribes killing off or enslaving all the smaller tribes.All round the world: Now, there are people being held as slaves, many of them being raped and tortured. All round the world: Now, there are poorer, weaker people having their land taken from them by richer, stronger people.6. FACT re:KBG The Indians DID NOT suffer terribly at the hands of European invaders. (Surely he didn't mean to use the word \\"invaders?\\") They actually killed each other, even members of their own tribe. FACT re:KBG The Indians broke all the treaties. (I'm learning so much!) FACT re:KBG \`It is a FACT that the Indians never had any distinct \\"homelands\\" in their tribal histories.'He's not giving up on this one, is he? I didn't think the other two FACTS needed a reply. If you believe them there's no hope. Or is there?7. FACT re:KBG (in reply to:The view of Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee seems to be that the so-called \\"glorious Horse Culture\\" of the plains tribes was \\"lost\\" because of being \\"destroyed\\" by European invaders.) \`The so-called \\"Horse Culture\\" of the western tribes came about as a result of the European invaders in the first place! As stated earlier in this post, the Indians caused the extinction of the prehistoric horses on this continent by hunting them as food. It was only after the Spanish brought domesticated horses to the plains and the tribes saw how these animals were used by the European invaders that the \\"horse culture\\" actually got underway'.The fact that Europeans introduced the modern horse into Northern America does not mean they did not destroy the horse culture of the Plains Indians.FACT re:KBG \`The decorative costumes and elaborately feathered war bonnets of the plains tribes didn't exist until trade with the European invaders began. There was no colored beads, no thread, no needles, no colored yarn, no colored linen, no glue, and no colored dyes among the tribes BEFORE the terrible invading Europeans arrived and used all these items as trade goods. None of these elements were possible PRIOR to the arrival of the terrible Europeans and all their trade goods!'Could they do anything? All over the world tribesmen and women are dyeing and gluing: But not the Indians.8. Question from KBG. \\"I would like to ask both the potential reader of \\"Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee\\" AND those who have already read it and feel that Whites were so terrible to Indians, what they think the condition of the American Indians of today would be if the European invaders had approached conflicts with the wild tribes in the same way these tribes dealt with one another? That is, if we Whites had used the tactics of the Sioux or the Comanche on all the tribes, where would their decendants be today?\\"Dear KBG, the whites DID approach conflict with the so called \\"wild\\" tribes in the way YOU say they dealt with each other. Luckily there were some people who didn't believe genocide to be the correct way to behave. Even in the last fifty years, there have been many attempts at genocide in different countries which have failed: Watch the News. Even if you believe the Indians were committing genocide, it's hardly specific to their race.I know KBG is reviewing \\"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee\\", but every review I have seen of his regarding the history of Native Americans and their conflict with the white men can be summed up as: Books that say Indian life is \\"just awful!\\" GOOD. Books that say Indians were murdering savages. GOOD. Books that say anything else: Politically Correct, Bleeding Heart pseudo-history. And this is the review KBG tells us will give us \\"THE FACTS\\".KBG says the Indians were all about killing and torture: Does that excuse the Europeans? Did the Europeans go there expecting the Indians to let them have the land? What were the Europeans doing there in the first place, if not to take control of the land and \\"civilize\\" the natives?What is the problem with being a savage? When it comes to the destruction of the earth, \\"civilized\\" men come out way ahead. Overpopulation: Civilization wins hands down. The numbers of people killed, in war or otherwise, by so called \\"civilized\\" men, make comparisons laughable. Savages: There's no comparison.In closing, I would like to state that, KBG DOES know all the FACTS about the Indian way of life: Their customs and rituals, their thoughts and feelings. So barricade your doors America: They're out to get you.Just Another Bleeding Heart.PS: Thank you to all the other \`Politically Correct, Bleeding Hearts' for their excellent posts."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"Carry this book around and people will like you.

If you did you'd learn about Chief Joseph who didn't want the white man's churches. Unfortunately, white men like churches and there were more white men around. You'll learn about Siting Bull who liked to stare into the sun, cut himself and bleed until he saw cool stuff. You'll learn about Indians and white men cutting out female genitals and wearing them on their heads to piss each other off. You'll learn about Indians cutting open animals and sticking babies inside so that the babies wouldn't freeze to death. You'll get a bunch of cool pictures of Indian men who like to wear their hair long like girls. Don't those silly Indians know that men are supposed to have short hair like it says in the Bible? Don't they know that the Great Spirit Chief is a silly fairy tale and that the ancient Hebrew god Yahweh (commonly translated as \\"God\\") is real and is gonna send all those unrepetant Indians to Hell to burn forever and ever? Don't those silly Indians want to go to Heaven and be with the blond haired blue eyed Jesus and all his pasty white followers who forced all the silly Indians off of their land and killed them for their own damn good?

It just tells the tale of the annihilation of some tribes. As it does not fully describe the conditions that led to this annihilation, some readers may not understand the whole process and, perhaps, get a somewhat blurred picture.Even then, some important facts are stated:1.- There has been a displacement of the original population (Indians) by the newcomers (Whites).2.- Most of the Indians have been killed (famine, murder and war).3.- The Indians have been treated in a way that, nowadays, would made everybody blame the government of the USA: To move by force large masses of population from their original places to new ones, to assign to the Army the mission of controlling civil population and the denying of human and civil rights to the indians would be considered a scandall.

Brown doesn't merely &quot;slant&quot; things to a degree that amounts to a hallucinatory experience, but makes things up outright. Anxious to make G.A. Custer look bad for the Washita attack, he invents casualty figures, claiming that Custer killed 103 Cheyennes, only eleven of whom were men! (As anthropologist John Greenway observed, massacres of Indians, in the neononsense of Brown and his associates, are not indiscriminate, but rigorously discriminate, consisting solely of women and children.) Brown either covers up Indian atrocities (particularly those of the Apaches) or tries to lie his way out of them by providing some bogus excuse; according to him, the Sioux's Minnesota massacre of some 400 white settlers one fine day in 1862 simply never happened.He can't even get the small parts right, even depicting Custer's men as carrying sabers at the Little Bighorn. One can find out nothing about the American Indians of the West from reading Brown's book, perhaps because he's not really interested in them save as victims for his guilt-stricken white readership.As for Brown's claim that his book is an &quot;Indian history,&quot; based on Indian accounts gathered at treaty councils or immured in obscure government documents, this is but another falsehood. He could have written the thing in two weeks, ripping off standard books in print -- including Custer's memoir &quot;My Life on the Plains&quot;!

I rank this book with Howard Zinn's \\"A People's History of the United States.\\"I read Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee shortly after it was published, and its illusion shattering impact has stayed with me to this day. The section debunking the \\"hero\\" George Custer is more than worth the price of the book.

In exploring the complexities of the issues, Brown does not fall into the trap of villifying \\"the white man\\" while \\"enobling\\" the Natives - while sympathetic to the Natives, punches are not pulled regarding actions by either side. The history is much more complicated than a littany of broken promises and broken treaties. The stories of such varied peoples as the Navajo, Apache, Ute, Cheyenne and Sioux, Kiowa and Puna have similar features in the conflicts these nations had with whites; yet the inter-generational conflicts within tribes and the unique circumstances between the federal government and Natives are also explored in detail. The only criticism I have is its lack of maps to give readers a clearer idea of the areas discussed in detail in the text of the book._Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee_ is an outstanding history that addresses many misconcpetions Americans have about the settlement of the West, while also serving as a reminder of the unpleasant nature and the costs involved in \\"winning the West.\\""},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"I realize now, after just finishing this book, how absolutely ignorant I was before it.

Still an important work on early American history, &quot;Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee&quot; is also seminal in its own right.

The book is more a historical romance than history. Mr. Brown was not a trained historian, and does not claim to be. The book lacks an introduction and preface as one expects in scholarly works. While it is always a question whether even a professional historian can be objective, anyone who has read more contemporary historical works in this area will quickly see that Mr. Brown's approach lacks objectivity. A couple of examples: In Chapter Two of the book, \\"The Long Walk of the Navahos,\\" the author ends with the observation that the Navahos would be the least unfortunate of the western Indians. He conveniently omits that the Navahos number about 250,000, have a reservation about the size of West Virginia, have developed a self-sustaining tourism business with their arts and crafts, and have maintained their language and culture. In Chapter Three, \\"Little Crow's War,\\" Mr. Brown fails to state that there was dissention among the Sioux about even starting a war, that cooler heads did not prevail, and that the Sioux warriors started the \\"war\\" by killing 400 to 500 unarmed settlers including men, women, and children which prompted calling in some military forces in the middle of the Civil War. In several places Mr. Brown suggests that practice of mutilation including scalping had been introduced by Europeans; later study has shown scalping and mutilation were practiced by Indians before Columbus. The events described by Mr. Brown are substantially accurate as far as they go, and there is no doubt that Indians west of the Mississippi suffered greatly under the tsunami of westward settlement in the 19th century. My opinion, the book has been superceded by later scholarship."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"I love this book.i got a paperback version and was rivetted with the accounts presented.It is a book that makes uncomfortable reading in the light of environmental issues so prominent today, and also America's role in championing the cause of the abused and displaced.\\"The land of the free\\" is a hollow sounding claim when the blood of thousands of Indians cries out for justice, wiped out by the advancing super race of Americans.I wonder if Adolf Hitler ever complained of American interference in Germany's attempt to wipe out the jews,given what was done to native Americans, or maybe he looked to American history for some good ideas.This illustrated Edition of Dee Browns masterpiece is enthralling and brought to life with the illustrations, photographs and additional comments from various sources.If you, like me thought John Wayne and others who sat tall in the saddle were the epitomy of the American cowboy fighting the Indian menace, this book will destroy that myth forever."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"Being an author of my own book, \\"Under the Rose: Poetry of Tragedy, Essence, and Romance,\\" I can tell you in an unreserved fashion that this book is ONE OF THE GREATEST BOOKS I EVER READ!I read this book 20 years ago and it opened my eyes and shone light upon me.

Being of Native descent, I found it hard with the history lessons taught in schools. A little too one-sided? I think not. Remember, history is HIS story -- the Europeans' version of what truly happened centuries ago. It has taken too long for us to have our story told. The indigenous people were keepers of the land, and never claimed to own the land. We never had any concept of the value of gold. We lived with the land and were one with it. Was it right to drive them from their homes? To have hundreds of men, women and children die during their walk of the Trail of Tears? I clearly do not remember any of this being taught in history class. Do yourself a favor and buy this book. Read it with an open mind and heart and understand history as it truly was!

In EACH case, the settlers - and later, the U.S. government itself - deceived, cheated, manipulated and brutalized the indigenous people. It began before the 1860s and - take it from a person on the scene - it continues to this very day, only by more subtle and low-profile methods.My respect for the author is immense because the history is well-researched and documented and is presented in an even tone that makes the emotional impact of the tragic and infuriating proceedings even more powerful.This book caused me to see the stereotypical depictions from my youth of Indians as cruel and vicious savages in a much different light, because it brought me to ask myself if I and my fellow Caucasian Americans would act any differently when responding to an outside, invading force assaulting our country and trying to take possession of this country we consider our homeland.I highly recommend this book to anyone, novice or 'expert', who is interested in American history and/or Native American people."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"A riveting, heart-breaking and blood-boiling account of the colonization of the Americas and the genocide of Indigenous People and their cultures required to achieve it. Reading every empty promise, broken treaty and manipulation by the white man towards Native people paints a very simple template of how the white culture achieved its dominance over and over again. Each story breaks the heart a little more as the reader wonders how the predatory, parasitic eurowestern race came to be created and differ so radically from Indigenous races across the world, and even more baffling, came to think & promote itself \\"civilized\\" or superior to Indigenous Nations in any way, when the reality is the very opposite.If no other history ('his stories') is taught in schools, this book should be the only required reading for it tells the clearest account of how the Americas were \\"developed\\", and any other \\"developing/developed\\" (colonized) nation, for that matter.If Europe's colonization across the globe (known as globalization today) does not enrage you already, this book will help that process, and it will begin the necessary global imperative of DE-colonization, or as Native American artist and activist John Trudell puts it, un-mining our mined minds. For those of us living on stolen Native land anywhere in the world, we MUST de-colonize; we owe it to the human race of the past, present, and future."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"I learned about the book 'Bury My Heart and Wounded Knee' in my college history class and was intrigued. especially living in Minnesota and being able to trace a small part of my lineage to the Dakota of Minnesota.

It was then when I noticed the subtitle on the book. \\"Adapted for young readers.''I figured that meant nothing more than simplifying the reading so younger readers could understand it. One problem, it Also meant that not Everything that is in the book 'Bury my heart at wounded knee' is in this book. I don't know the exact extent yet of what was left out but all I know is the part I specifically wanted the book for was not in there. In the original there is a chapter on 'Little Crow's war'. This is concerning the Dakota Uprising in Minnesota in 1862. A significant event when it comes to Native American/White Settler/U.S. Government relations. But an even completely left out of this book. To say I was disappointed would be an understatement.The rest of the book is still informative but quite a let down to expect something that should be in the book, but wasn't.

I found it best to print out a copy of this map (http://bradnelson.com/images/indian_wars_1860-1890.jpg) to continually reference whilst reading. If you're so inclined, I also bought a copy of Brown'sThe American West, a more general history of the frontier, which includes several maps, including some detailed battle maps.Perhaps what is most unique about this book, and why is has received so much praise, is that it is told from the point of view of the Indians. Months are given seasonal names and American soldiers are referenced by their Indian names.

It does seem more like a cheesy hollywood historical drama, where everything is painted in black and white. We get lots of superficial details and not much meat. I'd like to know what it felt like to be a Native American or a settler back then, and this book didn't give me that. It gave me High School History, the kind of history that turns people off to history. However, the book does have good qualities as well. It lets Native Americans speak for themselves about their history, when traditionally europeans have been the only ones speaking; some of the beautiful language of Native Americans can be heard, the nature metaphors. There is some decent irony. There's some nice description-- And the book seems pretty comprehensive in covering the history of the time. But I cannot continue reading it...it's quite drab.

One of the few books supporting the Indians cause"},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"My post contradicts most others on here. In it, I will prove that the content of \\"Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee\\" is gross distortion of fact and reality. Of course, the many Bleeding Heart's, Know-nothing's, and people who enjoy spending their time feeling sorry for some cause (in this case, the American Indian) will want to stone me to death for such blasphemy of their \\"God's Gospel Truth\\" version of frontier history. However, I dare you to read my point-by-point debunking of this book through entirely before making up your mind to purchase it.1. The view of many who post reviews here is that \\"Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee\\" contains \\"authentic\\" statements and discourses from various wild and hostile Indians. These flowery, high-sounding statements are taken as FACT concerning the Indian's spirituality and intellectual capacities, not to mention their \\"feelings\\" about war with European invaders.FACT: The only words on record from any of the Indians featured in this book were obtained through interpreters. No Indian featured in this book could speak English, or even broken English while free or just after settling on reservations, well enough to make complex statements about anything. Those who interpreted their words on all occasions were rough-and-ready frontier scouts, semi-educated Indians of tribes allied to the European invaders, or US Government Agents on reservations - none of whom had the command of the English language to provide renditions of such flowery, high-sounding statements. Therefore, it must be assumed that all statements in this book were generated by Eastern journalists, professional philanthropists, and sky-pie Eastern Liberals of the days shortly after the tribes had been passified - all Whites who had never seen a wild Indian in their lives, but who wanted to romantacize these wild Indians and construct an image of them as being some sort of Red Aristocrats or feather-wearing Philosopher-Sages of the plains (in much the same way crank movies like Dances With Wolves do today). There is no way on earth that these statements contained in \\"Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee\\" came directly from the lips of any hostile leader or warrior. Even if \\"official\\" sources, such as Government personnel were responsible for interpreting SOME of the statements in \\"Bury My Heart...\\" they still cannot be considered as authentic word-for-word translations because Indian languages didn't have many of the descriptives found in these high-toned and eloquent statements and they seem like an attempt to make conquered enemies appear more noble, refined, and elite than they actually were - perhaps to bolster the ego of those running the Federal Government, the Army, etc.2. The view of Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee is that Indian \\"Lands\\" existed as distinct and definable territories until invaded by Europeans.FACT: The Indians of the western frontier were nomadic and constantly at war with one another over the best hunting grounds. Before the arrival of Europeans, these Indians existed at the Stone Age level with no technology beyond stone, bone, or wooden-tipped arrows, lances, and simple bows. They did NOT comprise \\"Nations\\" because they had no DEFINED TERRITORIES in which they lived, nor any set system of politics. They existed as wandering TRIBES and operated within these tribes as BANDS.3. The view of Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee is that Indian \\"Nations\\" lived upon their ancestral \\"Lands\\" for countless generations until they were dispossessed by invading Europeans.FACT: No Indian tribe ever had a distinct and stable \\"homeland\\". Here are some examples of what I mean. During the early years of the fur trade, the Sioux existed in the forests of eastern Canada until being driven out onto the plains of what is now Minnesota, the Dakotas, Wyoming, and Nebraska by other tribes who obtained fire arms from trade with the French and British. Once on the plains, the Sioux attacked the Kiowa and Cheyenne, who lived at that time around the Black Hills area, and drove these tribes southward. The Sioux also attempted to totally exterminate the Pawnee and Absaroke (Crow) tribes, but were unsuccessful because the warriors of these two tribes were superior fighters even though far fewer in numbers than the Sioux.Equally, the Comanche (who through linguistic similarities can be traced to Aztecan roots deep in Old Mexico) had been living in what became Montana for a few generations until they were attacked and driven south by the Crow and Blackfoot. The Comanche eventually ended up on the southern plains of what became the States of Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, and New Mexico. Here they ran into large bands of the Apache tribe. The Comanche were both fierce and prolific (numbering over 20,000 at their zenith) and they slaughtered the Apache - some bands to total extermination - and drove the remaining survivors of other bands west into the mountans of New Mexico and Arizona, and south into Mexico.The Crow tribe seems to have originated in some swampy locale, because the names they often gave their offspring (Alligator-Stands-Up, for example) did not match any animal of the northern plains where they were living at the time of European migration.These are just a few examples of how the various tribes contiually shifted around the continent, driven to do so by pressures applied by enemy tribes.4. The view of Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee holds that the Indians were natural conservationists who \\"loved the land and their animal brothers\\" and who only took what they needed in their hunting - never wasting anything.FACT: Unknown to most people, the horse existed in the Americas in prehistoric times. Europeans were NOT responsible for the first appearance of the horse on this side of the world. However, by the time Europeans arrived with domesticated horses, the Indians had long since hunted the prehistoric horses to extinction as a source of food (by the way, the prehistoric form of the horse is still alive and well in Eastern Russia - \\"Prezwalzki's Horse\\"). Also, the Indians saw nothing wrong with destroying entire herds of bison even if they didn't need the supplies that so many dead animals offered. I call attention to the \\"Head Smashed In\\" Buffalo Jump in Alberta, Canada as an example of this. Whole herds were stampeded off these cliffs and their remains were casually used by the Indians until sufficient supplies were obtained, and the rest of the dead bison were left to waste.Also, captive White children who were restored to their families by the Texas Rangers and US Army after being taken by marauding Apache and Comanche in Texas told of how these Indians commonly killed bison and only drank the blood and ate the stomach contents before consuming the kidneys and heart raw. They often left the remainder of the meat to waste and moved on.It is a matter of fact that the only reason why the Indians did not kill more wildlife in greater numbers is because they lacked the technology to do so. They could only kill so many bison or deer or antelope with arrows, spears, or cliff stampedes, and that's why the populations of the tribes remained basically constant and low in numbers. They had reached their capacity to support their populations by means of their Stone Age hunting and technology, and their numbers simply didn't grow beyond a certain point because of this.5. The view of Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee is that Indians were generally placid, tranquil, peace-loving folk who only went to war to defend their \\"Lands\\" from aggressive invasion.FACT: The plains Indians built their one-dimensional cultures around two simple components. These were hunting and warfare. These tribes hunted for their subsistance and warred with one another primarily to obtain the best hunting grounds and secondarily to achieve \\"glory\\" within the context of their value systems. To back these FACTS up, I call attention again to the Apache/Comanche conflict. As I stated earlier, the Comanche slaughtered the Apache on the southern plains and took control of that territory (now known as \\"the Great Comanche Grasslands\\"), which was prime hunting grounds for the southern bison herds. However, the Comanche continued to pursue the Apache and destroy them whenever possible, such as when the Spanish were experiencing severe destruction of ranches and missions at the hands of the Apache in one Mexican Province. The Spanish invited several bands of Comanche to come to that province and exterminate the Apache for profit (6 Pesos for each Apache scalp brought in by the Comanche). At the end of one year, the Provincial Treasury had paid the Comanche more than 18,000 Pesos. Also, many tribes kept slaves. The Comanche kept Apache, Cheyenne, Osage, Tonkawa, Caddo, and Navajo slaves and ran a lucrative slave trade with Spanish land owners in Mexico.The teeming masses of Sioux fought all other tribes they came in contact with - attempting to exterminate the more stubborn ones who the Sioux couldn't run out of desired territories - and only allied themselves with the Cheyenne at the end of the frontier era.All tribes practiced mutilation and torture. Some were cannibals. The Tonkawas, for example; routinely ate Comanche, Apache, Kiowa, and Osage enemies (cooked or raw depending upon mood).There was no mercy or \\"fair play\\" between the tribes and none provided to invading Europeans by most Indians either. It was quite common for Indians of each western tribe to slaughter the women and children of other tribes they were at war with. Or, barring outright slaughter, to use them as slaves or sell them as slaves, or rape and torture them to death while in captivity.The Politically Correct Bleeding Heart stance holding that Indians only killed women and children of invading Europeans AFTER the Europeans had killed the women and children of the Indians ( as stated in Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee ) is totally false and in fact, an absolute trumped-up lie. The Indians were killing, capturing, raping, and selling the women and children of their own race long before Europeans appeared on the scene, and they simply added White women and children to the list of their prey afterward.6. The view in Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee is that the various Indian tribes of the western frontier all suffered terribly at the hands of European invaders while these tribes desperately attempted to keep Treaty agreements and the European invaders relentlessly broke them.FACT: Apache, Comanche, Pawnee, Tarahumara, Crow, Tonkawa, Cree, Blackfoot, Mandan, and other tribes were utterly delighted to kill their Red cousins on behalf of the European invaders. If they could obtain better weapons or trade goods, or if they could hope to destroy old tribal enemies, many Indians happily joined the White invaders in wars against other Indians. This routine had gone on all the way back to the conquest of the Aztecs by Cortez! No extensive attempts to convince them on the part of Whites was necessary. The various tribes WANTED to fight on behalf of the European invaders!Equally, many bands of Indians (Apaches are good examples of this) fought other bands WITHIN THEIR OWN TRIBE for profit and on behalf of the White invaders.Furthermore, the National Archives and Smithsonian are filled with documents containing accounts from personnel in the US Army, Federal Indian Agents, and Missionaries stating how Kiowa, Southern Cheyenne, Apache, Sioux, Comanche and other tribes would settle on reservation lands and enjoy food and shelter during the winter months only to take the warpath each spring and kill the very people who had been supplying them with the food and who these tribes had agreed to peace with as set down in Treaty terms.Since it is a FACT that the Indians never had any distinct \\"homelands\\" in their tribal histories, they naturally felt only a temporary (if any) need to adhere to agreements which kept them confined to one place for any length of time.7. The view of Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee seems to be that the so-called \\"glorious Horse Culture\\" of the plains tribes was \\"lost\\" because of being \\"destroyed\\" by European invaders.FACT: The so-called \\"Horse Culture\\" of the western tribes came about as a result of the European invaders in the first place! As stated earlier in this post, the Indians caused the extinction of the prehistoric horses on this continent by hunting them as food. It was only after the Spanish brought domesticated horses to the plains and the tribes saw how these animals were used by the European invaders that the \\"horse culture\\" actually got underway.Also, the decorative costumes and elaborately feathered war bonnets of the plains tribes didn't exist until trade with the European invaders began. There was no colored beads, no thread, no needles, no colored yarn, no colored linen, no glue, and no colored dyes among the tribes BEFORE the terrible invading Europeans arrived and used all these items as trade goods. Only then did the fanciful constumes and huge, feathered war bonnets come into being (as seen in the studio portraits of the chiefs and warriors featured in the pages of Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee).Also, the classic tepee used by all the plains tribes didn't exist prior to the tribes obtaining the domesticated horse from European invaders. Before acquiring the horse via the terrible Europeans, the tribes lived in small animal-skin tents and temporary hovels, and they moved their belongings across the plains on the backs of pack dogs. Obviously, the amount of belongings and the complex nature of belongings would be quite limited by how much could be packed around in sacks attached to a few large dogs per family. Equally, one look at any war bonnet in any museum will certainly reveal the use of red felt, yellow/white/blue yarn, various colors of beads, glue to keep the fluffy plumes on the ends of the feathers, different types of needles needed to puncture the shaft of each feather midway in its length to string cord through, etc. None of these elements were possible PRIOR to the arrival of the terrible Europeans and all their trade goods!In closing this post, I would like to ask both the potential reader of \\"Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee\\" AND those who have already read it and feel that Whites were so terrible to Indians, what they think the condition of the American Indians of today would be if the European invaders had approached conflicts with the wild tribes in the same way these tribes dealt with one another? That is, if we Whites had used the tactics of the Sioux or the Comanche on all the tribes, where would their decendants be today? I can answer that question for all of you. There would be no descendants of those wild tribes at all. The terrible Europeans would have made no attempt at treaty agreements to preserve at least some of the population of each wild tribe, and we Europeans wouldn't have even considered the set up of reservations. If we followed the tactics of wild Indians instead of our own more humane ones, the only thing that we would have done would have been to wage total unrelenting warfare until all the tribes were extinct.Think about it, and while you do, read the following titles for a TRUTHFUL and REALISTIC account of Indian/White conflict during frontier times -\\"Three Years Among The Comanches\\", \\"Scalp Dance\\", \\"The Truth About Geronimo\\", \\"The Pawnee Indians\\", \\"The Kiowas\\", \\"Nine Years Among The Indians\\", and \\"Life Among The Apaches\\". All these excellent books are available right here at amazon.com, and all blow Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee's Politically Correct, reality-denying content right out of the water.Read them all and THEN purchase Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee, and you'll see what I mean about fiction-as-fact and fantasy-as-reality being contained in the pages of this pseudo-history book."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"The DVD was commentated very well.

The Indians took the side of the British and they had hell to pay long afterwards as they were wiped off the face of America, along with the Bison.Geronimo, Sitting Bull and Custer's last stand. Read about it here."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"While there was apparently never any American \\"Wannsee Conference\\" to determine the fate of the Native Americans as there was for the Jews of Europe, to call the destruction of the American Indian a \\"Holocaust\\" is right on the mark: \\"The only good Injun is a dead Injun.\\" Dee Brown's 1970 book exploded the commonly-held myths of America's native peoples as bloodthirsty savages with a force that is still felt today. (This reviewer will generally use the non-PC term \\"Indian\\" because Brown does, and because hyphenated PC terminology is more irritating than enlightening.)Brown briefly recounts the earliest Columbian contacts between the Tainos and the Spanish (including enslavement) and gives us a very short synopsis of the fate of the Indians living east of the Mississippi (plague and butchery). The main bent of BURY MY HEART AT WOUNDED KNEE however, concerns the destruction of the western tribes, particularly the Plains Indians, between 1860 and 1890. In one generation, White Americans managed to decimate what had been a proud and unique culture, leaving the few survivors just fragments of their past.The intensity of BURY MY HEART AT WOUNDED KNEE is such that by only page 70, a recitation of the Sand Creek Massacre, this reader was already in tears. America's sad record with the Indian consists of broken promise after broken promise, one shattered treaty after another, and a view of the Indian as vermin fit only for extinction.To be fair, not all Whites were so inclined. Frontier soldiers frequently refused to fire on unarmed women and children, faced courts-martial, and reported abuses to the War Department at the cost of their reputations. Some Indian Agents fought tenaciously to hold the authorities to their treaty promises. But even the friends of the Indians were often forced at bayonet point and with the threat of the noose to work on behalf of anti-Indian forces. That most military commanders and civil authorities of the era were predisposed by nurture to despise the Indians is less surprising than the intensity of their hatred, which is often astonishing. Tale after tale of deception, theft, starvation, rape, child-slaughter, atrocity against the living and the dead, and mass punishment for minor crimes fill these pages. In one representative incident against the Santee Sioux, President Abraham Lincoln himself pardoned most of more than 300 Indians destined for hanging. Those who were hanged included (\\"regretfully\\" as the local military commander noted) several Indians who had been pardoned and others who were not charged with any crime and had actually saved Whites from death.Though there was no law or Presidential proclamation that enshrined the destruction of the Indian as an American goal, the elimination of the Indian Nations was a corollary to westward expansion. In effect, the Indian was treated by the Great Father and his Council in Washington with malignant neglect. Most White abuses went unpunished. The frenzied slaughter of the bison (4 million in two years) cleared the range for cattle and sheep and destroyed the buffalo-based culture of the Sioux, the Cheyenne, and other tribes. Brown documents how even the Modoc tribe of California, a threat to White hegemony at 300 strong, was decimated by the U.S. Army when the Modocs refused to go to the reservation chosen for them by these same Whites.That the Indians struck back is not surprising at all. Fortunately, Brown avoids creating a polemic by refusing to cast the Indians as noble savages. Instead, BURY MY HEART AT WOUNDED KNEE honestly portrays them as flawed human beings who miscalculated, often being too trusting of White promises, but sometimes being too rash in reprising against White settlements that were uninvolved in military adventures against them. It was often the case that Indian warriors would attack a White settlement and kill some inhabitants, only to return to trade peaceably not long after, an ambivalence which marked their interactions with (and was accepted by) other Indians. Some were turncoats and betrayed their fellows. There were inter-tribal rivalries and traditional enmities that pitted the Indians against each other and in alliance with Whites (Brown mischaracterizes all White-allied Indians as \\"mercenaries\\" without documenting this supposed fact). Intra-tribal power struggles existed which often forced men to actions which they themselves thought ill-considered. More frequently than not the Indians were prone to failure because they never could grasp the force and nature of the tide against them. Local reprisals simply brought more \\"Bluecoats.\\" Peace entreaties to the United States forces were scorned as temporary expedients by those who believed in Manifest Destiny, much as negotiations with today's terrorists are exercises in pointlessness.It appears, time and time again, that the worldviews of White and Indian were so far apart that neither could understand the other's motivations. Whites wanted to rule the continent and order it, linearly, to their fashion. The Indians understood that the natural world was not to be so ordered, and chose to maintain their non-linear lifestyle and customs. Both sides appeared duplicitous to the other. The Whites broke their word with stunning regularity, a practice that engendered the same reaction from the Indian tribes. Had the two sides been more evenly matched American history might have been much different, but the overwhelming force and numbers of the Whites could not be withstood (it is said that as much as 90% of the Native American population died of European-borne pandemics between 1492 and 1550). In 1890 there were 62 million European-Americans. The 'feared' Indian tribes never numbered more than several tens of thousands in the western U.S., and these were subdivided into numerous local bands and clans. By the time they forged workable alliances, their time was effectively over. However, in those tumultuous final years not only did the Indians raise up some great war leaders, they also produced a bumper crop of reasoned statesmen whose words move the modern reader profoundly.Today, memorials to the Indians consist mostly of place-names on the map. It is far too little. What was lost to America when the Indian was all but exterminated is beyond evaluation. At the time of its publication the well-researched BURY MY HEART AT WOUNDED KNEE was a first step toward redressing the balance, and it is a step that every American of whatever stock, must take. This is an essential read."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"I use to think Andrew Jackson was such a Great Man and leader of the American People and that the United States Government was the wisest and most powerful government in the world. That is until I read this book back in the early 1970's. The way I looked at this country and it's leaders was turned around from then on in my life. I had already gone through the period where John Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, and Martin Luther King were assassinated right on TV for the whole world to see, in broad daylight. And then the cover ups! And the American people bought into the lies, the deceit, that was told to us, hook, line, and sinker. I had already done research on the Kennedy assassination and knew that it was a cover up. Lone assassin my butt! So, when I read this book by Dee Brown the flood lights came on. Watching TV as a little boy the \\"Red Savages\\" were always the bad guys and those programs were made to brainwash the American people into believing that lie as well. And we did. Until Dee Brown released this book. The murderous atrocities, stealing their land for gold, rapes of young boys, women and men by United States Soldiers, were all allowed and committed by this white washed United States Government then and now, YES NOW, towards Native Americans should be put on trial and a shakedown of this so called Government \\"for the people\\" should be the least we as Americans should do. But most Americans watch the six o' clock evening news and that is the only gospel they will ever know or believe. Of course white America made excuses and perpetuated lies to try and discredit Dee Brown and the truth that was told in the pages of this explosive book, over 30 years ago now. But, after selling 5 million copies and still climbing, it has stood the test of time and it's opposers. If you never read another book besides this one, as long as you live, this should be the book.

The white mans greed for land is what led to the end of the real Native Americans. This story needs to be told to the entire population of the world.

I made many wonderful friends, including my Dakota partner. The book doesn't lie, I have heard those same stories from the mouths of elders and young alike. Passed down through their families, the stories still live on. Dee Brown has written a book about these same stories, he does it in a way that makes us all sit and think. After reading the book again, it has the same effect on my soul, except now it is more personal as I have visited the places in the book and heard the voices too.

The ignorance of society and racism are both shown in the extreme in this book, and its overall value in the modern world is its strong message that you can't forget history, because it can repeat itself, and that history is written by those who win wars. The Indians were ignorant of our culture (as European Americans) and we were of theirs. However, our ignorance developed into racism while theirs was a sense of reverence and awe. The Book reads as a betrayel of an abusive father to his ignorant son, when it is actually the annihilation of numerous indigenous cultures by a more powerful one. Chapter by chapter, the whole work is one of repetition: the destruction of each one of the great North American Indian tribes by settlers and military forces. One might compare the happenings detailed in this book to the hardships of African American Slavery in the United States. However, Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee is an account of perpetual heartbreak and destruction on a level unmatched by any hardship I have read of save the holocaust. Many repressed minorities have been assimilated into the modern US culture, but where are the Native Americans? The Paiutes, the Navajos, the Apaches, the Cheyennes? Most were slaughtered like cattle and left to die on barren lifeless reservations in the unsetteled areas of the United States in the 19th century. History can not be forgotten, or the same thing may reoccur."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"Having grown up in a time when the Indian is the hero/victim in U.S. history (I get the sense that prior to the 1960s, Indians were largely vilified), the book gets a bit tedious. Scholarly? Not really. It at times uses highly emotional language and deliberate glossing over of Indian atrocities to make its point -- that the U.S. Government treated Indians shamefully. This is undoubtedly largely the case, and I'm guessing that in its day it was a fairly fresh historical voice. It seems there was, no doubt a deliberate policy of dehumanization of Indians to facilitate the theft of their land and justify extreme measures of all kinds, and treaty after treaty was broken. But reading it 40+ years after publication it doesn't hold up very well; Army massacres of Indians are told in the first person and in great detail, while a following sentence might be \\"and angry braves killed 11 white settlers in response.\\" Just to take Geronimo's case -- I'm currently reading \\"Geronimo\\" by Robert Utley -- Geronimo and his braves killed hundreds of Mexicans and Americans, many of them non-combatants. Women and children brutalized, tortured. Why? Well, simply because raiding was part of Apache culture, as a way of gaining goods and validating men as warriors. In cataloguing the sins of the era, why would Brown totally ignore this, unless he intended to write a polemic, and nothing more?And the author's analysis is shallow -- how about some examination of cultural differences that exacerbated tensions? How about some detail on the politics of the day that influenced Government action? His point would have been easily made with a bit more objectivity, for after all, the facts will speak for themselves.All in all, an interesting read, and the pictures are terrific, but look elsewhere if you want something more in depth, well-researched, or balanced."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"This classic reads like an American author's \\"final will and testament\\" to the white man's shame for the complete destruction of America's only indigenous culture. Its focus is on the end game of the so-called \\"Indian Wars,\\" which like all of the so-called \\"black riots,\\" more accurately should have been called white pogroms against red and black men. It begins with the forced removal of the Navaho in order to make space for more white settlements and to steal mining rights in \\"legally designated\\" Indian lands. The Navaho are tricked onto a reservation called Bosque Redondo in exchanges for promises of food and warm clothing. But instead (and as usual) they get nothing but more grief, as the rest of the \\"holdouts\\" are rounded up and killed. This scenario is repeated almost without variation for other key tribes for the rest of the book.Except for the summary in the introduction, which goes all the way back to 1492, the book is restricted to the era that began during and right after the Civil War, and ends at the turn of the 19th Century. Not coincidently, the loose ends of other racial business, was also being tied up at this same time. The reader may recall that the Emancipation Proclamation had been issued, in 1861 and then as soon as the war was over, and for the remainder of the century, it was effectively overturned and reversed (or \\"redeemed\\" as the Southerners called it).That these two racial convulsions came to a head at about the same time, I believe was no coincident. The Birth of the Unified white nation through \\"Manifest Destiny\\" was little more than dirty racial business euphemized as \\"Christian racial progress.\\" Put simply, American history is about little more than ethnically cleansing the whole North American hemisphere of non-white races. And in this dirty business, of his own making, the white man was taking no prisoners and no responsibility for his cross-generational shameful deeds.As for the history of the final Indian wars, the only thing new here is that it is related to us from the Indian's voice as that voice is filtered through a white author's prose. Instead of a single trail of tears, this narrative is the story of many similar trails of not just tears, but also a trail of gross injustices, official lies, broken treaties, wanton killing and violence, untold suffering and grief, greed and the coveting of arable land and mineral rights -- all done with no one being held responsible for what are clearly crimes against humanity. The idea that these crimes could all have been euphemized as \\"the inevitability of broad undirected social forces (such as Manifest Destiny),\\" is itself a monumental crime against history. It is very much equivalent to suggesting that Hitler's rise to power in Europe was due to the inevitable imperative of the forces of Christian progress in Europe.And as is usual, when discussion of the white man's misdeeds are raised, the prose invariably is cast almost entirely in the \\"passive voice.\\" So what we get here is a gallery of \\"mealy-mouse\\" phrases such as \\"the tribes were displaced,\\" and \\"surrounding areas were occupied and colonized;\\" \\"they were the last to be moved to Indian reservations,\\" \\"the government's dealings as they continued efforts to destroy, the culture, religion, and the way of life of Native American peoples took place,\\" etc.Stylistically, it is as if no one really wants to know who is doing all the killing, maiming, removing, and wanton destruction of a whole culture? Likewise, and as per usual, the \\"active voice\\" is reserved only for Indian responses, which throughout the book can all be summarized by the simple phrase: \\"the Indians repeatedly attempted to save their peoples by peace negotiations, raids (which is called war) and then by being ignominiously forced into retreat and surrender.\\" Stylistically, this book, which is one of the few that even tries to give the Indian's side of the story, still engages in shameful verbal sleights of hand, and in a complete lack of willingness to place the blame for three centuries of ethnic cleansing and wanton destruction of a whole culture and way of life, where it belongs, in the white man's lap. Three stars"},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"Dee Brown tells the history of how the West was won from the perspective of those who lost it. From the Indian perspective, the white settlers are like locusts who multiply in unfathomable numbers and who destroy the land. Time and again, the Americans push the Indians westward, breaking treaties in the process. Some of the Americans have genuine empathy for the Indians and want to do right by them. But these attempts are undercut by others who take advantage of the political imperative of Western expansion -- or are simply forgotten when the next bureaucrat or military man takes over the reins of power.Sometimes the conflict escalates into the kind of indiscriminate slaughter of native settlements (such as at the Sand Creek Massacre)one later sees at My Lai. The Indians too engage in retaliatory raids against settlers, but Brown portrays this as done rarely and usually by hotheads not acting with proper authorization. It is not clear if Brown underplays this problem, though it is clear that like African slaves, the Indians engaged in far less rebellion and atrocity than they were probably entitled to.The nobility of the Indian chiefs and warriors and the hopelessness of their situation are well portrayed. Less well done is a good description of the kind of culture that was being replaced. Brown does convey a picture of the Indians as living in absolute harmony and in balance with nature. They are a nomadic and seemingly happy culture. But the book does not attempt to give a good picture of this. It is simply assumed that the Indian culture is a healthy one and in many respects a superior one to the whites. The problem with Brown's approach is that he dwells too much on conferring victim status on the Indians. They certainly were victimized, but to do justice to the culture one has to describe it. Otherwise we only define the Indian as he relates to the white settlers.I suspect that while Brown romanticizes Indian culture, the Indian tribes did represent a great civilization. Certainly the nobility of the people comes through in the telling of the behavior of their chiefs.Clearly, this civilization never had a chance. The Americans had the weight of the census behind them -- as well as a technological advantage and a need to expand. Pit this against a culture living in balance with nature with no expansionist needs, and one knows the result.How do we as a people come to terms with our history? It appears that our initial approach was to blame the victim. Many of the negative qualities that we attributed to the Indians were simply projections of our own shortcomings -- i.e., bloodthirsty savages, \\"Indian givers\\", and treaty breakers. It is depressing to see that in the face of the historical inevitability of the triumph over the Indians and the will to power that characterizes American westward expansion, ideology and political rhetoric are bent to serve the interests of the conquerors. How serious are we about out own ideals if they can be twisted so easily to support the accomplishment of a great historical wrong?Brown's book was an important step in coming to terms with our past. Let's not get defensive about it or sugarcoat it. After all, Hitler viewed the conquest of the American West as the model for his conquest of the the European East.The next step would be a more searching study of the native cultures, one that does not romanticize them. And finally we as a culture should attempt to learn something from the culture we displaced, including a commitment to treat the land in a way that does justice to our forebears."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"This is the Classic it was made to be by history. It is the story of conflict, greed, war crimes, torture embedded in the Euro-American DNA. It could well be India, Africa or the Middle East in illustrating the capacity for cruelty and the conspiracy between the Cross and the Crown to demonize humans as a pre-condition to Genocide/race colonization and Exceptionalism based on Divine and Human tenets of racial superiority. In his detailed documentations of \\"wars\\" which were actually massacres, Dee Brown overlooks a simple moral observation that has saturated books on Native Americans: that white men simply had no business here! All the history that sadly ensued begs that simple moral verity. A must read book that should be supplemented by any of Vine Deloria's works on how the \\"assimilate or exterminate\\" imperialism and crimes against humanity endure today in each of our Republic's fifty states.Vine Deloria: God is Red; Custer Died for You Sins; We Talk, You Listen."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"I never read 'populist' books, but in this case I was so glad I ignored my silly rule.This is truly a book which changes perspectives and life views.

This is a great starter book to get an overview of the plains and west coast tribes, very well written, organized, and engaging, but not overly scholarly. It is certainly one sided, does not go into detail on the violent lifestyle of the plains Indians (especially the further south you go), but demonstrates how the US consistently screwed the Native Americans and reneged treaties whenever we fond something of value (gold and other minerals, prime grazing land,...) on their assigned land. We continued to box them into smaller territories, randomly assigned them to different climates and locales, destroyed their game, shortened their rations, then wondered why they revolted. An excellent starting point to learn the key figures and events of different tribes, leaves you looking for more. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the lack of maps. Unless you are intimately familiar with the American west, you may need a computer handy to figure out where some of these places are.Start with this, then go to books such Francis Parkman and the Plains Indians, Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West (initial contact with native Americans and European Americans), then move on to Empire of the Summer Moon (Quanah Parker and the Comanches), Blood and Thunder (Kit Carson and the Navahos), or any of the excellent books on the Lakotas (Sandoz - the Strange Man of the Oglalas, Marshall - the journey of Crazy Horse, too many others to list). Again, I'm not a historian, many of these books have some negative reviews (except Sandoz and Parkman), but I found them to be very readable and engaging."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"Awesome history book of the American Indian.

Every school child should be required to read this book."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"I was shocked at the way our government, over the years, treated native Americans. In many ways it was like the waythey treated African Americans. Our government does what it wishes, justifying its actions along the way, using theconstitution as part of their justification.

What a great loss!"},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"A very moving and thought provoking book about the native American Indians and about the extinction of their tribes and their lives.

Even so, I found reading Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee a disturbing eye opener. This book has more clearly brought home the harsh truth about how we settled the west than any other museum or documentary that I have ever seen. In Red Clouds words, \\"They made us many promises, more than I can remember, but they never kept but one; they promised to take our land, and they took it.\\" If you are interested in the plight of the American Indians as our country-expanded west, then I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"I have to first start off by saying that I have never trusted anyone who was or is a politician. I have always said that politicians lie, cheat and steal from their so called friends. So now on that happy note I have to say that I am some what surprised at what I read in Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee. Mainly because of the way The White men swindled the Indians out of their land. As I read the book I would gasp at the things that I read. I hate to even think that I am possibly related to any of those white men. I do remember reading about the Trail of Tears, when I worked in the fourth grade. I just remember not really understanding why that happened. You are made to think that the Indians did some thing wrong and are savages.This is a book that everyone should take the time to read. There is so much more information in this book then in any American History book you will ever read. We owe those Indians a lot. As I was reading the book I was talking to my husband's one uncle and he said that I would be shocked by the truth. He was right. And to think that all these years I never knew what I know now. I am glad to say that my kids are part Indian/Native American on their father's side. My son has been told that he looks like a Native American even with is red hair and blue eyes.I loved this book and I am going to be looking for more books about Indians/Native American."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"As a traveller from N.Ireland who visited the &quot;great plains&quot; this year, including several of the battle sites mentioned in the book, my only regret about my trip was that I hadn't read this work, before my visit. Having recently begun a study of the Native American people and history, I believe that this book may possibly be the best starting place for such search. The story of the white conquest of the &quot;wild west&quot; has never had so much meaning for me and the Indian viewpoint and perspective has opened up a whole new way for me, of looking at the anthropology of the USA. In short, it's a &quot;must&quot; and a darn easy read too.In conclusion, I'd have to recommend that anyone wishing to investigate the truth of the clash of cultures and the real history of the formation of the USA, should make this a top priority. Furthermore, anyone planning a trip to take in the history of the &quot;wild west&quot; must, just gotta, read this first, I wish I had."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"There is not much that has not already been said about Brown's devastating indictment of the US Government and their policy toward Native Americans. In this masterful work, thoroughly researched and told in a heart-breaking manner, Dee Brown brings us face to face with our own shameful past.Time and again, the greed and unfettered desire for westward expansion leads our government to make and break agreements with otherwise peaceful people. Sadly, although the manner in which Native Americans are shuffled off their land form an all too familiar pattern, the story never seems stale or predictable. Indeed, one is struck more by the sense of &quot;now what will they (the US government do) to act in an even more duplicitous manner.&quot; While we may want to turn a blind eye to the actions of our government, after reading Brown's seminal work, you will be unable to look at things the same again."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"I first read this book as a teenager (many years ago). In those days all I knew about Indians was what saw on TV and Indians were shown as bloodthirsty, fightening savages. After reading this book I realised how wrong that portrayal was. I then began to look at the way Aborigines had been portrayed in Australia . It proved to be very similar to the way Indians had been portrayed and it was equally as wrong. I cannot point my finger and say look at the bad things the Americans did. I carry the shame that my own ancestors almost completely wiped out the Tasmanian Aborigines. And in other places of the world similar things happened (and are still happening). So much of history needs to be rewritten and this book has at least done that."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"As a teacher of American history, part of my job is to dispel myths about the past. Columbus didn't sail to boldly prove the world was round, but he did initiate the utter devastation of several hundred unique and complex civilizations. The true heroism of Sitting Bull, Red Cloud, Crazy Horse and the other plains chiefs dims the shining light surrounding the names so often mentioned in our textbooks, names like Sherman and Sheridan. The atrocious deeds of men like Chivington and Custer are bad enough, but the acceptance and utter disregard by so many American settlers who readily settled the vacated lands conjures images of the German population during the Holocaust. These and many other reasons (easy readability, compelling stories, etc. ) are why I teach this book to my advanced 8th graders every year."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"Dee Brown's book evocatively relates the sad tale of the final displacement of the American Indian from the West. The book covers the period from about 1860 to the Wounded Knee massacre in 1890.By 1860 the die was cast for the native peoples of the Plains. The railroad was coming, the buffalo on its way to extermination, their way of life destroyed. And yet, none of it had quite happened yet. The denouement was startlingly swift. Still there were heroic episodes - Red Cloud's War (which wasn't really Red Cloud's, but that's another story), Little Bighorn, Chief Joseph's rebellion, Geronimo's resistance, and the Cheyenne exodus. With the exception of Red Cloud's War and the forced retreat of the US Army from three forts on the Bozeman Trail, these efforts were of the tragic heroic variety with very short-lived success. For example, Crazy Horse surrendered within a year of Little Bighorn. In just a few decades the reader witnesses the fall of the tribes from a state of nomadic freedom to utter subjugation.Highest recommendation. Very well-written and essential."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"I hate to tell you people this, but if the white man hadn't of come onto the scene, then the US, the greatest land on earth, never would have existed.

No one ever talks about that, they always talk about how innocent they are. Read the Declaration of Independence, in which our forefathers talk about being attacked by the &quot;savages.&quot;And I hate to tell you this also, but the so called &quot;Native Americans&quot; emigrated here from Asia Minor.So people can say whatever they want about the horrid &quot;white man,&quot; but the horrid white men formed this country, not the Indians.After years of being slaughtered by Indians, the horrid white man decided that he had to fight back."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"This book lacked any kind of compelling literature required to spark the interest of any person who reads from the \\"young adult\\" catagory.

I recently bought it for my Israeli born girlfriend, who has a refreshingly keen interest in American history, and who approaches it with a relatively blank mental canvas. We've had some heated exchanges over the topic of the whole Middle East conflict, and the strife between Israel and the Palestinians, and this is a wonderfully seditious gem of a book in that it drives home the point so wonderfully that every country has its orthodox view of its own history, yet almost always there is another way of looking at that history which is just as valid, and which chronicles the events equally truthfully...just from the perspective of \\"the other side.\\"Try reading this book and keep in mind that virtually any history can be told the same way. It will open your eyes and mind to many other histories of cultural/ethnic/political conflicts around the world.But I found this book, upon rereading it, especially conduscive to parallels with what has been going on in the Middle East for the past 50 years. The history of distrust, demonization of one's opponents, treaties made and broken, allegations that neither party's word could be trusted because, invariably, some individual or small group of individuals would act in a way that violated promises made by those who, in reality, had no true authority to speak for everyone they pretended to represent, hadn't the police or military apparatus to effectively enforce those promises, and were ultimately held responsible when somebody else acted in a way that violated those promises.Does this sound familiar when you think of the never-ended discord and cycle of violence between Israel and the Palestinians? Palestinian militants who act with disregard for promises made by PA leaders, just as \\"renegade Indians\\" would do so with respect to agreements made by various Chiefs who had negotiated peace deals with American generals...Israeli settlers whose visceral distrust of Palestinian neighbors and intransigence with respect to efforts to negotiate a peace lead them to commit acts of violence, which their government officially condemns but quietly abides. How about Ireland in the past few hundred years? It is the same history of cultural conflict that Dee Brown writes about in this book.The beauty of this book is in the story telling, the version of truth that it offers, the sadness of the history itself, and the realization that the history that ends up becoming the orthodox version of events does so, ultimately, not because it's description of events is more objective or factual, but because it is the perspective of the victorious."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"This was required reading for a college Literature class I was taking.

When I told him how much the lyrics of their song \\"Christians Murdered Indians\\" moved me, he immediately recommended this book to me. I bought it, and could not put it down, finishing it on the day that I started it. It tells American History from the Indian point of view, a point of view which was overlooked until this was published. As I said, the content fascinated me, but it filled me with fury. After I had read about the atrocities committed by the Christians who came to the land, how they reproduced and spread like locusts until almost nothing was left, how they tricked the Indians out of their land and condemned them to reservations where survival was nearly impossible, and how they murdered the so-called \\"Savages\\", and mutilated their bodies in abominable, unspeakable ways, I felt anger, but also shame. Terrible shame that seventeen years ago, as a baby, I was baptised into this brutal Cult of Christ, this Church of Murderers. I have always been against organised religion, but this book really shows the depths of depravity to which these glorified cults will stoop.Another strong point of the book is its unbiased narrative, when the Indians committed acts of violence that were wrong, the author does not ignore them, but reports them frankly. This is not one-sided, it is told as it happened.So, I could not recommend this book more strongly, but as I have said, be prepared for the rage you will feel towards the evil people who committed this genocide between 1860 and 1890"},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"This book is a \\"Must Read\\" for anyone who cares about empathy for their fellow man. Because \\"Empathy\\" is the ONLY thing that seperates us from the animals.Bury my Heart at Wounded Knee is NOT Politically Correct, it is the truth seen through the eyes of the American Indian. It's a shame that we have people wanting to diminish the reality of what we did to the American Indian. Any one of you ever hear of the term \\"Manifest Destiny\\"? Well I hate to break it to you but it was NOT an Indian ideal.The American Indians may have had their differences but calling them savages was just a \\"white man\\" convenient contrivance to justify their slaughter. If you look at the American Indians at the time, you will find their belief systems to be more in tune with their environment than ours will ever be. Why do you thinkthey sold Manhatten to us for a hand full of beads? Because, as far as they were concerned, Mother Earth belonged to us all, not to any individual(s). While us white men are a blight on Mother Earth the Indians were not.If this is the only book you read about the American Indian then you are not getting the total picture but let's not diminish the importance of this fine book and author in helping to provide a balanced view of what happened to the American Indian. They were treated like animals, lied to, spread all over kingdom come, then slaughtered.

The book is good, don't get me wrong. But 5 stars? Not remotely close. 4 stars? I would say not due to it's unbalanced view of history. Are there good points? Clearly there are a great many accounts of things our government does wrong. But just as there are good points, there are bad points as well. Let me start with those.It's bothersome that he gets some very basic facts wrong, such as the way Crazy Horse got his name. Crazy Horse's father was named Crazy Horse. Yet Brown goes into some mythical explanation of where it came from. There are other points in the book he does this.Referring to Crows that work for the whites as &quot;mercenaries&quot; bothers me as well. Don't people question the loaded nature of the word &quot;mercenary&quot;? Why were they not opportunists? Especially since the Crows were always at war with the Sioux? But when a Native American took arms against another in the name of the white, he adopted the bad traits Brown unilaterally gives white settlers in this book.Brown never explores the cultures that led conflicts to end the way they do. He does not explore the fact that white history does not act like Native American in that 1 or 2 deaths is bad. There are deep underlying cultural causes to explore here that he does not. However, this is not a Brown specific problem. Most Indian books ignore this.Brown totally glosses over the reality of how Lewis and Clark were treated by the Nez Perces. He claims that they were totally gracious and accomodating hosts when the reality was that stealing from the white was commonplace.As in his &quot;mercenary&quot; use, there are always loaded adjectives that taint the narrative to say what he wants and not paint a factual picture. Saying things like Victorio was &quot;slaughtered&quot; instead of killed.Saying that it was acceptible for the Modocs to &quot;tax&quot; the whites as they stole items from them was a gross justification by Brown.Finally, the way he states Canad &quot;treated&quot; Sitting Bull. He complained that the US would not just leave the Hunkpapas alone. But when Canada did exactly this, he complains about it as well. There is no consistency with his work.Ok, so those are the bad things. What about the good things?Brown very successfully highlights the problems just about every Indian chief had in dealing with wiser elders and more reactionary youths. This continued rock/hard place scenario plays itself out in chapter after chapter.The above is the well done in the book and really shows the youth versus the old and stands as a commentary to the ongoing theme of social unrest in society and its inherent nature as youth does not have the wisdom of age.Brown highlights the irony of the Comanche history of planting food, then being driven out, then being told they should be planting crops. Very poignant and indicative of the US government in how they treated the natives.Brown also documents well the continued destroying and ignoring of treaties. This is interesting because the US does the same thing today.Brown's book is painfuly researched. This much is clear. But it bothers me that after so much research, an indian death is a slaughter and a white death is revenge. He paints every Native American as an innocent bystander forced to protect himself and every white as an Indian hating racist.Again, there are good points to the book. But you have to be very careful of the loaded nature of it. I would recommend reading this after you have red several other West/Indian books."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"This is a disingenuous book. Brown wrote in his preface that he \\"tried to fashion a narrative of the conquest of the American West as the victims experienced it, using their own words whenever possible.\\" As a result he writes to put the Indians in the best light and the non-Indians in the worst, withholding information that would show the complexity of the relations between Indians and Whites in this period.To make this review explicit, I'll state some beliefs I have about this subject:(1) The North American Natives were doomed the moment the Europeans discovered the continent. Europe had technology and science, and therefore was far advanced over the North American Natives. It happened to take 400 years for the inevitable result of subjugation to play itself through.(2) The Indian Wars of the 19th century involved North American Natives that were living under the material and geographical influence of the European Americans, who themselves, as a people, had been on the continent for over 300 years. To go back to a pre-European influence, the Indians would have had to give up everything brought to them from Europe and the United States, including the horse, firearms and ammunition, knives, blankets, fabrics, cookware, and metalworks of many kinds. They would also have had to return to the areas of North America in which they had lived prior to the coming of the Europeans. Modern claims to land area based upon territory occupied in the late 19th century are without logical force.(3) The Indians wanted to maintain their trade with the Europeans and Americans, continuing to enrich their own lives with things they could not produce themselves, but they didn't want any encroachment of culture or people. They did not understand that this trade created a dependency and that encroachment was inevitable. They thought they were simply bartering as they did with other tribes, when in fact the situation was far more complex. They did not understand the implications of the cultural and technological differences. The European Americans were a progressive race, the North Amerian Natives were not.(4) The noble savage is a myth. No race is more noble than any other. Nobility itself is an undelineated and therefore obscure moral concept. Moreover, its clearer application is to individuals, not groups.(5) The past is gone. None of us can recover what has been lost through the onward force of technology. The cultures of the American Indians were overrun by this force, just as we ourselves are overrun and changed, often without being aware of it. I believe that there will be revolts against this force of technology. The various pre-technological lifestyles of the American Indian up through the 19th century will be studied far in the future by people intrigued with primitive living.(6) What happened to the American Indians was a tragedy and tragically unavoidable. Any American who values freedom and hates tyranny, invasion, or oppression should understand why these people fought to keep their lifestyle, their culture, and their homelands.(7) No one now living is responsible for what happened in the past. Causality doesn't work that way. Our ancestors made their choices. We make our own.Dee Brown does not present any of these points, or anything like them. He wrote the book under a simple formula: Red Man Good, White Man Bad. It's as if the Indians' cry of \\"they started it\\" justifies everything the tribes, their warriors, and their people did. The book is written from a childlike moral judgment. Even the language is simplified, as if the book were written for young, immature minds. Not only is the book strongly biased and therefore historically innacurrate, one could argue that it is racist.In case you're only skimming this review and missed an earlier remark, I'll repeat that I understand and identify with the American Indians' fight for their homelands. I also think they were doomed to subjugation as soon as Europeans discovered the continent. It just took a while for it to happen across the country. The Indians were compelled to fight against the encroachment of the Whites upon their lands, and the Whites were compelled by the onward force of their culture (which unlike the Indian cultures was progressive) to encroach upon those lands. The encroachment, although nobody thought of it that way in the beginning, began with trade. The Indians came to depend upon the trading posts. They became dependent upon the Whites for firearms and ammunition, which they had come to believe they needed in order to hunt and therefore to eat and survive.The Indians who tried to live in peace with the Whites misunderstood the nature of white culture and therefore white encroachment. They thought they could retain their static culture while white culture continued to move onward and change. Those tribes who raised persistent war against the Whites understood that attempts at cooperation led to subjugation. The only way the North American Natives could have retained their cultures in whatever ways those cultures might have naturally developed is if the Europeans had never found the continent. That is an impossibility.What I fault Brown with, in saying the book is arguably racist, is that he writes rhetorically and gives an expurgated history of the Indians' actions in this fight for their homelands. He literally *does not mention* what they did when they attacked and killed white men, women and children; but the abuse and killing of Indians by Whites is given clear language. He's like a lawyer, skewing the presentation of facts to make his client look his best. This was a war of cultures and the cultures were separated by race. In that sense, it was a racial war. But fundamentally, and I believe this adamantly, it was a war of cultures, with one culture destined by the nature of its dynamics and force to win. Brown, in choosing sides (and so ignoring the ethnological complexity of the subject), sides with the Indian cultures and hence with a race, and ends up writing a skewed account that reads like a racist book.Brown excludes any discussion of warfare among the tribes themselves and so gives the impression that the only bloody battles the Indians fought were against encroaching Whites. This also results in his leaving out any discussion of the Indians' views on the rules of war. Edwin Thompson Denig, in his 1856 book Five Indian Tribes of the Upper Missouri, writes about intertribal warfare. In one 1835 incident, in which 40 or 50 horses were stolen from the Sioux by some Pawnees and Arickaras, the thieves were pursued and 22 of them killed. The Sioux warriors returned with the stolen horses and brought with them \\"the head, hands, feet and other parts of the enemies' bodies into camp. The hands and feet were stuck on sticks and paraded through the village by old women. The scalpless heads were dragged about with cords attached, followed by small boys shooting them with arrows, with guns loaded with powder, pounding them with rocks and tomahawks, encouraged by old hags who followed heaping abuse on the helpless and now haggard remains of their once feared enemies.\\" (Denig: 18)In another incident of the 1830s related by Denig, the Assiniboines along with some Cree attacked a Blackfeet village. All but 8 or 10 Blackfeet men were out hunting when the attack occurred. \\"The few men in camp defended themselves bravely, but all were killed, also every woman and child found there, who numbered about 130 souls. This was a terrible massacre. The children were killed and tormented to death in every possible variety of savage warfare. Many were roasted alive by a pointed stick being run through the body and planting it in the ground before a hot fire. No prisoners were taken, no mercy shown. But one or two boys escaped to bring the dreadful intelligence to the ears of their people.\\" (Denig: 77) This was Indian against Indian. In the Sand Creek massacre of 1864, as told by Brown in chapter four of his book, 105 women and children, and 28 men died. (Brown: 91) Both were vicious and brutal attacks, and during both attacks almost all the men of the village were away hunting; but Brown never admits to the manner and brutality of the Indians' own methods of war. He wants us to focus on White brutality against the Indian and to think the Indian incapable of such horrors. This is false, and Dee Brown knew it.His chapter three account of the 1862 Dakota war in Minnesota excludes any detail of the atrocities of the Indians against white settlers and homesteaders and focuses on the complaints of the Santee Sioux. For the bloody details that Brown ignores see Duane Schultz' 1992 Over the Earth I Come. Schultz also wrote a book in 1990 on the Sand Creek Massacre called Month of the Freezing Moon. I've read the 1992 book (and reviewed it) but haven't seen the 1990 book.Brown compounds his falsehoods when he writes about the 1866 Fetterman massacre in chapter six. He mentions mutilations by the Indians that were so upsetting they provoked Colonel Carrington to write an essay upon the subject. Mutilations included \\"disembowelings, hacked limbs\\" and, wrote Carrington, \\"private parts severed and indecently placed upon the person.\\" (137) As I read this I was surprised Brown was mentioning it, then his disingenous, twisted purpose became clear. \\"The Indians who ambushed Fetterman were only imitating their enemies, a practice which in warfare, as in civilian life, is said to be the sincerest form of flattery.\\" (137) Again, if you're only skimming this review, back up a few paragraphs and read the two quotations from Edwin Denig's book Five Indian Tribes of the Upper Missouri.Brown repeats his exculpation of Indian mutilation of Whites when he writes in chapter nine of Cochise \\"mutilating [his three white male prisoners] with lances, a cruel practice the Apaches had learned from the Spaniards.\\" (194) The Spaniards also, according to the Navahos, Brown tells us, introduced scalping; and even if Europeans didn't actually introduce it, declares Brown, they \\"made the custom popular by offering bounties for scalps of their respective enemies.\\" (25) In Brown's version of history, the Indians are never to blame. Whatever cruelty they have was taught them by others outside their race.\\"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee\\" was a brilliant choice for a title, and it helped make the book known by far more people than have ever read it. Brown's narrative style is simple and clear, putting the reader in the primitive mindset of the 19th century Indian. This makes the book easy to read, although the linguistic and intellectual simplicity is tiring. The political and moral simplicity is doubtless appealing to those inclined to simple judgments. It may be pertinent that the book was written during the Vietnam war, militant racial unrest, the civil rights movement, the \\"back to nature\\" movement, the ecology movement, the \\"new age\\" movement, anti-military sentiment, social protest, and widespread disrespect for those in authority. To \\"drop out\\" of society was to reject the dominant, regimented, technological culture and establish a \\"counter-culture\\" that sought a return to the primitive.At the end of chapter twelve, The War for the Black Hills, on page 313, Brown tells us that after the killing of Crazy Horse while he was in custody, his father and mother buried his bones and heart \\"somewhere near Chankpe Opi Wakpala, the creek called Wounded Knee.\\"I give this book low marks, but I think you should read it anyway. It is affective (I intend this word) and influential.\\"Let me be a free man -- free to travel, free to stop, free to work, free to trade where I choose, free to choose my own teachers, free to follow the religion of my fathers, free to think and talk and act for myself -- and I will obey every law, or submit to the penalty.\\" - Chief Joseph (330)It was a grievous age."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"When I started reading this book, I was in shock to learn that my white ancestors were so inhumane and evil. Even our presidents wanted the Native Americans anhilated, wiped off the face of the earth. Every single page is full of the atrocities that white people inflicted upon them. It immediately made me think of the atrocities the Nazis inflicted on the Jews. Our ancestors were no better, and it's still happening, just not quite as inhumane.Too bad our Native Americans don't control the lands. They know how to treat it and care for it. We're destroying it. The United States really does have a lot of reconciling to do; a lot to make right. Read this book and you'll see what I'm talking about."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"I read this book when it was first published and here it is 2006, some 30 years later, and I think of how much it has influenced my world view over the years. My grandmother of English descent provided care to 30 orphan Indian children. When I was a child the Columbia River Gorge, near where I grew up, was still a wild river, not plugged up with hydro dams as it is now. We'd go buy salmon from the Indians at Celilo Falls. We went to the Pendleton Round-up every fall and watched as these people and their festivities--the tipis, dogs, and horses--took over the town alongside the cowboys. My school gave field trips, riding the train to Toppenish to visit the Indians living there. Going back further, one of my great grandmothers was an acquaintance of Chief Joseph of the Nez Perce.As a child, I could see a lot of dignity and pride in these people around me, but also a heck of a lot of hurt. As time went on and their presence in my life slipped away because of our modern blandification and the destruction of the natural habitat in which they they sustained themselves, I sort of removed them from my consciousness. The members of the tribes that I knew as a child--primarily Cayuse--are just not around me anymore since I moved. I know there are other indigenous American peoples around me here in California that have also been homogenized into our culture. I sometimes recognize their distinct features.When the American Indian Movement took over Alcatraz, my wife and I donated food and blankets for their cause. So I've always had a heart for these people. My paternal grandmother was part Cherokee as well, so maybe that's where my affinity for them comes from.When I read this book, I remember feeling a new pain inside of me that lasted for months and then I grew angry. The anger turned to a deep mistrust of the \\"system\\", mixed in with a little fear. This has been an unconscious, inexpressible value for me for a long time, as though I've been haunted. When I learned to stoop under my desk as a child in the 1950s and was told by my teacher to pretend that the Soviets were about to destroy everything, when I was challenged by the SS System to go to Vietnam or go to jail, I learned at an experiential level to be mistrustful. What this book did for me, then, was to validate my feelings.I've visited the Winchester Mystery Mansion in San Jose several times over the years. Sarah Winchester inherited the fortune made from Winchester rifles, the gun of choice for killing native Americans. Sarah had seances in her mansion to keep the ghosts of the dead victims of the rifles from haunting her. A lot of the land of the natives has also obviously been built over with McMansions. I wonder whether the new mansions are an attempt to soothe our subconscious, national guilt.Read this book. In the year 2036 the world will look a lot different, but this book will still be with you."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"A must read.

They were said to be less than human, but after reading this book, you will learn who the REAL &quot;savages&quot; were."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"I read Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee by Dee Brown for my high school English class. This book taught me how Indians were treated in America during the time it was expanding form the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. As America expanded and needed more land they moved the Indians further and further west until there was no room left to life. The Indians were treated very poorly and where cheated when selling land since most Indians were illiterate.This book took place after the Revolutionary War when America was growing and moving west for land. There was not just one Indian tribe talked about, every major tribe was. The book talked about some of the wars between America and the Indians, it told how the Americans treated the Indians and only cared for them selves. Americans would assign tribes to reservations and say they would supply them with food but they would not give the Indians food and made them move to a new reservation a few yeas after because the Americans wanted the land back. Some Indians decided to fight back like the chief Red Cloud who led his warrior to battle and took over the Powder River Country, other Indians raided stations, outpost, and many wagons in search of food and for ammo to hunt buffalo and fight the Americans. Indians were treated horribly.After Reading this book I was a bit angered by how Americans acted. I found this book very interesting because I like reading about battles and wars and also history. I would recommend this book to you if you like to read about American history. This book is long but it is worth every minuet of reading."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"I have a well-worn first edition of this book, and have just finished re-reading it. Although by no means perfect or completely unbiased, it does do a pretty fair job of illustrating the methods that the \\"white man\\" used to banish the Indians to the few scattered reservations that are now left to them- and also documented some of the atrocities that were unfortunately quite commonplace in that period in North America.Also, I feel somewhat compelled to take some of the \\"facts\\" that were presented in the prior review to task, since the author seemed to feel that they were debatable:1) \\"The only words on record from any of the Indians featured in this book were obtained through interpreters. No Indian featured in this book could speak English, or even broken English while free or just after settling on reservations, well enough to make complex statements about anything. Those who interpreted their words on all occasions were rough-and-ready frontier scouts, semi-educated Indians of tribes allied to the European invaders, or US Government Agents on reservations - none of whom had the command of the English language to provide renditions of such flowery, high-sounding statements.\\"I'm not sure to which specific statements you were referring, but all quotations in the book are footnoted- with the majority of the most damning statements coming from records of the Secretary Of The Interior, Secretary Of War, Commisioner Of Indian Affairs, and the Congressional Record, among others, so I'm not totally willing to write off the statements in the book to some sort of mass miscommunication, or spurious eloquence on the part of the translator.I will give you the fact that the level of literacy at that time was spotty at best....one of the reasons many surnames have so many variations is the illiteracy of those who recorded them.And we all know that Congress has lied like a rug on more than one occasion, but I don't think that really applies in this particular instance.2) \\"The Indians of the western frontier were nomadic and constantly at war with one another over the best hunting grounds. Before the arrival of Europeans, these Indians existed at the Stone Age level with no technology beyond stone, bone, or wooden-tipped arrows, lances, and simple bows. They did NOT comprise \\"Nations\\" because they had no DEFINED TERRITORIES in which they lived, nor any set system of politics. They existed as wandering TRIBES and operated within these tribes as BANDS.\\"No argument there. But if you think that they lived totally without skills my friend, I suggest leaving you and your family with nothing but bathing suits and a couple of blankets in Powder River, Montana around October 1st, and then we'll come back around June after it thaws out and we'll see how y'all are doin? And let's not forget who it was that showed some of the early colonists how to survive long enough to see the next ship make it across the ocean from Europe....3) \\"Here are some examples of what I mean. During the early years of the fur trade, the Sioux existed in the forests of eastern Canada until being driven out onto the plains of what is now Minnesota, the Dakotas, Wyoming, and Nebraska by other tribes who obtained fire arms from trade with the French and British. Once on the plains, the Sioux attacked the Kiowa and Cheyenne, who lived at that time around the Black Hills area, and drove these tribes southward. The Sioux also attempted to totally exterminate the Pawnee and Absaroke (Crow) tribes....\\"Being a decendant of Nicolas Marsolet, I know a little bit about the fur trade, and the migration of the Indians from Canada into the plains....in fact, many of my ancestors were killed by the Sioux and the Iroquois.Interesting fact about Marsolet....he was on the first ship to Quebec from France, and was \\"traded\\" to the Indian tribes for one of their braves for several years. Later, he became the official interpretor for the Iroquois, arranging several treaties between the Indians and France. However, it is believed that he felt sympathy for the Indians, and was charged with treason on those same grounds.4) \\"Unknown to most people, the horse existed in the Americas in prehistoric times. Europeans were NOT responsible for the first appearance of the horse on this side of the world. However, by the time Europeans arrived with domesticated horses, the Indians had long since hunted the prehistoric horses to extinction as a source of food.\\"Sorry to throw a little Zoology and Darwinism your way, but the horse is a perfect example of an animal that is on it's way to an abrupt dead end in it's evolutionary path to extinction- Indians, or no Indians.5) \\"There was no mercy or \\"fair play\\" between the tribes and none provided to invading Europeans by most Indians either. It was quite common for Indians of each western tribe to slaughter the women and children of other tribes they were at war with. Or, barring outright slaughter, to use them as slaves or sell them as slaves, or rape and torture them to death while in captivity.\\"Ahem. Name me one race of people on this planet who *hasn't* done exactly what you just stated above. Or heck, better yet, maybe just open a newspaper.6) \\"If they could obtain better weapons or trade goods, or if they could hope to destroy old tribal enemies, many Indians happily joined the White invaders in wars against other Indians.\\"I believe that in the book, that situation is described as being a b-r-i-b-e.7) \\"Also, the decorative costumes and elaborately feathered war bonnets of the plains tribes didn't exist until trade with the European invaders began. There was no colored beads, no thread, no needles, no colored yarn, no colored linen, no glue, and no colored dyes among the tribes BEFORE the terrible invading Europeans arrived and used all these items as trade goods.\\"It's funny, I've handled some authentic artifacts, and I sure don't remember seeing any signs of needles, thread, linen, or glue? As for there not being any colorful yarn, I think you had better recheck that theory....because I know for a fact many colorful dyes are of Indian origin, made from substances such as oak galls, marigolds, bark, and lichens.Hard to believe that we're in the 21st century, yet here in our country we *still* have areas set aside as \\"reservations\\" for a certain race of people."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"I chose this book because I like to read about history. This is not the history you learned in school. This is the native american view of the way it was. This is not the movie version of the American west. If you want a different version of what happened this is a great place to start."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"Here is one of the greatest multi Indian tribe books with superb illustrations. I was so glad I bought the illustrated edition.The late great author Dee Brown( 25 great books) wrote an epic classic in Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee. It made the top lists when it was published and became an epic classic. Dee Brown only had a Librarian degree and not a PHD, so many of the academia tops scoffed at him saying how could he know so much about Indians without a PHD.We see the various tribes throughout North America, starting when Christopher Columbus landed on the West Indies islands and the Indians he encountered. The various tribes throughout the centuries and decades toward the 1900s are shown. The 544 page book read very well with no boring parts. Dee Brown took the \\"more Indian\\" point of view, seeing the approaching white man storming into their lands from the east rather than the \\"white man's\\" view of \\"Manifest Destiny\\" pointing towards the west.We see the many times various times the Indians initially helped the first white men into their lands with food and assistance. Unfortunately it became an increasing flood of people wanting more of their land, gold under their land, senseless killing of their buffalo and need of their land for railroad usage. Some of the Indians believed the land belonged to no one and all should use it smartly, without destroying it and its creatures and plants. The book shows the whites had other ideas as to what they decided was important.Time after time treaties with the US Government are arranged with the Indians and become useless as settlers, miners and railroad officials bypassed the treaties. Political pull was used in Washington to break treaties and bury the Indians. We see the greedy Indian agents and corrupt Federal Indian department giving the Indians poor meat, shoddy blankets, and poor working guns...if at all. Many times the Indians got nothing. They were herded like cattle onto smaller and small reservations in states they were not acclimated to and died by the thousands of starvation and various diseases.To me it was no wonder why many revolted and attacked the whites. Many of the Indians thought they were going to be exterminated.We see the many massacres and inhumane atrocities the whites did against the Indians and the massacres and atrocities the red man gave the whites. What was really sad was thousands of both whites and Indians were innocent victims who never had bothered each other but were killed because of their race.I won't ruin the suburb ending of the book about the slaughter/ massacre of the Indians at Wounded Knee and the end of the Indian dream.This epic classic belongs in anyone's library interested in the Indian/white man interaction in the 1700-1800s and those wanting some of the Indians view of what happened and why they were at times forced to act like they did. 5 stars plus. I can't wait to read Dee Brown's book on the Civil War."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"This chronology of how the West (and East) was won, or, more precisely, stolen, from the Native Americans is not for the faint of heart. The author provides a graphic blow by blow, tribe by tribe account of the deceitful tactics that the American government employed repeatedly to force the Indians to give up land to the government. The technique went something like this: convince the chief of [name of tribe] that if he agrees to the government's conditions, his people will be given food, shelter, protection and land on which to live in peace. Soon, the Government realizes the value of said land and so insists on additional, often one-sided, negotiations in which they offer money, livestock, or some other enticement for the Chief's signature on a document that he can not read or does not understand, stating that he agrees to give up more land. Through disease, battles, cold and starvation, the Indians are forced to capitulate over and over again in order to save their tribe, after which they are moved to progressively smaller, less desirable tracts of land. Some Native Americans are coaxed into working for the government as scouts. Eventually, some Americans learn what is really going on and become sympathetic to the plight of the Native Americans, which results in an occasional tribe-specific victory; however, when all is said and done, well, we all know how things turned out. Chief Joseph of the Nez Perc&eacute;s (p 385) may have said it best, \\"You might as well expect the rivers to run backward as that any man who was born a free man would be contented when penned up and denied liberty to go where he pleases...\\"In addition to detailed information about each tribe, the author begins each chapter with a list of relevant historical facts, significant quotes, and an illustration. In fact, the 2009 version includes a significant number of illustrations as well as about 20 mini-stories by various authors on such subjects as: beadwork, buffalo, and Native American or American persons of interest, a Note on the Text and Art (2009) by Andrew Gulliford, Foreward (2007) by Hampton Sides, Preface (2000) and Introduction (1970), both by the author.Best of the book: extreme detail, photographs, and illustrations. Worst, textbook-like style may make for slow going (or avoidance altogether) for us average readers. In summary, excellent content suffers only from a less than ideal writing style. Also good: Guns, Germs and Steel by Jared Diamond, The Last of the Mohicans by James Fenimore Cooper and Nothing Like it in the World by Stephen E. Ambrose."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"The book is a fine work. Although it feels like repetition in the accounts of the U.S. Army massacres, I suppose there is no other way to drive the point home in a brutally frank manner - the repetition in the book exists because the repetition in history exists - the \\"manifest destiny\\" of the Anglo-Saxons brought rationale for the Whites in their annihilation of the Indians. The constant treaty-breaking by the United States and moving of the Indians to smaller and smaller portions of the West under inhumane conditions seems so phony and absurd on the part of our government that it strikes as dark comedy at times, if one didn't know better. The repetition of the lies is so frequent that one becomes slightly bored at times, knowing the next line in the story after a while.While reading this fine book, I couldn't help but be reminded of two threads of human nature that exist, regardless of the time period; first, a reminder of the self-righteous hypocrisy (or perhaps, political excuse) that religion offers, whether it be use of the U.S. Military as a tool for the killing of non-Christians in the American West in the 1800's, or the killing of non-Christians in the Middle East in the 2000's. Second, how Capitalism serves Capitalism, and woe unto you if you get in it's way - profit and greed trump human dignity, especially if your group of humans happens to be different from the group in power.Secondly, about half-way through the read, I arrived at the notion that the American Indians were the perfect epitome of functional Communism in real application. Coincidentally, somewhere in the second half of the read, the author quotes a White leader belittling the Indians as nothing but \\"communists\\", at at time when the word didn't yet have the negative connotation that it developed in the U.S. in the mid-20th century.Other reviewers chide that the American Indian has been positioned as the innocent victim by the author, and that the reality is that Indians were vicious conquerors over their enemy tribes - rightly so that the human nature of clans conquering other clans existed in the Indian Nation, as it does all human societies throughout history. But it is incorrect to use that as an analogy of what the Whites did to the Indians - in the case of the United States, it was genocide due to the Capitalist powers that pressured the Washington politicians, all in the name of cleansing out the \\"savages\\" and \\"manifest destiny\\" (a way to sway the common good man to side with the greedy Capitalists). I believe there were times throughout history of American Indians that all-powerful tribes could have eventually wiped out or absorbed their neighbors to form a continental empire, but it was not possible due to the political \\"stuff\\" in their general social/political ideology. In the thousands of years of tribe conquering tribe, there were still 1000's of tribes in existence, never the extinction of buffalo, never the decimation of nature for profit, nor mass genocide. The savage brutality perpetrated upon innocent children for example, as the Whites did, was not acceptable to the Indian cultures - note that, in all accounts of Indians committing barbarous acts (not just in this account, but other historical accounts) it was always due to retribution (or isolated acts by atypical individuals/outlaws, not a cultural norm). The custom of scalping heads, regardless of man, woman, or child, for example, came from Europe (the Spanish). The author made a fine example of this fact.If, prior to reading this book, you believed that the American Indian society was at the height of human social evolution, and that what capitalism has brought is more bad than good, your belief will be further strengthened by reading this book - not the direct message, but a byproduct, of the fruits of this read.I would say that the book could have used a bit more divergence from the theme for the sake of adding color and a break from the repetition of military attack after military attack - perhaps addition of bits and pieces of cultural traits of the tribes rather than just quotes of the chiefs, more emphasis on those Whites that were indeed sympathetic with the Indian state, a better understand of the minds of the obviously-brainwashed military leaders, and brief mention of the inter-relationship and grievances between the tribes. These are small points however - this book is a classic account that is probably rarely heard, even forty years after its writing."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"Having worked my way (slowly) through Dee Brown's Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee [Illustrated 2009] I was struck with the overwhelming feeling that we (whites) have done such wicked things in the past that any ability to discern and comment from a feigned position of innocence has been fully compromised. I may think I can recognize evil in others, but unless I can see it in myself, I am totally deluded. I also recognized the feeling is it was a complete travesty for the United States to have found the Nazis guilty of crimes against humanity without having convicted themselves of the same monstrosities during the Indian Wars. It is ludicrous that we should fail to see the parallels between them.Historically, there were persons alive at the end of World War II who experienced and remembered the virtual extermination of their race in the 1890's, as well as a number of living war criminals who were never brought to justice. The United States handed out sentences at Nuremberg with an air of self-righteousness totally without any recognition of our own guilt less than 50 years before. The excerpt from Teddy Roosevelt's The Winning of the West demonstrates the hubris and self deception which served to justify US imperialism during his presidency and US foreign policy of the 20th century. To find the German people guilty of heinous crimes and feel compelled to punish them, without dispensing the same 'justice' on ourselves was not only hypocritical, it was delusional. I am not saying that following military orders is improper. Obedience to orders is the basis of command responsibility. However, it was very apparent that numerous crimes against Native Americans, just like the Jews and gypsies were committed by civilians without any possible claim of respondeat superior.I am convinced that ongoing process which is restoring the wealth stolen by the Nazis from the victims of the Second World War is also applicable to First Nation People. Acting as though the statue of limitation has run out on either is a failure to acknowledge the truth. As malleable as that statement is, we still should feel compelled to an honest accounting and dialog with the victims and their children. I do not expect that either side can fully appreciate what was done, but until each party has had their say in transparent, open and honest forum, the wounds of genocide are unlikely to heal.We have a collective responsibility not to hide behind our mythical history of the victors and act as though the end justified the means. We still have much reckoning to do when it comes to the Indian Wars and the Second World War treatment of the Germans and Japanese and their (and our) respective treatment of the Jews and the Indochinese. To the victor, go the spoils (Victori Spolia) or winner takes all, only works when you don't cheat."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"This is a book that apparently was sorely needed when it first came out, and it has continued to be so. To be honest, this perception, though probably factual, bothers me. Did it really take Dee Brown finally to tell the real story about the so-called Indian wars in the United States? I learned about much of the material he presents in a series of books I read when I was eleven years old or so in a series of books in Germany. They were basically biographies of various chiefs, shamans, or entire tribes if warranted: Crazy Horse, Sitting Bull,the Seminoles, etc. I was devasted by Sheridan's declaration that \\"the only good Indian is a dead Indian\\" a decade or more before this book was published. Why was Bury my Heart at Wounded Knee an eye opener? Why does it continue to be so decades after its first publication? My hunch is this: at first it was due to the ongoing process of soft-pedaling the facts within a nation that was still subconsciously enamored with the idea of the \\"Manifest Destiny,\\" while nowadays, it's because the complexity of nineteenth-century American history does not allow itself to be jammed easily into a single formula of political correctness. Regardless of the reason, if you have not read this book or a similar one, I urge you to become acquainted with what his now our history, yours and mine.Dee Brown writes this book from the vantage point of the Native Americans, and the product is anything but light reading. The saddest part, perhaps, is the seemingly endless repetition. Promises made, treaties signed,treaties not enforced, promises broken. Repeat. Brown does not specifically address the struggles, both internal and external, among U.S. leaders because the tribal leaders did not see them. But he is very careful in presenting an honest picture of the turmoil within the Native tribes and the philosophical differences among their own leaders, for example: Black Kettle, who would not take up arms due to his blind faith in the White Man's trustworthiness, Red Cloud, who combined negotiations with physical clout, or Sitting Bull, who would never agree to any negotiations. All them up faced the consistent challenge of controlling their own people, whose anger at times drove them to exacerbate their situation by giving the U.S. excuses for retaliation, frequently carried out against innocent people.Even for someone who is fairly knowledgeable about the facts, because this book brings together so many stories, Bury My Heart becomes something of a cathartic experience. But catharsis should never be an end in itself. We need to go on from there and continue a rational process of reconciliation. Doing so is going to mean working with each situation on a case-by-case basis. May our manifest destiny now be that we stand out among the nations of the world as a country of justice and good will."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"The illustrations, and pictures bring an already well written book to life.

The battles and massacres it chronicles will always be part of our history, a history that doesn't fall off our record after so many years like a traffic ticket. I would also argue, however, that reading this monumental work would benefit people all over the globe, because brutality, hubris and deceit are not American traits but human ones. As Americans, it's imperative that we fill in the missing blanks in our history, especially in those periods of history so often glamorized and simplified for entertainment purposes. Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee does this more effectively for the so-called \\"Indian Wars\\" than any other single work. Six years before Alex Haley changed the way we looked at African-American history with Roots, Dee Brown offered us the words of those who fought, killed, died and survived in the Westward Expansion. His work has been criticized by some for telling this story from a particular point of view, as if the history books our parents read in high school were produced ex nihilo. All history is written with a point of view. That's one reason why it's important that we read a lot of it!Only Shot At A Good Tombstone"},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"In &quot;Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee&quot;, Dee Brown offers a compelling and honest view of Native American history told by the natives themselves. It is a heartwrenching and depressing account of one of the greatest atrocities comitted by one race of people against another - the drive of Native Americans from their homeland, the destruction of their culture and the lack of respect and due justice they recieved from the United States Government. This is a central piece of American history that is often brushed under the carpet. &quot;Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee&quot; is written in compelling, striking language. Your skin will crawl when you read about the Sand Creek Massacre. A must read for all Americans.&quot;I will fight no more, forever.&quot; - Chief Sitting Bull."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"I have never before read a book like this. It is utterly fascinating, a real page turner, and yet it makes you ashamed of something that happened many years before your birth. Ashamed because you know that similar things are happening elsewhere in the world, and ashamed becuase we never seem to learn from our mistakes.On a lighter note this is a meticulous essay on a life long lost, and country unspoiled and beautiful, and a world we will never be lucky enough to know.If you only read one book in a year, make it this one."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"I'm glad that I read this book. I have never read about history from this point of view. It was moving! This version was written for young adults, and I feel that students should be required to read this at least in high school. Many people will be moved to tears and heartbroken as I was."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"Watched the History Channel lately? How about TLC or Discovery? For that matter, read any history books recently?Forget it all.It took about 400 pages, but Dee Brown has shown me that what I know of American history is bunk. This is the truth behind our heritage and our country.Here is the story of the systematic destruction of an entire people. Thousands and thousands of lives lost to lies, racism, hate, greed, and stupidity. All so the U-S could have more and more and more land. The house you live in is built on land won at the cost of an Indian tribe. Chilling to say the least.Brown's writing is so objective it feels nearly disconnected and remote. And for good reason. You can decide for yourself how horrible the truth is. Brown doesn't need to garnish the facts with commentary.Highly recommended, and nearly perfect. I only wish the book included map platelets so I could more easily understand the many battles, tribal exoduses, treaty promises, etc."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"I first opened this book when I was five years old. I would look at the photos over and over and try to remember the names of each native american. Once I learned to read I couldn't put it down. I have probably read the entire book ten times and certain chapters twenty to thirty times. I still have my father's original copy and all the pages are loose. Without a doubt this book will leave a lump in your throat."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"There are things that happen during ones life that can have a profound impact on the way you think and how you treat other living beings. This book had that impact with me. I am a 54 year old Black Man with a small amount of Cherokee mixed in. While growing up in this country I was taught that Indians were/are savages and they got everything that they deserved. Nothing could be further from the truth. After having lived in Albuquerque, New Mexico for three years I have found the Indian to be the most noble of people. I have read this book two times now and I hope I read it a few more times before my time is up. This book taught me how to be a much more giving person than I was before I read it. It showed me that all living creatures are important and that we are all here for a reason. Last but not least it showed me that America still has a lot to learn about treating people that think and act differently than we do. I urge everyone to read this book, but be prepared for sleepless nights."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"I have read some other books on the American Indians, but I must say that this is the most complete volume of their destruction that I have read. Not only does it give you a destruction time line, but also it does it in a very well written and gripping fashion. The author writes as best he can from the Indians viewpoint and I think this helps the reader get a better grasp of the pain the Indians went through. I knew it was a wonderfully written book by the fact that the pages just kept flowing, I never found myself slowed down or bored. It is just page after page of the US government taking advantage and overrunning the American Indians. The one constant it highlights is that the group with the most power can justify any crime, no matter how egregious in their name.In the book the authors detail how a common phase came about in America, \\"The only good Indian is a dead Indian\\". I have heard that statement before but it did not mean much to me. Now after reading about the constant pressure the Americans put on the Indians and the disgusting about of violence, it has far more meaning. When you read a book like this you just keep asking yourself how can people commit these crimes against women and children? The author has also dug up a number of photos of the Indians he details which makes it even more power to see the people that were so aggressively destroyed. A wonderful book that every American should read to make sure we know the real history of the country."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"I'll keep this short. The fact that Mr. Brown uses quotes and accounts from soldiers' own court testimonies lends a great deal of credibility to the book. Although the negative reviews here seem to slip into dramatic instance (ex: Well, my great-grandmother didn't experience that, so the book is flawed.) and selective observation, I would counter that this book presents history that McGraw-Hill is likely to never put in their textbooks.It's a tough, slow read and rather dry which, again, lends somewhat to the credibility of the information."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"I became interested in Native Americans when I was about ten years old, that was fifty years ago, my interest is as strong now as it was then.Thanks to Dee Browns book over the last few years more and more people are becoming aware of the plight of the native american during the period from 1850 to 1890, forty short years that saw the extermination of a whole way of life.Dee Brown has a way of making you feel part of the events that took place in the \\"Civilising\\" of the American west by the white european, the great tragedy is that today it would not be allowed to happen.Treaty after treaty signed by the US Government allowing the native americans land that shall be theirs for as long as the grass shall grow and the rivers run, and broken more often than not by the whites before the ink was dry, and when the red man rebelled he was labeled a savage, where does that remark put Col John Milton Chivington after the slaughter at Sand Creek.I possess a large library of books associated with the native americans and I can honestly say that \\"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee\\" is, in my opinion, the bible on the subject of native americans, and I thank the powers that be that Dee Brown had the courage to write this book and bring home to the world the terrible slaughter that took place in 19th century america."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"There's already been much ink shed reviewing this seminal work by Dee Brown on the \\"loser's\\" of the 'Indian Wars' that consumed much of American history in the latter half of the 19th Century. If you don't feel great rage at the unceasing, genocidal campaign by European Americans upon the lands, animals and people of Native America, then you would have felt right at home among the ranks of Long-Hair Custer's men. Were I born a native American, there would always be burning deep inside me this rage, but then again to fight is in our blood, to take from other people is wired into our genetic code.There are many elements of this book that recommend a reader new to the subject matter. First, that there are actually records of the comments and feelings of the native Americans who suffered through the Indian Wars, in the archives of the U.S. Department of the Interior - what a boon to be able to go back and see the other side's perspective. Raised on a black and white narrative of good guys - the cowboys, or we brave white settlers - against the bad guys - the savage, heathen, idle Indians, most Americans are cheated out of a knowledge of how much despicable savagery was done unto our neighbors in order to take what they had, and strip away their lifestyle and impose our own upon them. Our history leaves us inside a glass house when we begin to throw rocks at others who commit genocide. It's not that two wrongs make a right or that we have no right to point out other's atrocities. But we should all be conscious of the sins and tragedies our forebears visited upon the first nations to occupy the land we love. Perhaps this knowledge is what inspires us to speak out so readily when we are faced with modern genocide. Not that we always back up our outrage with action, of course.Second, I was shocked that some of the truly admirable military leaders of the American Civil War - Grant, Sherman, Sheridan - were the very leaders of the campaign to exterminate the native Americans. Precisely those skills, ability and tenacity that made them such effective military campaigners in the War between the States were used to devastating effect against the native population in the decades that followed the conclusion of the brotherly conflict. War criminals, though, they would be, were they have to undertaken this effort today. Phil Sheridan stands out in particularly stark relief - to him is lightly attributed the horrifically bestial remark that 'the only good indian he ever saw was a dead one.' If the God that these mean manifestly believed blessed their just causes does exist, then they must be roasting on an eternally rotating spit in the dungeons of hell for the crimes they unleashed on a people who refused to live the life we wanted them to.Third, knowing as many friends as I do in the contemporary native American community, one can only admire the general lack of enmity absent in their hearts. Life goes on. For those who survived, there are the every day concerns that all Americans, regardless of skin tone, pursue. But no one who considers the American people to be a peace-loving, kind, generous and charitable folk should live their lives without knowing the full breath and depth of the depravity that we have been and remain capable of.Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee makes you weep and wish you could go back in time and fight on the side of a people who truly lived the grand American mythic ethic of living lightly on and in harmony with the land, relying on the kind of rugged individualism that we claim as an inherent American trait. This book should be required reading for all American schoolchildren."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"This book is a very important testament towards the atrocities committed by our government towards the native americans. The story of the Cheroke's during the Sand Creek Massacre is the part of the book that got to me most. The way our soldiers mutilated the bodies of the dead native americans was horrible and proves how evil the white man was. Over all I think everybody should read this book and consider the evidence of how we destroyed many different cultures on the only basis of the fact that they were different from us. A must read."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"As I read this book of unimaginable hardship for the American Indians, my very soul was pained. For it offers the most truthful history of the removal of the Indians from THEIR homeland I have ever read. My heart aches with the knowledge that my anscestors lived both sides of the war mentioned in this book. My blood is thick with Irish and Cherokee...ironic, isn't it? I, as so many others I am sure, feel torn by the horror that the first Americans had to endure at the hands of those who set up colonies here. This is the first book I have read that tells the story from the view of the Natives instead of the white man. I am proud of my Native American heritage, therefore, I feel that this book is of ultimate importance to those of us who yearn for understanding. While I am hurt and somewhat angered by the history, it is imperitive that I learn both sides of this story. Unfortunately, the only history offered in school is one-sided, thus, imperfect. Let us all long to hear the songs of the first true Americans...The Native American Indians. When you have read this book in its entirety, your understanding will be opened. If we had only listened to &quot;those savages&quot; our respect for the land would be great and our natural resources wouldn't be at risk today. Be prepared to feel the emotions of a multitude; raped, murdered, starved, enslaved and stripped of dignity.

Although I had always been vaguely aware of the genocide of Native Americans, Dee Brown encapsulates the historic details without fluff or bias, jam packing this tight narrative with quotations, observations, facts and figures that will leave you astounded. The photos and illustrations are worth the price alone of admission into this neglected tragedy of How the West Was Won. My only criticism is that Brown mainly deals with the plains Indians and scarcely mentions the eastern and midwest tribes that were eradicated before the middle of the 19th century. But all you have to do is project backwards in the time line because only the names, dates and faces changed. American colonial policy was consistent from the beginning, the goal being to eliminate and/or subdue native Americans for their land and resources."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"If any culture deserves reparations, it's the first nation people.

But the story remains the same. Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: The Illustrated Edition: An Indian History of the American West by Dee Brown tells us of the same injustices that have been done to our Native American co-inhabitants of this country. We see how the first white men and women who came to New England were helped by the Indians or else starvation would have been their end. Brown even goes before those years to the days of Columbus and other explorers who used native peoples to their own advantage. We also read about the westward displacement of people who were driven from their homes and forced to move to a different part of the country, on foot. President Andrew Jackson moved thousands farther west in what became know as the \\"trail of tears.\\" As a retrospective newspaper indexer I read the firsthand account of this in an old newspaper from the times, and President Jackson said that this was for their own good. When reading about the Trail of Tears, I failed to see how that could be.If you've read the book, Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee, this edition makes an excellent addition to a home library.

It will challenge you to examine yourself and your beliefs about history, and will most likely change the way you view the history of our country. It brought me a greater appreciation for \\"the other side of the story\\" when it comes to history, and caused me, in many instances to truly question who was really more \\"civilized\\". After seeing the \\"Indian Wars\\" from both points of view, I gained a greater understanding of how, many times, both sides fell victim to \\"national responses\\" to the \\"actions of individuals\\", And how both sides were susceptible to making the same false assumptions or misunderstandings. I was also greatly impressed by the number of Native Americans that were smarter and wiser than they were given credit for, and I was saddened by the fateful resignation that so many gave into.

Love the pictures in it."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: The Illustrated Edition: An Indian History of the American WestI bought this book for my son before he leaves for college.He has always enjoyed history and I felt that there is a responsibility to face all aspects of our history, Even those that are not pleasant or easy to reflect upon.Therefore, Bury my heart... and Dee Brown's Custer Died For Your Sins should both be part of any honest study of American history although they recall events which are both painful and shameful.The worst known holocaust in history was actually performed against the indigenous people of the Americas after European contact.Besides the military,political and economic brutality there was also a more passive but devastating biological impact, all of which resulted in the loss of cultures rich in spirituality and wisdom that are sorely needed today.Well researched and well written this book is honest, straightforward and true to its subject.It carries value and furthercontains the substance of what makes James Cameron'smovie Avatar so profoundly appealing to audiences of young people"},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"This book will make you cry at the destruction of Nature and the America Indian at the hands of the white man.

It is sad, detailed and sometimes gruesome in it's telling of the history of different tribes and groups of American Indians.

There is a ton of historical information in here and it's very important that everyone understands what happened to the American Indian. But this is not some dry set of historical facts, it is a very interesting and engaging read in its own right. I often struggle with reading historical accounts because they are just so dense and inaccessible, but Dee Brown's work in Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee is the complete opposite of that. Anyone can pick it up and read it, no matter how much you do or don't know about the history of American Indians or how interested you are generally are in history as a topic. Get this book, you will not be dissapointed."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"Great book. Should be mandatory reading.

With the addition of beautiful photographs of the main Native Chiefs of each tribe, the reader gets to know these brave Native leaders intimately. This is a book that should be used to teach the real history of America. The only thing I would add would be maps of the various areas mentioned, as well as marking the various old forts, many of which no longer exist on a modern map. I found myself going to Google Earth to get the lay of the lands mentioned and was in even greater awe of these Natives as they were chased hundreds of miles by soldiers who wanted to exterminate these beautiful people.A riviting book, to be sure that will bring the reader to tears by the tremendous injustices and broken promises by the American government to this proud race."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"I recommend to any one interested in the history of the American Indian to purchase; Bury my Heart at Wounded Knee by Dee Brown.

The author has provided a must read history book for every American. I found myself in disbelief as to how we as a country could open our arms so wide to every nationality but yet be no better than the orchestrator(s) of genocide we read about in Nazi Germany. This book will cause the reader to wonder why we can't learn from history and perhaps question why we continue to change others culture when perhaps tolerance of various other cultures would be a proper answer. Have your children read this book at least once in their life. I did find myself putting this book down from time to time to allow me time to process what I had read. Very disturbing."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"This book can only be described as an absolute collectors item. Its lay-out is superb, as are the many photos and drawings.I found only one draw-back: the only Roman Nose shown in this Illustrated Edition, is a Lakota (possibly Brule) by the same name.The great Southern Cheyenne warrior and leader Roman Nose (Woquini) can be found in the original edition between pages 252 and 253. Charles A. Eastman (Ohiyesa) describes the man in his book \\"Indian Heroes and Great Chieftains\\" in such a way, that only the photo in the original edition can do the man justice. This is the Roman Nose, who was killed by Forsythe's scouts at the Beecher Island fight (the fight where Roman Nose died).I will further protect my book with a strong, clear plastic cover to keep it in pristine condition.Can only highly recommend this book to anyone, who is even slightly interested in the facts regarding the real history of the 19th Century Indian struggle for survival!"},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"As always, Amazon has done it again.

I only knew about the stories that our american schools try to pass on as a cover up from the true Massacres that really happened. There was no battle at wounded knee, just mass killings of inocent people and women and children. This is a very good book, have not finished it, but so far very good and strait to detail.

She gobbled it up and we still discuss it.When I read this book, I wanted to learn more, perhaps read an entire history, about every story or chapter. THere are fascinating characters that crop up, only to abruptly disappear, and many threads left uncovered.

It is the definitive history of the Native American's treatment at the hands of Caucasian Americans... It isn't too far a stretch, IMHO, to say that any person who thinks that Native Americans have had it easy in this country and reads this book will have their beliefs radically changed... It is infuriating, rivoting, moving, and thought-provoking... And Brown seems to just &quot;tell it like it is&quot;, without preaching or sermonizing... There are many passages that will move every person who reads it to tears because it is just so, so sad..."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"I just finished Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee. I'm astonished and disgusted. I can't believe this topic is not covered better in school. We spend all this time on the Civil War and then gloss over the native american wars. I'm fairly disgusted with the federal government right now.The native americans were astonishing people. Think what they could have taught us. It is very sad to know the fate of their great leaders, either assassination or death by mental defeat. They were incredibly smart men. You would have thought that some of our religious leaders would have been more brave and active in quelling the genocide. This is very recent history for us, it occurred in my backyard here in Colorado, and yet it does not seem to be on our conscience.This is a great book. I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"This book has me ashamed to be white.

They lied and killed then and are still doing so today. I'll probably be getting a knock on my door after submitting this but it would only salidify what our goverment is all about....Corrupt! Also read Trail Of Tears and watched I Will Fight No More Forever. All of them will have you feeling sad and ashamed knowing what our forfathers went though just so you can have what you have today. I don't vote I don't suport our wars and most of all I don't reconize the goverment......Why? I am Indian and unlike Chief Joseph I Will Fight Forever. Hopfully some of you will feel the same way.

I had expected to read nothing but senseless slaughter, but what I really read was the story of battles, most of which were fought valiantly by native peoples. Obviously, history is nothing like in the movies. There were a few cases of outright carnage, but the worst was done on paper through trickery. It was not a story of outright despair: I was uplifted by the honesty, tenacity and intelligence of the natives.I hope that somehow their spirit is integrated into the American culture. We would do well to remember Black Kettle, and forget about Custer."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"I read this when it was first published and recently reread it. This is THE book to start with it if you have an interest in Native American History or only intend to read one. It is interesting and heartbreaking. I reread this book and think of all the crises that have transpired since this book was initially published...Serbia, Rawanda, Sudan, etc. etc. and etc. We never seem to tire of destroying one another. Anyway, once you have read this book I would also recommend Trail of Tears and Chief Joseph's I will fight no more forever. And while you are at it take a look at some of the vintage photographs of Native Americans taken by Edward Curtis."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"This book first of all has fantastic details and has the closest depictions of the Indian Wars during this time period. I've read some of the other reviews and was disappointed to see certain comments made about how one-sided or biased this book was. It was from the Native American's point of views but much of it was all too true. Sure it wasn't right that the Indians attacked settlements but then again, was it right for white settlers to come in and take over land that was already inhabited to begin with? They believed in Manifest Destiny and that they had the right to supposed \\"free land\\" and that because primitives just lived on it and because they didn't farm it, they really had no rights to it. A good \\"modern example\\" would be this, how would you like it if the government was to move you from your home in which you had settled in and you liked the area, but then they kept moving you from house to house until you were put in an area that had nothing. Especially, in a centralized location where your food supply was taken away and instead the government had purposely given you a rotten supply of food. Tepees back then were like the RV's of today. They were not permanent homes for the Indians, but they started using them because they were always getting pushed further out to the West out of their villages all over the U.S. When flight was no longer an option, sadly, the only thing left for the Natives was fight... I realize this book in some ways seem controversial but I'll put it as my college History teacher had mentioned, this book is the closest thing to the real deal."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"I just finished reading this book. This is the first book on Native Americans that I have read. It totally changed my point of view on the Native American and on the history of the Native Americans in this country. Putting political differences aside, this book is a must read for everyone. Unfortunately, some people might be turned off by its pro-Indian stance. The sad truth is that the histories that Brown chronicles are true. The American government of the time systematically cheated, killed, and humiliated the Native-Americans, so did the Mexican government. The American government deliberately stole lands that were worth millions from the Native Americans. These lands (black hills) are currently being disputed and most appalingly, the government allowed the destruction of the Buffalo, which was a main source of food and resources for the Native Americans of that region. This book is insightful in its description of coercive methods of subjugation. Many which have been practiced by the government in different situations, specifically in recent wars. These methods include theft through broken treaties, the use of the media to propagate negative stereotypes and to whip up fervor against a group of people, the distortion of law against those who it was designed to protect(citizens and non citizens), the disregard for human rights by government agencies, the use of force and standing armies for the subjugation of people and the killing of innocent civilians.Unfortunately this is what this book is about and you can't sweep that under a rug."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"When this book was first published it was the first history of the American west from the Indian point of view and it makes this read revolutionary. It examines all the conflicts of the west from the point of view of the native leaders, forced to struggle against increased white settlement and their people's needs. This book glorifies the native warriors who sought peace, such as Black Kettle, and those who chose to fight, such as Geronimo. It is a sweeping, beautiful history and tells the stories of great men such as CHief Joseph and tribes previously ignored such as the Klamath. A very interesting book, great reading. It is however not exactly historical, it is a sweeping portrait of the fight between the tribes and the U.S government, it is not a supra-detailed analysis of every tribe or leader.One nice thing about this book is that it is not overtly political and does not get bogged down in jargon, it is a read, not a quest to look down on the reader. It is a cry to give the native leaders justice and honor."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"I read this book quite a few years ago, but up until that time I looked at George Armstrong Custer as an American hero. After reading this book I realized what he really was...a mass murderer!This book will break your heart, and possibly bring you to tears, but it is a great read. It tells the history we were all taught in school from the other side, the side no one wanted us to know as children. Read this book and you'll agree with me. True american history, with no punches pulled."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"This book broke my heart, as it should.

A fabulous read of events from the continously broken treatys, to the brutalizion and starvation of the native peoples. The fact that any survived is a true testement of their strength and willpower and I, as an american am embarressed and saddened of our governments treatment of these culturally rich and proud people."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"To all those who are in doubt about this type of book, you must read it to understand it. As a historian myself who was raised and educated with the other side of the story (i.e. the Native Americans), it is very easy to see how this book could be degraded as much as it is. This is one of the most thorough books that I have encountered and I have read a lot of books that are supposedly \\"Native American\\" based, but aren't. This is a truly inspiring book and I am planning on making it part of my university college class that I teach on the Native Americans."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"This is an excellant book written from the Indain's view. To many times the old tome \\"The Victor gets to write the History\\" is true and the perspective of the Indain is lost in time. Lee tells history, and explains history in a clear and concise manner without all of the glossed over glamor of the typical writer covering this subject. Very good reading."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"When you commit to reading this one, be prepared to cry. The first few times it happened--the American govt. negotiating a treaty, the Native Americans agreeing, and then the govt. breaking the treaty--I felt indignation. How could they do that! And then the cycle repeated over and over again. I felt sicker and sicker as I continued reading. A dull ache inside of me was what I was left with. This is a record of atrocities. An indigenous people being pushed out, nearly annihilated, and left to struggle in the wake of having their way of life forever altered.It made me think.The larger picture is that it still happens on Earth.Somewhere on a comment, I read an opinion that this should be required reading for every school kid. Yep. I agree.Classic example of needing to know our history, lest we repeat it."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee is one of those books whose importance is beyond the writing, it is a force in history itself. It changed American opinion regarding the Native American population, humanizing them in the face of extreme predjudice at the time of publication. This is one of the books everyone should read-and pass along."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"This classic look at how the West was Won (or Stolen) from 1860-1890 remains a powerful statement about greed, suffering, and betrayal. Using single-chapter narratives, the author outlines how Indians of the Great Plains and West were deprived of their land via a series of broken treaties, false promises, and military force. The culprits were land-hungry settlers, greedy prospectors, crooked Indian agents, and an arrogant U.S. government that viewed Native Americans as a nuisance - or worse. Readers learn about proud tribes like the Sioux, Commanches, Navaho, Ute, and Apache, plus top leaders like Sitting Bull, White Tail, Red Cloud, Geronimo, Black Kettle, Crazy Horse, etc. Their goal? To maintain their land and lifestyle in the face of rapid expansionism. Readers also learn about Indian agents, U.S. military commanders (Sherman, Sheridan, Custer, etc.), missionaries, Buffalo Soldiers, interpreters and traders, a varied collection that ranged from violent Indian-haters to some that honestly strove to help and befriend Native Americans. As many know, the U.S. government repeatedly promised Indians certain lands via treaty, then quickly violated those treaties when settlers, prospectors, or railroad interests wanted that land. Such forces played out in places like the Black Hills and Powder River Country, and in events like the Sand Creek Massacre and Little Big Horn. The book outlines overt racism, cruelty, plus outright attrocities - commited primarily by whites, but also by Indians. I didn't realize how many chiefs ventured to Washington DC to meet the Great White Father in usually fruitless efforts to preserve their land and lifestyle.Author Dee Brown (1908-2002) was a reporter, librarian and professor, one who's youthful acquiantance with baseball pitcher Moses Yellowhorse (Pawnee Tribe) spurred his interest in Native American Indians. As Brown metaphorically states in the introduction, readers should face eastward (rather than westward) when reading this book. Brown combines gripping prose, suspense, plus documented footnotes to provide a highly-readable classic."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"This book makes for compelling reading, which is a lucky thing because the anger and sadness it inspires would have otherwise compelled me to lay it aside well before finishing it. As it is, I could only read a chapter a day before I had to set the book down in disgust at the crimes committed against the Indians in the name of \\"civilization\\" and \\"progress.\\" Funny how those same wonderful attributes -- civilization and progress -- are used even today to justify so much appalling behavior, so much waste and stupidity. But don't we all revere the wondrous wars and fantastic \\"entrepreneurship\\" of our country with its endless choices of products to buy if you play carefully and skillfully by the system's rules? The Indians, of course, were outside those rules entirely... they merely wanted to live as they always had on land that had always been theirs; they were completely unprepared psychologically and militarily to deal with the cunning insanity and resourcefulness of the whites. And so everything was taken from them... absolutely everything. The Indians were hardly perfect in their conduct, but anything they did seems to pale in quantity and quality to the barbarism practiced by civilized whites. And what were the Indians to do to defend themselves and enforce the treaties that had been repeatedly broken but, ultimately, kill whites?The only \\"good\\" thing about the history of the Indians who had the misfortune to be born in what was to become the United States is that they were not exterminated quite so systematically as the Indians of Latin America. For an unforgettable account filled with unequalled savagery practiced by the Spaniards you can read Bartolome de las Casas' contemporaneous document, \\"A Brief Account of the Destruction of the Indies.\\"I do not know much of the history of the events portrayed in \\"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee\\" outside of what I have read in this book, but if just one tenth of what this book describes is true it is a monument to the arrogance, greed and depravity of our ancestors. It is a must read for anyone even remotely concerned about the history of our country."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"This is a beautifully written and easy-to-read book. It a heart-wrenching overview of the treatment of the native Americans at the hands of white settlers in the second half of the 19th century. It should be required reading for all high school students, if for no other reason than that, as the saying goes, \\"When the whites win a fight, it is a victory, and when the Indians win it, it is a massacre.\\" Certainly, nothing in this book is part of the normal history curriculum for American students.

I'm yet to read it, but all the reviews on it are great."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"Independently that this book is biased, one thing is certain: the final result of the whiete invasion was only one: the Indians lost it all. Be it for lack of discipline and union among themselves, for inferior weaponryt, for naivety, for traitor that allied with white men, whatever. The sheer fact is: the land was theirs. White people took it by force, in order to make money. That's it.Of course, there were good white people; of course there were bad Indian people. But, up until the publication of this book, the publishing market was flooded with books only about the good white people. There wer almost no books about the goods Indian people and the BAD white people. That's what the writer tried to fix. That's why the book looks so biased toward the Indians.In general, white people from imperial powers spread disgrace wherever they landed, be them Spanish, Dutch, Portuguese, French, German or British. It's a known truth. What Spain did to maias, incas and astecas, for example, was far worse than what Americans did to Indians. But the overall purpose was always the same: stral the natives of their land, their minerals, their food, their wealth, and amke it all ours.This is indeed a classic, one that has stand the test of time. You'll marvel when knwoing about all the great chiefs and their noble fight or even their noble surrender. You'll cry witnessing one by one of the tribes falling down to oblivion. You'll fell sorry that the US Army was capable of having in its rankings some obnoxious officers (every Army has them)...A great book. Even if it is biased (on purpose, I think), it's a great book."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"...for as long as you live.

I can't believe that this book is not a text in US high schools or, at least, colleges. How could anyone claim to know anything about our predecessors without having read this book. It is one of my top three for US to know US. The subject matter is universal Even AMAZON should know enough and be confident enough to promote this book better than it has."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"What is depressing about this book is that thirty seven years after its publication most Americans are still so ill informed about the 19th century history of the West that they continue to give it rave reviews. Mr. Brown was a gifted story teller but he was no historian (he was actually the librarian at the College of Agriculture at the University of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana) and his account of the deeply moving and troubled tale of the clash of civilizations that was played out in the West (and it was truly a clash of civilizations: Irish-American vs. Anglo-American vs. Hispanic-American vs. Mormon-American vs. Union-American vs. ex-Confederate-American vs. New England American vs. Midwestern American vs. Brule Sioux vs. Northern Cheyenne vs. Southern Cheyenne vs. Blackfoot vs. Hopi vs. Navajo - and the list goes on) is, in my opinion, only slightly better than a caricature.One point can show this nicely. Yes, annuities (in a variety of forms) were promised by treaty to Indians on reservations or residing near the various agencies. And yes, frequently these annuities failed to arrive or arrived only in part. But that is only part of a much bigger picture. At least in the area of governmental support, the Indians weren't being treated much differently than American soldiers. In the years following the Civil War, Congress was loath to spend money on just about anything and frequently a good proportion of soldiers were AWOL working second and third jobs because Congress hadn't paid them. The treatment of the Sioux and the Blackfoot and the Navajo (etc) by Congress is part of the larger story of Reconstruction and Immigration and needs to be read in that light. It is very poorly served by the kind of bad White duplicity vs. good Indian honesty out of which Brown weaves his story. It isn't that Mr. Brown's story is inaccurate, it's just very incomplete, and because of its incompleteness it presents a deeply distorted picture of this very important part of the American epic. Read Brown if you want, but also read John Monnet, Vernon Maddux, Colin Calloway, and especiallyRobert Utley (personally I also greatly enjoy Mari Sandoz, but her work, although brilliant literature--I think it's the greatest writing the West has yet to produce--isn't universally admired by historians). At least that's my two cents worth."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"I was told to read this book as i like to read about american history. this is one of the best book i have read. dee brown really did a lot of backgroud work on it ."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"I had an auto mechanic the other day tell me we need to move on and FORGET what happened in the past! That is an ignorant statement. If you watch \\"Incident at Oglala- The Leonard Peltier Story\\" (an activist for the AIM- American Indian Movement who was wrongly accused of killing 2 FBI agents during the 1973 siege at Wounded Knee,South Dakota and is still inmprisoned in Leavenworth - speak out for his release) , and read \\"Trail of Tears\\" by Gloria Jahoda, how can anyone deny the continual blatant, evil, treatment of Native Americans to this very day. If you have read this book buy copies for your friends birthdays and give it to them. At Christmas time give a copy to your friends, relatives, and enemies and tell them to read this book. Anyone with a conscience cannot deny the truth. The history of American Native's blood spilled on their own land is screaming that the U.S. Government should stop the Nazi treatment of our brothers and sisters. But to this day they have not. We need to raise our voices until they are heard and let politicians and the world know we are not going to stand for the way our brothers and sisters are still being robbed, cheated, and lied to. Read this book and if you don't share it with others you are as guilty as the soldiers (I am ashamed to call them Americans) of our government who were told during the genocidal removal during the \\"Trail of Tears\\" \\"... if they give you any trouble use your boothils to get rid of them, because we don't want you to waste our bullets on them.\\" My great, great grandmother was murdered on the \\"Trail of Tears\\" and I will never, as long as I breathe, forget that time or my other brothers and sisters that have been imprisoned, deceived, mistreated, and murdered without cause or reason to this day. To the negative, ridiculous people who have given this book a low rating, ignore them and read this book. You cannot be the same if you still have a heart and soul. This book should receive 100 stars."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"It has been nearly six years since I read this book, but it's tragic look at America's treatment of the Native Americans has lingered with me ever since. It is a look at how \\"manifest destiny,\\" the belief that Anglo-American expansion was decreed by God, lead to, among other things:-The seizing of Indian lands;-The raping and murdering of women and children;-The futile attempts by the Indians to stop this conquest, and;-The forced relocation of Native Americans to \\"Indian Reservations,\\" a similar process that Hitler used on the Jews during the Holocaust.The cruel and barbaric treatment of the Native Americans in the nineteenth century the is still the greatest sin America has ever committed, and one from which it will never be free from. \\"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee\\" is a powerful and tragic book that shows how the need for power and expansion leads to the destruction of those who, according to some, \\"stand in the way of progress.\\" I highly recommend it.Grade: A+"},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"This book opened my eyes to the REAL history of the American West. No one who reads this book can deny who the real savages were. It shows the fickle nature of historical &quot;fact&quot; that a country so used to heralding itself as the home of the brave and the land of the free could have such base and shocking beginnings. Despite the fact that I am a New Zealander, I feel an overwhelming sense of shame at being of European blood and therefore of the same basic stock as those whites documented in 'Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee'. I can only imagine how ashamed I would feel if I were an American. Anyone unmoved by this book must have a complete lack of morals and a heart of stone.

Much of the Americas were home to the natives whether it is America, Canada, Central, and South Americas. The fate of the American Natives in history is crucial to understanding our own fate.

Over the years equal rights in this country has been a fight for all minorities but the native people especially in america have been the last to be allowed to vote, hold political office, own property, and even to be allowed to worship in the way that have done for centuries.

The work includes photographs of chiefs and people of prominence within each respective chapter of time. At the back of the book, there is an index for reference. The beginning of each chapter is prefaced with a time-line of other world events for perspective as well as the obviously well-thought-out quotes of important Native American Indians. Legendary Native American Indian tribes, chiefs and warriors included in this book are: Navaho, Modoc, the many branches of Dakota (Sioux), Nez Perces, Apache, Ute, Cheyenne, Arapaho, Crow, Comanche, Ponca, Sitting Bull, Geronimo, Ouray, Crazy Horse, Chief Joseph, Captain Jack, Cochise, Manuelito, Little Crow, Roman Nose, Dull Knife, Little Wolf and many others.The Long Walk of the Navajo - a people once very rich but left destitute and dying on a parceled out prison-land reservation of unimaginable, horrid conditions - is a familiar walk of the fates of other Nation tribes before and after themselves. Although different in their own ways, each tribe's fate was related in their suffering the same resounding theme of systematic destruction due to the greed of the white settlers.Anything not of the white way was considered barbaric. Instead of assimilating into their host country, the white people bullied and deceived Indians into meek submission to adopt their way and live on unwanted reservation lands or face death. When America had an interest in Indian land, they found ways, generally by brute force, to remove the Indians from their land. Unprovoked attacks, false arrests and killing and rounding-up survivors to take them to a worthless piece of land so settlers could stake land claims were part of the tactics used when the west was lost to white invaders. If land was not handed over promptly, entire villages were massacred, burned and destroyed, the survivors taken and labeled prisoners of war. Tribes of gentle, non-resistant Indians were conquered and exterminated. Cries of \\"Exterminate or banish!\\" were common among the settlers as was the seizure of land without pretense of payment. Gold seekers and settlers encroaching on land constantly provoked and stole from the Indians and then reversed the truth. The building of forts and the Union Pacific Railroad system in the middle of their hunting grounds and scaring the buffalo also heavily infringed upon terms of the treaties. Places that were sacred and holy to the Indian people, were mined by gold-crazed whites and trespassed upon although words of the treaties specifically said that no white man could pass over, settle upon or reside in the territory set forth. Those who fought too hard to keep their land or freedom were automatically marked for extinction. Any white who defended the rights of the Indian people were ridiculed, ostracized and worse.Even if attacked first, the Indians were considered murderers in their defense, yet for the whites, a killing was considered an \\"act of war\\" and punishment was never administered. The soldiers routinely \\"acted with crazy minds,\\" brutally massacring indiscriminately, sometimes leaving 2/3 of the dead as mutilated women and children. The Indian people only fought trespassing soldiers who were on their land and did so with brilliant war strategies. There were never fair trials because it was the white man's law and under that law Indians were \\"not persons within the meaning of the law.\\" They were considered aliens at birth.\\"Let us own the country together,\\" proposed Buffalo Chief, who along with all Native Americans, desperately wanted peace and tried at all costs to find it. \\"Peace\\" almost always meant life on a reservation of the white man's choosing, never being able to leave the military, political operations without written permission. A promise of peace in the government's treaty would always say the Indians would no more be relocated yet they would continue to be relocated, sometimes four and five times. The \\"People of the horse,\\" accustomed to traveling where they pleased in the land \\"where everything drew a free breath,\\" were constantly sent to poor and barren \\"Indian territories\\" or reservations where the people became very sick or died while imprisoned. Tribes had to share the reservations with other tribes not to their liking and were punished severely if they left. Promises of annuities and peace in exchange for their land were continually broken and to the reservations was funneled bad food and sub-standard supplies at best. Still, the Indians were not allowed to travel in order to hunt their own food as they once did. The buffalo were nearly extinct due to the sport hunting of the whites who left them to rot. General Sheridan was one of many who condoned the hunting/extermination \\"to allow civilization to advance.\\" Between 1872 - 1874, 3,700,000 buffalo were destroyed. Of those, only 150,000 were taken by the Native Americans who utilized every part of the buffalo for survival.Long-time Indian adversary, George Crook, who was experienced in the dealings of treachery, later concluded, \\"It is too often the case that border newspapers...disseminate all sorts of exaggerations and falsehoods about the Indians, which are copied in papers of high character and wide circulation, in other parts of the country, while the Indians' side of the case is rarely ever heard. In this way, the people at large get false ideas with reference to the matter. Then when the outbreak does come, public attention is turned to the Indians, their crimes and atrocities are alone condemned, while the persons whose injustice has driven them to this course, escape scot-free and are the loudest in the denunciations. No one knows this fact better than the Indian, therefore he is excusable in seeing no justice in a government which only punishes him, while it allows the white man to plunder him as he pleases.\\" Or as Yellow Wolf explained it, the unjust whites told \\"only his own best deeds, only the worst deeds of the Indians.\\"In death, the Indian people were also dishonored with no proper burial given. Captain Jack's (Kintpuash) body, for instance, was taken away after his hanging, to be embalmed, appearing in eastern cities as a carnival attraction.Even if the rightful Native American land owners had ceded their land under proper and understandable terms instead of under dubious means and sometimes faulty translations, it can be said that they were never given full disclosure as to the havoc and destruction that was to follow as the result from the change of hands in the ownership and more importantly to them, the stewardship of that land. Also logical is the fact that the Native Americans would not have willingly moved from their beloved ancestral homes so connected to their own lives to a foreign imprisonment unless threatened, coerced or tricked.History may have turned out quite differently had the Native American Indians consolidated forces and known their foreign adversary better. Instead of fighting against warriors in the manner they were accustomed to however, their enemy first appeared in disguise as a friend who took the extended hand offered in friendship and then chopped it off after the treaties were signed.I highly recommend \\"Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee\\" as an important, must-read for every American, especially those interested in a fuller disclosure of the truth as well as a case study into the manifestation of human greed, acceptable crimes possible through mob mentality, dehumanization, intolerance, misunderstanding and other hideous examples of depravity.

While describing these issues, Brown does not fall into the pattern of historians of exalting the white man while portraying the native Americans as savages. While sympathetic to the Natives, punches are not pulled about actions of either side. The history is much more complicated than a string of broken promises and broken treaties. The stories of different tribes as the Navajo, Apache, Ute, Cheyenne/Sioux, Kiowa/Puna have similar conflicts that these nations had with whites. Yet the side stories of the inter-tribal conflicts within nations and the different circumstances between the federal government and Indians are what make this book good, which are definitely explained with detail. The only bad things I have to say about the book are the lack of maps to explain the areas written about and the continuous, unchanging style of the book. It is a history book of course and therefore lacks the spunk of fiction novels.Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee is an outstanding history explains many misconceptions caucasians have about the settlement of the west. I recommend it for anyone interested in the real history of the U.S.A., how the real American west was won, from the point of view of the people who lived it.

Brown takes seriously the phrase \\"an Indian history\\" and writes expressly from a native point of view (dating events by year and moons, such as \\"During the Moon of the Red Cherries\\" (p. 264) and calling American military personalities by the names the Indians gave them. The book's chapters are built around specific tribes and the means by which the U.S. government treated with them, violated the treaties, gunned down their people (including in several instances in which whole villages were slaughtered including women and children, with possessions burned and ponies butchered as well), and stole their land.But the U.S. government wasn't just making a land grab. The military and, often, the Great Father (the U.S. president) were also trying to obliterate Indian culture, and could not stand the thought of American Indians free in either Canada or Mexico, and would not rest until they could lure them back and imprison and/or kill them. Brown gives complete accounts of Indian speeches at councils and meetings, as well as blow-by-blow accounts of the deaths of Crazy Horse and Sitting Bull, for example.Brown's chapters recount the individual histories of the Navahos, the Cheyennes, the Apaches, the Nez Perces, the Utes and the Sioux, to name a few. He also follows the \\"careers\\" of many well-known Indians in the struggle to preserve the cultures and lives of their people, and the book ends with the slaughter at Wounded Knee on Dec. 28, 1890. This incident represents the apotheosis of the the government's inexorable need to turn Indians into little white men -- or into dead Indians. (All men created equal, again, means all white, Christian men.)The story is not complex; it has one theme, and Brown tirelessly supports that theme with evidence of the means by which the Indians were tricked, tortured and targeted by a force bigger than themselves.A satisfying anecdote comes in the chapter, \\"Dance of the Ghosts.\\" Sitting Bull has been asked to make a speech at Bismarck when the Northern Pacific Railroad celebrated the driving of the final spike into its cross-country line (which bifurcated Sioux lands). Sitting Bull had worked with a young government soldier who spoke Lakota on a speech to commemorate the moment. But when the time came to give the speech, Sitting Bull stood and said in Lakota, \\"I hate all the white people. ... You are thieves and liars. You have taken our land, and made us outcasts\\" (p. 401). Only the army officer knew what the words meant, and everyone at the ceremony applauded the famous Sioux chief, who smiled and bowed. The army officer stood for his \\"translation\\" and spoke from the script, elaborating on the ideas in well-worn Lakota cliches to a standing ovation. Hunkpapa Sitting Bull was so popular, he was taken to St. Paul, Minn., for another ceremony! The reader can only cheer for the insult Sitting Bull was able to deliver based on the ignorance of his audience. It was one small rebellion of knowledge vs. the overwhelming force of the U.S. bully."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"I first read this book in 1972 again in 1983 and again this summer.

She does on occasion gloss over, and attempts to justify, equally horific actions by the indians.All in all, the book made me feel good about the American Indians proud heritage and connection with their spirits and the land and their simple way of life.

I can remember it being discussed, when I was in Middle School, between the years 1971 and 1974. Adults would mention it. You heard them talk about it on the radio, and on TV. This was about the time that Marlon Brando refused his Oscar for The Godfather, in protest of the treatment of Native Americans by the government.It was very much talked about at the time.Finally, years later, I picked up the book and began reading it. Not only was it in my list of books on American History that I want to read, but recently, it fits into my passion for understanding the history of my own family. My great-great grandmother, Mattie Clemons, was a Creek or Choctaw Indian from Alabama. She was very likely the illegitimate child of a white man named Clemons and an unidentified Native American woman. As a very young girl, perhaps three or for years old, I believe that she was forced west in the Trail of Tears. She spent her life hiding her Indian identity, seeking to blend in with the whites. This rejection of her Creek/Choctaw heritage was passed on to the next one or two generations, and only recently have we begun searching for answers.For people like me, books like Bury My Heart provide some answers. Our ancestors, that lived only 150 years ago, have vanished into historical thin air. Records are few. Their names are not known. But thankfully, Dee Brown gives us more than perhaps we realize at first glance. I may not know the names, or the places, of my Native American ancestors. But I know more about their lifesyle, and what happened to them, than I do of even my Polish great-grandparents on the other side!The book is shocking, saddening, sickening, enlightening, and riveting. It is peppered with occasional comic moments, mostly at the expense of the white idiots that dominated the formulation of Indian policy. Our heroes on one side of the American History tome: Jackson, Grant, Sheridan, Sherman, and Schurz, are transformed into near Nazi-like villains on the other.This mixed bag of human nobility and shame makes the story of Wounded Knee authentically American.I will never forget some of the book's moments: Of a visit to Chicago by one chief, who noted that the whites tended to go back and forth, hurriedly, like ants, with no particular purpose except to keep on the move; of Chief Joseph's comments about schools and church (he didn't want churches because all they did was taught you how to argue about God); of one chief handing to an Indian Bureau agent a handful of dirt, saying \\"Here, take this - it is all that's left of our land\\"; of the Indian Messiah that ushered in the Ghost Dance movement, and generated hope that the Indians would make a comeback; of the final massacre at Wounded Knee, where women and children were slaughtered along with the adult males.The Indian Wars were a shameful chapter in American History. I would argue, with my grandfather, that our horrible treatment of the Indians surpassed even that of the African American slaves. Most likely both are on a par.American policy was to make the Indians into white people. But those that did, by converting to Christianity and building houses and farms, still were forced onto reservations.I would recommend this troubling book to any that have not yet read it. We still can, and should, learn much from our Native American brothers and sisters. And if we can have a hand in reviving all that was noble and decent in their culture, it would be a good thing."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"There's already been much ink shed reviewing this seminal work by Dee Brown on the \\"loser's\\" of the 'Indian Wars' that consumed much of American history in the latter half of the 19th Century. If you don't feel great rage at the unceasing, genocidal campaign by European Americans upon the lands, animals and people of Native America, then you would have felt right at home among the ranks of Long-Hair Custer's men. Were I born a native American, there would always be burning deep inside me this rage, but then again to fight is in our blood, to take from other people is wired into our genetic code.There are many elements of this book that recommend a reader new to the subject matter. First, that there are actually records of the comments and feelings of the native Americans who suffered through the Indian Wars, in the archives of the U.S. Department of the Interior - what a boon to be able to go back and see the other side's perspective. Raised on a black and white narrative of good guys - the cowboys, or we brave white settlers - against the bad guys - the savage, heathen, idle Indians, most Americans are cheated out of a knowledge of how much despicable savagery was done unto our neighbors in order to take what they had, and strip away their lifestyle and impose our own upon them. Our history leaves us inside a glass house when we begin to throw rocks at others who commit genocide. It's not that two wrongs make a right or that we have no right to point out other's atrocities. But we should all be conscious of the sins and tragedies our forebears visited upon the first nations to occupy the land we love. Perhaps this knowledge is what inspires us to speak out so readily when we are faced with modern genocide. Not that we always back up our outrage with action, of course.Second, I was shocked that some of the truly admirable military leaders of the American Civil War - Grant, Sherman, Sheridan - were the very leaders of the campaign to exterminate the native Americans. Precisely those skills, ability and tenacity that made them such effective military campaigners in the War between the States were used to devastating effect against the native population in the decades that followed the conclusion of the brotherly conflict. War criminals, though, they would be, were they have to undertaken this effort today. Phil Sheridan stands out in particularly stark relief - to him is lightly attributed the horrifically bestial remark that 'the only good indian he ever saw was a dead one.' If the God that these mean manifestly believed blessed their just causes does exist, then they must be roasting on an eternally rotating spit in the dungeons of hell for the crimes they unleashed on a people who refused to live the life we wanted them to.Third, knowing as many friends as I do in the contemporary native American community, one can only admire the general lack of enmity absent in their hearts. Life goes on. For those who survived, there are the every day concerns that all Americans, regardless of skin tone, pursue. But no one who considers the American people to be a peace-loving, kind, generous and charitable folk should live their lives without knowing the full breath and depth of the depravity that we have been and remain capable of.Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee makes you weep and wish you could go back in time and fight on the side of a people who truly lived the grand American mythic ethic of living lightly on and in harmony with the land, relying on the kind of rugged individualism that we claim as an inherent American trait. This book should be required reading for all American schoolchildren."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"The recent HBO movie based loosely on this book did no justice to these wrenching stories describing the decimation of the American Indian.

Brave and fearless, they fought hard for the right to live in their homelands. True conservationists, they could not comprehend our greed for land. Said Chief Joseph of the Nez Perces, \\"The earth was created by the assistance of the sun, and it should be left as it was. . . . The country was made without lines of demarcation, and it is no man's business to divide it. . . .\\"Dee Brown's magnificent book should be required reading for all studying American history."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"Over thirty years after it was first published, Dee Brown's \\"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee\\" is still one of the best written and researched one-volume accounts of the forced removal of the western Native Americans and the conquest of their lands. Brown's prose is simple and direct, and completely lacking in unnecessary pathos, yet the message is conveyed loud and clear. This book should be compulsory reading for American high school and college students, to insure that they have no illusions about our country's past. Also interesting in the context of recent events is that Brown included a quote by Gen. George Crook, a veteran Indian fighter throughout the Great Plains and Southwest, who eventually began to perceive (albeit too little, too late) the flaws in his government's policies. With some qualifications, it could serve as an apt description of certain aspects of America's (and the world's) current political climate: \\"It is too often the case that . . . newspapers . . . disseminate all sorts of exaggerations and falsehoods about the Indians, which are copied in papers of high character and wide circulation, in other parts of the country, while the Indians' side of the case is rarely ever heard. In this way the people at large get false ideas with reference to the matter. Then when the outbreak does come public attention is turned to the Indians, their crimes and atrocities are alone condemned, while the persons who injustice has driven them to this course escape scot-free and are the loudest in their denunciations.\\""},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"This well-researched piece is more than just a record of the original American tragedy. What Dee Brown has provided here is a carefully written account of a terribly one-sided clash of cultures - one Stone-age, the other in the throes of an industrial revolution. There was never any question about who would win. The sad thing is in how the cultural collision played itself out. For ultimately a cultural clash is an amalgamation of individual stories. In each case, Europeans and Native Americans alike, for better or worse, played out their conditioning to an end that was all too tragically clear.The natives died defending their way of life, victims of superior technology and organization, as well as dehumanizing propoganda. They died on the reservations, victims of neglect and political invisibility. They died by the thousands, and soon no one was left to carry the cultural banner forward.In the early 19th century, the plains and western tribes wandered at will (or some would say, as needed) over their homeland. By the early 20th century, native culture was completely disposessed; it's representative peoples either locked up on reservations or absorbed completely in &quot;white&quot; culture. This book provides an answer as to how this transition occured, as painful as that answer might be.Dee Brown's technically accurate and artistically rendered account is emminently readable. Yet chapter by chapter, the recurring theme becomes almost morbidly familiar. One begins to be able to predict what is ultimately going to happen after a while.Don't be fooled into thinking that the native culture was any better or worse than that which displaced it. The real message is that we can't blame ourselves for what happened. We can however, take responsibility for what is happening now. See humanity through Brown's eyes, and realize that such things as we have witnessed here can and do happen over and over again. The best we can do is to become aware of this capacity, do our best to overcome it - generation by generation, and follow a more honorable path.The great tragedy is that, in the European's single-minded quest for land and freedom, something precious and irreplacible was lost forever. Read this book, and learn something about yourself. It is the very least you can do."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"The typical reaction is to angelize a people that our nation has oppressed for over a century. This is not the truth, although demonizing the native Americans went hand in hand with the systematic extermination of their culture.Dee Brown takes an even-handed tone in this well-crafted narrative, journeying through the American West with the advancement of the United States, each step a broken treaty. As the world of the Native Americans is rapidly erroded, reactions are mixed: to treat the invaders as other Indian populations always fails, as this is a new enemy unlike any ever seen in tribal societies. Raids and skirmishes do not deter aggression--they only invite punishment. The invasion of civilization is inexorable, and when this becomes obvious Brown does an excellent job of covering the various attempts Native Americans make to assimilate with the invaders.Our nation is by no means innocent. We are imperialists by history just as other nations have been. The only difference is that we took a mass of land contiguous with our nation, while Europeans sought patches of land on other continents. Manifest destiny is revealed for what it is--and the Native Americans are revealed for the human victims they were."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"I received a gift from my oldest daughter in Colorado. She gave me a book called \\"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee\\" by Dee Brown. It is an American history of the Native American. I thought it was nice and put it aside to read later. It sat for several months on the table in the living room before I finally picked it up and began to read a little from it. As I began to read, I found it to be compelling and I could not seem to put it down. I would often be brought to tears to read of the outlandish things that happened and the atrocities that occurred on both sides of this sad event that was unfolding. This history of how our ancestors, native and non-native inter-related to develop this country and this continent.I would think as I read some of the histories, these things sound right, but they aren't the way I remember being told of them when I went to school. I remembered how the settlers had to forcefully take the land or be wiped out by the Indians. Kind of the John Wayne, good guy, Indians, bad guy attitude that was more prevalent when I was growing up in the fifties.After reading the book I was puzzled enough about the difference to go and check some more recently published history books that were in the library. My God! I thought to myself; They rewrote the whole thing since I was a kid. The modern books related a similar story to \\"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee\\".There is something else I noticed as I read \\"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee\\". There seemed to be something that gave the Indian an ability to survive and even conquer against enormous odds. Something more than just defending their land and families. We all thought we were doing that. They would go into battle and it would cost five to ten American soldiers lives to take one Indian life. They had something. A belief it seemed. They had a belief that was so strong and continual in their manner of living that they could survive against unbelievable odds. They seemed to know something in their belief system that gave them strength. I thought of what my Dad used to say was his motto from Sir Galahad, \\"My strength is of the strength of ten because my heart is pure\\". They had that!I had never considered the Indian as spiritual or necessarily good hearted. How could I have missed that? Everything that I knew was based on the idea that their beliefs weren't much more than good stories to tell to kids. Indians were colorful, resourceful, nature minded, brutally warrior like and of course, defeated. They were a defeated people who had lost their pride and will to a dominating society. They sat on reservations and waited for \\"we the tax payers\\" to send them money and supplies while they complain that we don't live up to the treaties that we agreed to. It was that \\"I'm right, you're wrong\\" thing creating a barrier between the cultures so that no one would really want to know much about each other. Now I was seeing a whole new people in the Indian. A people I never knew existed."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"This works from Dee Brown is a view of the terrible Nazi-Reich-like nature of the Westward expansion of Europeans through 'the New World', and the toll it took on the people already living there. This book should be a required history book in high school and college American History courses. Dee Brown did a great deal of research and traveled all throughout America to make sure he got the story from both sides- whites and Indians. Sadly, as a white American, reading this makes me realize that I should not be proud of my forefathers, but ashamed. But more importantly, it gives me a vicarious view of what the Indians went through (and continue to struggle with), in the name of manifest destiny.What makes this account unique is that it is very scholarly while being very moving at the same time. As a whole, in a factual, heart-wrenching way Dee Brown has captured the Native American's attempts to survive genocide. When you finish, the title of the book will come back to you in a different way."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"The victor writes the history, and in the process romantices it and distorts it. This book gives us real history unencumbered by political correctness. Thankyou Mr. Brown. This book is hard to read at times, but the knowledge you gain is well worth the heartbreak. In response to the review from Denver, if this book offends your dim sensibilities, try reading In The Spirit Of Crazy Horse by Matthiessen. Next time try to proofread your review for typos and grammar."},{"Title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West","review":"This is one of the most amazing books I've ever read on Native American history. It is also a heartbreaking, stomach-turning account of the white man's arrogance, perfidy and blatant cruelty. Mr. Brown tells the whole truth in vivid language, sparing nothing, which is as it should be. This was not an easy book to read, but rather a very painful and poignant one. It deserves your full attention."},{"Title":"Larry Bond's First Team","review":"A lot of people did not like this book. Folks you could do much worse. This book moves quite fast and you need to pay attention otherwise, you will lose the plot.The writing style for this book reflects the anxiety of the main characters as they track the components for a dirty bomb through Central Asia. If that was the intent then the authors achieved their goal.However, I think they missed an interesting subplot by not playing up the friction between Corrine (the lady lawyer) and Ferguson (who is trying to get killd before he dies of cancer).This is an average thriller against the back drop of the War on Terror."},{"Title":"Larry Bond's First Team","review":"I have a new \\"worst book I've ever read\\" on my list after trudging through this garbage for the last three weeks. First Team has two things going for it. First, the book summary on the jacket because that is the only hope you have of following the plot, and second, the captions beginning each chapter that indicate where the characters are.Larry Bond's books have all been high quality novels, even though the last one he wrote wasn't as good. But he hasn't written anything in awhile then returns with this effort with co-author Jim Defilice. I don't know who wrote what, but somewhere along the line, they really botched this book up.The story involves a team that operates outside the law tracking terrorists. It has CIA man Fergeson, two special forces memberts Rankins and Connors and a marine called Guns. They are on the trail of terrorists trying to prevent a dirty bomb being set off in the USA.I seriously considered quitting this book after about 100 pages. At this point the problem wasn't the storytelling, but the horrendeous dialogue among the \\"First Team\\". I guess the authors were trying to add character to these people, but every other word was a joke or a lewd comment. This detracted from the story because it often seemed forced and out of place and incredibly unrealistic. I doubt soldiers trade crass jokes in the heat of battle.The horrible dialogue tapers off somewhat and then the horrible story takes over. The authors can't describe scenery at all and do a horrible job of telling the reader why characters are in Iran, then in Russia, then split up into teams, then together. Why are they following a train? Why do they stop? How do they get to a US airbase from following a train? Those easy questions are never answered.This book has the typical computer nerd working in a messy office at headquarters and he finds some useful info and shares it with the team in the field. Or at least I think he did. What he finds out and tracks makes no sense. The authors mention a May 11 memo. Where did this come from. Did I miss its introduction early in the novel?The president of the USA sends a sexy 26 year old attorney who amazingly has gone through special forces training out in the field to go with the \\"Team\\" and to make all key decisions. Ridiculous.The \\"authors\\" do a horrible job of setting up the premsis for the existence of the \\"First Team.\\" They do a baq job of writing characters and dialogue. They have no clue about telling a story.This book is horrible. Please don't read it!!!!!"},{"Title":"Larry Bond's First Team","review":"First off, Larry Bond and Tom Clancy are my favorite writers for fiction. However...This is not like any of Larry Bond's first three books: Red Phoenix, Vortex, and Cauldron. It does resemble his latter two of Day of Wrath, and Enemy Within.I found it a good book and easy to follow, but not to the level of his first three. It is fairly typical of most terrorist plotted techno-thrillers out today. It is worth buying, but only in the bargain bin or paperback.I highly recommend Michael Farmer's &quot;Tin Soldiers&quot;"},{"Title":"Larry Bond's First Team","review":"Just plain awful. The dialog is a non-stop string of wisecracks and one-liners; hardly the stuff that makes you believe you're reading an alleged thriller. And certainly nothing that makes you believe these characters are believable.Oh yes, there are endless descriptions of all the weaponry and high-tech gadgetry this imaginary CIA and Special Forces combination team carries. Unfortunately it's difficult to believe they cart all this stuff around in a truck as they do their \\"secret\\" missions in places like Chechnya.I've read other Larry Bond books and generally he's not bad.But \\"Larry Bond's First Team\\" is just plain awful. No plot; no believable characters; no suspense; no fun. By the end of this novel - if you get that far - you may well wonder as I did, why you wasted the time. My own rationalization is that it's like getting hooked on a really bad movie. It's so bad that you can't believe it gets worse. In the case of Larry Bond's First Team. The only believable thing about it is that does keep getting worse and worse.Jerry"},{"Title":"Larry Bond's First Team","review":"I have been an ardent Larry Bond fan from &quot;Red Phoenix&quot; on and have all of his previous books in my home library. I immediately purchased this new novel as soon as available with great expectations. Alas, was not to be. This book was terribly disappointing, and a hard to finish reading. The story was choppy, the characters only cardboard cutouts that you could care less about. Nothing was in-depth and read like a book thrown together overnight by a couple of buddies over a beer. Even the hero, Ferguson, seemed more of an accident waiting to happen, and inept to say the least, to be leading a special forces strike team. Sorry Mr. Bond, but if this is the first book in a planned series, I surely hope that more thought and depth goes into the sequels. Try reading some Vince Flynn novels with hero Mitch Rapp to get the right idea of some great action stories."},{"Title":"Larry Bond's First Team","review":"Bond and DeFelice have teamed up to create a great combination of characters that jive well.

Terrorists, spec ops, and action. What more can one ask for?Well at first the book starts out interesting in the first few chapters and seems like it will be a promising read. It all breaks down by the time the lead, Ferguson starts talking. When he and his team start talking it is nothing but wisecracks and misogynistic filth spewing out Ferguson and his team's mouth. The characters seems like cardboard cutouts. Devoid of life.On a side note when members of the team call a member named \\"Connors\\" who is neither the team leader nor over the age of 40 the nickname \\"dad\\". It is something that was super awkward whenever I read and bothered me a lot. That is not how normal people talk. I can't imagine anyone calling someone who is perhaps no more than 8 years older that. Just another example of the horrible dialogue.I especially despise the character Ferguson, he ruins the book for me. Somehow he is allowed on highly dangerous deep cover operations despite the fact he has thyroid cancer. It is barely explained (at least not where I made it to. I never finished) what he is doing about it. It just makes him unbelievable as a character. The fact is random and barely affects his personality. Other than he gets shaky when he doesnt have his pills.I could complain so much more about this book (such as the 26 year old lawyer who made it through special forces training just for the hell of it, uh I dont think thats possible) but I'd like to highlight one more thing. Things aren't explained well in this book. For example The Team goes to Iran. Its never really emphasized why or what importance it has to the plot. Events that happened are hardly explained why they're happening. Just more bad writing.So overall this poorly written, unbelievable piece of garbage is better left untouched. I only made it half way through the book and it felt like I was dragging myself to read it. I feel the poorer for doing so. Do yourself a favor and spend your time and money on better books."},{"Title":"Larry Bond's First Team","review":"The main reason I gave this book 4 stars was the perceived realism.

Tip of the spear type stuff. Hard decisions, good guys die. Thanks Nick, can I borrow the others?"},{"Title":"Larry Bond's First Team","review":"This was an OK book. I like both Mr. Bond and Mr. DeFelice but this book lost me after a while. I actually know when it lost me, when the authors put a 26 year old female lawyer in charge of a special operations force. Huh. The plot was interesting but the characters needed more clarity. I loved Ferguson but I knew very little about him.

How could he - with even a little bit of self-respect - attach his name to this monstrosity? I've read all of Bond's works which preceded this awfulness, and found them quite interesting - even realistic and thought-provoking. They were always relevant to the political and military machinations of the times. That's why this book is such an oddball: the plot - as thin as that is - is absolutely unrealistic. The characters are all uber-stereotypical. The dialogue is immature. Its reads like a 12-year-old boy's soldier fantasies. I rolled my eyes through the 1st few chapters, then it got so bad that I started to skim through it, and my life was none the worse for it.This lacks any of the previous Larry Bond excellence that techno-thriller fans have come to enjoy, so I have to assume that Jim DeFelice - the co-author of this nonsense - bears the brunt of the responsibility. I will never read another book in the 'First Team' series again. This is the worst thing I've ever read."},{"Title":"Larry Bond's First Team","review":"I was estatic when I found this book. I have been a fan of Larry Bond ever since I first Read \\"Red Storm Rising\\" which he co-wrote with Tom Clancy, following through every one of his other books. He writes a War Story as well as anyone in the business today. As a Veteran who has seen quite a lot of combat I know.I am VERY sad to say that this was not a very good book. The Story didn't make much sense. The charactors were not developed, heck in most cases, the characters weren't even explained as to WHO they were. I have read EVERY other book by Larry Bond and this is the only one I thought was bad. In all of his previous books the charactors were very detailed and real. In this book the charactors weren't even good enough to be called two-dimensional. Mr Bond always seems to colaborate with someone when he writes (Patrick Larkin and Tom Clancy) and It is VERY CLEAR in this instance which parts were written by Mr. Bond and which parts were written by Mr. Jim DeFelice.Please Mr. Bond, drop the Co-authors and write your next book alone. I know that Mr. Bond has a new book due out in May, 2005. I only hope he has gotten back to his roots in telling good stories with believable charactors."},{"Title":"Larry Bond's First Team","review":"Potentially a good plot, but anemic characters.

It moves very fast and there's a lot of action, etc. It doesn't skimp on combat, etc.But what stood out for me were the characters. They actually seemed affected by what happened in the book - they were more like real people, even the supposedly minor ones, than a lot of other books I seem to be reading these days. So much so that at some points they did things that annoyed me, even though they made sense to the characters themselves. By the end of the book I really cared about what was happening to them and I wanted to find out more - which I think is a sign that it was very good. I'd definitely pick up a sequel."},{"Title":"Larry Bond's First Team","review":"I read a lot...and I love techo-thrillers, spies, war stories et al. I couldn't even finish this book.

Avrech's The Hebrew Kid and the Apache Maiden is a delight. It is full of adventure and wisdom and humanity--that Avrech wrote it from the heart is manifestly evident.His ability to evoke emotion is skillfully displayed. Though the story has moments of poignancy, tragedy, violence and fear, Avrech also displays a genuine talent for surprising his readers with humor when they least expect it, and I laughed out loud at least half a dozen times. I also learned many things about Jewish religion and culture, and about life on the American frontier.Avrech's perception for fleshing out characters I care about is excellent-a requisite if a writer wants to ensure my continued attention. His first-person protagonist, Ariel, becomes the man in deed and spirit in his quest toward the Bar Mitzvah that the ritual is intended to symbolize.Others contribute to Ariel's growth and add their own dimensions to the story: seemingly oblivious Papa, an educated rabbi on a spiritual quest, a boot maker, a misunderstood mystic, and a loving father; the Apache guerilla leader Victorio, a real figure from history renowned and feared for his tactical, merciless brilliance; Doc Holliday, another legend of the West, fearless and quick to kill, alcoholic and tubercular, and paradoxically, almost sheepishly needy of redemption; and the unforgettable Apache Maiden Lozen, courageous, primal-in many ways the perfect complement to Ariel, as he is to her-though we know that the gulf of cultures and the forces of history mean a union of the two can never be.Avrech manages to introduce concepts of respect for other cultures without being ham-fisted (which would be decidedly non-Kosher!) or worst of all, politically correct. In fact, he is decidedly politically incorrect, arming his young hero with a handgun, and exploring how coerced disarmament made possible the persecution and mass murders that historically plagued Diaspora Jews.While this is first and foremost a coming-of-age story, it is also a story about the struggle of oppressed people newly blessed with a uniquely American promise, the Right to \\"Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\\" But we also see that, while maintaining culture and traditions has ensured survival for the Jews as a unique people, the opposite fate awaits the Indian way of life. That there is no satisfactory resolution to this is one of the great tragedies and failures of our nation.I devoured this book in one sitting--I could not tear myself away. It should have wide appeal; it can easily be read by literate children, but also has the plot, story-telling depth and character development needed to resonate with adult readers.Well done, Mr. Avrech. I don't know if you intend further adventures for the Hebrew Kid, but you've left me hungry for more."},{"Title":"The Hebrew Kid and the Apache Maiden","review":"Bravo!! I am so impressed!

I didn't want it to end! I want a sequel! There were many times in the book that I was pleasantly surprised by the twists and turns in the story. It was very difficult to put the book down. Mr. Avrech really did a wonderful job of teaching Torah while telling a very intriguing & rich story (I never knew about the Lamed Vovniks!). At the same time, he also gave a nice history of the Apache Indians. It was very respectfully done, and never 'hokey' or one-dimensional. Too many times I have seen depictions of Native Americans as animalistic idiots. It was great to see how Lozen was affected by knowing Ariel, and how it made her re-think some of her Apache values (again without ever being disrespectful towards the Apache). It's nice to see Jewish characters who are enthusiastically Jewish without apology (and to see how others respect that in turn)."},{"Title":"The Hebrew Kid and the Apache Maiden","review":"The Hebrew Kid and the Apache Maiden is a great read, combining two worlds seemingly far apart and yet so similar!

Avrech's new book, The Hebrew Kid and the Apache Maiden, is a wonderful addition for children (including this 50 year old child).It is funny and touching and you will quickly come to care for the characters who are developed so beautifully by the author.I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Hebrew Kid and the Apache Maiden","review":"HEARD ABOUT THIS BOOK AND ORDERED 4 COPIES TO USE AS CHANUKAHPRESENTS FOR CHILDREN IN MY FAMILY.

The book is funny but also contains an important message about tolerance for all. Hebrew kid is age appropriate for just about anyone, from young children to adults. I recommend it to all."},{"Title":"The Hebrew Kid and the Apache Maiden","review":"I read this book aloud to my two youngest boys (9 and 10). It has been a profound experience, one which has brought us closer together and has helped me to share things with my boys that I was afraid I would never be able to express in my own words.Robert Avrech has created a world and its characters that are vividly real, unsparingly realistic and yet inspiring and comfortingly spiritual- all this in a book that is accessible to my sons, substantial enough to leave a lasting impression on me and written with such sturdy elegance that it is a joy to read out-loud.This is a wonderful book. It is, in fact, a work of gentle and entertaining genius."},{"Title":"The Hebrew Kid and the Apache Maiden","review":"I really enjoyed the characters in the book. I could relate someone I knew to everyone in Ariel's family. The personalities of each character was developed extremely well that I could picture each one of them. Momma's lines were hilarious, the no nonsense courageous woman who tells you like it is. Rebecca fits the mold of the newly arrived immigrant who was taken in by American culture. Ariel's smarts and sense of adventure (with its youthful naivet&eacute;) is every adventurous/precocious twelve year old. Also, the way Ariel and Papa explained the different parts of the Jewish religion were excellent. They were clear, succinct, almost simplistic, yet captured the essence of the mitzvah or explained a custom. I think for kids it will really give a sense of pride in Judaism (or any religion, for that matter) and for many kids an appreciation and understanding of Judaism which they may not get in their day to day lives.Mr. Avrech did a great job in pointing out the differences between Judaism and other religions. I really enjoyed the G-d answered- No exchange in the book, it's a famous concept, and was addressed very well. The exchange between Lozen and Ariel about fasting and commemorating past events is really quite amazing.Another aspect I found interesting was that at the beginning I assumed Lark Ellen was an older woman (based on the things she said and how she expressed herself), and when she dies you find out she is seventeen. In general every character seems much older/mature than their counterpart in today's society. I am sure this was done on purpose and for two reasons, living in a time of war and going through adversity forces you to grow up quicker. Additionally, the life expectancy back then was only to around 50 (or maybe even less) 17 was already middle age. Kids were expected to do a lot more then, then they are today.The relationship between Lozen and Ariel is unique but also very telling. From both characters you see the affection/respect they had for each other, yet each one stuck to their convictions and clearly understood that they were not meant for each other.The overall theme of the book, we are all really not that different, or in a sense pay it forward, was thread throughout the book and is really a timely message.Overall, I really enjoyed the book, and recommend it to all readers young and old alike."},{"Title":"The Hebrew Kid and the Apache Maiden","review":"The Hebrew Kid and the Indian Maiden is an exciting and wise tale of the American frontier and of how tolerance and understanding can overcome the fears and challenges of youth. As Ariel and Lozen learn about each other we learn about Jewish and Apache cultures, their great differences and their common humanity. At the same time, The Hebrew Kid is a great yarn, filled with action and the color of the American west, vividly brought to life by Robert J. Avrech."},{"Title":"The Hebrew Kid and the Apache Maiden","review":"Fun, exciting, yet thoughtful, Hebrew Kid is wholesome family entertainment. After this book, the Wild West will never look the same!"},{"Title":"The Hebrew Kid and the Apache Maiden","review":"I read this book in two sittings. I loved it. For one, it was fresh. I'd never come across anything like this in Jewish fiction - a Torah observant family in Apache territory. I found a thriller and great descriptions - the kind you find in real novels that respect the reader, and dialogue where each character has his or her own voice, and strong Jewish women who can tote a gun and make great kugels that end up in the hands of appreciative Apache warriors. It was gripping and a hoot to read, and I loved the Jewish content. Ariel, about to be bar mitzvah, would make an incredible rabbi. Thank you, Mr. Avrech, for upping the level of Jewish literature for our children and for ourselves."},{"Title":"The Hebrew Kid and the Apache Maiden","review":"I too read this book -- which I'd describe as Sholom Aleichem meets \\"Little House On the Prairie\\" meets John Fitzgerald's \\"The Great Brain\\" stories (about kids in 19th-Century Utah) -- straight through in a couple of hours. It also reminded me a bit of \\"Holes,\\" because it's so engrossing that even kids who don't normally like books (e.g., many boys) will probably stay up late reading it with a flashlight under the covers."},{"Title":"The Hebrew Kid and the Apache Maiden","review":"I really enjoyed reading The Hebrew Kid and the Apache Maiden. Actually, it took me no more than two nights to read it. Not because it was too easy. a) Because I could not put it down, and b) because I'm a book worm. But seriously, I think the way everything worked out was really cool.Everything is depicted so well. I knew exactly what was going on and was able to picture it clearly. When the book described how Rebecca (which is actually my name) kept her hands \\"soft and white\\" I was able to picture her long delicate fingers. I even felt her despair when she saw her ruined hands after she was saved from the scalp hunters.Ariel was extremely smart for a twelve year old boy.(I am also twelve years old). Perhaps it was all of his Jewish studies. And his unique friendship with one of the most feared warriors of the age was especially interesting. And it was definitely useful.Ariel's easy-going attitude and ability to see the good in everyone was probably his most useful weapon. Imagine if he had just taken out his gun and shot Doc Holliday with it instead of conversing with him and learning he was a good man, if not a bit crazy. No Bar-Mitzvah minyan for him.I also learned alot about Judaism in this book, something I wouldn't have expected from a book about the wild west.The Hebrew Kid and the Apache Maiden was very funny, very sad and very exciting. I really enjoyed it and I'm looking forward to the next book."},{"Title":"The Hebrew Kid and the Apache Maiden","review":"The Hebrew Kid and the Apache Maiden is a fast paced, historically detailed page turner that begs to be a series. Like the \\"Harry Potter\\" novels, The Hebrew Kid is geered toward young readers but eminently appealing to adults as well.With his quirky, Yiddish-speaking family, 12 year old Ariel explores the Arizona Territory of the 1880's, encountering Apaches, soldiers, and other struggling pioneers along the way to a new home. The interaction between the fictional characters and real historic figures like Doc Holliday, and Apache maiden Lozen are entertaining and well done.I look forward reading what happens to Ariel and his family when they get to the mining town of Tombstone, Arizona."},{"Title":"The Hebrew Kid and the Apache Maiden","review":"Finally, Master screenwriter Robert Avrech in Print!!!The Hebrew Kid And The Apache Maiden is a fascinating read, and a family classic.My youngsters-aged 11 and 9, loved the exhilarating adventure of being transported back in time to the Wild unsettled West, accompanying Ariel and his migrating Jewish family through the very real perils, calamaties and challenges they encountered.They were intrigued by the gripping tale of a Jewish pioneer boy on the verge of Bar Mitzvah,forced by circumstances to mature instantly way beyond his twelve and a half years.What I found most alluring, was Robert's entirely true to life portrayal of character. Robert deviates from many of his Jewish contemporary fiction writers for young adults, who often create larger than life characters. With a supreme grasp of human nature, Robert Avrech spared no details that would dilute the character's essence. The story exposes us to some of life's harsher realities, but ultimately the characters' reactions lead us to shape and define them clearly-as is often the case in the shaping of our own selves.The Hebrew Kid And The Apache Maiden is a wondrous novel that anyone of any age can easily relate to: one of courage and optimism in the face of adversity; of finding hugely comforting friendships in the most unlikely of times and places. The text is rich with powerful imagery, fluid prose, wonderful dialogue and a hearty dose of Jewish legend.Written from the depths of a tormented soul as his beloved only son lay dying of cancer, Robert Avrech has endowed us with a priceless gift. Artfully and delicately,the author weaves his own soul's journey-the universal truths of faith,loyalty and love- into the very fabric of this heartstoppingly poignantsaga."},{"Title":"The Hebrew Kid and the Apache Maiden","review":"An author's intellect too often outstrips his spirit. The observation, the wit, the rendered phrase will display polish, but the work as a whole may lack a certain, deeper luster. And it's that luster that fixes our attention - while we're reading the work and while it lives with us forever after. Fortunately, Robert Avrech's first children's novel is imbued with this kind of luster.The Hebrew Kid and the Apache Maiden is an entertaining and inspiring tale honed with high craft and deep piety. Written by a career screenwriter for a primarily (though by no means exclusively) young, Jewish, male audience, it is at once plausible and improbable, silly and serious, magical and didactic. I read it one afternoon in a cafe, pausing only to wag its colorful cover in front of a few inquisitive onlookers while telling them that they too (\\"big people,\\" like me) should read this. Did I adequately communicate this to the other \\"big people\\"? I can't say, because before finding out if I had, I let myself be transported again - under the sure, guiding author's hand - to that age....Yet there's more going on - and at stake - in HKAM than quality entertainment. It has to do with Mr. Avrech's choice of setting the novel in the Arizona of the 1870s, thereby overlaying mass Jewish immigration with mass American expansion and the Indian Wars. It also has to do with the interwoven themes of coming of age, learning to handle firearms, and Jewish self-defense. For while the novel makes no pretense of speaking directly to other - mostly \\"big people\\" - works which treat some or all of these themes, HKAM reminds me, indirectly, of some other works that (in part or in whole) do treat them: Primo Levi's If Not Now, When?; Antek Zuckerman's A Surplus of Memory; Romain Gary's A European Education; Esther Forbes's Johnny Tremain; and any number of Hemingway stories. Yet by predating the 20th Century - and the Shoah - and by sticking to the Kid's point of view, Avrech helps preserve that degree of Orthodox Judaism's innocence and wonder and awe which frequently is beyond the scope of \\"big people\\" or less observant or 20th Century works. For, as the dedication offers, what's also at stake in this novel is the debt Mr. Avrech is attempting to repay to his departed son - the great inspiration for the Hebrew Kid.The Hebrew Kid and the Apache Maiden is a mitzvah through and through. Purchase it in hardcover while you still can. You will want your copy to last as long as there are generations to come, generations which will always peer into the lives of past generations, wondering how to learn from them."},{"Title":"The Hebrew Kid and the Apache Maiden","review":"Normally being a slow reader with a wandering mind, I read this entire book in just four days, unable to put it down. It was such a sweet, heartwarming story; I could easily imagine the author writing it, as I know him personally, and he truly is such a nice man. But this book is more than a sentimental tear-jerker; actual historical people that existed at the time the story takes place, are here. I learned things about American history I had not previously known. I also found it interesting how the author emphasized how the Jews are not truly white people at all, but their own separate race who may have more affinity with American Indians than with White America."},{"Title":"The Hebrew Kid and the Apache Maiden","review":"Robert Avrech's first installment of the adventures of Ariel in the turbulent beginnings of the American Southwest isn't simply a book for young adults. It's an enjoyable must-read for adults -- Jewish and non-Jewish -- interested in Judaism in any way. His explanations of Jewish and Apache spirituality are simple without being simplistic, and are beautifully woven into the adventurous tale of a boy trying to learn how to be a man -- and a \\"mensch\\" -- in a dangerous world. Hopefully it won't be too long before we're able to enjoy Ariel's next journey!"},{"Title":"The Hebrew Kid and the Apache Maiden","review":"The book is captivating from beginning to end. This book is a wonderful example of what books for young people should be. It covers the full range of emotion; love, passion, fear, etc. It examines bigotry in it's characters as well as brotherhood amongst 'strangers'. It would be well that the parent reads the book as well, because it might open up many as yet unaddressed topics of conversation. I loved it!"},{"Title":"The Hebrew Kid and the Apache Maiden","review":"For a book about a Jewish family making a dangerous trek through the Arizona territory in the Old West, there sure are a lot of things for adults to enjoy. Younger adults will appreciate the adventure, and probably learn more about religious Jewish and Apache culture than they ever will in school. Where else can you get that in one package?!? There's also a lot of humor in the story and the way Avrech makes the characters come to life. The idea of Doc Holliday enjoying a nice kugel is one that will sustain me through many Sabbath meals to come. I'm looking forward to giving this book to my 9-year-old niece."},{"Title":"The Hebrew Kid and the Apache Maiden","review":"The Hebrew Kid and the Apache Maiden caught my eye when I first learned about the book in fall 2004 -- I made it a point to get myself a copy, even though it was classified as young-adult. Never mind the classification! The book grabbed this fortysomething's interest as well as that of my young children. I read the book aloud to them as they gathered at my feet -- just like family time in the good ole' days.And this book gives a look at the ole' days of the Old West as it was being settled by all types of people, observant Jews and Native Americans included!This story of an unlikely friendship between a young Jewish boy on the brink of becoming a bar mitzvah -- and determined to celebrate this important Jewish rite of passage in the Arizona Territory -- and an Apache maiden captivates the readers with its adventure, suspense, humor, historical and religious references. Author Robert J. Avrech has wisely included a glossary of Yiddish and Hebrew terms used in the story for those readers unfamiliar with them.The story presents itself in a lovely package, with its hardcover format, tight spine stitching, fine calligraphy and detailed artwork introducing each chapter. Even the look of the book is reminiscent of the good ole' days.The Hebrew Kid and the Apache Maiden has found a welcome spot on our family bookshelf and we plan to reread the story many times over. Looking forward to more Hebrew Kid adventures..."},{"Title":"The Hebrew Kid and the Apache Maiden","review":"My 13-year son still thinks of this book fondly, remembering my reading it to him when he was small. He enjoyed the youth focus, the action, the Judaism and the apparent West Texas setting of some of the story. And the book still is prominently displayed on his bookshelf where he periodically points to it as a tale that he enjoyed hearing and has occasionally dipped into himself since he learned to read on his own."},{"Title":"The Hebrew Kid and the Apache Maiden","review":"This is an excellent book!My ten year old son is reading it and can't put it down. It's a uniquely American-Jewish experience that makes this so interesting. The writing is exciting and well crafted with enough detail to paint vivid mental pictures.This book would be appropriate for a history lesson too!The only drawback is that some of the transliterated Yiddish or Hebrew words are misspelled, or have unusual spellings. It's just enough to be a bump in the otherwise smooth writing."},{"Title":"The Hebrew Kid and the Apache Maiden","review":"mr. Avrech has written a fantastic, adventurous, page turning, funny, and lovable story. his characters are intresting and distinct and his plot is very exciting. i particularly liked Lozen, a brave, and strong girl who ariel befriends. The story explains and ties together the Apache and Jewish cultures, two sets of people who on the surface do not seem similar. i highly recommend this novel to readers of all ages- everyone in my family has read it!"},{"Title":"The Hebrew Kid and the Apache Maiden","review":"I'll admit, I bought THE HEBREW KID AND THE APACHE MAIDEN for my 12 year-old nephew, but I couldn't resist taking a peek myself. And, once I started it, I was hooked; couldn't put it down.Author Robert Avrech has crafted a marvelous plot. He weaves together the history of the Jews with details about traditional anti-Semitism--both in Europe and in the United States--along with lore about the American Wild West of the 19th Century.This novel is a work which combines great imagination with scholarly research.Every page here is an adventure, starting with Apaches on the war path and moving on to Mexican desperadoes. The reader, especially the younger reader, definitely will learn much about the Jewish religion as a result of reading this book.According to the author's biography, he already is a successful screenwriter. I have read novels written by great authors, and I have seen screenplays written by great screenwriters, and THE HEBREW KID AND THE APACHE MAIDEN is the equal of the best of them.Robert Avrech dedicated this book to the memory of his son."},{"Title":"The Hebrew Kid and the Apache Maiden","review":"I read this novel by my friend Robert J. Avrech straight through in two hours Friday night. I laughed out loud a dozen times. It is terrific and a much-needed contribution to fiction for kids..........A soldier approaches the frum family.\\"You get back to your Cossack friends before I knock your head in, you dirty little sheygitz.\\" Mama lifted a cast iron skillet.\\"Please, ma'am, I'm not a sheygitz. My name is Schulman. I'm a landsman. A Jew.\\"...............The mother yells at this Indian maiden Lozen. \\"So you be careful who you call a witch. Let me tell you something, you might scare the goyim with your whoops and hollers and guns and knives, but to me you're just a little shicksah pisher. And a little advice, maidel: you should spend a bit more time on your looks... You think a man is going to want to marry a wild girl? You should be thinking about a shidduch, not riding around like you're on the warpath!\\"Mama was practically shouting. Lozen nodded mutely.............The book is written from the perspective of Ariel, a 12-year old about to celebrate his bar mitzvah in the Wild West of the 1870s.It's clearly crafted by an accomplished screenwriter. All the scenes have conflict and move the story forward. Most of the chapters end with a hook that compells you to keep reading. The story often heads in the opposite direction of what you'd expect.Dialogue is an Avrech strength. His emails are frequently hilarious when he paints his life with spare dialogue.While Ariel is the book's most sympathetic character, momma and Doc Holliday are the most entertaining.The book reminds me a great deal of Robert's movie A Stranger Among Us with its romantic view of Jewish mysticism. Both works have lead characters named Ariel who dabble in kaballah.I love the absurd tensions of an Orthodox family trying to deal with the goyim in the Wild West.The book comes out of a robust confidence that must flow from Robert's life that Orthodox Judaism is strong enough to tackle the wider world. I believe that Robert Avrech (who comes from a long line of Orthodox rabbis and his son Ariel would've carried on that tradition) is the first Orthodox screenwriter of feature films (with Brian De Palma's Body Double in 1984). In the world in which he grew up, Hollywood was at best foolishness.So Robert must've learned at his secular college, and at his secular kibbutz in Israel, and in secular Hollywood, how to interact with non-Jews, righteous and otherwise, while maintaining his Orthodoxy.Robert's life reminds me of My Name is Asher Lev, probably my favorite Jewish novel.I read The Hebrew Kid for fun, but I reflect on it as an allegory of Robert's journey through the non-Orthodox world.Like the frum family in his novel, Robert has long strived to practice Orthodox Judaism within a frequently hostile environment.Avrech is not of the \\"Yossi Klein Halevi school of Orthodox Judaism,\\" which simply posits that Orthodoxy is the language he learned to communicate with God. Robert is authentically Orthodox (literally means correct belief) in the sense that he truly believes in the Thirteen Principles of Maimonidies, and not just in some figurative sense. I know. I've grilled him on these.I believe that Yossi and Robert both went to Brooklyn Talmudic Academy, aka Yeshiva University High School of Brooklyn. Yossi writes about it in his Memoirs of a Jewish Extremist.The lead Jewish characters in this novel have meaningful interactions with non-Jews. Their worldview divides people not just along Jew and non-Jew, but most significantly along the lines of moral and immoral. The Jews learn from the goyim and vice versa. The Jews constantly face pressures for which they know no immediate halachic answer, but instead have to search themselves and their sacred texts for direction.Because they live in the real world, the Jews in the novel sin. They're real. They're not cookie-cutter characters like much religious fiction for teens.Three years ago, Robert told me he could never write a novel.Three years ago, Robert didn't have a son who was dying.As he worked on this novel, Robert used to read portions to Ariel, who laughed when he had the strength."},{"Title":"The Hebrew Kid and the Apache Maiden","review":"I met screenwriter Robert J. Avrech and his wife for the first time before Christmas, and he presented me with a copy of his book. He hoped to learn the impact his words would have on a non-Jewish California girl. Today, I emailed him the following message, which I hope will be useful to persons considering his book as a delightful addition to their bookshelves and their lives:I want you to know that I finally had some quiet time yesterday afternoon/evening to sit alone and enjoy your book. That the story revolves around a Jewish family is in no way a road block to enjoying the pages. In fact, I was incredibly grateful for the glossary at the end of the book, which I referred to again and again, and the story not only satisfied my thirst for adventure but also for cultural knowledge.The empathy and compassion with which you drew the characters -- Jews, goyims, gamblers and warriers alike -- enabled the story to be appealing cross-culturally. When Ariel brought this message home in the last few pages at his bat mitzvah, I was moved to tears. Your story is really all about love, isn't it? I feel it on every page. I can see that this book will be appealing to audiences young and old, because it is so fun to accompany your characters on their journey, and there is also deeper meaning on every page. Thank you for sharing this with me."},{"Title":"The Hebrew Kid and the Apache Maiden","review":"I found the Hebrew Kid and the Apache Maiden to be thoroughly engaging and heartfelt. The characters seem real, and ready to jump off the page. Mr. Avrech has beautifully crafted a story of tolerance, courage, friendship and love. He brings the old west to life, while telling of the struggle of a Jewish family coming to America to create a new home. At the same time, the Native Americans struggle to maintain their home. He intertwines the cultures and beliefs of the Jews and the Apache's in such a way, we learn that perhaps, the two are not all that different. What a wonderful lesson of tolerlance for children and adults alike. I think this book will become a classic...a wonderful read and teaching tool for a fascinating time in our history. I look forward to Mr. Avrech's next Hebrew Kid book!"},{"Title":"The Hebrew Kid and the Apache Maiden","review":"With this engrossing novel for readers of all ages and faiths, Robert J. Avrech spins a suspenseful story that will have you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.As someone who is not overly interested in the Old West, I wasn't sure how captivated I would be with the historical setting of this book. Much to my surprise, I found myself enchanted by the fictional escapades of these figures who really did exist. The center of it all is young Ariel, who Avrech manages to write as pious, modest, and extremely loveable at the same time - no mean feat.With rich language and imagery so vivid that you really feel as if you are seeing the book unfold before your very eyes, The Hebrew Kid and the Apache Maiden is one of those novels that you and your children will read time and time again over the years. (It helps that the book itself is of such fine quality - with a sturdy sewn binding, charming chapter illustrations, and beautiful gold foil imprints, this is a real work of art and should be treasured as such.) In fact, with the way the scenes reveal themselves through Avrech's stunning prose, a film version of this tale is almost not necessary - though I eagerly await from screenwriter Avrech the cinematic rendering of one of the most touching and fortifying tales of faith and good deeds that I have ever read. With just as much anticipation, I await the day that I can share this book with my own children."},{"Title":"The Hebrew Kid and the Apache Maiden","review":"Robert Avrech has written a wonderful little book, out in paperback now, that is a must-read for all Jewish families, teenagers, college students, adults. With the sure touch of a master storyteller, this seasoned Hollywood screenwriter has put together an amazing little book, part adventure story, part mythic saga, part Jewish cultural celebration. It should be in every Jewish library, every Jewish home, and I for one, can't wait to see the TV movie version. A winner in every way, and mazel tov to a mighty fine writer, seeker, and visionary, I might add. Nice nice nice!"},{"Title":"The Hebrew Kid and the Apache Maiden","review":"Emmy-winning screenwriter Robert J. Avrech presents The Hebrew Kid and the Apache Maiden, an unforgettable historical fiction novel set in the wild west. A Jewish family in search of security they cannot find in their native Russia struggles to make a life for themselves, and their son forms a fast friendship with the sister of a great Apache warrior chieftain. The boy and the girl each hold different beliefs, customs, and ways of life sacred - yet it is the differences that make the world they live in whole. A memorable story, intended for young adults but appealing to all ages."},{"Title":"The Hebrew Kid and the Apache Maiden","review":"Avrech has created a fascinating mix of religious instruction, mysticism, and danger, along with a healthy dose of the Old Wild West, filled with unforgetable characters and their reactions to unfamiliar and unlikely circumstances. Ariel is a lead character you can't help speculating about- his future as a leader of a Jewish community in America or possibly a Senator of the United States. At the very least, he could likely grow into a combination of Doc Holiday/Dr. Welby, shooting from the hip but tempered with love and compassion. Ariel and Lozen are great role-models as an unlikely pair of fish out of water who find a common ground for understanding and even \\"forbidden\\" love! His relation with his parents and sister is nothing short of heroic as he literally rides to his sister's rescue showing uncommon courage and smarts. The Cartwrights have nothing on this family! I can't wait for the next installment!"},{"Title":"The Hebrew Kid and the Apache Maiden","review":"The Hebrew Kid and the Apache Maiden works on many levels. It's an adventure story, with page turning appeal, but also imparts information about Judaism, Apache culture, and the pioneering spirit that drove Westward expansion. It pleases the young adult reader, but transcends all ages. A family I know read it out loud from cover to cover on a Friday night, but adults also enjoy its character development and touching relationships. I recommend The Hebrew Kid and the Apache Maiden as a wonderful Chanuka gift for all generations."},{"Title":"The Hebrew Kid and the Apache Maiden","review":"Robert Avrech's novel is exciting and fastpaced and introduces us to a large group of fascinating characters. The book is truly unique and would be of interest to readers of all ages and backgrounds, but is truly a gem for Jewish children and young adults.The only disappointment for me came when the book ended and I still had questions about the future of Ariel and his family. Fortunately, the author assured me that another installment will be forthcoming. I can't wait to read it."},{"Title":"The Selected Poems of Federico Garcia Lorca","review":"I have the Collected Poems of Lorca but I still return to this beautiful, compact volume time and time again. It is not that the Collected Poems dissatisfy me, no... I simply find most of my favourite poems in the Selected Poems.It is in my opinion the best introduction to Federico Garcia Lorca's poetry. Here one can find 'The Faithless Wife', just as famous as Neruda's 'Tonight I Write the Saddest Lines' as well handsome selections from the Divan, Canciones, Romancero Gitano and his other works. I feel it was my first reading of 'The Faithless Wife' that inspired my interest in Lorca's poetry. It is spare, solemn, a poem thirsting for love, truth and sex.W.S. Merwin's introduction and Lorca's brother, Francisco provide some background to the poet's life. The collection is 'collectively' translated by a sound handful of prominent poets and scholars: Ben Belitt, Rolfe Humphries, Langston Hughes, Stephen Spender, Edwin Honig to name just a few. I often find collective translations more satisfying as if the poet's voice needed an assembly of talented, careful scholars to piece together the great dynamic of the artist. This small book becomes a beautiful mosaic in their hands.Highly recommended, easy to read, easy to approach but from there, you'll want to explore more of Lorca and of course, the next big step is the Collected Poems. A great beginning."},{"Title":"The Selected Poems of Federico Garcia Lorca","review":"My husband used to read me this book when I was pregnant with my only child. The sound of the poems made her kick. Maybe the poems, but probably it was just the way he read them--in spanish--louder than he ever said anything. My husband never yelled, even when he was angry he just stayed by himself a bit, but he really used to get into these poems. From his childhood, I guess. He tried to translate them himself, but he wasn't very good at it. He would probably say these aren't very good either, no translation is your own after all, but I don't speak spanish, and to me these are close to the way he used to make me feel when he read them. Very lovely, and a little alarming.I tried reading them to my daughter--she's having a baby in the summer--but it didn't really make anyone feel alarmed.

Like many of his painter contemporaries, he felt that in order to experience America, he needed to journey west. Oddly, however, he was most touched not by the majesty of great mountains, but the plains! His paintings are, at first glance, quiet canvasses.Perhaps this is why Whittredge does not get the attention he deserves. Instead of embracing the awe of \\"here is the Hand of God\\" mountainscapes or painting Indians on their horses or trying to capture dramatic light effects of certain types of weather, Whittredge gives us something else. Something contemplative and soulful and deliberate. This is not to suggest of course, that he is some sort of realist. This is Romanticiscm. He is firmly in the camp of the classically-trained, American 19th century oil painter. But a bit apart.Trivia: Whittredge posed for \\"George Washington Crossing the Delaware\\" and appears as one of the boatmen!Book Details: a typically handsome book from Cambridge: cloth over boards with a sewn binding, in dustjacket; 2.75 pounds, 250 pp. Illustrations throughout. Index. 35 pp of bibliographic information. Since this is a book from the late '80's, most of the illustrations are in b&w.;Author Janson does an admirable job in considering the whole of Whittredge's output in friendly, expert prose. As one would expect from a monograph, the artist's biography is used to illuminate his aesthetic output. Most pleasing is the extent to which the author places Worthington Whittredge within (and also without!) the artistic and aesthetic traditions which surrounded him."},{"Title":"For People and for Profit: A Business Philosophy for the 21st Century","review":"More than 'Japan Inc.&quot; ...

This book is the story of his life, as well as letters he wrote to his spiritual children.In his 74 years of life upon this earth, Elder Leonid's wisdom poured forth on those who sought spiritual guidance. He always knew the right thing to do at the right time. Sometimes this was a kind word, a small gift, or a stern rebuke. He even had a great sense of humor. Not funny in the sense that he was a clown, but he knew that a humorous observation was what one sometimes needed to soften their heart. He was a man of great patience, love, prayer, wisdom and other Christian virtues. He even peacefully endured persecution from others because he had shed his concern for himself.The section of the Elder's letters to his spiritual children is especially valuable.

Crosby investigates the roots of European domination over the western world. He calls the places where early Europeans settled \\"Neo-Europes\\" with special emphasis on North and South America , Australia , and New Zealand . In his prologue he ponders whether Europeans dominated their environment and other cultures because of their technology, or whether the consistent \\"success of European imperialism has a biological, [and] an ecological, component.\\". Crosby 's thesis is that Europeans were successful imperialists because wherever they went their agriculture and animals thrived; and the indigenous populations and local ecosystems collapsed under their biological advance.Crosby begins at the beginning, discussing the one big continent, Pangaea, supposed to have existed in pre-history and the slow development of life forms other than reptilian, in particular Homo sapiens. The break up of Pangaea (this hypothetical super-continent) caused the \\"the decentralization of the process of evolution,\\" that is, when the land cracked apart flora and fauna were spilt between the newly created continents. That continental split is the reason similar species are found in Europe and North America.Eventually Crosby brings the reader up to the end of the Ice Age. Ten thousand years ago humans were exploring the islands of the Eastern Atlantic including Australia . Once on these islands humans domesticated plants, piled up mounds of garbage, spread disease, and hunted animals into extinction. Normally the despoilment of indigenous flora and fauna occurs over tens of thousands of years. In locations where humans arrived with mature hunting skills a sudden extinction of local plant and animal life occurred. These sudden prehistoric, or Pleistocene, overkills were the first concentrated impact humans had on virgin ecosystems.The virgin ecosystem of Porto Santo Island was the destination of Portuguese settlers during the 1400s. Porto Santo Island was completely uninhabited and filled with untouched flora and fauna. One Portuguese ship captain brought a mother rabbit and her babies to the island. The rabbits loved Porto Santo and thrived in the island environment. So much so that soon the settlers were blasting away at the rabbits in an attempt to exterminate the entire local rabbit population. It seems the rabbits could not determine the difference between the crops meant for human consumption and the crops meant for bunny consumption. The rabbits won in this instance and for a time the settlers moved elsewhere, \\"defeated by their own ecological ignorance.\\"The experience of Spanish invaders in the Canaries showed them that no matter where they went, even if they could not out-fight their opponents, Europeans could dominate their enemies anyway. \\"In all these [new] places, the newcomers would conquer the human populations and Europeanize entire ecosystems.\\" The Spanish learned from their experiences in the Canaries that their livestock and crops would succeed in these new environments; they also learned they could easily defeat the local natives without traditional warfare. The various \\"plagues\\" and \\"sleeping sicknesses,\\" which the Spanish called peste and modorra, killed off and weakened natives who had no natural immunity to ailments common to the Spanish. In essence, sore throats and colds were the winning weapons of the conquerors; it was the flu that subjugated the Canaries.The unfortunate natives of the Canary Islands , the Guanches, did not survive their meeting with the Spanish sailors. These previously isolated people died rapidly from dysentery, pneumonia, and venereal disease. According to Crosby \\"few experiences are as dangerous to a people's survival as the passage from isolation to membership in the worldwide community that included European sailors, soldiers, and settlers.\\" When the Spanish conquered the Canaries the Guanches lost their land and therefore their livelihood. Some Guanches joined the Spanish army and went to fight in the Americas ; the Spanish sold others into slavery. The majority of Guanches however died of disease and the entire population became extinct.Unlike the Guanches of the Canaries, the Maoris of New Zealand did survive despite great odds. When invaded by Europeans the Maoris assumed they would become extinct. European rats annihilated the Maori rat, an animal that was a food staple for the natives. The Maori fly might have help ward off the incursion of sheep that quickly destroyed the local flora, but invading European houseflies wiped out the local flies. Clover took over where ferns had been, and the Maori waited for their own extinction. The Maori population hit bottom in 1890 but then began a mysterious recovery and 280,000 people claim to be Maori by 1981.In the 1500s Europeans arrived in the Americas with horses, technology (weapons), domesticated plants (crops), farm animals, germs, insects, diseases, weeds, and varmints. The garbage piled up by farmers encouraged varmint populations (mainly mice and rats) which spread disease and attacked human food supplies. Crosby devoted an entire chapter to the spread of weeds around the world. Weeds are not specific plants. \\"Weed\\" is a general term applied to a plant that spreads rapidly and encroaches on other plants. The study of where specific weeds appeared and when, aids in tracking population movements. The weeds brought by Europeans were actually another unintentional imperial victory. Weeds repaired damaged top soils and provided feed for livestock. \\" Rye and oats were once weeds.\\" \\"Weeds are the Red Cross of the plant world; they deal with ecological emergencies.\\" \\"Weeds thrive on radical change, not stability. That, in the abstract, is the reason for the triumph of European weeds in the Neo-Europes...\\" Weeds were resilient and thrived in soils laid bare by European plows, and damaged by drastically altered ecosystems.European populations exploded in the Americas and Australia . What distinguished these Neo-Europes were the large food surpluses they generated. Neo-Europes led the world in food production \\"relative to the amount locally consumed.\\" Other cultures actually produced more food per capita and per hectare, but the Neo-Europes exported more food than any other society. Especially successful exports from Neo-Europes were wheat, soybeans, pig products, and beef. Europeans consistently chose to settle in temperate climates where their animals and crops thrived. This was prudent and logical, it would have made no sense for Europeans to settle in torrid climates where their livestock would have suffered, and their favorite crops could not be grown.The wind also aided European imperialists. When faced with strong winds the Portuguese marinheiros, true sailors, did not turn around and go home or sit sail-less in the water until the winds changed. Marinheiros would \\"sail around the wind.\\" Sailors would tack close enough to the contrary wind to keep moving and then find a wind that they could use to continue their course. The Portuguese who perfected this \\"crabwise slide\\" called it the volta do mar, literally \\"going back to the sea.\\" This understanding of winds allowed marinheiros to sail out on trade winds and back home on the westerlies.Smallpox was the big killer of the Aztecs and the Incas in Peru ; the Huron and Iroquois in Mexico ; and the Amerindians of the United States . Crosby claims the victories of the Conquistadors over the Amerindians were \\"in large part the triumphs of the virus of smallpox.\\" Besides smallpox Europeans brought dysentery and influenza; those epidemics killed almost the whole indigenous population of North America . In effect, the domination over ecology and culture by European invaders was more of a biological accident, than a well-executed military takeover.Virgin soil epidemics spread through populations who had no prior contact with European diseases. These populations had no immunity to protect them. Virgin soil epidemics had many dramatic consequences. First, the epidemics effectively committed genocide, killing entire populations of native people around the world. Second, certain diseases (measles, influenza, tuberculosis) effected people fifteen to forty years of age more than others. These young adults were responsible for most of the labor involved in supplying food, procreation, raising children, and defending the society. The third and fourth effects of virgin soil epidemics were cultural optimism on the part of the conquerors, and cultural fatalism on the part of the conquered. When Europeans arrived and slew their rivals without raising a sword they believed that God must be on their side and this belief affirmed the rightness of their imperialistic actions. When the indigenous people died by the hoard from mysterious ailments they developed a fatalistic view of their own destiny and supposed the white man's Gods were the more powerful.Ecological Imperialism is interesting, occasionally humorous, and easy to read. Crosby accomplishes his goal of writing a big book. This author presents a convincing and encompassing explanation for the incredible success of European imperialists. The book leaves the reader with more questions. How aggressively imperialistic were the original conquerors if all they had to do was show up and their opponents fell to the wayside? Crosby argues convincingly that Europeans were triumphant because the places they chose to conquer had ecosystems and indigenous populations that surrendered to the biology of the invaders."},{"Title":"Ecological Imperialism: The Biological Expansion of Europe, 900-1900 (Studies in Environment and History)","review":"This book is simply a must read for anyone doing Economic History, Development, or Economic Growth.

Crosby examines the reason Europeans were able to defeat the Indigenous people in American, Australia and New Zealand. Crosby argues that the biology and ecology factors played tremendous roles in their win. Crosy argues that the weeds, animals and the Europeans best allies, the germs or diseases that they brought with them to the New World dominated the Indigenous people. The Europeans sought to make the New World as similiar to that of the Old World. It was interesting for me because we were taught that the military superiority of the Europeans was the main factor.

He tells the story of the expansion of a tightly connected group of European organisms, which includes humans alongside with other domesticated animals, crops, weeds, viruses and bacteria.The book shows that humans were the leading elements in this great expansion beyond Europe and across the oceans - but they would not have managed to successfully invade, occupy and dominate vast areas of the planet such as America, Australia and New Zealand if they had not been supported by a powerful combination of fauna, flora and germs. In fact, often enough these supporting organisms even took the lead in making the \\"new-found\\" territories hospitable for Europeans. Once they had arrived to faraway lands with similar climatic conditions as Europe - but with much less people, germs, domesticated animals and plants - the horses, pigs, cows, sheep, bees, rats, weeds and endemic diseases carried by European vessels began spreading quickly in these totally unexposed areas, and thrived mainly by destroying the native organisms.Another important point developed by Crosby is that this apparently aggressive invasion and occupation of other continents was actually the consequence of a long process started many thousands of generations before, and of which Europeans were totally unaware. They were simply the ones most prepared and willing to cross unknown oceans (in fact, for centuries they had to painfully learn all about winds and currents - for which many a vessel with all its human and non-human crew had to be sacrificed) and settle down many 1000 of kilometres away from their original home, because the \\"old continent\\" had become overpopulated, deforested and overgrazed. Their \\"ecological imperialism\\" was in the end part of their struggle to survive and reproduce (to the disadvantage of other human and non-human organisms).Thus, Crosby urges his readers to think of this propagation of certain humans and their accompanying flora, fauna and germs in detriment of others as a natural phenomenon. In fact, he often compares the European ecological expansion with an \\"avalanche\\" or a \\"bursting dam\\", i.e., something that had to inevitably happen given the circumstances. In this scenario, it becomes clear that these organisms were vehicles for a great \\"biological revolution\\" (in the words of the author), where humans were the spearhead of the movement - but hardly the all-knowing, dominant, free agents they mostly imagine(d) themselves to be."},{"Title":"Ecological Imperialism: The Biological Expansion of Europe, 900-1900 (Studies in Environment and History)","review":"Crosby brought up an argument that I've never heard before - and argued it quite well.

It basicaly sets up a straw man by claiming that most people think Europeans conquered the New World and Oceania through weapons but in fact they were 'biologically' programmed to win. This thesis begins in the 10th century A.D. But here the author misses something. The Vikings that landed in Labrador and in Greenland were unsuccessful. They dwindled and died out. SO if they were biologically programmed to suceed then why didn't they. Inferior weaponry?Then we jump ahead to the 16th century. Now the book misses another important point. Only in North America and Australia were the natives completely decimated by disease. In Mexico and New Zealand many of the native Aztecs and Maoris and Mayas survived. In Mexico today most people are descended from them. It was the sparsely populated natives that succombed to disease and this 'biological' issue. The conquest of Mexico and the mixing of peoples has a parellel in the Arab conquest of North Africa or the Turkish conquest of Anatolia. It is not simply a matter of disease and biology.Thus this book falls short on several points. It is not an original thesis. It also suffers from severe problems of history, in trying to curve the data to fit the idea.Seth J.

This biota fucntioned as a team wherever Europeans took it. European germs swept aside native peoples. Europe's cattle, pigs and horses filled native biotic niches. European weeds and agriculture squeezed out native plants. This biological expansion of Europe created &quot;Neo-Europes&quot; which still function today in North America, Australia, New Zealand and southern South America.European imperialism often failed or was considerably delayed in areas where Europe's biota could not prevail. In China much the same biota was already present. Africa, the Amazon and southeast Asia were too hot, too fecund and too disease-ridden for Europe's animals, plants and humans. These areas were among the last to be dominated as a result, and then only briefly, when Europe's technology gave temporary edge to its armies."},{"Title":"Ecological Imperialism: The Biological Expansion of Europe, 900-1900 (Studies in Environment and History)","review":"This is an excellent book on how and why the Europeans were able to conquer North America, Australia, temperate South America (particularly Argentina), and New Zealand--the so-called Neo-Europes, in Crossby's terminology. Crossby's thesis is simple: the native biota of those places (including humans, of course) did not coevolve with the invaders, and were consequently naive (i.e, unequipped) to deal with them. Or, put another way, the invaders were preadapted to deal with the new conditions, and aggresively advanced, in a teamlike fashion, to encroach the native biota. Crossby also explains why Europeans were not able to conquer other places (such as Greenland, the Labrador region, and the New and Old Worlds tropics), adducing mainly climatic reasons and the lack of technological expertise.To be sure, Crossby's arguments are not new. However, he does a great job at synthesizing an incredible wealth of historical data. His style, oftentimes humorous, also makes of his book an enjoyable read. I would recommend this book to anyone teaching a comprehensive course on the conquest of the places Crossby deals with.

W. Crosby, is a cogently argued and well written book. The main thesis of the book is that the expansion by Europeans to the Americas, Australia, New Zealand, and a few other enclaves (what Crosby calls the Neo-Europes) wouldn't have succeded if the biota the Europeans brought with them had not suceeded. This biota included not only humans, of course, but pathogens, weeds and grasses, and horses, cattle, goats, and pigs, among the most important. Crosby addresses the reasons why this biota was so succesful in the new territories, and concludes that, in general, the climatic regimes there were sufficiently similar to those of its European origins and the indigenous biota was so 'naive' that 'victory' was almost assured to the invaders. To be sure, this is not an original conclusion, but the wealth of data Crosby uses, along with his synthetic power and sense of humor, makes of this book an enjoyable and thought-provoking read. People interested in searching for the biological causes of the successes (and failures!) of Europeans in the world should read this engaging book."},{"Title":"Ecological Imperialism: The Biological Expansion of Europe, 900-1900 (Studies in Environment and History)","review":"Alfred Crosby is widely credited for popularising the ecological dimension of the history of imperial expansion. For this reason, and perhaps this reason alone, his book is worth a read.The book, first published in 1986, revolutionised the way we think about European imperial expansion into the New World. How a few hundred disoriented Europeans armed with spears and misfiring guns managed to overwhelm entire Inca and Aztec civilisations in the early sixteenth century, for example. Crosby convincingly casts aside traditional political or military explanations by attributing the astonishing Portuguese and Spanish victories to bacteriology: how diseases such as smallpox and measles that the Europeans unwittingly carried with them wiped out thousands of New World inhabitants, severely crippling their defences.The larger point that Crosby drives across is a profound one. Historical events - in this case, European expansion and imperialism - can be explained predominantly by ecological factors. In the clash of \`biotas' between the Old and the New World, the Old World won. Convincingly. Hence the presence not just of Europeans in the Americas, but also of pigs and dandelions. According to this thesis, ecology shaped European expansion; creating \`Neo-Europes' in the New World that facilitated European migration, precipitating the \`Caucasian wave' from the 1820s to the 1930s. Unlike in most other histories, in Crosby's ecological history, humans form the backdrop and inexorable ecological forces take centre-stage.Refreshing as this perspective is, the way that Crosby has rendered it is problematic in on a number of accounts. By excluding humans from the picture; or at best relegating human developments to the sidelines, Crosby emerges with a dangerously reductive picture of historical development. Deterministic ecological explanations cannot alone account for European expansion - after all, we must not forget that the first European transoceanic voyages were motivated by curiosity rather than necessity. More problematic is the book's implicit assumption that ecological influence was unidirectional. In concentrating on explicating the Old World's ecological victory over the New, Crosby neglects to examine the influence that New World ecology had on the Old.Nonetheless, Crosby's work remains a landmark study that deserves a read. Moreover, it packs a punch as a piece of writing - its lucid narratives and provocative assertions laid out with the bold and elegant strokes of a master-artist. Yet Crosby's work is also increasingly a dated study that has been qualified over and over by new works in the field, or in the related field of environmental history. Those interested in the subject should by no means stop at Crosby's book."},{"Title":"Ecological Imperialism: The Biological Expansion of Europe, 900-1900 (Studies in Environment and History)","review":"Always lively and perspicacious, this clever book seeks to solve a seemingly trivial puzzle: while historians have mustered a host of plausible explanations (weapons, diseases, horses, etc.) for why Europeans spread so thickly into North America, Australia, New Zealand and Argentina (the lands Crosby labels \\"Neo-Europes\\"), what could possibly explain why the dandelion did so as well? The question doesn't appear so innocuous when it is pointed out that not just the dandelion, but the European housefly, and feral pigs, and a horde of other weeds, pests, crops, diseases and livestock from Europe followed suit. Quite often these organisms, even the domesticated ones, raced ahead of European explorers themselves, rapidly proliferating into vast herds and stands that the settlers themselves could not fathom. Why was this so? Why didn't, say, Australian weeds, their seeds inadvertently shipped back to England, eventually carpet the meadows and fields of Europe? To answer this odd question, Professor Crosby begins his story with Pangaea--the great supercontinent that began to split apart about 200 million years ago into the continents we now have scattered about the globe. These \\"seams of Pangaea\\" then forced a radical divergence in the terrestrial flora and fauna of the planet, and set the stage for the equally radical convergence initiated when European mariners crossed these now mid-oceanic seams. Crosby details case after case in each category: weeds, pests, livestock, diseases and crops. He forcefully illustrates how sudden and overwhelming the ecosystem takeover was until the suspense is too much to bear. What is the answer? He drops clues every now and then, and the most explicit one is in the form of a quote that begins one of the final chapters: if weeds are to be defined as those organisms that thrive on the disturbances caused by humans, then humans themselves must be considered the primary weed of all. Here, then is the answer: all the opportunistic fellow-travelers of the European diaspora are exquisitely coadapted to the scale and pace of the continuous ecological disequilibrium characteristic of the Old World civilizations--and they, in turn, furthered and helped generate that very disequilibrium. Together--humans, horses, cattle, pigs, rats, clover, peaches, measles and, yes, dandelions--comprised a potent self-replicating system, dimly discerned by its contemporaries, that could not be stopped once it spilled across the seams of Pangaea."},{"Title":"Ecological Imperialism: The Biological Expansion of Europe, 900-1900 (Studies in Environment and History)","review":"This is one of the most revealing books I have ever read. Crosby has made me gasp in awe more times in one paragraph than I have reading most entire books. He explains not only how Eureopean plants, animals, and people are in so many places, but how they got into such a position, what advantages they started out with, which ones they developed, and why they failed in other places.His thesis is convincing because he gives several examples to prove his point, to show how his theory worked in each of these cases. I wish there were more books that were written so clearly and irrefutably. Written with the power of a true historian yet with the thrill of an action movie, it's a rare combination of skill.If you liked the subject of Guns, Germs, and Steel, you'll find this book to be even more exciting and easier to read."},{"Title":"Ecological Imperialism: The Biological Expansion of Europe, 900-1900 (Studies in Environment and History)","review":"Like any other book by Crosby, this one is pretty much a must for anyone studying environmental history. The book goes into detail about how the New and Old worlds differ and how those changes were caused. He breaks the books into several sections and his noteworthy topics include discussions on disease, weeds and winds. At times, Crosby's writing is a bit boring because he tends to repeat a lot of things, but this is just his way of drilling important points home. Even if it may not be the most exciting book, it is very informative and deserves to be read."},{"Title":"Ecological Imperialism: The Biological Expansion of Europe, 900-1900 (Studies in Environment and History)","review":"Alfred Crosby is one of the few historians who have changed the way people think. Back in the 1960s he got the crazy idea that the *biological* expansion of Europe into the rest of the world was the real story of the last few centuries. His book, The Columbian Exchange -- Europe sent over people and germs and got back the biological wealth of the Americas -- was rejected by a dozen publishers. This book is a restating and resharpening and amplification of this thesis, which by now is so well accepted in its basics that I was amused to see some of the Amazon reviewers say there was not that much new here. In a way, I guess they're right, but this book is nonetheless full of wonderful historical connections -- why smallpox caused the slave trade, why corn changed the history of Eastern Europe -- that you would never think of otherwise. I would also want to single out Crosby's writing, which is dryly humorous and even moving on occasion. Altogether amazing stuff, this book."},{"Title":"Ecological Imperialism: The Biological Expansion of Europe, 900-1900 (Studies in Environment and History)","review":"Professor Crosby is both a historian and a student of ecology; I am neither, yet I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It concerns the unintended displacement of the native plants and animals of the New World by European species, which hitchhiked aboard the boats of Columbus (and other explorers). Sound dry? It's anything but. Crosby has no less a story to tell than the biological reshaping of an entire continent. If you think that humans have only lately been responsible for environmental disruption on a global scale, this book will show you otherwise. Our species is an integral part of our environment, and has been shaping and reshaping it for centuries - a colossal process that has determined which food crops we grow, what species of trees shelter us, what diseases we suffer, even what birds we hear sing at dawn...In short, nature itself is largely manmade.And if an epic, true story isn't enough to lure you to read this book, consider Mr. Crosby's prose - clear, straightforward, even moving. This book changed the way I see the natural world, and was a pleasure to read in the bargain. You can't ask for much more than that."},{"Title":"Ecological Imperialism: The Biological Expansion of Europe, 900-1900 (Studies in Environment and History)","review":"'Ecological imperialism: The biological expansion of Europe, 900-1900', by A. W. Crosby is a very informative read. This book is an absolute must for anybody studying the ecological and historical impact of European expansionism up until the 20th century. Introducing the term \\"Neo-Europes,\\" Crosby posits that for the Europeans to have openly sought expansion into new territories, they would have factored into account the location and geographic climate, and known that the new territory would have been favorable to supporting the pre-existing agriculture of the Europeans.By tying together a vast reservoir of sources, and taking a humorous tone, Crosby presents fresh insight that deviates from the norm of school-taught drivel. For example, the description of the Viking explorers as tentative sailors (as opposed to the fearless and conquering image that is brought to mind), or the image of Karlsefni scaring off an attack by the native Amerindians with livestock are just a few examples of the in-depth research that was undertaken by Crosby to present such a new look at the settlement of the Americas.The Vikings, as described by Crosby, were some of the earliest settlers, however they also failed because of their lack of infectious diseases. Crosby states that as an isolated civilization, they were unable to conquer the New World via the cop-out of infecting the indigenous populations with pre-existing diseases (i.e. smallpox).Crosby takes a millennia long process and boils it down into an easy to understand read that is humorous and informative, without being overbearingly scholarly. For any student of history, environmental history, etc., this is absolutely vital to understand the impact that conquering forces, invading agriculture, and infectious germs had upon history and conquered peoples."},{"Title":"Cicero: Pro Roscio Amerino (Bristol Latin Texts Series)","review":"If you're looking for an accurate transcription of Cicero's speech defending Sextus Roscius, then this is the text for you. The introduction and interspersed synopses are also very helpful. The only area of improvement needed is in the notes, where, at times, the explanation of a Latin term consists of other (sometimes more obscure) Latin terms. Otherwise, it's an excellent little book."},{"Title":"Cicero: Pro Roscio Amerino (Bristol Latin Texts Series)","review":"This is a review of E.H. Donkin's commentary on Cicero's oration Pro Roscio Amerino. This commentary was originally published in 1915 and has been reprinted by the Bristol Classical Press. A brand new commentary by Andrew Dyck on this speech was published in 2010 in the Cambridge green and yellow series under the alternate title Pro Sexto Roscio, so the question confronting a potential buyer of this much older commentary is whether there is anything to recommend it over the newer one other than a difference in cost. In most respects the answer is no. Among other things, the newer commentary provides a much more expansive and detailed treatment of the speech that builds upon the advances of scholarship that have been made in the intervening century on the historical context of the speech and on Cicero's oratorical aims and practices.Donkin's commentary is not necessarily obsolete, however. For the advanced reader whose goal is to read through the speech quickly and efficiently, Donkin's clear presentation and brief but targeted notes could potentially be more useful than the expansive notes of the newer commentary, which is often quite dense. In Donkin's commentary each section of the Latin text is prefaced by an English paraphrase of the main point Cicero will make in that section, an arrangement that allows for more rapid comprehension of the text and helps the reader more readily see the pronounced transitions between individual sections of the speech. Donkin's notes provide limited grammatical help that is more or less adequate for a reader with about 4 years or more experience studying Latin, but for a reader with less experience Donkin's grammatical help will perhaps be too infrequent and too allusive for him or her to use this commentary easily and profitably. The main purpose of the notes and the brief introduction to the speech is really to help the reader follow Cicero's line of argumentation and to clarify potentially obscure references to contemporary realities and the facts of the case.The speech itself was delivered by Cicero in 80 BC on behalf of a man, Sextus Roscius, who was on trial for killing his father, a crime that Cicero argues was actually perpetrated by two of the murdered man's relatives in collusion with a freedman of the dictator Sulla. The speech is thus an amazing piece of rhetoric in that it must perform the neat trick of placing the guilt for the crime on close associates of the current dictator without calling into question the legitimacy of Sulla's regime, and the speech is filled with discussions of aristocratic ideology, Sulla's proscriptions, traditional Roman morality, literary and historical precedents, and Roman views on parricide. This speech was also Cicero's big debut in public life in the Roman Forum and thus offers interesting points of comparison with his later forensic and political orations. On the whole then, Pro Roscio Amerino provides notable insights into an important historical period for which we have relatively little contemporary evidence and also into the early development of an orator who would later stand at the forefront of Roman politics and literary culture. For these reasons this speech is a must read for anyone interested in Roman history and literature regardless of which commentary one ultimately chooses to purchase."},{"Title":"Defacement: Public Secrecy and the Labor of the Negative","review":"The anthropologist Michael Taussig provides a detailed and thoughful narrative on the cultural phenomena of public secrecy and Hegel's &quot;labor of the negative,&quot; drawing inspiration from an impressive range of sources both new and old. This is a book on the theory and practice of unmasking, as a cultural practice that both contains and sustains the sacred in its ever-slippery transition back and forth between explicit cultural knowledge and public secrecy. In &quot;unmasking unmasking&quot; (to borrow a Taussigian metalogism) via a lively engagement with the ideas of both critical theorists (Nietsche, Benjamin, Canetti) and ethnologists, we learn that public secrecy can be the most crucial - if the most rarefied - form of social knowledge. In the book's last section, we recognize Uncle Mike as the little child in &quot;The Emperor's New Clothes,&quot; who naively but urgently challenges us to see how that film of secrecy - behind which social life is all-too-often lived with perfect complicity - actually works its way into the making and unmaking of meaning."},{"Title":"Flight Across the Mekong","review":"I enjoyed reading this book.

No dull recounting of historical facts and figures here. Rather a fast-paced education in the complexity of a South East Asian nation in revolution - with sufficient intigue and even a touch of teenage roamance for good measure. Having lived in Bangkok and frequented Pattaya, the Laotion border and Thai jails there was an undeniably realistic feel to the overloaded samlaw struggling up the hill.

The account of this period of her life is wonderfully told in her previous book, THE MEZUZAH IN THE MADONNA'S FOOT: Marranos and Other Secret Jews.Her second book, THE MARRANO LEGACY, chronicles an intriguing relationship she develops over the Internet with a mysterious Crypto-Jewish Priest. The priest, Simon, is a Spaniard who read her first book and found that it coincided with much of his own family history of hidden identify. The Marranos are secret Jews who converted to Catholicism at the time of the Spanish Inquisition, all the while keeping alive the traditions and customs, even some of the rituals of ancient Judaism! Secrecy and determination to hide all evidence of their Jewish roots continues into the present. The memory of entire Jewish communities wiped out in Spain at the time of the Inquisition and the more recent events of the Holocaust have only served to strengthen their resolve to remain concealed, and to live clandestine lives.Still, many Jewish practices were retained. Lighting Sabbath candles on Friday night in church was one of the ploys used by these Conversos. Las Posadas, a nine-day feast when bonfires and candles are lit \\"to guide the Holy Family looking for shelter,\\" coincides with the Hanukkah celebration. Keeping Kosher and the marked aversion to pork; even performing the sign of the cross could be managed by reciting a whispered Jewish prayer secretly.The most extraordinary practice that these Conversos established was to mandate that one male member of each generation of Crypto-Jews be chosen by his family to enter a seminary and be ordained a priest so that he could provide a link between their secret world and the Church and community. To this day such priests exist. The complicated web of secrecy and double identities that underlie the existence of a Crypto-Jewish priest is the subject Alexy's new book as she chronicles her amazing correspondence with \\"Simon\\".They begin an exchange as fragile as that of timid lovers getting to know one another in a psychological atmosphere surrounded by the constant fear with which Crypto-Jews live their daily lives. Alexy's training as a psycho-therapist no doubt gave confidence to Simon that his needs for secrecy and absolute control over the material that he would reveal would be respected. So far, so good. The correspondence however takes very unexpected turns. Not even the most gifted therapist can anticipate the infinite nuances attending each exchange. Halfway through their correspondence Alexy also discovers he is nothing like her fantasy of Simon as one of El Grecos's martyred saints with deep-set dark eyes full of pain. Simon is a live wire of energy and has most contemporary tastes. Though mired in the past, he travels, goes to bullfights, loves to ski, and enjoys foreign films on his VCR. It was his grandfather, an elder of the Marrano Community, who selected him to be a priest while at the same time teaching him to be a secret Jew. Simon's own parents whom he loves dearly do not know of this second identity!The weight of so much baggage challenges Alexy's utomost skill, patience, and faith. It brings up a great many of her own inner conflkicts, traces from the confused path she had been forced to follow in her own youth. Their relationship grows, yet the fate of such anguished souls is prdictably riddled with complications. At various junctures she is convinced that she has frightened him away when she doesn't hear from him for months on end. Tragedy nearly ends the friendship altogether.In tiny incremental bits we are taken on this strange beguiling journey between two marvelously intelligent people trying to make sense of revelations that inform the reader yet again of the life-shattering cost of man's inhumanity. The author's great skill for asking the right questions, her timing, and sensitivity to this unusual young man's mysterious life make this an entirely original story."},{"Title":"The Marrano Legacy: A Contemporary Crypto-Jewish Priest Reveals Secrets of His Double Life","review":"In the 1490s, Christopher Columbus left Spain to explore new worlds. Also during that period, the dark, deadly and repressive era of the Inquistion began in Spain. Thus was born the secret Crypto-Jews. Trudi Alexy's striking book takes the reader on a five hundred year old journey of discovery, regarding the mysterious Crypto-Jews, from the time of the Inquisiton, to the present. In a series of electronic mail, between Trudi Alexy and a Crypto-Jewish Catholic priest, we learn of the pressures, conflicts, deception, confusion and thoughts of living a double life. I could hardly wait to turn the page and read the sometime belated response from the hidden priest, whose life is filled with apprehension, danger and surprises. Trudi Alexy's book reads like a mystery or spy story. Her postscript is insightful and brilliant. Fascinating reading."},{"Title":"The Marrano Legacy: A Contemporary Crypto-Jewish Priest Reveals Secrets of His Double Life","review":"\\"The Marrano Legacy\\" by Trudi Alexy is one of finest books I have read lately. With 149 pages, it is a fast read. It is also a must-read for everyone who is interested in this subject. Ms Alexy explains in her Prologue what sort of story this is: \\"an intensely personal\\" one, both for her and the crypto-Jewish priest \\"Simon\\". She touches on her own life and relates it to the letters which go back and forth between her and \\"Simon\\". They are very moving letters, painful letters often, which explore intensely personal feelings. The Prologue also explains what is meant by a \\"crypto-Jew\\". The book is beautifully written and quite revealing about both Ms Alexy and \\"Simon\\" though his anonymity has been preserved. I found it moving because I am a Jewish Child Survivor of the Holocaust and, after the war (World War II) was over, still had to hide my Jewishness because my parents told me so, so it was easy for me to relate to \\"Simon's\\" situation. Hiding becomes a habit and this is true for \\"Simon\\" as well. I would - and indeed will - highly recommend this book to everyone. If anyone is not now very interested in crypto-Jews, you will certainly be after you read this book."},{"Title":"The Marrano Legacy: A Contemporary Crypto-Jewish Priest Reveals Secrets of His Double Life","review":"Just a note to point out that the two previous reviewers' comments are unfair to _The Marrano Legacy_. Trudi Alexy is entirely aware that she has no physical proof of the existence of her mysterious Crypto-Jewish correspondent and discusses this issue in her book. It is also more than clear that she is aware that the Sephardic Jews who converted to Christianity did this not to escape the Inquisition, but to stay in their native land, Spain; the Inquisition prosecuted them as Judaizing Christians, not as Jews. The book poses serious questions about group and religious identity and is extremely well written. I'm grateful to chance for coming across it in the library and highly recommend it to anyone of \\"mixed\\" cultural or religious origin."},{"Title":"The Marrano Legacy: A Contemporary Crypto-Jewish Priest Reveals Secrets of His Double Life","review":"I hope Ms. Alexy's mysterious, secretive priest has some idea of the damage he inflicted on her book by refusing to be forthcoming, refusing to answer questions, refusing to meet, and so forth--to an absurd and unnecessary extent.\\"Simon's\\" voiced assertions that he is pleased by her publishing news and that he wants her to tell his story are disingenuous, considering what lengths to which he has gone to avoid giving any answers to her questions beyond the most vague--then coming up with a disaster to excuse avoiding a meeting, followed by a terminally broken heart to excuse ending all communication about Crypto-Judaism. Especially vile was \\"Simon's\\" announcement that two young Ashkenazi Jewish men apparently traveled to his little town somewhere in Latin America and murdered his uncle, a Catholic priest (decades before), because he was a Crypto-Jew: vile because he then refused to discuss the incident further, and soon afterwards stopped cooperating. As it stands, it is merely a mean fiction.Apparently in the end he became a nonsecular sort of interfaith person, which is a shame if, as he claims, he was the end-product of 500 years of lovingly maintained Jewish tradition in his family.It all sounds like Internet trolling to me, I'm sorry: some young person somewhere was jerking Ms. Alexy around for the mere sake of entertainment--and then began desperately casting around for ways to get out of the ruse. Back in those days--'98 and '99--that was all too common.If that is the impression \\"Simon\\" has left us with, he will be clear with us: it is all our fault! All our fault for not just knuckling under and believing whatever any stranger chooses to claim about his own heritage. Jews the world over study hard in order to take on their full responsibilities as adult Jews. That's how it's done. Crypto-Jews have hidden for 500 years, he says, so despite their heavy Catholic credentials, Jews should just believe them and welcome them as fully educated, bar mitzvah'd Jews! In the end he is so angry at Jews for not welcoming Crypto-Jews as already-bar mitzvah'd Jews (though he has apparently not even tried) that he rejects Judaism altogether.I worship with several ex-\\"Crypto-Jews,\\" and I can tell you that this man is not their best representative.His fury seemed to affect Ms. Alexy deeply, but perhaps didn't make her very angry because she herself had been a hidden Jew, and so was by definition not one of those at whom her priestly pen-pal was so enraged.I don't know whether to be angry at a fraud who targeted an honest and caring woman or a priest who showed himself to have a shallow intellect and fragile character.I did enjoy reading the book because the author's style is engaging and she is forthcoming, sincere, and genuine. I will probably read her earlier book, \\"The Mezuzah in the Madonna's Foot,\\" which sounds like it is just packed with verifiable and fascinating stories."},{"Title":"The Marrano Legacy: A Contemporary Crypto-Jewish Priest Reveals Secrets of His Double Life","review":"One can only wonder at the claim \\"'Simon,' a descendant of Spain's medieval Marranos who submitted to baptism to escape the Inquisition,...\\" Since only baptized Christians were subject to the Inquisition, one is hard-pressed to imagine how being baptized would constitute an \\"escape\\" from the Inquisition, itelf greatly exaggerated as the Black Legend."},{"Title":"Yoruba-English/English-Yoruba Modern Practical Dictionary (Yoruba Edition)","review":"This dictionary has it all. It is very good and basically can replace the need of a grammer book. In the beginning pages, it teaches you some of the grammar used in the Yoruba langauge. Tone patterns, the vowels, question types, greetings, verb conjuctions and word roots.Besides that, this dictionary contains the meaning of just about any word you could think of in the English or the Yoruba language. Really, it has some odd and wierd words in here that you would never think you would even say in a sentence. Also, the dictionary itself doesnt just give the definition, it also defines small variances of the word. (Ex: See: lati ri (nkan); Let me see: Je ki nriran; To understand: lati ye; I see: O ye mi.) It also translates the English word to Yoruba. (Ex: Shout [A loud cry] or Fox [Doglike wild animal])This book is a must-have for anyone trying to learn Yoruba. It contains so many words, even primitive Yoruba word such as Ireti which means Hope or Gbimo which means Plan. It contains over 26,000 entries.The only thing I would advise anyone to do, is to learn the Yoruba alphabet if you do not already know it.

The YORUBA MODERN PRACTICAL DICTIONARY is one example. Compiled by Kayode J. Fakinlede, the dictionary is cleared aimed at a Nigerian audience, both Yoruba speakers working with English and non-Yoruba learning this major national language.Fakinlede is not a professional lexiconographer, but a research scientist and, as we are told, \\"avowed Yoruba nationalist.\\" One of the key aims of this dictionary seems to be facilitating the development of Yoruba scientific terminologies. There's a 10-page listing of English to Yoruba wood roots (e.g. \\"bio-\\", \\"cardio-\\", \\"quadri-\\"), and the English-Yoruba portion of the dictionary contains an usual amount of specialized scientific terms for such a relatively small dictionary. There's also some example texts of mathematical operations in Yoruba at the end, such as \\"To divide D in a ratio of A to B, find the sum of the ratios: A + B\\".That the dictionary was written for a Nigerian audience is evident in the glossing of each English listing in the English-Yoruba portion. Listings such as \\"nosegay [a small bouquet, a bunch of flowers] or. idi ododo\\" are clearly meant to help out readers whose English might be shaky. And, of course, the preface written by attorney-general and civil rights activist Bola Ige, shortly before he was assassinated, is the sort of thing that would attract a local Nigerian audience.However, the dictionary can still be useful for English-speaking students of Yoruba outside of Nigeria. A 13-page grammar gives a good sketch of the language, and the dictionary itself contains 26,000 entries with few noticeable lacunae. I'm not aware of any better dictionary that is widely available in the United States. However, the dictionary does suffer from a fault common to all of Hippocrene's dictionaries: extremely amateur typesetting. The bulk of this dictionary, a trade paperback reaching nearly 700 pages, could have been lessened had so much space not been wasted on each page."},{"Title":"Yoruba-English/English-Yoruba Modern Practical Dictionary (Yoruba Edition)","review":"I will echo the other reviewers in saying that this is probably the best Yoruba dictionary on the market. I have yet to look for an English > Yoruba translation and not find it. That being said, there is a definite lack of Yoruba > English (the Yoruba > English section is less than half the size of the English > Yoruba section) so it is much less helpful in translating from Yoruba into English than the other way around. As a student studying Yoruba, it is not as helpful when I am reading a Yoruba text and attempting to find the meaning of a Yoruba word. My Yoruba professor has also identified some errors in translating English into Yoruba.My largest disappointment with this dictionary, however, is with its CLEARLY Christianized and biased stance toward the Yoruba indigenous religion. It translates \\"devil\\" as \\"Esu\\" for example, when years and years of scholarship have indicated that this is an incorrect association (Esu is a deity in the indigenous religion and is in NO WAY analagous to the Christian devil). Additionally, it translates \\"idolater\\" as \\"aborisa\\" which is also incorrect (an aborisa is one who practices Yoruba indigenous religion and most would take issue with being referred to as \\"idolaters\\" particularly since it is clear that this term is being used pejoratively). There are several other translations of this sort which are extremely off-putting and disappointing. Outsiders have demonized Yoruba religion -- and African religions more broadly -- enough without someone who is of the culture doing so in a book that is supposed to be a neutral reference guide (to the extent that anything can be \\"neutral\\").

It was not written to a Christian audience rather for people who believe in a sort of American Christianity Manifest destiny. There are a lot of things American Christians do well but telling people that the their way is the only way that Christianity can exist in a democracy is definitely not one of them. Shakespeare said the eye can not see itself except by reflection the author should have reflected more but instead he tried to tell us how the American version of Christianity should work with out\`putting research and thought into it. A little more reflection, looking how others are doing it would have been interesting but describing your view of your belly button was gross and boring."},{"Title":"Achieve Your Ideal Weight... Auto-matically (While-U Drive)","review":"I feel the other reviewer on this book/tape seemed to be confused about the word Auto-matically, which is printed on the cover.I just begun to listen to this tape mid December and I do like it. You can listen to this tape while driving (the main reason I purchase it). I believe it's a play on words. Auto-matically does not mean that weight will come off automatically. I've read the back cover on another similar self-help tapes and they stress &quot;DO NOT use their tapes while driving it can cause drousiness etc. This tape YOU CAN DRIVE and listen. Read the back cover and decide for yourself.You must be open mined about how this tape works and they do stress that. They use affirmations (positive assertions) mostly throughout the tape. You may feel corny at first, (I do) repeating these affirmations to yourself, but maybe this IS what I/we need to &quot;win the mental game of weight control. I know I can't achieve a better me soly by listening to this tape alone. In the short time of listening to this tape I can already see that mentally I'm more positive about wanting to improve myself.

However, their voices are so relaxing I found myself having trouble staying awake when I used the cassette. Secondly, its obvious they are very happy with each other and they indicate this with comments to one another that really detract from the point of the cassette. The premise of the cassette is that feeling good about yourself will help you lose weight and once you feel good about yourself the weight will come off &quot;automatically&quot; but then they go on to recommend a 40/30/30 diet!

Dennis Beaudry has captured the current state of Christianity in this fictional account of events within the Body of Christ. The State of Christianity reads as if the story is happening in today's headlines. You will find murder, deception, lies, suspense and scandals all in the name of Christianity as author Dennis Beaudry brings his character alive on the pages of his book. While this book will be one book that you will not want to put down, it will challenge you in your faith and bring you to the realization that as a country we need to go back to the basics of our heritage and our faith. Our country, our churches and our lives will move forward if we just go back to the basics. The State of Christianity is a book that I highly recommend to any one. I promise you, that you will not be able to put this book down, you will be encouraged, strengthened and solid in your faith in God."},{"Title":"The State of Christianity","review":"Dennis Beaudry has made a book which touches the scriptures in a way every Christian and non-Christian home needs to look at closely. In the revelation seen across the country in several major cities, Dennis shows us the real truth of whether we will follow God's will or our own. Only to see the final results of the God's power through His Holy Spirit outpouring in the nation's heartland, Kansas. The ability to bring church and state together in such a thrilling and captivating book would seem impossible. \\"But,\\" Dennis did it very dramatically.An excellent and must read,Daryl D.

If you have ever read any of Kurt Vonnegut's books, you will know that his sister had died of cancer. What you learn from this book is that her husband died on the very same day and the children from that family went to Kurt Vonnegut and his wife who already had three children of their own. Sounds too much to be true?

It describes, in clear language, some of the very real, day to day problems that the author's family encounters by welcoming these four boys into their already child filled lives; with the author's three children, these four make seven.

Traces the development of Whitman's fascination with death and his internal struggle between his faith in immortality and the constant doubts that impinge on this faith. A definite contribution toward understanding Whitman's inner life.Analyzes virtually every poem and poetic passage that is concerned with or colored by Whitman's attitudes toward death andilluminates these poems and their language. Sets the poetry in the context of Whitman's discussions of death and of contemporary discussions and theories of death.The book is itself a worthy meditation on death. Recommended for Whitman fans, for readers of poetry and for general readers.Ted Malone"},{"Title":"Third Millennium Equipoise","review":"It's rare to find such a powerful and thoughtful assessment of the world situation - and written years before others were drawing the parallels across the many systems General Saighal describes. I can imagine that this broad global vision must have been brewing inside of him for many years. To read it is to see the way forward in these fragile times.At the end of the book is a deeply moving epilogue. While the text of the book engages the head, the beautiful epilogue is sheer poetry --- very moving."},{"Title":"Third Millennium Equipoise","review":"Yes, we know the big five have been stockpiling nukes enough to kill off the Earth several times over. Yes we know that even before Exxon was caught red handed by Greenpeace, scores of corporations were throwing muck into the ocean when nobody was looking(or at least appeared to).Yet, while millions of Dollars have been pumped into( and earned, may we add) ,by the business of spreading awareness into already aware Homo Sapiens(excepting perhaps, Exxon),precious little exists to tell us what to do to stop the rot.Not surprisingly then, most Eco revival movements start promisingly, to gradually peter down into groups of harmless demonstrators waving placards outside the accounts office of Gammon Inc. or worse, for want of something concrete in their action plan, end up blowing factory pipelines with Gelignite.It is precisely here that General Saighal scores a victory. The TME while fulfilling the role of an impassioned plea for action, is actually a blueprint .A step by step guide, a Seldon plan ,to shorten the period of Eco-barbarism that would gradually arise if the current spate is unchecked.The author was a serving officer in the Indian Army before his retirement in 1995,and has held several sensitive appointments, including a tenure in the Middle East, as well as UN peacekeeping assignments. This, evidently is much of the source of observations and reasonings in the book.Broadly, he seeks out a (practically, more or less)no Nuclear weapons Earth, which could only be achieved within a time frame in turn divided into phases. Starting with the mobilisation of all thinking folk via all resources available, including the information superhighway, it would start with a series of reforms within the United Nations, perhaps the only platform left to us .Next, it would involve a target oriented, phasewise reduction in the Nuclear weapon arsenals of both the haves and the (allegedly) have-nots, with special care being taken for the rogue nuclear states. Sounds easy? Well, the author (and I) feel otherwise. With the vested interests of people wishing to stick to power with any glue available, and the powerful military industrial complex, which stands to lose everything it currently posseses, the task is going to be anything but easy, though not impossible.There are plans outlined to deal with both Nuclear terrorism and Rogue nuclear states. However, these, and indeed all the protocols set up by general Saighal need a baseline international co-operation to be successful. Considering the basic human tenant to be irrational, as well the total lack of any world leader of stature at the present moment, it does seem an uphill task. But then it is high time we got together and started something more substantial than waving hand made placards at ministerial cavalcades.The style of the author is lucid, the language simple. Though the book does appear to drag it's feet at certain areas at the start, it soon assumes a slick pace that continues throughout the work. Most subjects pertaining to the topic are covered, though I personally feel that possibly ,an unpredictable nation like China would require a more finely cut ,tailor made policy, a sort of \`special' approach.There is however, one catch. A pricing of four hundred rupees is bound to discourage buyership among the studentia, the actual grassroots for any movement. Hopefully, the promised paperback edition might rectify this.Dr. Anand Sharma"},{"Title":"Third Millennium Equipoise","review":"Third Millennium Equipoise: What is to be done?In this \\"transition year\\" to the next millennium (which we have begun celebrating prematurely) there is a need for deep reflection and thought about the shape of the next decade. The next ten years promise to be fraught with wonder and danger at every turn but they also are probably the last window of opportunity that humanity has to change the way we are exploiting nature and our fellow men and women.If humankind is able to harness its collective energy and is able to sow the seeds of a harmonious and an ecologically sustainable world order (not the quarter-baked one we currently have), then the storm clouds gathering at the horizon can be held at bay forever (that is till our Sun becomes a red giant!). On the other hand if we are unable to do so then the extremes of unsustainable poverty and wealth, nuclear armageddon and terrorism, climate change... threaten to make the life of our grandchildren quite dire and difficultHumankind has achieved a lot in the last millennium but one should not forget that there is a large section of the world that is still undernourished and suffering an existence at the margins of civilisation. It is only too easy to forget their existence and in fact even to justify that \\"there will always be losers in this race to enrich oneself.\\" The distinguishing feature of our age is undoubtedly the pace of technological innovation and advancement.For the first time in the history of the earth, a species has now has the ability to consciously dominate nature and to shape it according to its will. This ability to hegemonize is, however, incomplete as nature still has the ability to consign us as a species to its dustbin of \\"has-been dominant species\\", as was the case with dinosaurs. Can humankind avert such a fate?It is this question that haunts us as we step into the next millennium. However, the time that we have to change our path to avert such a fate is of limited duration (probably till 2010). It is in this context, Vinod Saighal's \\"Third Millennium Equipoise\\" becomes not only relevant but also indispensable.Vinod Saighal in his book makes the case for nuclear disarmament that is not only compelling but also achievable if we are able to get out of \\"ghetto mentality\\" of being divided as nation-states (or any other such countless divisions such as religion). However, we, as Vinod Saighal also emphasizes, do not have much time to begin the process of ecological revival of the planetIt is imperative that we enlarge the canvass of democracy by creating a New World order in which the people are the sovereign (not the nation-state) and have the chance to create a sustainable future that is necessary to revive the earth for the benefit of our unborn generations. In the third millenium equipoise, Vinod Saighal outlines a blueprint of what needs to be done to enable such a transition.First and foremost, according to him we must consign our weapons of mass-destruction (and mutually assured destruction (MAD) scenarios) to the past. However this can only be achieved if we are able to democratize the world order we live, i.e. equality in status and power between the nuclear-haves and have-nots. In fact, Vinod Saighal makes the case that real and lasting nuclear disarmament is only possible if we are able to democratize and fundamentally restructure the United Nations simultaneously.Second, the success of this quest is also hinged on our ability to change our consumption patterns (of matter and energy) that seem to define \\"a happy life\\" by the amount of goods we can accumulate in our finite lifetimes. Therefore, in order to revive the planet and to safeguard our future as a dominant (but enlightened) species, we need to start questioning the \\"politics of consumption\\" which is the sina qua none of our ability to dominate.Our consumption patterns are already unsustainable and if the current path is not altered then with every addition of wealth (or population) we also add an additional constraint on our ability to cope with the consequences of our \\"unbridled material needs (and greed).\\" For instance, if in the next ten years China and/or India define their notion of being \\"developed\\" as the West has in the last century, then surely we as the dominant species are doomed because of the material consequences that follow from such a definition.It is imperative that we in the under-developed South are able to posit and create a new paradigm of development that is intrinsically sustainable and transferable (to the developed West). The good news is that such a paradigm already exists. However, the bad news is that it only seems to exist as a luddite alternative as articulated by Mahatma Gandhi at the beginning of the twentieth century. His vision of a \\"bottom-up\\" democracy and control (over resources) at the level of the village has only become possible now, i.e. if we are able to use the potential of the new Internet based technologies to democratize decision-making so as to give \\"people\\" control over their local resources.However, at the same time we need to devise an international system (superstructure) of managing the global resources such as unpolluted air and water more judiciously then we have hitherto done. This is exactly what Vinod Saighal implies when he expounds his idea of a Planetary Council replacing the United Nations over a fifty-year period in the blueprint outlined in his book.What is now imperative, in my opinion, is that we (as the world) should begin taking the initial steps towards such a future in the next decade (or so). Otherwise, the historical turning point and the window of opportunity that we have to re-shape our future in the next ten years will close without our winning the battle over \\"uncertainty\\" that is plaguing our generation, i.e. the inability to visualize a future for our progeny that is not emasculated by our currently insatiable appetites for material goods.Therefore, the central theme for all action in the new millennium must be to address this issue squarely. In essence what needs to be done is to nurture a paradigm of sustainable development, which insures the future by radically changing our current paradigm of development."},{"Title":"Imhotep, builder in stone (Immortals of engineering)","review":"We really know little of Imhotep the man, writes Maribelle Cormack in her book:We do not know where or when he was born, but we don't know either when he died, in fact, we know too that he was worshipped 2000 years later and that the Greeks identified him with Aesculapius, their god of medicine.\\"We do know that he built the world's first great structure of stone, the Step Pyramid at Saqqara...and that he...began the age of the pyramids builders. He set a pattern that would be followed for several thousand years...In the field of medicine, even the best medical knowledge was mixed with superstition...But much medical knowledge that Imhotep possesed was sound and based on experience. To say that a physician had been trained in Egypt, even far into the Greek and Roman days, was equivalente for that time to saying that he had a modern diplome from the finest medical school...\\"Well, I bought this book about Imhotep, because of the mystery about him, and in fact, his life was so mysterious that it is a real source for novels, and this little book is a must-read for all those interested in ancient mysteries, and specially of this man, that was an andite according to The Urantia Book:\\"The Andite races were the primary blends of the pure-line violet race and the Nodites plus the evolutionary peoples.

She discovered a healing technique when working on other people. She had cancer in the leg, and was going to lose the leg, so she applied the technique, and was able to save her leg and her life.It certainly is interesting to see this theta healing technique described. You are using a deeper state of mind, to connect with the source, to rearrange your DNA, and effect permanent positive changes and healing. Theta is a state of mind associated with deep meditation, light sleep, insight, and creativity.I cannot say for certain whether it works yet because I may not be doing it properly, and I may have beliefs that are blocking me. I do believe the technique has merit. What I have noticed is additional warmth and energy in my body when I am doing this.I do believe you can clear many emotional issues when you are in a theta state, and there is an emotional aspect to many illnesses. Also, Theta visualization is fun.If you have difficulty accessing the Theta state, which I believe most people will, I recommend you get the Dr Jeffrey Thompson cd's, Theta Meditation System, and Awakened Mind system. These will help lead your mind to the desired state.In this book are many repatterning techniques, as the author has studied NLP. So, you can overcome emotional issues, and replace limiting beliefs using the techniques in this book. These are very useful, and it is difficult to find many books that cover this issue properly. I would recommend this book for this reason alone.There are techniques for creating for your own reality, which I feel would work, including attracting a soul mate. One of these is a Huna technique similar to what I am already using, and I believe this would work for you too.The actual chapter on gene replacement is very short, so I suspect that is covered in detail in the first book.The world is constantly evolving, and if you use books such as this and anything by Sanaya Roman, you will be on the cutting edge of our spiritual evolution, and understand better than most how the world works, and work with it, and make it work for you.If you were to use this book, you will benefit from it. It also has many profound insights. I recommend it.I also highly recommend EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique) which is a simple acupressure technique which can be done in less than two minutes. Can you imagine easily letting go of emotional issues such as anger, anxiety, fear, forgiveness, sadness, stress, phobias, procrastination, trauma etc. You can research this further and download a free manual at [...], and buy various EFT books at Amazon.Please note that since writing this book she has consolidated both these books into a single bookTheta Healing: Introducing an Extraordinary Energy Healing Modality, so if you are interested in this topic I recommend you get that book because it combines all these priciple in one book.

It reads like it's written by a twelve year old and was given to the publisher in its unedited form.

I tried the techniques of rising up above my body and entering the crown chakra of my 'patient' and visualising the sick areas of their body and extracting the programs from the DNA.However I think I need more practice. And whatever you do, be careful with the medical advice she gives. Some of it is doubtful and poorly researched. Including extracting metal government implants from people.

She blurts out to Whitney that she is Whitney's sitter and can't allow the girl to overindulge in eating sweets. Naturally Whitney is hurt to think that she has to have a hired sitter.

The basic motif of the calendar remains the same. For each month there is a large publicity photograph and a pair of smaller candid shots from the show. There are five big shots of Sarah Michelle Gellar as Buffy, and one each of Nicholas Brendon as Xander Harris, Alyson Hannigan as Willow Rosenberg, and Anthony Stewart Head as Rupert Giles. Then there are pair shots of Buffy and Angel (David Boreanaz), and Spike (James Marsters) and Drusilla (Juliet Landau). The latter is a nice touch because as excited as fans got about Spike and Buffy being together, Spike and Dru were a neat team too. The final two months are devoted to cast shots from different seasons.As for the other cast members like Anya and Dawn, and key recurring roles like Faith and Joyce, they are reduced to the smaller photographs, at least for this year's calendar. The shots cover most of the seasons of \\"BtVS,\\" and I like the shot of the kids as graduates of Sunnydale High class of '99. As always the backdrop for the photo triptychs is nice and intricate, and there are four sets of them for the 2006 calendar. On the calendar part of the calendar you get the phases of moon, making it useful for Oz and his kind, and national holidays from places they tend to speak a lot of English. There is plenty of room to be able to write things down on the calendar, but I still believe most fans are going to use this primarily for display purposes. If they need something functional, there is the \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer 2005-2006 Student Planner,\\" even if you are not a student.In terms of companion calendars for this one there is a \\"Spike 2006 Wall Calendar,\\" but apparently there is not one for \\"Angel.\\" This will really mess up my bulletin board, because the Spike calendar is supposed to be in the middle between Buffy and Angel, because, well, you watched the shows so you know why and I do not need to explain it to you. Canceling a television series is bad enough, but canceling a calendar?

This chapter, one of the suthor's seven academic articles gathered to make up the present volume, expands the usual reading of the text and develops six different narrative contexts in which we can view it.A creative, in-depth study of less-frequently-examined corners of the earliest Gospel, with an introductory chapter on narrative criticism, followed by chapters on \\"Fallible Followers,\\" \\"Disciples/Crowds/Whoever,\\" \\"Interpreting the Disciples in Mark, \\"Jewish Leaders in the Gospel of Mark,\\" and \\"The Major Importance of Minor Characters in Mark.\\""},{"Title":"In the Company of Jesus: Characters in Mark's Gospel","review":"This is an extraordinarily helpful collection of fine articles written over the years by a pioneer in narrative criticism of Mark's Gospel. It begins with Struthers Malbon's original introductory article to the field of narrative criticism in general, and continues with several essays on various characters and character groups in Mark.These articles provide a wealth of information and insight for any serious student or teacher of Mark's Gospel, and also complement her recent masterwork on the characterization of Jesus,Mark's Jesus: Characterization as Narrative Christology, as well as her analysis of Markan spatial settings,Narrative Space and Mythic Meaning in Mark (Biblical Seminar Series).Struthers-Malbon writes in dialogue with the finest scholarship in the field, yet in an accessible style that draws non-specialists into the discussion and teaches them about the field as she goes. With academic rigor she interprets the Gospel in a pastoral style that engages our common human experience of reality and does justice to Mark's enduring and ever fresh story. I thoroughly recommend it!"},{"Title":"In the Company of Jesus: Characters in Mark's Gospel","review":"Elizabeth Struthers Malbon's book, In the Company of Jesus; Characters in Mark's Gospel, is a collection of seven essays written by the author. The first chapter gives the reader a background in narrative criticism, which is the basis for the rest of the essays. Each of the essays takes a look at a different set of characters in the Gospel of Mark. They range from the women in the Gospel to the disciples. I found the book to be enjoyable, but I can see that a little instruction in narrative criticism would be helpful in reading this work. Overall I enjoyed this book, but I would recommend it for someone who has had some instruction in narrative criticism."},{"Title":"The Book of Whole Meals","review":"I recommend this book to anyone interested in macrobiotics, vegetarianism, and general healthy living. The book begins with the theories on why it is important that we eat organic, locally grown, natural foods. It explains how to choose your meals, what those &quot;wierd&quot; natural foods are that were unfamiliar to me before I read this book, and even how to set up your kitchen. The recipes make up the second half of the book. It is divided into winter, spring, summer, and fall with seven complete meal plans for each season. These meals are something you could actually make. Leftovers from dinner are combined or changed into something completely different for lunch and breakfast the next day. In the sidebars of each page are directions for how to prepare the complete meal in the proper order. For example, it might say 1. Cook rice. Go on to soup. 2. Chop vegetables. Go on to tofu. 3. Marinade tofu. Go on to etc. Then the complete recipes are listed on the main part of the page. All the recipes in this book are easily adaptable to your particular tastes. The only thing I don't like about it is there are a few recipes involving fish or eggs. I am a vegan, so I don't use either of these."},{"Title":"The Book of Whole Meals","review":"With this book, I started at the first fall menu and started cooking my way through it. It's been totally doable. The recipes are so simple and laid out with directions of what to do first, second etc. that preparing entire meals with dessert gets faster with time. (She includes a healthy dessert in most of them.) I have noticed a couple mismarkings that would've affected the whole dish if I hadn't caught them, and while some of the recipes are really wonderful, others are just plain yuck! (I know it's health food but sometimes it goes too far!) As for flavor, it's definitely on the side of the old \\"healthy\\" stuff. If you're looking for the creative haute-cuisine vegetarian/vegan stuff you can find today, this is not it. However, the meals make me feel good and satisfied. They are so balanced, I find I don't crave sweets afterwards. The suggestions for what to do with the leftovers are really useful. Also, if you are nervous (as I was) about using all of these strange ingredients, the directions are simple enough that you'll become a pro in no time. One more thing - my complexion has really improved since I started using this book."},{"Title":"The Book of Whole Meals","review":"this book was not what i expected. it may be a very good book for those who cook or intend to cook 3 meals a day. But when i bought this book, i thought it was about making a full balanced meal at one time. this book is set up a bit differently. it gives instructions to prepare breakfast, lunch and dinner all at once. the breakfast needs some bit of dinner leftovers, the dinner requires some part of lunch leftovers and the lunch needs some ingredient from the breakfast. So in order to make one meal, you have to make all 3 meals. so if you just want to come home and cook a single meal of dinner, then this book is not for that."},{"Title":"The Book of Whole Meals","review":"I am not a vegetarian but I would like to become one. I bought this book because it offered balanced vegetarian breakfasts, lunches and dinners - just what I was looking for. However, the dinners are HUGE! Of course, a person does not have to cook every dish on the menu, and she does state that, but the whole reason I was drawn to this book was I wanted a book that would say, \\"Here eat this and you'll get all the nutrients you'll need as a vegetarian.\\" I did not have a problem, as one reviewer did, with the idea that I would need ingredients from dinner, for example, for breakfast the next day. In fact I liked that idea. The first fall menu is: Miso Soup, Brown Rice, Aduki Beans, Sauteed Carrols, Onions and Squash and Cabbage Salad. Doesn't that sound great? For this meal, she writes that you will need TWO 2 or 3 quart covered pots, a 4-quart pressure cooker or 3-quart covered pot, plus a skillet or saucepan. Do you have, or usually need, that many pots? I don't. The next day after cooking this dinner, you use the left-over rice for breakfast, the left-over aduki beans for a soup for lunch and the left-over sauteed carrots-onions-squash in a dish of fried rice with vegetables, also part of the lunch. I like that but I would have to make the lunch for the next dinner because I just don't have time to spend over a half hour cooking a lunch. I will screw up my courage eventually to try to see how I can use this book, perhaps even buy some more pots and whatever, but I wish someone had written a review warning me about the cooking vessels needed to do the menus as written. (Waffle iron needed for breakfast number three, by the way.)"},{"Title":"The Book of Whole Meals","review":"I have had this book since the mid-1980s, when I got it as a gift. It's kind of an oddball book in a couple of ways. Although there are separate recipes, the book is designed in a seasonal and whole-meal format. Some of the recipes are a little curious, some work OK, and others are puzzling unless you are a fan of traditional macrobiotic ingredients.However, in this somewhat hodgepodge compilation, one recipe stands out completely, and that is the one for tofu cream pie. This alone is worth the price of the book if you like a healthful dessert that's not too sweet (of course, you can adjust the sweetening, as I do, but I make it even less sweet).You have to like the taste of tofu and tahini to fully enjoy this pie. The crust is simple - although a bit tricky to put together - and goes well with the filling. I have found that this pie is really good topped with some soy or coconut ice cream. Anyway, truly the book is worth it if only for the tofu cream pie recipe, which I have never seen anywhere else and does not even seem to be on the web.Be aware: I do not know if the current version is the same as the one I have and includes this recipe."},{"Title":"The Book of Whole Meals","review":"I eat macrobiotically, and although this book is not macro specific, it does a GREAT job laying out how to plan meals to minimize time spent cooking..."},{"Title":"The Book of Whole Meals","review":"This is an exceptional book for anyone new to vegetarian cooking and concerned about getting the nutrients that are necessary.

The text is story-style and often moving (especially the description of his stroke while painting a portrait), which is not surprising as Sorolla's great granddaughter wrote it. What artists will miss is the nearly complete exclusion of Sorolla's terrific miniature (\\"apuntes\\") oil sketches (except for some tiny color reproductions in the Chronology section of the book)and virtually any technical information about the artist's methods (If these are of interest to you, I would suggest Edmund Peel's book \\"The Painter Joaquin Sorolla\\", now out of print and usually pretty expensive). It seems that the book is geared more towards the casual Sorolla enthusiast than those who are already familiar with, and passionate about, his work. Nevertheless, it is a very good Sorolla monograph and given its size, availability, generous number of reproductions and reasonable price (this is a large hardcover), I would not hesitate to recommend it.AN IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT MY ART BOOK REVIEWS: It might seem as though I rate most art books very favorably. The reason for this is that I usually visit my local library before buying a book. I'll look at all (in print and out of print) of the Rembrandt (for example) books and choose my favorite one to purchase. In the case of an artist's monograph, I try to choose one or two comprehensive books for each artist. These are generally large, well illustrated hardcovers with above average reproduction quality and informative text, often by one of the leading scholars on the artist. Thus, by the time I purchase a book, I have already found it to be among the best available on the subject.Availability update, 10/6/12: This book is now out of print and is very expensive on the second hand market."},{"Title":"Joaquin Sorolla","review":"The book includes more pictures than most older books on Sorolla. details: 280 x 240mm, 352 pages, 45 duotone, 40 mono and 183 colour illustrations.Loosely speaking, Sorolla's way of painting is similar to that of Sargent, but his colour is better designed, even for black colour, and he uses brighter and stronger colour and uses less middle tone to intensify the music effect of value/colour contrast, while his edge and stroke are often not as much modeled. However, his use of stroke is more economic and it is said that he often finished a painting in an astonish speed. I guess that his art corresponds to the greatest human art activity in future: not mechanically duplicates nature image as camera can do, but powerfully reveals and emphasizes its beauty in a way as simple as possible.I believe books about painters should have 1) least text and most pictures, and 2) large picture size (and better with 'close-ups'). In this regard, this book is above average although it is not completely satisfied. Compared to many Sargent books, this book has a higher pictures to text ratio. The quality of the print is also better.Monographs of painters with more texts and fewer pictures seem to show that the main role of the books is the author/historian, rather than the artist. You can rarely find a painting book on a deceased painter without a lot of text, while for a living artist the opposite is often true, because the artist himself often considers the text as redundant. You don't find history studies attached to the art of music when listening to a collection of music. This is perhaps because paintings, not like music, have to be hung on gallery where historians get work to do, not because the art really needs text."},{"Title":"Joaquin Sorolla","review":"The wait is over! This is it! If you are a fan of this elusive and spectacular artist, then you MUST!!!! own this book.The pictures are great and the color reproductions are great and lot more paintings than previously seen in other books, I can't stress enough, this book is a must for artists who strive to unlock the skillful vision of Sorolla, what a gift to all of us who love this Spanish Impressionst."},{"Title":"Joaquin Sorolla","review":"I've been collecting books of l9th and early 20th century painters since the late 80's and I must say that this must be the best book yet. I've been looking for a Scrolla book since '91 and haven't seen any until now. I am not dissapointed. There is a color reporducion on just about every page. This is a 327 page book. The narrative is not too extensive, but I'd say as someone who paints and loves to see \\"how they did it\\", the amount of narrative is just right, and interestingly written. Just looking at his sunlight pictures is extreemly educational for painters. He answers so many of my questions as a painter. I've never seen anybody who paints like this!I can definitely reccommend this book, no mater what period of art you may be interested in. He is a painter for all times."},{"Title":"Joaquin Sorolla","review":"Anyone interested in oil painting or any other form of painting must have this in their library, amazing, incredible, better than I could ever have imagined.........."},{"Title":"Joaquin Sorolla","review":"This is the first recent biography of this little known Spanish painter by his great granddaughter who is a leading authority on the artist. Comparisons to other artists of his time can be tricky as many of those artists are still well known today whereas Sorolla is not, save only in his native country despite the fact that he was a well known and acclaimed artist during his time. The author attempts to explain some of the reasons why this is, as well as giving the reader a moving and detailed account of her great grandfather. The book is lavishly illustrated with very nice reproductions of the artist's works. I really loved this book because I've had the good fortune of seeing one of his marvelous paintings that is in the collection of the Memorial art Gallery at the University of Rochester (NY) and have often wondered about the artist and why I've never heard of him or have seen more of his paintings. When I first saw his painting \\"Oxen on the Beach\\"(1910) it really knocked my socks off. At first I thought it may have been a John Singer Sargent painting but this particular painting was even more high keyed than Sargent's paintings and masterfully captured the dazzling light of Spain.Most of the reproductions in this book are of Sorolla's later years showing his plein-air paintings. I now want to see more of his paintings that are in other collections here in the U.S. and in Europe and cataloged in this wonderful book. I have a large collection of art books and this one is now one of my most prized books."},{"Title":"Joaquin Sorolla","review":"Beautiful book - fabulous color illustrations - I could not afford the hardback and was glad to find the soft cover book.

We were close friends until his death and the most painful thing was to have them {Brian Chase] to suggest I was suspected of their assassination.\\"Chase, after being traced by Daniel Brandt of San Antonio, confessed that he created a fake online biography of Seigenthaler in May, 2005, as a gag \\"to shock a co-worker who was familiar with the Seigenthaler family.\\" This was allowed to go global on Wikipedia. This is going on now on other web sites including these reviews, from Dallas. John Seigenthaler, father of the NBC journalist, was falsely accused of being involved in both assassinations of JFK and his brother, Robert. Character assassination is prevalent these days and must be stopped. Anybody can write anything about an unsuspecting person and put on their web page as indignities, as racial and ethnic slurs and worse.The online encyclopedia to which anyone can contribute used a false article which implicated him in the Kennedy assassination.

Typos, run-on sentences, and grammar are potholes in the road from time to time. Alot of repetition, as well.So, WHY am I giving this book 5 stars?

Hunt, Clint Murchison, Sr., David Atlee Phillips, the CIA.I have done 4 years of intensive JFK research and in a nutshell Lyndon Johnson and his Texas oil men used their CIA/military connections to murder John Kennedy for a host of reasons both personal and ideological.LBJ and his close friend J. Edgar Hoover were in charge of the cover up - and they did with a vengence! Then LBJ put CIA Allen Dulles on the Warren Commission to manipulate that farce.The book also prints part of a Hoover memo to LBJ that note that the KGB by September, 1965 had information in their hands purporting to show that Lyndon Johnson had orchestrated the JFK assassination.Based on what we know about Lyndon Johnson's fragile, mentally delusional state at that time, that could not have been a comforting thought!This book also contains a lot of depositions and information about the Dr. Charles Crenshaw lawsuit against the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA)- which he won a large cash settlement from.This book is well written; it's informative and I think it is well worth the price you will have to pay for it!"},{"Title":"The Radical Right and the Murder of John F. Kennedy: Stunning Evidence in the Assassination of the President","review":"Livingstone makes a very good case for the known fact that the assassination was a conspiracy, carried out and covered up with the assistance of the highest of government officials.However, there were aspects of this book which I found quite disconcerting. Livingstone makes some bold statements, most of which I happen to believe, but only because I've researched this subject for the last 30 years, and consider myself somewhat of an expert. But perhaps the most disconcerting element is the fact that he spelled Lyndon Baines Johnson wrong. Yes wrong, and this places into jeopardy the credibilty of his further statements. In the book, Baines, the correct spelling, was spelled Baynes.Before reading this book, I suggest, if unfamiliar with the case and its players that one read either \\"JFK The Second Plot\\" or \\"Crossfire\\" or another book on the subject. You need to be familiar with the people involved because this book will not help you to decipher who they are or their backgrounds. Further, unfortunately, Livingstone skips all over the place inserting non topical information into a chapter which is devoted to a particular topic. It is stream of conscious writing and this makes it difficult to follow unless very well versed on the case.I have read all of Livingstone's other books on this subject. He is perhaps the foremost authority, which by its very nature makes this a book worth purchasing and reading. But be ready to try following a \\"Superball\\" in a closet because it is that frustrating. If he did not have a ghost writer, he should have, and if he did they did an awful job."},{"Title":"The Radical Right and the Murder of John F. Kennedy: Stunning Evidence in the Assassination of the President","review":"As Mr. Livingstone has stated elsewhere, the entire establishment is a conspiracy. Well put!This whole JFK case has been subverted (or \\"faked\\" if you will) to cover up the involvement of those reaching into the very top of the US government.It's very important to remember nearly 50 years later that ANYTHING less would have been \\"Old News\\" by now, pronto.As Jim Garrison once said, it's not a question of whether Oswald's (US intelligence and/or military) handlers were or were not responsible for the assassination -- they WERE responsible.But you won't hear about any of this from the Executive Branch, the Congress or the Mainstream Media because this story still has the potential to undermine the whole US political system, one that serves these folks quite nicely just like it is."},{"Title":"The Radical Right and the Murder of John F. Kennedy: Stunning Evidence in the Assassination of the President","review":"This is the author's fifth or so book on the assassination? My first impression of the book is that it went from hand written notes to publishing in one step.The author spends a great deal of time trying to blame the Hunts and others of the super rich class, and by his twisted logic calling them 'The Radical Right'.The Hunts, George Soros, Bill Gates, and others of the Super Rich class don't go around calling themselves Republicans or Democrats, Conservatives or Liberals. They have no loyalty to any party or cause. They are the puppeteers.So, the title of this book implies that radical far right Republicans were responsible for the entire conspiracy. In present day language, Tea Party Conservatives.Harry should change the title to read \\"The Super Rich and the Assassination of JFK\\"."},{"Title":"The Radical Right and the Murder of John F. Kennedy: Stunning Evidence in the Assassination of the President","review":"Although I waited anxiously for this book, I must admit that as one who read Livingstone's other JFK assassination books, overall I was a bit disappointed in this production. Much of it is a rehash of his other books and borrows the new big picture framework from others, like Peter Dale Scott's Deep Politics and the Assassination of JFK. [Still, along with Michael Collins Piper's Final Judgment, is one of the best books on the JFK assassination.]On the positive side, I was pleasantly surprised and happy to see that the author finally got religion and joined the ranks of those JFK researchers who see the importance and value of focusing more on the big picture, than groveling continuously in the dirty details without ever coming up for air. In this regard, Livingstone's previous work on the medical evidence is first-rate and seeing most of it repeated here did the book no harm.Also, his investigative reporting on the pre-assassination party held at Texas oil magnate Clint Murchinson's home on the eve of the assassination is also first rate -- as was the way he connected the dots between the players in attendance there. Previously, the idea that such a party actually took place, remained in the realm of hear-say.Unfortunately for me this was the high point of the book. It was all downhill from there.The rest, including the much-touted \\"new revelations on the J.D. Tippit murder,\\" left me cold. Facts, fiction, hearsay, rumors, \\"factions\\" and \\"factoids,\\" seemed to have been all been given equal weight. The author provided no context, guidance, or analysis to wade through and out of this quagmire of \\"new information.\\" As a result, one would be insane to try to draw any conclusions based on what amounts to random facts and \\"near facts\\" tossed at the reader, with the hope that something would stick. So far, for me none has.This is especially unfortunate for a researcher of Livingstone's caliber, as now he will surely be cast down into purgatory with another run-of-the-mill researchers as just another \\"assassination conspiracy kook.\\" This is especially unfortunate for this author, since his previous work has been of such high standards and generally held in high regard.Despite this, I gave the book three stars."},{"Title":"The Radical Right and the Murder of John F. Kennedy: Stunning Evidence in the Assassination of the President","review":"While some good facts are in the book, I think it could have been better organized. The author goes on and on about wounds whose locations were changed so the \\"official version\\" of the assassination made sense to the American people. After awhile, there is too much repeating of the same thing. He covers the wounds in so many different sections, that after awhile he is really not stating anything new. Plus he throws in so many names of people at times that it is hard to figure out who is who and how they fit in. I've read better books regarding the assassination."},{"Title":"The Radical Right and the Murder of John F. Kennedy: Stunning Evidence in the Assassination of the President","review":"I dont currently have this copy but I recently read 'High Treason' and now Iam on role of doing research from the same books that the authors had from that book.They point to everyone but Oswald. CIA, FBI and various politicians all knew that this was going to happen and they all failed to notify the authorities. George Bush Sr. is reported to one of those people. He worked at the CIA at that time.1. Oswald didnt get hired at the TSBD until two weeks before the assassination. Obviously his fingerprints are going to be found somewhere. They weren't found on the gun that was considered to be the snipers rifle.2. The CIA changed the motorcade route just previous to the president arriving in Dallas.3. Jack Ruby was reported to be seen near the grassy knoll just prior to the assassination. Why would he be in that exact spot had he not known something was about happen?? Coincidence yeah its possible.4. Just after the shooting a report goes out on the radio saying that the police suspect a lone gunman. How do they know to put a report out saying this when the shooting had just barely taken place.5. Allen Dulles (CIA)was head of the Warren Commission and was going to be fired by JFK at some point. The CIA didnt like that. JFK stated he was going to 'tear up the CIA into a million pieces' and fling them into the air.6. JFK pulled out of Vietnam and the CIA didnt like that. They had recently bought Bell helicopters and if there wasn't going to be war then they wouldnt have a way to fund other secretive operations.7. In High Treason you are able to see that there clearly two shots from the front. On in the right side of the forehead and another to the throat.8. The doctors in Dallas testified in court that two shots came from the front. Once JFK got to Maryland those doctors said something entirely different from the earlier findings.9. Was Oswald involved?? Yeah I think he was but possibly as a CIA operative. Who was the 2nd Oswald we may never know. He clearly didnt act alone. He was spending way over what he was earning so clearly the funds were coming from somewhere.Read High Treason and/or watch the Zapruder film and that will change your view on this subject.Other involvments could be LBJ and or Nixon. Theres a theory out there that Watergate and Assassination of JFK are connected."},{"Title":"Dropped from the Clouds","review":"Verne has done it again! Another action packed interesting book about exploring a comet in outer space. I couldnt put it down!"},{"Title":"Tensor analysis for physicists","review":"In recent times it has become fashionable to derogate the classical tensor analysis cultivated by such pioneers as Levi-Civita, Schouten and Eisenhart. Modern critics refer to such works as a \\"sea of indices\\", the reading of which is likened to \\"chasing shadows\\". It is true that this style of tensor analysis does not uphold the standards of rigor set forth by the Bourbaki school of presentation, but, in light of the fact that the language has changed so drastically since the writing of this book, it would be fair to treat the classical theory as a separate subject, of interest in its own right.This book offers a valuable, yet not entirely self-contained, introduction to classical tensor analysis. As a beginner, I found the text to be too terse and was forced to consult other sources, such as Levi-Civita's \\"Absolute Differential Calculus\\" and Eisenhart's \\"Riemannian Geometry\\". Once I had gained some familiarity with the basic notions, Schouten's book became the preferred reference. The author develops an extremely precise notation which he calls the \\"kernel-index method\\" and systematically applies it as a problem solving tool throughout the book. Looking back, it is difficult to say how I ever got along without it.Unfortunately, the book's terseness is due in part to the fact that the first five chapters are basically abridged excerpts from the author's lengthier 1954 treatise, \\"Ricci-Calculus\\". In nearly every respect, the aforementioned title is more complete than the present book. In the interest of saving space for the physical applications in the second half of the text, the author omitted important details, such as an adequate definition of manifold and the role of the vector field which generates the infinitesimal transformations used in discussing Lie derivatives.For classical tensor analysis, Schouten's \\"Ricci-Calculus\\" (1954) and \\"Pfaff's Problem and its Generalizations\\" (1949, but still in print) are both excellent. For the modern theory, I have found Noll: Finite Dimensional Spaces; Choquet-Bruhat et al: Analysis, Manifolds and Physics, Part I and II; Spivak: A Comprehensive Introduction to Differential Geometry, Volume 1; Loomis: Advanced Calculus; and Helgason: Differential Geometry, Lie Groups and Symmetric Spaces all to be exceptionally well written."},{"Title":"Tensor analysis for physicists","review":"I would suggest this book for relativity lovers, who loves to undrestand General relativity deeply. This book is easy to learn and it takes very little time to read but the benefits are very large."},{"Title":"Cabin Fever","review":"I don't usually read contemporary romance, but a friend of mine recommended this novel. I read it and I loved it! The characters are \\"realistic\\" in my opinion. Especially Nolie, the main character. She is not your typical thin, sexy gal you often read in other books. She is overweight and plain and pretty much accepts it. One reviewer claimed that if Nolie was not happy with how she looked why couldn't she fix herself up instead of going barefoot or eating throughout the book. Nolie \\"knows\\" she is not the type that a gorgeous guy like, Chase, would be interested in. Nolie did \\"attempt\\" at going on a diet. But just couldn't do it. That in my opinion, is a reality. It isn't easy to lose weight. The reason she goes around \\"plain-looking\\" is because she believes she is no great beauty to begin with and has pretty much accepted it. It was only when she became attracted to Chase that she started feeling \\"inadequate\\". Who doesn't feel self conscious when they are attracted to someone? In today's (unfortunately sometimes shallow) society, if you're not a size 0 (or something like that) you are not generally considered \\"desirable\\" and just because some women do not wear makeup or dress fasionably doesn't mean that they don't care about their appearance either. I, myself, would rather have a man love me for who I am than what I look like. This book, Cabin Fever, proves that just because you don't look or act like a \\"supermodel\\" doesn't mean that you aren't attractive. The old saying, \\"Looks aren't everything, it's what's inside that counts\\" is very true. And that nobody's completely perfect is true as well. Chase's ex wife was thin, sexy, wore expensive clothes, but she was ugly inside. Chase found Nolie beautiful and she didn't have to put up a \\"facade\\" to win his affection. Who you are inside holds a lot more weight than what you look like on the surface. In addition, the conflict between Nolie and her in-laws and the conflict between Chase and his parents are very real, meaning it does and is happening in families. There is always some sort of solution. This is the first book I've read by Marilyn Pappano and it won't be my last. Most readers like to read books purely for the escape into fantasy, so I do not recommend this novel for escape-seeking readers. This is a very down to earth story. And yes, the overweight girl can get the gorgeous hunk! (For the record, I'm not overweight nor do I wear a size extra small either! LOL) This story is a great inspiration to all women who feel less than perfect! Just be yourself! Accept who you are! Be who you are! Men who can't accept you for who you REALLY are, are in fact, missing out! Their loss, ladies! Forget those shallow men!"},{"Title":"Cabin Fever","review":"Nolie Harper begins a new journey of self-discovery away from the small, one-horse town of Whiskey Creek, Arkansas where she grew up and where everyone knows everybody else's business. Nolie lands in Bethlehem, New York, along with her five-year-old daughter, Micahlyn. Property left to her by her great-grandfather brought her to Bethlehem, which includes a feed store he ran before his death. This is the first time Nolie has ever been on her own, living first with her parents, then with her husband, and last with her in-laws who lovingly, and overbearingly, took in Nolie and Micahlyn after their son's untimely death. The young widow is looking forward to living alone, making her own decisions, and raising her little girl as she sees fit.Chase Wilson, a loner recently released from jail for a crime he did not commit, is the tenant in one of the two cabins that Nolie inherited, an unforgettable tenant who takes her by surprise since the lease was signed by a woman. But this distant, surly hunk who makes her hormones hum is certainly no woman. Nolie's interest is peaked by Chase's stony demeanor, reclusive ways, and gorgeous good looks. However, she also has to deal with her daughter's dislike and fear of their new neighbor, aptly called \\"the bogeyman\\" by Micahlyn.And then there's Gloria and Sophy, two wonderful women who just show up from time to time in Nolie's life to help out a little bit; two women who no one else in town seems to know anything about. And there is that banner saying \\"REOPENING SOON\\" that mysteriously appears in front of the feed store that Nolie is working so hard to get going again. Are Gloria and Sophy just figments of Nolie's imagination or could there be angels in the town of Bethlehem?Sparks soon fly between Nolie and Chase. While Nolie frets that Chase could never be attracted to someone with extra lush curves such as herself, Chase can't get the image of the tall, red-haired, womanly Nolie out of his mind - or his heart. Nolie's neighborly ways and gentle manner are getting to the brooding ex-attorney more than he ever expects or wants.CABIN FEVER literally throbs with heat, not only from the summertime temps, but also from the warmth of a relationship that simmers with caring, understanding, acceptance, desire, and ultimately, love. Bethlehem is a town many of us would like to call home, with trusting neighbors and a sense of community. And most of us wouldn't mind a visit from Gloria and Sophy either. Marilyn Pappano skillfully creates characters that make you want to know them and become a part of their life. And actually you can, in her next novel, SMALL WONDERS, coming in September 2003, the ninth book of the Bethlehem series.Vivian Outen"},{"Title":"Cabin Fever","review":"Three years ago her beloved spouse Jeff died. Her in-laws were great taking their son's widow and child into their home, but now Nolie Harper needs to regain her freedom. When she inherits two cabins in Bethlehem, New York, Nolie accompanied by her reluctant five-year-old daughter Micahlyn leaves Whiskey Creek, Arkansas for her new home.She is surprised to find the other cabin occupied as it has been rented for a year by former Boston lawyer Chase Wilson. Having served jail time over much of the last two plus years, Chase lives the life of a hermit just outside his birth town. He pities himself for having lost his practice, his house, and his wife to his former partner. However, though she is overweight, he finds Nolie quite attractive even if her daughter thinks he is the bogeyman. As the two adults fall in love, ghosts from their respective past and a lonely child threaten anything permanent. On the other hand, there is a more powerful force at work nudging the loving duo to come together.Though the weight of woes would break through a reinforced ceiling, fans of relationship dramas will appreciate the latest Bethlehem tale. The story line stars two individuals needing fresh starts so that a joint venture seems out of the question. However, with some heavenly interference, this couple has a chance to redeem him and find new hope and happiness for her. Marilyn Pappano provides an uplifting contemporary.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Cabin Fever","review":"I find all of Marilyn Pappano's book to be heartwarming, but CABIN FEVER is my favorite. I've read it a number of times and enjoy it greatly each time. The characters are people with wounds and flaws who learn to trust and love again. This book is part of Pappano's wonderful series on the lives and loves of the people of Bethlehem, New York, but it stands on its own very well. When I need to read a book that is uplifting and encouraging, and funny and romantic too, this is the one I'll turn to. I'll read it again and again and again."},{"Title":"Cabin Fever","review":"This was my first Marilyn Pappano book and it definitely won't be my last. I loved the characters in this book especially Nolie and Chase.Nolie's lost her wonderful and caring husband who dies in a farm accident. After three years she is ready to move on with her life. This means uprooting her five year old daughter Micahlyn, who has been brainwashed by her husbands parents into thinking she should stay with them, to Bethlehem. Nolie is a plus size woman and she feels less than able to attact a handsome man. But it is what is inside Nolie that makes Chase want to know her better--he sees something totally different than Nolie sees.Chase Wilson worked hard to make something out of himself only to have everything taken away. He lost his job, his wife, his money, etc. He is down on his luck in a bad way. At first sight Michalyn thinks he's the boogyman and Nolie thinks he is a street person--he in much need of a bath and shave. Gradually Nolie and Chase become friends and lovers. Nolie is different from any woman Chase has known. His wife was superficial and he is looking for a genuine person and Nolie more than fits the bill. He just has to convince her that he is truly intersted.The story involves many secondary characters who liven up the story. I loved Micahlyn--she was such an honest and open child who eventually fell for Chase too. It's a heartwarming story about how two people can heal from their hurts and find a truly wonderful love the second time around.I am looking forward to Leanne and Cole's story \\"Small Wonders.\\""},{"Title":"Cabin Fever","review":"This was my first book by Marilyn Pappano. Overall I'm happy I read it because I have been in a romance novel funk for a long time and the story kept my attention. Cabin Fever had the potential to be a disaster of a story but the author is obviously very gifted and told the story in a way that satisfied me. I did have some negative issues with the book. For example, Nolie kept getting on my nerves with her \\"fatness\\". I just wanted to tell her to shut up and step away from the donut box. And god, did she have to eat in half the book? That's real sexy. Couldn't she just TRY to make her self more appealing instead of walking around barefoot! She could have gotten hookworm or some crap out in the forrest. The horror! Of course she had image issues, she made herself out to be this plain jane when she could have made an attempt to beautify herself.The other b.s. aspect of the story was how the grandparents drove up (flew up?) in like 24 hours (!) to the backwoods of Bethlehem. I think it took Nolie 3 days to get there from Whisper Creek but it took the feeble old grandparents 2 seconds to confront Nolie in person. Hogwash! I hate it when authors pull a fast one on the reader. That really annoyed me.But overall, the story was charming and I am looking forward to reading more of Ms. Pappano's books."},{"Title":"Cabin Fever","review":"This was my first book by Marilyn Pappano, I was disappointed, when I first got this I could not wait to read it, this book did not do it for me, Some parts of the book I did enjoy and some parts went down hill for me .Happy Reading Lisa"},{"Title":"The parasites","review":"I have to agree with the other reviewer that this book lacked suspense and dark mystery that I found in some of du Maurier's other books. But, I found myself completely involved and interested in the lives of the three siblings. If you enjoy reading period pieces(this one ranging from the 1920's until the late 40's)and reading indepth portrayals of individuals, you will like this book."},{"Title":"The parasites","review":"What I find most surprising is all the dissapointment from the readers here on this work. This was one of the very first reads by Ms. DuMaurier that I read and I must say I found it immesnly worth while. I know quite a bit about her and I can tell that this was a personal work and yet, I can also say that her characterzation is flawless. I have never read a book where I did not like all of the main characters, and yet did at the same time. They are annoying and selfish and yet relateable. The story set up is odd, but I liked it. I found the ending most powerful and once again DuMaurier is skilled at an intricate frame of complex relationships. Well done. If you are a first time DuMaurier reader, wait though, get used to her for a while."},{"Title":"The parasites","review":"Parasite: an invertebrate animal preying upon the body of another animal.And that is what Charles thinks of the Delaneys. They have inherited their parents' talents and have done nothing else with their lives. But Charles wasn't specific. Who among the three Delaney children is the parasite? Is it his wife Maria? After all, he knows her better than the rest. And he knows that she is a great actress, so great that she can develop a new personality on cue. And that is precisely her problem. Who is the real Maria? Or is he referring to Niall? Niall is a natural-born talent, a great musician. But his unresolved issues with his mother and his own brooding feelings for his stepsister has stopped him from living his own life. Then there's Celia. Sweet, spinsterish Celia, the only daughter of both Mama and Pappy Delaney (Maria is Pappy's daughter, Neill is Mama's, children borne from a previous relationship). She's the least talented one, not as pretty, and always the mediator. She's also given up on having a husband and children of her own to look after Maria and Charles's kids. She had also looked after her father after her mother died. After Charles's verbal assault, all three of them ponder his meaning, going back to the events that have brought them to where they are today. Are they happy? Could they be anything more than just the Delaneys? Is there a life beyond the entertainment world?Daphne du Maurier dedicates this novel to \\"Whom the Caps fit.\\" You soon realize that this story is very personal. Du Maurier's parents were both entertainers, and perhaps that part of her life had left some feelings that ran deep for her. She wrote various memoirs and short stories with this same theme. The Parasites, while not the author's best work, is an entertaining and poignant tale of love and loss. I like the way the author uses a rather interesting second-person narrative. All the reader knows is that one of the three Delaney children is the narrator, but which one? And do we get to find out whom it is? That is all I will reveal on the matter. Suffice it to say that the unique narrative style draws you in from the beginning. Another interesting thing is the relationship between Maria, Neill and Celia -- especially the first two. There is a Cathy and Heathcliff feel to them that is quite noticeable from the start. This is especially clear in Maria's selfishness, their unnatural clinginess toward each other since childhood (Maria used to pick on Neill when they were kids) and Neill's jealousy when Maria meets Charles. Their relationship is not as dark or as morbid as Emily Bronte's couple, but the similarities are there. And that is all the information I will supply. Don't want to go all book club discussion-type on you. You will have to read this magnificent book to know the rest. First published in 1949, The Parasites is a nice, quick read from Du Maurier, falling into a lighter cateogory, somewhere between Frenchman's Creek and The King's General, only that it's contemporary and more poignant. I recommend it."},{"Title":"The parasites","review":"I read Rebecca and adored it - the subtle darkness and drama, the nuances that one only picked up on the second and third readings, the intense yet always likeable characters, the delectable prose...I hardly even glanced at &quot;Parasites&quot; when I bought it (thankfully, I only spent a dollar at a used bookstore) and eagerly sat down to read it. Two hours later I tossed down the book, feeling depressed and cynical about humanity in general.This books follows the lives of three siblings, the children of equally self-absorbed actors, who are &quot;parasites.&quot; Each one has the capacity for greatness, given their respective talents, but each wastes them on cheap, unnoticeable books, music, and stage plays.If you're a fan of flashbacks you might like this - their lives in the 20s to 40s are covered over a massive number of pages, after a look at them in the &quot;present&quot; day. But this book hadn't DuMaurier's other books' sparkling prose and intense dialogue, or any of the spinetingling atmosphere that sucks you in.It also wasn't helped by the fact that the main characters ARE parasites, living off whoever they are nearby. Their whininess and complaints augmented their selfish personas. I spent much of the book wanting to slap them. There don't really seem to be ANY likeable characters, and while I didn't expect the ending, I felt even more depressed when I read what one of the characters did.I advise you to read &quot;Rebecca&quot; or &quot;Jamaica Inn&quot; for a first book.

It says more about me than about Du Maurier that my favorites among her books are two that are not well regarded by her larger public.You have to be familiar with the overall British milieu of the time, and a passing familiarity (even second hand) with the British music hall system to fully comprehend the atmosphere created by the author. Still, even without, the book is a case study of how genius and selfishness are intertwined. In particular, it brings out how genius demands sacrifice, not just from the artist but from those that love him/her.Be warned: the book is not exactly a \`feel-good' affair, I find myself depressed for days after each re-read."},{"Title":"The parasites","review":"...is how Du Maurier dedicated this novel and one has to wonder how personal this story is for her, she herself being a child of famous entertainers. I understand her relationship with her father was a bit unusual to say the least.\\"Parasites affect their hosts by feeding upon their living tissues or cells, and the intensity of the effect upon the hosts ranges from the slightest local injury to complete destruction.\\" The Encyclopedia Britannica (quoted from the book).My, my, another highly ambiguous ending from Dame Du Maurier and I'm still scratching my head wondering what to make of it. The three Delaney siblings are Maria the actress, Niall the song-writer and Celia the only child parented by Maria's father and Niall's mother (Niall and Maria thus being step-siblings). One day Maria's husband accuses the three of being parasites who have spent their lives feeding off of others and thus begins a series of flashback on the lives of the children and their famous parents as they try to ascertain which one of them is the parasite Charles refers to - or is it all of them?Maria can be anyone she wants to be and is she truly the woman her husband thought he married? Niall loves to make up popular tunes in his head, but he relies (uses) others around him to put pen to ink. Niall adores Maria but at the same time he has what might have more than *brotherly* feelings for her. And Celia, she is dedicated to protecting and caring for her \\"pappy\\" who is IMHO the worst parasite of the lot of them. Oh that family visit to the country estate of Charles' parents - truly guests from Hell.The flashbacks were a tad confusing, and you never do know who is actually narrating the story (is there just one narrator or different ones?), and I really didn't get *into the groove* until the last 100 pages or so. And that ending - she sure can leave you hanging in ambiguity wondering what really happened. While Du Maurier's writing is top notch as always, this was a very different novel with very unlikable characters and might be best for die-hard Du Maurier fans only. Four stars, but if it had been written by anyone else it would've only got three."},{"Title":"The parasites","review":"I've read most all of Daphne DuMaurier's books and loved them. This one had an interesting title and I picked it up expecting a good read or at least some redeeming quality to the book. Instead, it turned out to be a most depressing book about shallow, inconsequential, trivial people. The only one who makes any personal change at all is Niall. This is a book about wasted lives and was a waste of that portion of my life that I spent reading it. Even her writing did not seem to be up to its usual quality. Personal recommendation? Don't waste your time!"},{"Title":"The parasites","review":"It is an interesting story that follows the lives of three siblings. I was constantly hoping for something exciting or suspenseful to happen (like most of Daphne's books), but nothing really did. It had a somewhat surprising ending, but by then I didn't care anymore."},{"Title":"John Peel","review":"I read this book on the beach in little more than a day, and felt afterwards I knew very little more about the man. This book's bulk is made up by lists and direct quotes from the valedictories of other writers, rock musicians and BBC people -- as much as is legally possible without having to get permission from their publishers.As other reviewers have written, this is a pretty shabby book, exploiting the fact that Peel had apparently written little of his own autobiography before he died. There are many clues to the speed with which this book was rushed out. For example, on one page Wall says that T Rex's 'Ride a White Swan' went to number one. Just a few pages later, Wall admits that it only went to number two. One sentence contains both 'success' and 'successful' just a few words apart.Throughout the book, Wall cannot make up his mind whether Peel survived for so long because he was his own man, or whether Peel, like Madonna, repeatedly reinvented himself to find a new audience. Only I'm not sure Wall realises there is any inconsistency in this.I liked Peel a lot, and can remember listening to him under the dormitory sheets in the 1970s, praising Stevie Wonder's 'Songs in the Key of Life' to the hilt. The presence of Led Zeppelin's Stairway to Heaven in many of Peel's early festive lists also hints at the extent to which his tastes changed.Personally, I feel that once Peel decided to embrace punk in 1976, he had a pernicious influence over many other BBC deejays. Several deejays such as Andy Kershaw just got too close, and found it hard to want to appreciate any music that Peel had already condemned. And the trouble is that Peel often condemned bands, not because there was anything wrong with their music, but simply because the band had become too successful.So Peel comes across as the consistent champion of the underdog. I wouldn't go so far as classifying him as an underachiever himself, because no-one in authority ever seemed to think he had much potential. But this book gave me the impression that he could have achieved rather more if he had embraced TV more readily and he hadn't been so timid about flying."},{"Title":"This Is Our Faith: A Catholic Catechism for Adults","review":"We have been using Fr. Pennock's book as the basis of our Adult Faith Formation/RCIA for a number of years. It provides excellent stories that capture the essence of each chapter and plain English, making it easy for non-Catholics to understand.The questions at the end of each chapter help to focus discussions that deepen awareness and develop the faith perspective of all who use it.Even as a textbook for individuals, this excellent book nurtures those who use it in the faith of the Catholic Church.I recommend it highly"},{"Title":"This Is Our Faith: A Catholic Catechism for Adults","review":"I am taking a class from Dayton University and this is the text book for my first class. Almost read the entire book."},{"Title":"This Is Our Faith: A Catholic Catechism for Adults","review":"While not the most original work in the field of Dogmatics and Catechetical work, this is a concise and approachable book that would serve nicely as a reference guide for those who find the official Catechism too dry or difficult to read. What is nice about this volume is that there is Catechism reference numbers that correspond to the subjects Pennock addresses at a given point in the book for those who wish to research further.Having looked at many \\"Introductions to Catholicism\\" in order to better recommend books to those inquiring about a simple reference book to better understand their faith, I have found that this works well as both an introduction to Catholic faith and as an introduction to the Catechism of the Catholic Church.The simple Question and Answer format allows for this book to be \\"taken it at your own pace\\"."},{"Title":"This Is Our Faith: A Catholic Catechism for Adults","review":"Michael Pennock, in this revised edition, takes the numbered articles of the Catholic Catechism and explains each point in a clear, succinct manner,using language that is understood by ordinary Catholics. Those who have had little opportunity to study theology can make sense of the doctrines and traditions of the Church and raise pertinent questions for clarification. I find it an invaluable teaching resource for adult Catholics from all walks of life, especially teachers, pastoral assistants and catechists."},{"Title":"This Is Our Faith: A Catholic Catechism for Adults","review":"For several years I have been using this book to supplement and reinforce the lessons in the RCIA (Rite of Christian Initiation for Adults) program. My students have found it very helpful. I think it does a wonderful job of providing the basic knowledge that every Catholic should know about their faith. While it is based on the much larger, more in depth and scholarly Catechism of the Catholic Church, this book makes the basic tenants of the faith understandable. Also included in the book is a good glossary of terms and several of the basic prayers most Catholics learn by heart. If you are interested in learning more about the faith regardless if you are a cradle Catholic, and want a better understanding, or are about to marry a Catholic and want to learn about your spouses faith, or are following the inner yearnings of the Spirit inside you, this book should prove to be a enlightening resource."},{"Title":"This Is Our Faith: A Catholic Catechism for Adults","review":"This is a wonderful book that was received in excellent condition.

Thank you."},{"Title":"This Is Our Faith: A Catholic Catechism for Adults","review":"We have been using &quot;This is our Faith&quot; by Michael Francis Pennock in our RCIA class. Written in a simple and direct style, &quot;This is our Faith&quot; is an eminently readable and highly accessible introduction to Catholic teaching and theology. Pennock divided the text into four sections that parallel those of the Catechism: The Profession of Faith, focusing on the creeds; The Celebration of the Christian Mystery, which focuses on liturgy and the sacraments; Life in Christ, which emphasizes Christian morals; and Christian Prayer. Individual chapters consist mostly of Questions and answers--making &quot;This is our Faith&quot; sort of a FAQ for Catholics. Each question is cross-referenced to the Catechism. Curiously, the teachers of my RCIA class sort of discourage us from reading the Catechism. (Is that typical?) But I like having the cross-references so that I can follow up where the text doesn't provide enough detail. Pennock's theology seems sound and conventional, yet he reflects both traditional church teaching and current thinking. Anyone in RCIA ought to pick up &quot;This is our Faith.&quot;"},{"Title":"This Is Our Faith: A Catholic Catechism for Adults","review":"I thought this book did a wonderful job of explaining Catholic beliefs in a straightfoward manner. It touches on pretty much every topic that you could be interested in, and I especially like its question-and-answer format. I believe that one of the best aspects of this book is that, for the most part, you can skip around. If you just have questions about the sacrament of marriage for instance, you can just read that chapter to get your information; it doesn't depend too heavily on all the chapters before it (although everything leading up to it is certainly important also, specifically things like the basis of the Catholic faith)What I don't feel is covered as well is the reasoning behind the beliefs. In many sections of the book, references are made to the bible as well as various papers the Vatican has composed. However, I feel that many of the topics warrant much more information about the history behind them, how certain decisions were made, etc. After thinking about it though, I think perhaps that is outside the author's intention for this book; I'm sure someone could write a book on the history of each topic alone.Ultimately, this is a great no-nonsense book about the beliefs and teachings of the Catholic church. You'll have to look elsewhere to find out WHY they believe and teach it, though."},{"Title":"This Is Our Faith: A Catholic Catechism for Adults","review":"While the book is fairly accurate in the author's assessments, there are statements that are erroneous. For example, the author implies that anybody and everybody are members of the Kingdom of God.

I would not recommend it to anyone serious about the Catholic faith. It is a very poor text, in many ways. They correlation between it and the CCC is very awkward at times, or other times, they just plain conflict. For example, the CCC states that the goal/objective of ecumenism is the reconciliation of all Christians to the Catholic Church. You will not find this anywhere in Pennock's book. In fact, Pennock, in contradiction to the CCC, states that the goal of ecumenism is: a common commitment among Christians to live out the gospel and to be open to the unifying action of the Holy Spirit.\\" Or, in violation of USCCB instruction regarding catechetical instruction, Pennock caveats nearly every statment of faith with: \\"the Catholic church teaches\\"... or \\"Catholics believe..\\" lending the impression to the reader that there are other acceptable teachings that are just as valid as what \\"the Catholic church teaches.\\" Most alarming, though, is his depiction of Christ. In the chapter \\"Jesus: Lord and Messiah\\", we are first told that Christ is compassionate, self-giving and humble, but Pennock doesn't get around to addressing his divinity until the last page and then only places it in a list of dogmas.Similarly, when answering the question \\"What is meant by the 'real presence'?\\", Pennock states that Jesus is present in the \\"assembly\\", the priest, and \\"the word\\", but he lists Christ's presence in the Eucharist - what the Catechism of the Catholic Church calls the \\"source and summit of the Christian faith\\" - last. Pennock, has such a lack of zeal for the Catholic faith, that by reading his \\"catechism\\" he nearly sucked out all the zeal I had inside of me. This primary texts gets two big thumbs down. How did this book ever get a imprimatur???"},{"Title":"This Is Our Faith: A Catholic Catechism for Adults","review":"There are moments in this book that are thoughtful and considered. And there are other moments that range from the sweepingly general to the bluntly propagandistic. I am reading this book as a part of an RCIA program offered through my church. In this regard, the book does give a good general overview of the Catholic Churches stance on any number of spiritual & secular issues. But it's value begins and ends there. I would not buy this book. I prefer writing that is more intellectual and critical in it's approach.

There are many more good books available today than in years past, and McNally's book is a case in point.&quot;The Complete Book of Flyfishing&quot; does many things well. It gives the first time, fledgling flyfisher a basic overview of the equipment, tactics, and methods by which they can become proficient in the sport. There is also a depth and breadth of information in McNally's book that explains well many of flyfishing's harder techniques and methods. All in an easy to read format that leaves the reader wanting more.Some instructional books effectively transfer information without adequately explaining the reasons why traditions and methods have evolved and are recommended. McNally gives more than just a &quot;how to&quot; treatise. He explains the rationale behind his choice of material, technique and equipment choices.If a friend asked the best method to learn the basics of flyfishing I'd have no hesitation in recommending &quot;The Complete Book of Flyfishing&quot; by McNally as an outstanding guide.Intermediate flyfishers will also find many interesting items in the book. McNally's section on knots is a prime example. Many have fished for years without a good working knowledge of the knots needed to fish properly. McNally provides first class illustrations for all the basic and tertiary knots. Sections on leader design and composition are also outstanding.

It took me so long to read, that I was out of time to return it. I sincerely believe the &quot;meat&quot; of this book could have been communicated in less than 200 pages, and probably less than 100 if color photos(other than the 10 pages in the center of the book that were of no benefit) were used. Actually, few photos of the &quot;how to&quot; were shown,the sketches carried most of the weight. Most of the black-and-white photos were of an already caught fish that bolstered the authors standing with his audience. L.L.Beans books are done and offer more info. Let's cut to the chase so that we can get back on the water. I would not recommend to beginner of advanced fishermen.

I mean if people fish to relax I can totally understand that, but for sport? I never understood why it was so competitive and special for many people. My family likes to compete in special tournaments where the winner of the biggest fish receives an award but... I've never been inspired enough to want to fish THAT hard. NONE of this should stop you from picking up this book however, because whether you're someone who just has crappy luck fishing or someone who only fishes out of feeling like you HAVE to in order to impress friends, this book is for you.

However, as many of these clergy do not have an understanding, nor do they teach, the doctrines that our pious fathers in the Presbyterian Church once taught from the same pulpit, this book also is very weak as a tool for the Christian who aspires to become an elder or other church officer.The author has a weak understanding of reformed theology. What he feels to be the essential tenets of the reformed faith are ten tenets listed in the Book of Order (not the Book of Confessions) which he belives summarize the reformed faith. A much better understanding is required of church officers. Church officers must be sound in the faith, and this book lacks the guidance to help church officers. It does not properly give an understanding of reformed faith, and it does not serve as an effective tool to understanding reformed faith and doctrine.The whole argument of essential tenets has been especially fierce in the last 100 years (more so in the early 1900's). The author of this book comes down on one side of the essential tenet argument. He is biased, and he is biased against subscription. He does not say that he is biased, and therefore will not explain or defend his position. Indeed, the whole issue of subscription is avoided. Thus, an accurate history on the subject of subscription to the Confession is not offered in this book. Presbyterian ministers and elders historically subscribed to the Confession of Faith as their own confession - to be what they believe scripture teaches. This they continued until the 1900's. Also, the use of the word &quot;tenets&quot; is a rather new invention. Our Presbyterian fathers used the word &quot;articles&quot;, as the Confession was made up of articles (Each chapter of the confession consists of several articles). The word &quot;tenets&quot;, which is now used, does not refer to the articles, but to a set of beliefs. So we now have the &quot;essential tenets&quot; of the reformed faith and confessions. This was not the talk of Presbyterians before.The author of this book quotes a part of a sentence from the Adopting Act of 1729. He subverts the meaning of the Adopting Act by drawing a wrong conclusion about it based on this one part of a sentence from it. His conclusion is what he wants you to accept without going into an analysis of the Act itself or explaining that there are those that disagree with him. For if it is explained that there is disagreement, then an explanation would be required to establish why he believes as he does. This however takes time and work. So it is avoided. Many clergy in the PCUSA take his side on this point. But you are not getting the whole story from this book. You need more knowledge to understand the issue. Thus the meaning of the ministers that wrote the Adopting Act is not explained, and you will not understand it unless you exert yourself to learn more. This book will not help you. And thus, the whole argument of what is required of those who aspire to be church officers is misreprented by many, including this author. This issue of essential articles was actually decided by the 1729 Synod. And of course, they did not use the word - &quot;tenets&quot;.The author of this book gives his biased argument for his position. However, he does not present the other position. He doesn't even acknowledge that there are those that disagree with him. There are whole denominations that disagree with him on these points, including the Orthodox Presbyterian Church and the Presbyterian Church in America. Seminaries disagree with him, including Reformed Theological Seminary and Reformed Presbyterian Theological Seminary (viz. disagreement about the issue of subscribing to the confessions and what is essential in reformed faith). There are resources available that present the arguments that are lacking in this book. These other resources can give you a better understanding of Presbyterianism and help you to understand the reformed faith and therefore understand more about our faith in God and what it means to be Christ's disciple.Again, this book is useful as tool to understand the author's side on the issues he presents. He does not work to establish his position as he does not acknowledge any other position. This book helps you to know how many of the clergy look at the confessions of the church and how arrogant they are about telling you how you should believe."},{"Title":"Presbyterian creeds: A guide to the Book of confessions : supplement on A brief statement of faith, Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)","review":"I first read this book because I was told that Jack Rogers was an inspiring writer who broke from his conservative background to forward progressive causes for alternative communities.

Shelley continues to clean up the mess the boy makes.\\"Moira's Birthday\\" - It is Moira's birthday and she wants to invite grades one through six and kindergarten. Her mother and father both say, \\"NO,\\" She can only invite six kids. All of Moira's friends beg to be invited, so Moira ends up inviting 200 kids, but Moira doesn't tell her parents. When the kids all show up, her parents don't know how they will feed everyone so Moira orders 200 pizzas and birthday cakes. When only 10 pizzas and cakes are delivered the kids all go home and come back with food. Moira tells everyone if they help clean up, they can take home a present. After everyone goes home 190 pizzas and cakes are delivered so Moira has another party the next day!\\"From Far Away\\" - Saoussan is writing to her reader buddy about what her life use to be. Saoussan is now 7 years old and in second grade. She use to live in another country but a war caused her and her family to leave. They moved to Canada and Saoussan started to school in kindergarten. She didn't know any English so she couldn't understand her teacher or the children. For Halloween a skeleton was placed in the washroom, this scared Saoussan and she thought the war would come to Canada. Her teacher tried to explain but she still didn't understand English. When her father picked her up at school he explained Halloween to her.

She has no friends. When Millicent makes friends with the wind she has someone to play with. One day Millicent and her mother make the 3 day trip down the mountain to the far valley. The wind can't find Millicent because she is deep in the forest. The children in the town aren't nice to Millicent when they find out she is friends with the wind. One boy who is in his disbelief is picked up by the wind and tumbled, so the children run away. After Millicent and her mother return to the mountain, Millicent wishes she had someone other than the wind to play with. So Millicent asks the wind to find her a friend. The wind comes back with a boy for Millicent to play with and they do!"},{"Title":"Munschworks 4: The Fourth Munsch Treasury","review":"I bought this after reading Munsch's early stories like \\"Paperbag Princess\\" and \\"David's Father\\". They were charming light hearted stories that the kids loved to listen to. But the stories in this collection are bizarre and creepy. \\"Millicent and the Wind\\" is about a little girl who lives out in the wilderness with her family and her only friend is the wind. In the end she asks the wind to kidnap another child to her house so she has somebody to play with. \\"The Boy In The Drawer\\" is beyond strange. A little girl finds a tiny boy (leprechaun?) in her room who does crazy things like grow tomato plants in her bed. When she tells her parents the only thing they tell her is to clean it up. What's the point? The only story that is cute and appropriate for a young reader is \\"Moira's Birthday\\". Otherwise I would recommend you skip this volume and look up Munsch's first collection of stories."},{"Title":"Munschworks 4: The Fourth Munsch Treasury","review":"This is one of the best and most entertaining children's book ever! Love it! I really recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Munschworks 4: The Fourth Munsch Treasury","review":"After 3 previous collections, compiling 15 different Munsch children's books, the 4th collection would not have been faulted if the quality or consistency lacked. The three previous collections are all must haves, and surprisingly- or if you are a Munsch fan, not surprisingly, volume 4 delivers the good and may be the most diverse yet.Three of the books are what I would call standard Munsch fare- stories involving children in normal situations in which a bizarre turn of events occurs. \\"50 Below Zero\\" tells the story of a sleepwalking father who ends up curling up in a strange place every night, including against a tree in the middle of a field on a night when the temperature is fifty below zero. Yikes, as his concerned son would say. \\"Moira's Birthday\\" is one of the more lighthearted Munsch stories, in which a birthday party gets overrun by first, second, third, fourth, and fifth graders, along with the worst of them all- kindergarteners! \\"The Boy in the Drawer\\" is a typical \\"creepy\\" Munsch tale, in which a young girl keeps encountering a tiny boy in the strangest of places, a boy who grows bigger when insulted. Each of these is fun, sophisticated, and incredibly well illustrated as all Munsch books are.The two stories that make this collection stand out are \\"Far and Away\\" and \\"Millicent and the Wind\\". The first is a series tale about a life affected by war, as seen through the eyes of a school aged girl. This unusually serious but somehow Munschian piece shows a different side to the author and his abilities. The latter story is a fairy tale of sorts, about a lonely girl befriended by the wind. Not only do these stories step outside the parameters of the typical Munsch story, they also are illustrated in styles unlike his other work.There is not much else to say other than \\"This book will not disappoint!\\""},{"Title":"Munschworks 4: The Fourth Munsch Treasury","review":"I love any book that Robert Munsch writes. I think I have just about every book that he has written. I am retired from the school system and always had storytime with the kids. They always love the Munschworks books best. My grandson and the students I tutor always reached for the Robert Munsch books first."},{"Title":"From Weird and Distant Shores","review":"Caitlin R. Kiernan, From Weird and Distant Shores (Subterranean Press, 2002)I can't really say anything about Cait Kiernan's delicious storytelling that I haven't already said before. If you haven't yet discovered the gothically beautiful, barren world that is the mind of Caitlin R. Kiernan, all I can do is wish that, soon, you will. Kiernan's short stories are the literary equivalent of Edward Gorey's drawings; witty, somewhat Victorian in their scope, but with an ineffable sadness behind them that changes from piece to piece, beckoning the reader ever farther down the road to perdition.That said, I ended up not rating From Weird and Distant Shores as high as Candles for Elizabeth. This is (for the most part) a collection of \\"shared-world\\" stories Kiernan wrote during her fledgling years for various anthologies. And while everything she says in the introduction about the attraction of writing shared-world stories is true, all the pitfalls of doing so loom before even the finest writers. Investing your breath of life into someone else's creation doesn't always work; it ends up either being their creation looking right, but moving with an odd, amateur-puppeteer-style jerkiness, or looking like your creation and making the original author say \\"what the hell is THIS?\\" Which obviously happened to Kiernan more than once, judging by the acid words she has for certain copyeditors in the afterwords of some of these tales. (Needless to say, of the shared-world stories here, those, presented in their original drafts in this collection, are usually the best.)There are exceptions, of course. There are three very early tales from an abandoned short-story cycle towards the end of the book, and while science fiction is not nearly as much my bag as is dark fantasy, what was in them begs for more fleshing out. Hopefully, more readers of the book than I will be thinking very hard at Kiernan \\"when do we get more of \`Between the Flatirons and the Deep Green Sea'?\\" Also, some of the shared-world collections were far less restrictive than others, and the book's most haunting tale (\\"Two Worlds, and In Between\\"-a much better title than the original, because it gives nothing away) comes from one of them.Highly recommended, especially if you can't find the now-out-of-print Candles for Elizabeth. ****"},{"Title":"The Grace Exchange: God's Offer of Freedom from a Life of Works","review":"Larry has a great way of taking a Christian concept and stripping away all the religion of today and showing how Christ wants to live through us.

As I read \\"The Grace Exchange,\\" I found myself desiring the spiritual growth that can only be found as I allow Christ to live THROUGH me. Larry does a great job of explaining key Bible passages (Romans 7, etc.), the slippery slopes of both immorality and religiosity, the supreme importance of a loving relationship with God and those around us, and more, in a fresh insightful way. I especially liked his explanation of the hold sin exerts on our mortal bodies, that we will be completely free of when we receive our immortal bodies--and what an incredible joy that will be. When we find ourselves sinning or contemplating sin, it should not be reason for doubting our right-standing with God, but evidence of the hold sin is trying to exert our flesh. I hope I explained this right. Anyways, Larry does a much better job and made many things I have heard taught on before more clear to me. I found this to be inspiring reading."},{"Title":"Semiparametric Regression for the Applied Econometrician (Themes in Modern Econometrics)","review":"Semipaerametric, like nonparametric and other parametric theories, are fasicinating.

It is not a compilation of factual accounts. It is a testimonial to how one person of the current age views what dealing with Jesus could have been like.

A paranoid collegue warns him about the mysterious deaths of the other witnesses and it isn't long before the Parralax Corparation become involved.Then the story gets weird. The hero is first involved in the murder of a low level employee of the company before he and his collegue are pitted against each other. Unlike the film, the main character does meet the head of the company who reveals the aim of the company to be a social engineering group designed to control democracy. Also, he has an affair with the widow of the man he killed and later saves her sons life.The book's main assasination is modelled on the JFK killing while the film was on RFK. There are major differences in plot and structure and I would estimate that probably over 80% percent of the book was thrown out by the screenwriters.Singer has written is a earnest and entertaining thriller that has none of the cyncial downbeat edge of the film. I should not really compare the two but as the book has been out of print for so long, I thought readers would like to know as much as possible about the original source."},{"Title":"The parallax view","review":"I read a LOT. Probably 4-6 books a month. I really enjoy reading a source novel from a motion picture, and I've read enough that I don't expect the novel to follow the movie exactly, or in some cases even closely.This was one of the most convoluted, poorly written books I have ever read.

They might Italian, but they don't have to be. In fact, the soundtrack that came to my head while reading &quot;RoseStreet&quot; was the song &quot;Tradition,&quot; from &quot;Fiddler On The Roof.&quot; How can the story of an Italian immigrant couple and their American-born children have anything to do with Jewish shtetl life?Read the book.Ever look in the mirror and just examine your own eyes.

For those simple reasons I sort of enjoyed the reading, though it's not especially well written. It struck me as the sort of family history one might cobble together for the grandchildren. I had hoped for much more reference to foods and traditions; a focus on the immigrant experience in a more universal way. Rather, it is more a simple litany of who lived where, who married whom, who bore which children out of the family multitude. There is not much in the way of character development beyond the husband and wife who managed to keep everybody fed--even that without much compelling detail.I'd originally thought to send the book on to my best friend whose Italian family settled the same area of Youngstown, thinking it would be a treat for her at her Wisconsin home. Now that I've read the book, however, I don't plan to. It is so entirely specific to one family that I don't expect she would find it any more interesting than I did.I commend the author for his effort, and for the pride in his bloodline."},{"Title":"Rose Street: A Family Story 2nd Ed.","review":"Carmen Leone works magic in Rose Street. He captures the specifics of his Italian-American family's experience in Youngstown, Ohio with remarkable clarity while simultaneously tapping into themes which remain universal to the family dynamic: responsibility, authority, self-sacrifice, love.

For some reason, I don't know why, Berry decided to rename the main characters. J'Quel D'Trelna has far more appeal to me than Jaquel Detrelna. K'Ronar and S'Cotar became part of the rhythm of the story, Kronar sounds like something out of some Tarzan story. Scotar sounds like cooties. His edit destroyed the feel of the story. I still have three of the four books in paperback. I will track down the fourth. If I had done the edit, I would have changed the names on in Quadrant Blue Nine. That would have made a little cultural diversity."},{"Title":"The AI War","review":"This is very well done non-stop military sci-fi. If that is what you like, then up my ranking. It is impressive and exciting. For those of you wanting an all-around book, don't even waste your time. There is enough character development in the entire book to fill half a chapter in most. The characters (there are many) all have similar names, and you have to refer to the (necessary) dramatis personae repeatedly, unless you choose to simply not know who is who, in which case you would lose little. D'Trelna is fat, that is about as big a difference as you get. Another matter is these insectoids. They are really bad. For one thing, they are supposed to have been defeated at one point by humans, even though by my reckoning one of them is more valuable in a war effort than a hundred men. They can instantly move themselves and others from one place to another, read minds, and leap tall buildings in a single bound. There are some surprises, and the action is good. Read it if that is what you want. If you want to find the story very believable and care more than a little who wins/loses and lives/dies, pass it up."},{"Title":"The AI War","review":"like it, have read the other two books, the plot move along very well, but some times easy to forget which universe your in, do to all the charters"},{"Title":"The AI War","review":"\\"Space, the Final Frontier\\" Well not if you are a Science Fiction Writer, apparently.

Doc Smith 'Lensman' Books way back in the early 70's and even then those books had been around for about 40 years prior to that. All that changed a couple of months ago when I picked up, on Kindle, the In Her Name series of books by Michael R Hicks.

Over all it was a fast paced thriller as the the Commodore and his crew are chased across the galaxy by both 'friend and foe' trying not to kill their friends but desperately trying to find a way to save the galaxy from the invasion that is coming.Lots of intrigue with plenty of twists and turns.

And you will laugh!"},{"Title":"Henry Huggins","review":"Cleary's first novel introduces her most popular boy protagonist and his mischievous pet dog, Ribsy. Immediately after adopting the lovable mutt, Henry experiences a variety of adventures: bedlam on a bus ride; mass guppy breeding and the consequences thereof; nocturnal worm collecting as a means to replace a friend's lost football; the messy resolution of an unwanted role in a school operetta; disastrous participation in a local dog show. In the book's final chapter, Ribsy's former owner comes calling for him, and what ensues is enough to make even the youngest readers cheer for Henry.Even after six decades, the ingenuity of Cleary's scenarios and the enthusiasm of her characters still impart an enduring freshness to the proceedings in spite of the novel's dated attributes and vernacular. Louis Darling's illustrations are notably cruder than those of subsequent Cleary books, but they're no less charming or evocative of their innocent age for being so much less detailed."},{"Title":"Henry Huggins","review":"My 4 and 2 year old sons listen to Henry Huggins all the time.

My daughter roared with laughter during a long road trip, and was very sorry when the story came to an end.The CD is very well done; I have had it for a few years now, and I have listened to it by myself on multiple occasions while driving or cooking.

That is, until the day he met a stray dog and decided that he HAD to keep him. Predictably, he and \\"Ribsy\\" have many humorous adventures together, and these stories are what make up \\"Henry Huggins\\". From that first ride home that starts on a city bus and ended in a police car, to a dog show that sees Ribsy sporting pink fur, to the final test of loyalty that will make all readers breathless with anticipation, the story is well told. Everything in this book is carried out in a pleasant and easy-to-read manner, so children should have no trouble staying with the story, even if there are few pictures. Even though it was published over 50 years ago, \\"Henry Huggins\\" is still a valuable book to have in your collection."},{"Title":"Henry Huggins","review":"I bought this book in English and Spanish - cross-comparing the two is a good way to learn a second language.

If you did, too, make sure you preview the first disc! The copy I received was appropriately labeled \\"Henry Huggins,\\" but the material on disc one was NOT FOR CHILDREN. I listened to enough of it to research the source. It begins with the chapter titled \\"That's Amore\\" from the book \\"When You Are Engulfed by Flames\\" by David Sedaris. The themes and language in this book are adult. Amazon kindly exchanged my defective CD set with a new one .... AND IT HAS THE SAME PROBLEM! Buyer beware."},{"Title":"Henry Huggins","review":"The life of the third grade protagonist becomes more exciting when he finds a companionable stray dog; just getting him home via public transportation proves his first challenge. The friendly mongrel is so thin that Henry dubs him \\"Ribsy.\\" Soon accepted as one of the family, this dog accompanies his new master wherever possible; in fact he even causes many incidents of local mayhem and amusement. Henry deals with various crises such as lost property, guppy mania, night crawlers, the shool play and a pet show. But a serious threat to their kid-dogrelationship destroys Henry's peace of mind, when a boy appears who claims to be the dog's former owner.This is Lite Reading for elementary students, with plenty of dialogue, juvenile antics and conflict. This story is enchanced by Lois Darling's cute sketches. Set in those happy days before kids had TV sets, this ALA notable story explores the joys and woesof pet ownership. No more will Henry need to wish for somethingexciting to happen! Hinted themes include the subject of Cheating and the concept of sharing/showing compassion for others.

So the whole book is about the dog.At the very end he comes to a problem with the kid and him, and they haft to work it out. Then all the sudden Henry was winning and so the other kid he was fighting with decided to cheat. The theme of this book is never give up on what your trying to do and don't let other things get in your way of your dreams. The best part of this book is I love the fact that he goes threw what I go threw and he is just like me in real life in the book!!!!!!!! I really don't like anything in this great book. I am satisfied with the ending because he gets what he wants.I think the author gets a 12 out of a 15. He really keeps up your interest, and tells just the right amount you need to know.

A great opportunity for her to listen to a story and use her imagination (instead of looking at pictures). Great way for her to segue from one chapter to another and from book to book with the same characters (we've also read Beezus & Ramona). Cleary's books reflect our neighborhood atmosphere--kids playing in the streets, moms hollering for their kids to come home for dinner and kids going from house to house playing.

That was many, many years ago but I can still hear her reading the book and remember our class asking her to please keep reading! I read this book to my kids and they love Henry's adventures, starting with how he gets his dog Ribsy and tries to bring him home on the bus! Despite having to overcome some crazy obstacles, everything always works out well for Henry. What a delight that is!The stories are simple fun. Since the book was written 50+ years ago, my kids are intrigued by how much freedom Henry, as a 3rd grader, has (going to town by himself, taking the bus, etc). It was a different era and while reading to my kids we often stop to discuss how some things have changed over time. The same goes for Henry's spending money - for e.g. he spends a nickel for an ice cream, and my kids wanted to know how much that would be \\"in today's money\\".There's not many illustrations, but they're good, and this is one chapter book that my kids don't even miss not having many illustrations. Beverly Cleary's writing is simple, descriptive, and clear that it's easy to picture everything vividly without illustrations.This is a fun, happy book!! Kids too young to read a chapter book will enjoy hearing the stories read aloud, and chapter book readers will also enjoy Henry Huggins as well. The stories appeal to all ages. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Henry Huggins","review":"The Beverly Cleary books are great for kids. They show independent children and normal families. In the books are ordinary stress levels, pressure, respect, and consideration.

Henry Huggins is a funny boy that seems to always be looking for some excitement. Of course, almost all his excitement comes along with a little dose of trouble via his energetic and kinda scrawny dog Ribsy. They have adventures that take them on a bus, through a pet store, into a dog show and pretty much, all through the neighborhood. My third grade students seemed to enjoy reading about Henry and Ribsy's adventures. The students were able to find similarities with their own lives and use their imagination to picture themselves as characters in the story. It was a fun read."},{"Title":"Henry Huggins","review":"I have a number of Ramona CD's so thought I'd venture out into Henry Huggins. As much as I love Ramona, this Henry CD is the best, due in part to the voice of Neil Patrick Harris. My son loves to listen to a CD every night before going to bed, and he requests this one more often than any other. It's amazing to think that Beverly Cleary's book, written 50 years ago, can still appeal to youngsters today. It's timeless. Thank you Beverly Cleary!"},{"Title":"Henry Huggins","review":"I started reading the Henry Huggins books to my son when he was 5 years old. We read a chapter every night and my husband would come in to see what was going on because we were laughing so much! When Henry's mom gave him a home haircut, we cried we laughed so hard. My son is now 22 years old, and he still has his Henry Huggins books. He is saving them for when he has children of his own. I highly recommed these books and anything by Beverly Cleary.

One of my favorite parts is when Ribsy, Henry's dog, rolled in the mud right before the dog show. Henry saw another boy putting white powder on his dog to make him look whiter, so he tried it also. He was surprised that the powder was not white, but PINK! Since Ribsy was wet from the mud, Henry could not rub the powder off of him, so he decided to cover him completely in pink. At the end of this chapter Ribsy won a silver cup for being the most unusual dog at the show.I would read Henry Huggins by Beverly Cleary again, and I think that boys would like it even better.(Note from mom: I read chapter one aloud to my first grade daughter whom decided to read the rest to herself. This is a good read for a child who is ready to go beyond simple chapter books, but is not yet ready for something too long and thick.)"},{"Title":"Henry Huggins","review":"In November, I read a book that was comical. Henry Huggins is a boy that had no excitement in his life until he found a dog on the streets. He was buying an ice cream cone and he met a dog. Then, he wanted to bring him home. He got on the bus home, but the dog ruined everything. Henry got kicked out of the bus five times. Then the police came, and Henry got so scared for he thought the policemen would take him away. Instead, the policemen just took him home. Henry named the dog Ribsy \\"because you could even see his ribs.\\" The most important part was when Henry entered a dog show because he wanted to win something. Ribsy slid in the mud, so Henry used talcum powder on Ribsy. Henry didn't know it was pink and the judges said \\"that is a weird dog.\\" Would Ribsy win anything? Or would he lose? A few months later, a boy came and claimed that Ribsy was his dog. Then they had a competition. Who would Ribsy choose?I hated the part when a boy came because Henry and Ribsy wee having a happy life, but the boy came to ruin it. How come Ribsy was on the streets? If I was Henry I would say \\"go home\\" and if he didn't I'll beat him up. Who will Ribsy choose? Who will he want to go with when the competition starts?I think this book is good for a kid who found a dog without a collar that belonged to someone else because you could see what this boy went through."},{"Title":"Henry Huggins","review":"the best book I ever read was called Henery Huggins.

She uses her tale to leave us laughing and wishing we could look up and see tat funny do and Henry Huggins fast behind him trying to fix whatever craziness he has started.If there are any kids in your life, or if you want to slip away and hide in your own childhood for a little while - pick up Henry Huggins and settle in for some serious fun."},{"Title":"Henry Huggins","review":"In Beverly Cleary's book, Henry Huggins, she tells a story about the life of a little boy. This book is definitely an adventure book. Henry Huggins is a seven year old 3rd grader. He lives on Klickitat Street, which is Beverly Cleary's childhood street in Portland, Oregon. The story is set in the 1950s and Henry lives in a small, peaceful town in the suburbs.Henry Huggins is the main character. The book takes the reader through Henry's everyday excitement as a curious, adventurous young boy. He is a very likable boy and has a big heart. As a reader, it is easy to get into the book and try to figure out what Henry will do next. Ribsy is Henry's dog that he finds at the local drug store one day. He names him Ribsy due to the fact that he is really skinny, therefore making it very easy to see his ribs. The book also briefly mentions a few of Henry's classmates, including Robert, Beezus, and Mary Jane and a fifth grader named Scooter.This chapter book has several different storylines. It contains six chapters that are unrelated to each other. In the first chapter, Henry finds Ribsy and begs his parents to let him keep him. The adventure is trying to figure out exactly how Henry will get Ribsy home. The second chapter is about Henry wanting guppies but then a few guppies' turns into a hundred guppies. The third chapter deals with Henry wanting to save money for a nice football like the one his friend Scooter has. But certain events lead him to have to spend his money on a football for Scooter. The fourth chapter deals with Henry having to perform in a school Christmas play. The fifth chapter is about Henry entering Ribsy in a dog show. The last chapter is about Ribsy's former owner trying to take Ribsy back. Does he get him back or will Henry be able to keep his beloved dog?Beverly Cleary does a good job of showing the action of the book. She uses sound words such as, \\"Thump, thump, thump\\" and \\"Crackle, crackle, crackle\\" to describe the actions of the characters. I think this is a great book for younger kids. It tells them about adventures of little kids around their own age that they can relate to."},{"Title":"Henry Huggins","review":"Henry Huggins written by Beverly Cleary, is about a boy named Henry. Henry finds a dog in the drug store. Henry is a normal boy that finds a dog in a drug store. Henry names him Ribsy. They have a lot of adventures together.What I liked about the book was it was exciting yet interesting. The characters were fascinating. I think the message from the author was finders keepers. If you find something you should put up posters before you keep it."},{"Title":"Henry Huggins","review":"My 9-year-old son wasn't an avid or enthusiastic reader, and when it came time for his first book report, my husband and I panicked. We were afraid we'd never find a book that sparked his interest enough to want to read through to the end.Thank goodness for Henry Huggins. This story is simply adorable, and I was delighted to see my son laugh out loud as he read the book. After he finished a chaper, he'd run and tell me what new mess Henry and his lovable scoundrel of a dog, Ribsy, had gotten themselves into. In fact, I actually caught my son reading the book on his own, with no prodding from me or his father.This book was published in 1950 and so my son did have a few questions about why things were so inexpensive in the story, but other than that, \\"Henry Huggins\\" is not dated at all and the story is just entertaining now as it was in the 1950s.I am so thankful that I purchased this book and that it not only kept my son's interest but helped him realize that books could be fun. This story should be a great first \\"chapter book\\" for any child who is ready to move past picture books."},{"Title":"Henry Huggins","review":"I never did read much Cleary growing up...but since the Girl is having some trouble getting into book, I thought this might be a good one for her...and I was right, she absolutely LOVED it. Henry Huggins (like How to Eat Fried Worms) is a bit dated, since it was written in 1949, but the overall feel and character of the story is pretty much timeless. We are presented with a typical neighborhood, family, kids, neighbors of the time that, despite the way we live life today, is presented in a way that is still accessible to kids today (even those not living in suburban neighborhoods. Henry is a typical boy who wants a bit of excitement in his life...and finds it while browsing at the local convenience store, in the form of Ribsy as skinny mutt who he decides to take home (with his mother's permission of course)...on the BUS! This is first of 5 adventures that Henry and Ribsy encounter as they go on through the book (we also get raising guppies, catching thousands of night crawlers, a charming look at Christmas pageants and snow from a 9 year olds perspective, the dog show, and the prospect of Henry having to give up Ribsy). Each is charming and still endearing more than 50 years after it was originally written. We are presented with stories that show Henry as honest and hard working, we learn to have compassion for others and that doing the right thing is always important...all in a humorous and realistic way that doesn't feel like the message is being shoved down our throats! I give it a solid A, even after 50+ years, Henry Huggins is fine reading for 8-10 year olds!"},{"Title":"Henry Huggins","review":"My all-time favorite book is HENRY HUGGINS. I am a 34-year old mother of 2 boys who are too young to read the book by themselves and not interested in sitting through a book with very few pictures. However, I have been eager to share this wholesome story with them. So, this book on CD was perfect!! I play it in the car and I don't hear a sound out of them for miles--they are so engrossed in the story and don't want to miss a word. (great for long trips!) They love Henry's adventures &amp; his crazy dog, Ribsy. Neil Patrick Harris does the most fantastic job reading this wonderful story. His voice changes so much for each character that you would swear it was more than one person reading the story. From Mrs. Huggins to Mr. Pennycuff, the pet shop owner, Neil Patrick Harris keeps us entertained with his impersonations of the characters. I love this CD set. I'm thrilled to be able to share Beverly Cleary's timeless stories with my children and I know they will love them just as much when they actually learn how to read! I hope they have Neil Patrick Harris record the other Henry Huggins books too. Super job!!"},{"Title":"Henry Huggins","review":"I remember almost every one of Henry's antics and adventures and I read these books 20 years ago. This book is the classic that started it all. I love the Ramona books, but Henry will always be my favorite. He has his shortcomings, but he is a true good spirit, a good friend, and a great dog owner. Make sure to have your kids read this book, it is truly just a sweet story about a boy, his life, and his dog."},{"Title":"Henry Huggins","review":"From my understanding, Beverly Cleary was a librarian who could not get some boys to read. They complained that there wasn't anything to read that they could relate to. They asked why weren't there books about kids like them, just average boys? So Beverly Cleary wrote &quot;Henry Huggins&quot; for them- a story of an average boy who gets into all sorts of believable adventures with highly amusing results. It is a GREAT book, and Ms. Cleary introduced to children's literature some of its greatest characters: Henry and his dog, Ribsy; and, in later books, his tomboy friend, Beezus, and Beezus' amazingly pesty kid sister, Ramona. Everyone of the subsequent books in the Henry/Ramona series is fantastic- filled with humor and characters with whom kids can understand and relate. &quot;Henry Huggins&quot; started it all and makes a wonderful introduction to Ms. Cleary's world on Kickalat Street."},{"Title":"Henry Huggins","review":"This was a funny story about a boy and his dog. It all started when Henry Huggins found a lost dog outside of the drugstore one day after buying some ice cream. After a complicated ride on the bus, Henry gets the dog home and his mom says he can keep him. Henry names the dog Ribsy. The two have many adventures in the year they are together. This includes winning a dog show, and getting their picture in a newspaper. Unfortunately it is this very picture that leads the dogs original owner back to the dog.I liked this book because I thought it was very funny. One particular part of the book has everyone fall to the floor and unable to get up because of some apples a lady dropped when the dog got loose. Henry makes a great buy at the pet store and brings home two guppies that quickly multiply. Before he knows it he has hundreds of baby guppies.My favorite part of the story is when the original owner tracks them down with the help of the newspaper picture, and wants his dog back. They decide to let the dog choose who he wants to go with. Henry and the stranger stand back and each call to the dog. To Henry's surprise the dogs name is Dizzy. After what seemed like forever to the boys, Ribsy chooses Henry."},{"Title":"Henry Huggins","review":"This story takes place in a street called Klickitat Street and it takes place somewhere in the past. It takes place in the past because when they go to the store everything is cheap.This book is mostly about a third grade boy named Henry Huggins and his friends Beezus, Scotter, Mary Jane, and Ramona. In the begging of the story Henry is trying to look for a pet. In the second part they put him in a play but he don't want to be in it.In my opinion it was a good book because it tells a lot of what friends do and to care about each other. I would recommend this book because it says like how to be fair and if you do something wrong fix it."},{"Title":"Henry Huggins","review":"One day Henry finds a dog and he tries to take it home on the bus. Henry and Ribsy become best friends. One funny chapter was when they entered a contest and Henry tried to clean up Ribsy and mistakenly put pink powder all over Ribsy and they ended up winning because Ribsy was a pink dog.

Cleary has now become his all time favorite and I couldn't be more delighted, as I recall racing through her books when I was my son's age! He can relate to so many of the characters (especially the michievous ones), and the CD has now become a nighttime favorite. Once our oral story time is over, he will fall asleep listening to Henry Huggins, Ellen Tebbits or Ramona Quimby's escapades on CD. It's become a ritual in our house and I'm delighted he's so interested in reading."},{"Title":"Escaping the Shadows: An Email Journey","review":"Escaping the Shadows captivated my attention and expanded my understanding, and it will do the same for you.This book illustrates the amazing tale of one woman's personal quest for peace and solidarity in her life. Lisa J. Peck does an outstanding job giving the reader a glimpse into the life of Charlene, an LDS middle-aged woman with several kids, blazing a trail of hope and courage through an abusive marriage, subsequent divorce, single motherhood and reentry into the 'dating world.'It should be noted that though this book deals with mature issues of domestic violence, divorce, health issues and internet dating, it is surprisingly upbeat and will leave you with a positive feeling of accomplishment for the main character. It may not be suitable for younger readers.As an adult male and husband, I was not sure what to expect when I began reading it, but I am glad that I did. It opened my eyes to serious topics generally not mentioned in LDS circles, though they apply to us as much as they do to the nation. My wife and I both were amazed at the accuracy with which the book describes the physical as well as mental and emotional trauma one can suffer in abusive relationships. Someone close to us recently went through a similar trial in her life, and it was uncanny to see the similarities between her experience and the book.Escaping the Shadows is a must-read for singles and married couples alike. It was both enlightening as to serious matters, yet fun and uplifting so as to enjoy."},{"Title":"Escaping the Shadows: An Email Journey","review":"Ms.Peck has done a fantastic job of helping the reader to not only understand the mind of the abused . . . but what friends and family can do to help and what the abused can do to escape the situation. It is marvelous in helping single women to watch for the signs that will lead to an abusive relationship. Domestic violence is prevalent in our society, and Ms. Peck takes us through a fictional journey of a woman emerging from the shadows, into the terrifying world of dating and finding true love once again. This is a must read by every man, woman and child in the world if one hopes to prevent from being sucked into a relationship like or hopes to fight free of one."},{"Title":"Sturlunga Saga, Vol. 1 (Library of Scandinavian Literature, Vol. 9)","review":"This volume is comprised mostly of the Islendinga Saga, which is very long and repetitive as compared to other Icelandic sagas. If you have already read all the other, more popular, sagas, then go right ahead and read this one. Not recommended for newcomers to saga literature, however. There is some very interesting detail about conflicts with a Christian bishop, but this can be gotten in a more succinct and readable form in volume 2 of this translation."},{"Title":"The Road to Mecca","review":"I was required to read Asad's book \\"Road to Mecca\\" for a class. I'm not a Muslim and the book is not small and I dreaded it. That changed when I got into it. Amazing book! VERY well written, this personal journey of a European news investigator who spent years in Saudi Arabia and converted to Islam is full of adventure, history, intrigue, philosophy, culture and sociology and all manner of insights. It gives a rare deep view to Westerners of the world of the Middle East."},{"Title":"The Road to Mecca","review":"This is a great adventure story from the glorious days of Arabia. It's also the best introduction to Islam I've ever read."},{"Title":"The Road to Mecca","review":"I have always felt a longing for the desert. This is the first time I have ever read someone putting these feelings into words. Simply awsome!"},{"Title":"The Road to Mecca","review":"I read this book a while ago and can still remember some of the most thrilling parts of the book. Even thought the book is an autobiography it almost reads like a thriller. I reccomment this book to all Muslims. MUhammad Asad is truly an example for all."},{"Title":"The Road to Mecca","review":"This is the story of how Muhammad Asad (1900 to 1992) - born a Jew in Austrian Galicia as Leopold Weiss - came to be converted to Islam in 1926. There is only the briefest account in the introduction of his astonishing career as a Muslim; how he helped to draft the Constitution of Pakistan and in 1952 became Pakistan's representative at the United Nations. The book, except for a brief 1973 postscript, was first published in 1954. In 1980 he was to publish a famous translation of the Qur'an into English. For a long account of his remarkable life, google \\"Martin Kramer\\" \\"The Road from Mecca\\".The book opens in 1932, six years after his conversion, when he and an Arab friend of his were crossing the Arabian desert on dromedaries. On their way, from the Saudi-Iraq border to Mecca, he became briefly separated from his friend, lost his way and nearly died of thirst - an immensely powerful and poetic description of the desert and of this ordeal. It is a foretaste of the evocative way he writes about everything he sees and experiences.During this journey he reminisces about his life.His early study of Judaism had given him some feeling for a religious outlook, but its emphasis on ritual and on a God caring especially for one little tribe had left him for a while a secular person, albeit one with a vague longing for a \`spiritual order' in the post-war period of \`moral chaos' and materialism. Of course it was also a period of intellectual ferment and creativity; but still felt that it all took place in a spiritual vacuum.He became a journalist; and then in 1922 he was invited for a visit by an uncle living in Palestine. His first sight - so unEuropean - of gracefully moving Arabs, camels and dunes along the banks of the Suez Canal fills him with a strange exhilaration, foreshadowing so many later experiences. In Palestine he was immediately struck by how the Arabs seemed to belong to the land more than the Ashkenazi Jewish immigrants, and he identified with the former against the Zionists. Here and throughout the book he writes about everything Arabic in rhapsodic terms, and the Arab people he extols in fulsome and romantic style: they are handsome, calm, dignified, at one with nature, at ease with themselves, with no sense of inferiority when in the presence of those in authority, hospitable and, with all their faults, noble individuals.Only occasionally does he describe some of their faults - for example the narrowness and intolerance of the Wahhabis; but even then he admires their aim of restoring the original purity of Islam.But this is to anticipate. (Asad records his own memories with disregard to chronology.)Returning to Europe after eighteen months in Palestine and Syria, he found that continent barren and faith-less (Christianity's separation of Church and State leaving its secular activities nowadays without any spiritual dimension), its people mostly ugly and clumsy. (I have inserted the word \`nowadays': Asad shows no awareness of how deeply Christianity had shaped every aspect of secular life for many centuries.) He was disgusted by the post-war violence in Europe (but will withhold judgment from the tribal warfare which accompanied and even followed Ibn Saud's conquest of Arabia).Then, in 1924, his newspaper sent him back to the Middle East, and this journey took him during the next two years from Egypt to Afghanistan, at times under perilous circumstances of various kinds. In Iran he was struck by the melancholy of the people - a people who still weep at the fate of Ali and his sons thirteen centuries ago - and who, so Asad believed, cling to Shi'ism because the Arab Caliphs who conquered the proud Persians were Sunni.Asad identifies himself with the Sunni case. He had now begun to engage seriously with the text of the Qur'an and the history of Islamic civilization. He saw that the narrow fanaticism of the Wahhabis was at odds with all that. Above all, it was the abandonment of the search for knowledge and education, enjoined by the Qur'an, which had plunged this civilization into ignorance and poverty. The Islamic world, he felt, must close the knowledge gap between the Muslims and the West, but without allowing Western materialism to corrupt it. He held forth on this subject with such passion to a Muslim in Afghanistan that the latter said, \\"You are a Muslim, only you don't know it yourself\\".But Asad was not yet convinced that the Qur'an was \\"the word of God and not merely the creation of a brilliant mind\\". Islam appealed to this man of an essentially mystical temperament because he saw it as an eminently practical and rational guide to a rounded life. But then, soon after he had returned to Europe and perceived \\"the hidden suffering\\" on the faces of its comfortably-off citizens, he experienced an epiphany which broke down the last barrier for him, and he made his confession of faith.He now embarked on his first hajj to Mecca; there he met King Ibn Saud with whom he established a personal friendship. In 1929 the King sent him on a perilous mission to gather information in a rebel area. Another dangerous journey he undertook, in 1931, was to Cyrenaica, in the forlorn hope of opening up a supply route from Egypt to the Sanussi rebels against the Italians. And in the following year he undertook the journey which frames this book.Asad's interpretations of what he sees strike me as almost impossibly romantic; and in his commitment to the Orient he is deeply unfair in his generalizations about the West. Indeed he says more than once that his embrace of Islam meant cutting off his links to the West: that is the language of \\"the clash of civilizations\\". But in 1932, when this book ends, Asad was still a fairly young man, and in later life he would modify the extreme position he took up in this classic."},{"Title":"The Road to Mecca","review":"This book is a very enjoyable read. Asad's stories of adventure and his search for personal fulfillment provide constant historical, cultural, and religious lessons for the reader. A wonderful way to learn and understand other people and their ideas, which may or may not be different from your own."},{"Title":"The Road to Mecca","review":"The Road to Mecca by Muhammad Asad.This is the most beautifully written book I have read in a long time. Asad writes in English and his European background colours the choice of phrase. It is the story of a spiritual journey but is set in the larger tale of his travels and adventures in inhospitable parts of the world, accompanied by people most Europeans of the time would have shunned. He writes with empathy and warmth and it is this which lifts it into the sort of book I could not put down. Even people with no religious belief enjoy it for its beauty, and the chronicle of a world that vanished with the discovery and exploitation of oil. It is so good that I bought six copies and gave five of them as Christmas gifts to Muslim, Christian and atheist friends. Every one of them reported loving it, though sometimes for different reasons."},{"Title":"The Road to Mecca","review":"The road he took to reach Mecca is such an insightful one that it will keep you wanting to take the journey over and over again..."},{"Title":"The Road to Mecca","review":"What an incredible journey through the heart of the Islamic world at a very crucial period in history. Mohammad Asad embarks on an adventure that not only changes him but also is bound to profoundly affect anyone who joins him in this beautifully written book. This is without doubt an unmatched creation by an exceptionally gifted writer."},{"Title":"The Road to Mecca","review":"A journey through life where a human realizes who he was, why he was, and where he was going. He also seemed to understand where humanity is going, and why with all our technological conveniences, we would not be able to fill the hole that we have dug in our hearts. Along the journey, his uncanny honesty, surreal imagery, and deep love for humanity emerges with certainty. This narration is about the Reality seen through the window of life of a seeker of Truth, whose quest never terminates until he reaches it."},{"Title":"The Road to Mecca","review":"The Road to Mecca is a travel narrative by Muhammad Asad about his travels and experiences in the Middle East following his conversion to Islam.I read this book for a college course, and it was the most enjoyable work of the semester. It is enjoyable to read. At points it is relaxing, at points it challenges one to examine one's own convictions.As far as what Asad's purpose is in writing the book, it can best be described by two passages:&quot;[Asad has] set out to exchange one world for another - to gain a new world for yourself in exchange for an old one which you never really possessed.&quot; (pg 48)and:&quot;The meaning of all my wanderings lay in a hidden desire to meet myself by meeting a world whose approach to the innermost questions of life, to reality itself, was different from all I had been accustomed to in my childhood and youth.&quot; (pg. 50).All in all, a great read. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Road to Mecca","review":"I had heard about Muhammad Asad from his articles that he wrote on the vision of Pakistan. I was always intrigued by the clarity with which he wrote his ideas (Pakistan is no where close to how he envisioned it). I wanted to find out more about him. This book provided just that. Its a short summary of his prime years as a young man, how the Arab culture inspired him to study Islam and how his logical/analytical thinking guided him to truth. The way story has been laid out it is very captivating and eye opening from start to end."},{"Title":"The Road to Mecca","review":"A beautiful book written by a former Jewish Journalist of Austrian origin who travels to the middle east and stands in admiration at the lifestyle of the Muslims in the Arabian peninsula.Although his embrace of Islam is not immediate he comes to understand the beauty of this religion and finally embraces it while in Europe. He later decides to move to live in Arabia by giving up completely his western lifestyle and past, the story focuses on many various events and I found it quiet impressive as to the amount of famous persons Mr. Asad has come accross in his journey in the middle east, some of which are: King Ibn Saud (founder of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia), the president of the world Zionist organisation (who is later to become the first president of Israel), the Shah of Iran, the famous Lybian Mujahidin Omar Al Mukthar, the King of Jordan Abdullah and many other.Although the book is quiet old, as it recounts of events which occur in the 1920's, it is very well written and beautifuly explains the beauty of the life in Arabia in those times, it gave me a nice image and picture of the life of the beduins, their hospitality and gratitude from life and it's simplicity but how the people live it full of happyness. I was quiet impressed as well with the many events which have occured during the travel of Mr. Asad, in his attempt to help the King Ibn Saud to understand how the rebels operated against the King in order to prevent the Kingdom from successful establishment, to his travel to Lybia to meet Omar Al Muhtkar for possible assistance on providing additional support to continue the rebellion against the Italians.In overall, the story is quiet beautiful, gives us a nice feeling of the Arabian desert and most of all the discovery to Islam of Mr. Asad is an impressive story to read."},{"Title":"The Road to Mecca","review":"In this book Muhammad Asad wrote his personal quest for the Right Path, this book is more like a story than autobiography. It starts with the story when he was traveling with his Arab friend in the Saudi Arabian desert on two dromedaries. This book mainly covers his journey to Middle East, when he was working as a journalist for German Newspaper.I like his style of writing: He uses simple english, he can communicate his points very clearly, and he always keeps you interested. Being a western Muslim, his judgement and thoughts are different than that of born Muslims, this makes the book more interesting. Because for him simple things that he encountered during his journey was a big lesson, which many born Muslims don't realize. For example, in one of the chapters he questions the old Arab guy in Jerusalem: \\"Why do you pray, as you pray? Why do you have to perform all these movements with your body? You could just pray with your heart (as Christians do)\\". And the old man says: \\"Because God has created us in two forms, body and soul. That is why we pray with our heart (soul) as well as body. Because body and soul are together\\".There are lots of things that will benefit you in this book. To get the real message, you must read it."},{"Title":"The Road to Mecca","review":"I cannot say enough good things about this book. I was given a copy by a Pakistani friend with whom I work here in New York. What in a shallow read is a brilliant work of exceptional linguistic skill, is truly a mind opening and enlightening walk in the shoes of a man who sought answers to questions many cannot bear to face. One can only be awestruck by his adaptation to a culture so far from ones own... and his remarkable ability to transition between virtually a dozen languages. This book has changed my life.I would agree with another review that we may not all agree with his conclusion, but certainly an understanding of Islamic principles can only bring us closer to the truth, whether we accept it as our way of life or not. Our lives in the west are bombarded with materialistic ideals, and although we all know this and criticize this amongs ourselves, we at the same time seem to accept it. Materialism is now being used to enhance capitalism and our bottom lines, but at a tremendous cost that we will not realize for generations. The United States was created to be a dynamic and transformable state, yet it can only be what its citizens will it to be. This book will open you to an understanding of life that is absent in our current social structure, and can perhaps make your life more meaningful than ever imagined. If i had the time I could write a book on this book, although it wouldn't be nearly as intersting, so just read &quot;A Road To Makkah&quot;... you will not regret it."},{"Title":"The Road to Mecca","review":"The Road to Mecca is not a historical book. Yet, some parts of its mystical archives are very considerable in getting a real picture about Islam and Muslims during the two era; the falling of Islamic khilafah and the beginning of the western Imperialism era.Muhammad Asad or Asadullah von Weiss (1900-1992) was having close relationship with many leaders, scholars and fighters (mujahidin), including King Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud, King Faisal, King Abdullah, Reza Shah Pahlavi, Jacob Isral de Haan, Shaykh Mustafa al-Maraghi, Abul A'la al-Maududi, \`Allama Muhammad Iqbal, Sayyid Ahmad, Ash-Shaheed Umar Mukhtar and Agos Salim besides travelling a massive hundred of thousand miles to Arabia, Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Persia, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Central Asian states. Hence, his long journey and great experiences wrapping in his own beautiful narrative, are the valuable \`tutorials' to be mastered.I would like to highlight two most significant chapters. Almost the whole chapter of \`Jihad' consists of Asad's dialogue with Sidi Muhammad az-Zuwayy, Sayyid Ahmad and Umar Mukhtar, illustrating the history of Sanusi Islamic movement. It includes the dilemma of the Sanusi, whether to fight against British in Egypt or not. I concluded the lessons as:a) The Muslim leader as well as the whole Muslim community must follow the Qur'an and the Sunnah. God help whomever help God. Whereas the utmost priority in the Muslim life should be his ad-din al-Islam.b) Muslim brotherhood should be developed without any different, Arab, Turkish etc.c) Without any objection, jihad is a part of Islamic teaching and obligation, in protecting Muslim faith and land.Another chapter, \`Dajjal' was specifically written about the dajjalic modern life and Zionism, Iran and Reza Shah Pahlavi, and also about his experience in embracing into Islam. Muhammad Asad was all the time against the Zionist and any colonial power toward Muslims' land. \\"Although of Jewish origin myself,\\" noted him in The Road to Mecca, \\"I conceived from the outset a strong objection to Zionism...I considered it immoral that immigrants, assisted by a great foreign power...\\"I never regret reading it.

The author looks with his mind through his eyes at people & the world around him in a very passionate way. The inner thoughts of his life and adventures are really captivating. It starts with him remembering the dissatisfied young man he was in Austria. He leaves it to seek adventure and ends up in the Middle East & converts to Islam in 1926. Great story which includes his views about the world and those he met along the way. I was not really in tune with all his personal views but understood his basic feelings. He was born in 1900 & lived in Austria. His birth name was Leopold Weiss. His religious ancestry consisted of a long line of orthodox Rabbis except for his father who was a lawyer. His parents were not religious and this I believe led to his lack of spirituality and turning from Judaism to Islam. His view of Islam became an obsession. He loved everything about the people who lived it and its teachings. I however didn't understand how he seemed to always know all the great and powerful people who taught & ruled on the Arabian peninsula. He was the personal friend & adviser of Islamic Kings, Amirs, Sheiks, Scholars, etc . If so, one might see why he was so taken by the religion. He never the less presents himself as a humble man in tune with the simple life and seeking adventure and his place in life. Really a great book even though he presents a one sided praise of Islam and a disgust for the western civilization. Islam could be a wonderful religion if not for the fanatics who control it. He himself hints to this during his writings but does not understand that he also has become one of them. Very interesting story of a european secular Jew who found his calling with Islam and its people."},{"Title":"The Road to Mecca","review":"A truly refreshing take on Islam and life as a whole.

Can a modern/secular mind find it way into Islam and appreciate its truth? And if so how is this possible? As I was born in and raised into a Muslim society, I took it for granted that Islam was the true calling of God. At one point in my life, I did some soul searching into what I really believed and found that while I was strong in my faith, I needed help understanding more things about Islam. I found several books that helped but this bok expressed how I really felt. Asad's experience is the perfect testimony of the modern reason finding its way into Islam and at the same time reconstructing the message and significance of Islam for the modern Muslim. It helps us understand the relevance of Quranic message for modernity."},{"Title":"The Road to Mecca","review":"This book is a tale of an Austrian Jew who converted to Islam.

Written by a European intellectual who embraced Islam as a young man, this book can help us to achieve a better understanding of a religion and a religious-cultural complex that has, to such a great extent, become a matter of controversy in our present time. Along with Nasr's more recent \\"Islam in the Modern World\\" it is a \\"must\\" to anyone who wishes to deepen his knowlede on the subject.

I highly recommend this book for people wanting to learn about middle east and islam"},{"Title":"The Road to Mecca","review":"This was a great travelogue/autobiography of one man's spiritual journey into a completely foreign world and his subsequent embrace of that world. Asad, born as Leopold Weiss, was from a Jewish family in early 20th century Austria-Hungary and during his work as a journalist he travelled extensively throughout the Muslim world. He subsequently fell in love with Arab culture and converted to Islam. His dissatisfaction with Western society is something that precedes his Middle Eastern journeys, only he never suspected where this would ultimately lead him.\\"I was not unhappy: but my inability to share the diverse social, economic and political hopes of those around me-of any group among them-grew in time into a vague sense of not quite belonging to them, accompanied, vaguely again, by a desire to belong-to whom? - to be a part of something- of what?\\"Coming from a Jewish background, it is not remarkable that Asad would feel alienated from European society and feel an affinity for Arabia. That being said, there is something universal in his story, about his search for meaning, for peace of mind, for some place to call home. In fact, his personal insights strike a chord with me greatly (I am a white American), and I found myself significantly relating on an intellectual and emotional level. Anyways, this is also a great depiction of the early 20th century Muslim world as Asad rubs elbows with Kings and peasants alike. Definitely worth a read."},{"Title":"The Road to Mecca","review":"This is one of the best books written by a Muslim convert,and I have to say that I was blown away by the amount of enlightening comments and views that Mr.Asad has included in his journey to becoming a Muslim.It is so bewildering to read and understand how a religion like Islam,so profound and dignified, could change a person like Mr.Asad to change his religion and ,ultimately,his ideas about life,God and people.This book is interesting to read because the style of writing is easty to understand,the description he uses to include the reader in the events is quite vivid and the personal remarks about people,places and politics are worth considering.In my opinion,this is not only a book,it is a treasured narrative that seems like a running documentary about a foreigner discovering the Middle East with all its grandeur and tragedies."},{"Title":"The Road to Mecca","review":"After reading this magnificent book, I am still puzzled as to why such a remarkable personality like Mohammad Asad still remains obscure to both the Western world, and most importantly, the Muslim world. A person who has seen and experienced all of the main events of the 20th century at first hand, and has lived to describe it lucidly truly deserves to be on the map of personalities of the last century. His contribution to 20th century socities of the Middle-East is immense. A first class traveller, a journalist, a writer, a philosopher, an adventurer, a statesman, a diplomat, a scholar, and most of all a believer in the faith of Islam through experience, at least should be considered on par with lawrence of Arabia, if not above, for the sole reason that he was involved in the shaping of more than one country, not just Arabia.Let me get to the book. This book is actually four journeys fitted into one. It is a geographical, historical, linguistic, and spiritual journey all in one.- Geographical: for it a first class travelogue of the Middle-East region during the twenties, before the current borders ever existed or were drawn. He provides a very graphic description of places, lands, moods, cities, and people that he has come across, that virtually transports you to those times. He is not the romantic orientalist, nor is he the underminning military observer, but somehow a mixture of both with a flair of adventure. He traveled during a period of time when it was still possible to join caravans, hire horses and guides, and buy camels when embarking on a journey, which makes it all the more exciting to read.In short, even if you are not interested in the main story of the book ( his finding of the faith of islam ), to read the actual adventures he experienced, for the armchair traveler, this book is a must !- Historical: for he has witnessed all the events that have shaped the Middle-East of today. The fall of the Othoman Empire, World War I, World War II, the creation of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Zionism and the creation of the Israel, the ascending to the throne of the Shah of Iran, the creation of Pakistan, colonialism and the different resistances against it. He had been directly involved with events of early Saudi Aabia, and was one of the people who elucidated the idea of creating a Muslim nation in the Indian sub-continent with the man responsible for the idea, the poet Muhammad Iqbal. The personalities he has come face to face with testify to his involvement in those events of the first half of the 20th century. Listing them chronologically, Mdme. Maksim Gorky, Chaim Weizmann, King Ibn Saud, Prince Faisal (later King), The Shah of Iran, King Amanullah of Afghanistan, The Grand Sanoussi, Umar Al-Mukhtar, Muhammad Iqbal, to name some of them. He describes historical events that give important insight into the history of the region. For instance, the Bedouin revolt of 1929 against King Ibn Saud, the events that led to the ascension to the throne by the Shah of Iran, the Sanoussi resistance against Italian colonialism in Libya, etc. His accounts helped explain several aspects of ME history that I believe a lot of people from my generation (late twenties) are plainly not aware of.-Linguistic: for his English prose is remarkably lucid. It is amazing that he can write such beautiful English, considerning that it is not his mother tongue, nor it is his second language, but something like his fourth or fifth, after Hebrew, Polish, German and French. His description of moods, feelings, physical aspects of a place, times of day, spiritual feelings are so vivid that you actually feel them, not just imagine them. His book is truly to learn from, the vocabulary, the prose, the lucidity, all witness to a great work of literature.- Spiritual: Well, I leave this up to you. But in short, this journey is the main raison d'etre of this book. He describes his search for a spiritual ideology that would fill the vacancy left by the downfall of all spiritual engagements in Europe at that time. He describes the whole process gradually and in a very rational manner, but at the same time in doing so, he shows-maybe indirectly- his scholastic abilities in reasoning and his raional thinking on why he was convinced with Islam.All in all this book I believe should be compulsory reading for all history classes in countries of the Middle-East. History text book writers could use a few tips from Muhammad Asad's book.Before I end, I would like to say that this book has virtually changed my outlook on a lot of things, and has opened a whole new world for me. Read it and I hope you would go through the same experience...."},{"Title":"The Road to Mecca","review":"I consider myself an admirer of Islam, if not a believer, and I was interested in reading this book from the time I first heard of it. A well-reasoned apologia of the faith by a respected Western convert, I felt, could only be a useful and enlightening book. I was not prepared for the reality.On beginning the book I was initially disappointed by two things. First of all, Mr. Assad was a journalist. Secondly, the book was first published some 50 years ago - and the events described in it happened 20 years earlier than that. I have no objection to reading old books - far from it! - and I have in general no objection to reading books by journalists, but I tend to avoid old books by journalists. The journalist, by definition, you might say, is absorbed in the ephemera of current events; when he refers to the past, it is usually only to make a point about the present. And what may be a cogent observation about current events tends to pall quickly with time. At best, most old books by journalists are old news; at worst, downright laughable. Anybody who has tried to read an erstwhile best seller by Lowell Thomas or John Gunther will know what I mean. In addition, I feared that a book on religion by a journalist could only be superficial, so I resigned myself to making the best of what I feared was to be a bad situation; after all, I had already bought the book.It was true that the book seemed steeped in the current events of 1930: the French and British \\"mandates\\" in the Middle East, the Saudi struggles against the Beni Hashim and their English friends for control of the Arabian peninsula, the Sanusi battling Fascist Italy in Libya, Shah Reza Khan building a new Iran. Most of these events are ancient history to Western readers, if indeed they ever heard of them at all. But much to my surprise, the book was a startlingly good read, and it held my interest. Indeed, Mr. Assad's opening story of being lost in the desert is one of the finest pieces in its genre that I have ever read, and stands up favorably against anything written by Thesiger or TE Lawrence.I was actually halfway through the book before I finally realized that all of my preconceptions had been wrong. The book is a finely wrought description of an inner journey to his own center, along with two outer journeys - Mr. Assad's trip to Mecca to perform the Hajj which forms the outward frame of the book, and the larger journey of his own life, starting with his childhood in a Jewish family in Lvov through his presence and participation in many of the major events of the era, and how these affected his outlook.One of my earlier observations was true; if you're looking for well-reasoned arguments about Islam as a world religion, you will not find them. Instead, there are anecdotal references regarding the effect that the community of believers had on him, and in fact it is probably not overstating it to say that it was the experience of living with Muslims in a Muslim community, and coming to appreciate the world outlook of that community, that influenced him the most and led him to accept Islam.And it is precisely this understanding and interpretation of Islam in terms of the community of believers that makes this an important book - maybe more important than it was when it was originally written. It is true that the era of Western presence as a governing power in the Middle East is long over. But the point is that for well over a century, the West cared not at all about local interests in the Middle East. Not only did we arrogate to ourselves the right to rule these areas, but wittingly or not we did, and still do, tear apart the fabric of these societies by our presence and values - and the Islamic people of the Middle East resent this tremendously. I know of no other book that manages to bring a sense of this so forcefully.Mr. Assad brings up the issue of Zionism in the book, and mentions that he had made the acquaintance of Chaim Weizmann, with whom he did not see eye to eye. Within a few brief paragraphs Assad manages to describe completely and succinctly what is largely still the Arab argument against the existence of Israel, and it would benefit Westerners to become familiar with this argument if they want some understanding of the Arab position beyond the two-dimensional stereotypes found in the more sensational press currently available.Not everything about the book made me happy; I was quite dismayed at Mr. Assad's rather summary dismissal of Shiite Islam as basically an Iranian character flaw, and even more dismayed at his caricature of Iran as a nation of opium addicts. In this case I can only assume that he was reflecting the Wahabi prejudices of his bedouin friends.But these are only scattered clouds in a sunny sky. The value of the book lies in the opportunity it gives us to realize that the Middle East has a long-standing grievance against the West, whether it be England, France, Italy, America or Israel. From the Arab point of view we all look the same, and it is not nearly as easy to determine who the aggresor is than we would like to think."},{"Title":"The Road to Mecca","review":"Books about Islam and Arabia abound. Not surprisingly, most have a Western bias if for no other reason than they view events through Western eyes. Professor Edward Said once advised that to gain an understanding of Islam and Arabia one should read more than Bernard Lewis. He suggested two books: Classical Arab Islam (by Tarif Khalidi) and The Road to Mecca. Perusing the latter, one understands his point.Muhammad Asad was a Polish-Austrian Jew born to an orthodox rabbi in Lwow (then a part of Austro-Hungary) in the summer of 1900 whose spiritual journey led him eventually to leave Judaism and embrace Islam. Though published in 1957, Asad is recounting events from the 1920s and early 1930s. The central thread is a haj to Mecca in 1932 via camel from the northern reaches of Saudi Arabia. He uses flashbacks to give the history of his travels and conversion.His conversion started in adolescence. \\"Under the influence of an agnostic environment, I drifted...into a matter-of-fact rejection of all institutional religion.\\" (61) Seeking adventure he joined the Austrian army toward the end of 1914. He was only 14, but tall. This made it easier to convincingly lie about his age. His father tracked him down, though, so his enlistment didn't last more than a few weeks. Four years later he was drafted into the army, \\"but by then was searching for other avenues to self-fulfillment.\\" His draft enlistment was only a little longer than his previous one for soon Austria-Hungary was out of the war.After attending a university for a time, he gave up his studies to pursue journalism. It wasn't the profession that drew him, per se, but rather wanderlust leavened with spiritual restlessness. This led him to the Middle East in 1922 where his growing rejection of Western materialistic egocentrism found root in Islamic values that revolve around the brotherhood of man and individual self-discipline.Throughout his journey of conversion, as he drifted farther and farther from his familial and cultural roots, he was befriended by an interesting variety of Arabs. This included religious leaders and even the royal Saud family. He took an Arab wife (who bore him a son), lost her to illness, and later married a German woman (and another son) who shared his spiritual longing. His journeys, which have the flavor of Bedouin wanderings, took him throughout the Arab world, through circuits of Afghanistan and Iran that could be a geographic primer for contemporary military operations there, and even a foray into Libya in 1932 to gain intelligence for Crown Prince Saud concerning local resistance to Italian occupation.The book is well written with a sophisticated style. Asad was in love with Arabia and Islam, and it shows in his descriptions of the land, his awakening, and all things Arab in a glowing, propagandistic prose.He starts the book with a description of the West's cultural bias towards Islam, the beginnings of which he attributes to our Greco-Roman heritage. \\"Ever since Greek and Roman times, European thinkers and historians have been prone to contemplate the history of the world from the standpoint and in terms of European history and Western cultural experiences alone. Non-Western civilizations enter the picture only in so far as their existence, or particular movements within them, have or had a direct influence on the destinies of Western man; and thus, in Western eyes, the history of the world and its various cultures amounts in the last resort to little more than an expanded history of the West.\\" (5) These insensitivities are also \\"rooted in impressions that were born during the Crusades.\\" (7) \\"When, in his famous speech at Clermont, in November, 1095, Pope Urban II exhorted the Christians to make war upon the 'wicked race' that held the Holy Land, he enunciated - probably without knowing it himself - the charter of Western civilization.\\" (9). Probably, indeed.This book is part religion, part philosophy, and part cultural exploration. He contrasts Christianity, with its gradual withering of a strong spiritual hold on Western civilization, with Islam and its pervasiveness with Arabian spirituality and life. He recognizes that Arab culture is not as robust as it was centuries ago (e.g., 317), but he offers little explanation. (Ironically, he says, \\"It was not Muslims that had made Islam great; it was Islam that had made the Muslims great.\\" (207)) He also describes the stubbornness of Arabs along with their history of a willingness to resist political repression regardless of the odds. He made particular mention of the people of Baghdad: \\"...a great strength was apparent in these men: the strength of hatred - hatred of the foreign power that denied them their freedom. The people of Baghdad had always been obsessed by longing for freedom as by a demon.\\" (222-223) I'm not sure what that says about Saddam Hussein's hold on them, but it may be apropos of our post-Saddam occupation of Iraq.Beyond being an interesting read, the relevance of this book is the insight it provides into Arab sensibilities today. It shows a history of resistance to outside influences and an underlying sense of outrage at dar al-Harb for its lack of spiritual perfection.Asad was a man before his time. His views - this book - provide the underpinnings of today's ideology of Islamism. \\"Never before, I reflected, have the worlds of Islam and the West come so close to one another as today. This closeness is a struggle, visible and invisible. Under the impact of Western cultural influences, the souls of many Muslim men and women are slowly shriveling.\\" (371) He professed a balance with the West, but the seeds of conflict are clear.Professor Said was correct. This book is definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"The Road to Mecca","review":"As a practicing western muslim, I often approach the popular literature regarding Islam with trepidation, and the fear of what I am about to find in print. The beauty of this book is the connection that I felt with the author, who in spite of his passage many decades ago, echoed the very sentiments I felt during my own Hajj, and my own spiritual journey through life. His beautifully woven eloquence, thought, and understanding create a unique tapestry of visions in this wordsmith's hands. The book is in my opinion valid, touching, and opens a portal to the Hajj for those who are interested in the trip. As the author emphasizes, the Hajj is a microcosm in the journey of life, and reflective of his larger journey toward Islam, as a submission to the religion which he embraced. The book is a study in metaphysics, cultural anthropology, and is simultaneously a fascinating autobiographical reflection by a convert to Islam. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Road to Mecca","review":"Muhammad Asad's \\"The Road to Mecca\\" is unanimously considered to be one of the most important works on contemporary Islam in the past century. It is an enlivening tale of a man's incredible journey for knowledge and serenity. When he converted to Islam from Judaism and adopted Muhammad Asad as his name in 1926, Leopold Weiss was already a respected journalist in Europe. His popular travelogues about his journeys in Arabia gained wide readership through the Franfurter Zeitung, one of the foremost newspapers in Europe at the time.The book starts with the writer narrating his voyage in a Saudi Arabian desert, proceeds to his childhood in Vienna, his struggling days in Frankfurt, to his eye opening experiences in Palestine, Iran, India, and finally coming full circle to Saudi Arabia. The Road to Mecca is commonly perceived as a tale that informs the reader about Asad's conversion to Islam. This is of course the most noticeable theme, but the story is also an important chronicle of the political, social and economic scenarios in Europe, Arabia and Asia at every stage of the book, which is itself spread on a canvas of about five decades. Some of the most insightful accounts of the leading figures of that time, like King Ibn Saud, Kemal Ataturk, Maxim Gorky and Riza Khan are presented with remarkable perceptiveness. The same acumen can be seen in Asad's understanding of the people he met and the lands he saw. Asad handles a wide variety of subjects with rare alacrity and clarity, with Islam, and his journey to it, being the underlying theme at all times.The Road to Mecca is a travelogue, a lesson in history and politics, and a definitive presentation on Islam, all rolled into one. It is an extremely readable book, not only for readers who are interested in knowing more about Islam at this important juncture, but also for those who want to read one of the most clear-sighted illustrations of the first half of the 20th century."},{"Title":"The Road to Mecca","review":"Muhammed Assad was a gifted journalist. This gift makes the reading of his Near East adventures a highly entertaining experience. The son of wealthy Jewish parents, he came to Palestine in the early 1920's, became an Anti-Zionist and fell in love with the Arab world. He returned to Europe after many adventurous journeys, married a woman 14 years older then he was, became a Muslim, and went back East. The story is told through the memories entertained during a camel ride to Mecca in the early 1930's (although written about 20 years later).Asad was a fearless man (he once walked from Haifa to Damscus without a passport, and later dodged bullets while trying to advise the Sanusi rebels in Libya against fascist Italy). He had an enormous talent for languages - he could speak fluent Arabic and Persian, in addition to the European languages and Hebrew.He was immediately attracted to Islam. Even before becoming a Muslim he had nothing but praise for it. According to him, Islam is completely class -less, accommodating spiritual and physical needs perfectly.Asad's criticism of the Western value system seems relevant today at least as it was then. We might not share his conclusion and choose Islam, but we cant deny that there is something wrong in the Western way of life.The book DOES NOT include Asad's Indian and Pakistanian years. I do not know what book this information is from, and I would really want to get it, as I heard Asad WAS one of the people behind the estblishment of Pakistan.I recommand this truly extraordinary and enlightening book to everyone interested in what is really going on in the world."},{"Title":"The Road to Mecca","review":"This book is a must for anyone seeking an objective understanding, not only of the Middle East and Islam, but also of Western Civilisation. Though chronicled at the turn of the 20th Century, his experiences and views are as valid and alive today, as they were then. Asad (born Leopold Weiss, an Austrian Jew) not only describes a personal journey of spiritual discovery, but at the same time, raises serious concerns about the destructive rush of western civilisation towards a dehumanising materialiasm, and; the Muslim world of forsaking the proven, eternal and rational values of the Divine Islamic truths for a servile and decadent aping of the West."},{"Title":"The Road to Mecca","review":"I had The Road to Mecca in my bookcase for more than a year before I finally opened it; and I have never stopped reading and rereading since.It's not a usual theoretical book on religion; instead it is a travelogue, a journey of a mind, a cultural awareness of a people and a nation, and a rare insight and understanding into faith, psychology, development sociology, and world affairs.Muhammad Asad starts off with a journey towards Makkah, spiritual home of Muslims, and through the trip we travel back and forth in his mind and through his conversations and communications with people, about his past; his journey from a young Austrian journalist into a Muslim. We move through Arab lands, meet people, explore ways of life and philosophies, understand history, and most of all, gain a rare insight into Islam and what it means. Asad shows us all aspects of life in those lands; through bazaars to palaces, along risky journeys and enthralling adventures, meeting Kings and bandits. His understanding is rare and gifted and the socio-political-religious world has not been explained better elsewhere.For Muslims and non Muslims alike, it is a must read, capturing but not imposing, exploring and understanding."},{"Title":"The Road to Mecca","review":"M. Asad has written a truly inspiring work with \\"The Road to Mecca\\". As a foreign journalist in the Middle East, he was in a unique position to truly experience the culture and religion of the area and express his experiences in a way in which only a journalist could. What caught my eye was what happened when he returned to Europe where he suddenly felt like an outsider who was surrounded by people simply sleepwalking through their lives. It was after this revelation that he truly grasped the draw that so many feel towards Islam awakening within himself. As a muslim convert myself, I felt that this was something that I could closely relate to. Nonetheless, I believe that M. Asad's novel was not only inspiring but also a useful, insightful resource into understanding the countries and cultures of the Middle East; something which is useful to muslims & non-muslims alike. I would highly recommend this book to all."},{"Title":"The Road to Mecca","review":"Muhammad Asad has lucidly detailed his travels in the heart of the muslim world where he discovers true happiness in reverting to Islam. A truly amazing book of someone who has been guided to the path of God and remanied loyal thereafter. Even his austrian wife was blessed with faith and performed the Haj with him. It is not easy to become a muslim, much more difficult to chronicle a journey of piety. Excellant prose. A must for everybody."},{"Title":"The Road to Mecca","review":"Mr. Asad book is very will written.

An interesting journey. Worth a read."},{"Title":"The Road to Mecca","review":"The book is review of discovery of religion,Islam, and Arabs by Mr. Mohammad Asad.He belonged to people between the two great wars who were confused as to the future of mankind.Man had completely separated religion and daily life at the expense of loss of spiritual peace.The separation of body and spirit lead to clash of various ideas(communism,Fascicism,socialism,capitalism) and world war 2 and the cold war.The author has come up with the discovery,waitng to be identified,that all men are ONE COMMUNITY.The greed for improving standard of living at the expense of poor people and nations will keep us eternally unhappy.Judaism is like it is God for one race and thus narrow in outlook.Christianity,as practiced NOT as preached by Prophet Jesus,has lead to renunciation and formal rituals.While Islam caters for both soul and materialistic requirements within set parameters;The golden mean of Plato.Thw wars in middle east,europe,south asia are based on greed for power and self greatness."},{"Title":"The Road to Mecca","review":"Muhammad Asad tells us the story of his love affair with the Arabs and their world, a love affair which led to his conversion to Islam between the two world wars. The former Weiss of Austria recounts his journey as a dissatisfied journalist to Cairo, Jerusalem and Damascus, in between a picturesque narrative present of his ramblings by foot and camel between Iraq and Mecca, in the company of his kinsman-by-marriage from a local tribe. We get a vivid picture of these eloquent and hospitable people during the era of their escape from Turkish, then European imperialism, while traditional forms of life and belief were still largely untainted and unimpeached by cosmopolitanism.Unfortunately, Mr. Asad never makes clear why Islam was the solution to what he claims was the West's materialism and rootlessness. The very low conversion rate to Islam among Westerners, coupled with the chaos, violence and degradation characteristic of Muslim countries, whether they claim to be \\"Islamic\\" or not, suggests that submitting to Islam was a confirmation of his own emotional affinity for Muslim culture, rather than a rational choice that we also should make. And in fact, books about conversions rarely truly explain the author's thoughts and actions. How many of us who have been struck by the beauty of C.S. Lewis \\"Surprised by Joy\\" can paraphrase Lewis's reasons for his \\"conversion\\" (which was not one at all in Asad's sense). So frequently the author confuses his autobiography with an explanation for his conversion. But these books do frequently make good reading, and this one is not an exception. Unfortunately, the culture that Mr. Asad found so attractive has been transformed by oil, urbanization, \\"globalism\\", political ideologies, and the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Those who need more evidence of what Asad found so attractive in this region may want to read Thesiger's \\"Arabian Sands\\". Those who would like to read a more convincing account of a religious conversion may want to check out Julius Lester's \\"Lovesong : on becoming a Jew\\"."},{"Title":"The Road to Mecca","review":"Muhammad Asad (AS) was obviously a very moral, compassionate and righteous person, and a brilliant exegete and translator of the holy Qur'an, especially considering that he did not learn Arabic till his twenties. Naturally, I am sad that he joined the ranks of those who left the Jewish people for whatever reason. At the same time, I prefer him being a Muslim, influencing many people to righteousness, to being an atheist as so many other assimilated Jews became.Asad did not go right from Judaism to the Islam but spent about ten years in the desert of agnosticism aloof from religion. He dropped out after his bar mitzvah at age 13. His impression of Judaism was that some of it was OK, but he disliked all the ritual that was forced on him by his father, who didn't do any of it himself.This attitude is familiar to me. After my bar mitzvah I too spent nearly 20 years in the same desert. Both of us learned Judaism as children, rather than as mature adults. What is taught to children is considered kid stuff and is not often taken seriously. What remains of childhood education, cut off, is merely a childlike view of the subject. That is why Jews who get through Jewish high school have much lower assimilation rates than those who quit when Asad and I did. I thank God that my path was different and that my love of both God and Judaism has deepened.Background FactorsWhile Asad studied the Torah and Talmud in the Hebrew and Aramaic, several things, IMHO, prevented him from taking to it. First his parents were secular, his father having similarly revolted from Asad's rabbi grandfather's wish for him to become a rabbi; wanting to become a scientist but and ending up a barrister.Second, Asad apparently did not have very many Jewish friends because his Jewish knowledge was acquired from a private tutor in his home, rather than in Hebrew school. Nor is there any mention in his book of his participation in a religious community. While he probably had a bar mitzvah in a synagogue, there is no indication that he attended religious services or prayed regularly.Third, while familiar with the language, literature, and rituals of Judaism, he evidently lacked a comprehension of overarching Jewish philosophy. His stated objections to Judaism, in the book and in his Qur'an commentary, are somewhat naive, revealing a superficial knowledge of the religion but not a philosophic one. He had a view of Judaism typical of that of a thirteen-year old after a first reading.Fourth, while he does not refer to this, he lived during the tail end of the Emancipation and the Enlightenment, when Jews were leaving the ghettos, being exposed to secular wisdom, such as it is, turning away from religion, and assimilating in large numbers. At the tail end of the enlightenment, many believed in liberty equality and fraternity, as did Voltaire. Religions were considered oppressive, divisive and useless. Asad talks of the \\"free love\\" characteristic of the age; something he participated in although with misgivings. The Enlightenment attitude probably facilitated Asad's anti-Zionism. The Nineteenth century saw the highest number of European Jewish conversions to Christianity since the forced conversions of the Inquisition; over 250,000 it is estimated. Asad considered becoming a Catholic but decided against it because of its dichotomy between body and soul (something not present in Judaism and Islam). He did not yet know of Islam.Fifth, closely related to the previous reason, he lived during a time of great antisemitism, notwithstanding the Emancipation. In Polna, Czechoslovakia during 1899, a year before Asad's birth as Leopold Weiss, a Jewish shoemaker, Leopold Hilsner, and the entire Jewish community of Polna were accused of ritual murder. Pograms and a flood of antisemitic propaganda ensued throughout the country. Two years earlier, a pogrom raged in Prague for three days. Mobs systematically looted Jewish-owned shops and businesses, ransacked synagogues, and assaulted or murdered anyone who seemed to be Jewish. As a young adult, Asad had great difficulties obtaining a job. He doesn't say, but it highly likely that antisemitism had a role as it did for so many.Sixth, perhaps following his father's lead, he had a rebellious nature. He ran away from home to join the army at the age of 14, but was located and returned home fairly soon. At the age of 20, he ran away a second time; this time for good. Symbolically, he was leaving his religion as well as his family, though he had not yet found a replacement. These are years when even a normal son is spreading his wings. I recall, at that age, reading William O. Douglas' \\"Strange Lands and Friendly People,\\" and being fascinated with exotic milieus. I would have joined the Peace Corp., had it existed at that time; and I did not run away or have to face any of the other problems that Asad faced. My own son was similarly fascinated with exotic people and foods during his late teens and early twenties. I used to kid him that he ate every kind of food except Jewish food.Critique of Asad's View of JudaismAs I wrote recently, Asad, in his early teens, \\"developed a supercilious feeling toward many of the premises of the Jewish faith.\\" What he says is, \\"I did not disagree with the teaching of moral righteousness so strongly emphasized throughout the Jewish scriptures, nor with the sublime God-consciousness of the Hebrew prophets -- but it seemed to me that the God of the Old Testament (sic) and the Talmud was unduly concerned with the ritual by means of which His worshippers were supposed to worship Him. It also ocurred to me that this God was strangely preoccupied with the destinies of one particular nation, the Hebrews. The very buildup of the Old Testament as a history of the descendents of Abraham tended to make God appear not as the creator and sustainer of all mankind but, rather, as a tribal deity adjusting all creation to the requirements of a \`chosen people:' rewarding them with conquests if they were righteous, making them suffer at the hands of nonbelievers whenever they strayed form the prescribed path. Viewed against these fundamental shortcomings, even the ethical fervor of the later prophets, like Isaiah and Jeremiah, seemed to be barren of a universal message... (Pgs. 60-61)\\"Let us consider this criticism in the order given above; not necessarily in order of importance. Asad's first complaint was that Judaism was unduly concerned with ritual. If he were a subscriber to B'nai Avraham I would love to have asked him how he reconciles this criticism with the fact that, whereas Jews pray thrice daily, Muslims have five sessions. Whereas Jews fast on Yom Kippur, and four other nonconsecutive days, Muslims fast for a full month. Whereas Jews bend the knee and bow occasionally during prayer, Muslims kneel and touch the floor with their heads. I know very little about Muslim ritual but feel it safe to assume that undue Jewish preoccupation with ritual was not a strong determinant of Asad's conversion. When seeing similar rituals practiced in a Mosque, he marvelled at the Muslim integration of body and soul.\\"It also ocurred to me that this God was strangely preoccupied with the destinies of one particular nation, the Hebrews. The very buildup of the Old Testament as a history of the descendents of Abraham tended to make God appear not as the creator and sustainer of all mankind but, rather, as a tribal deity adjusting all creation to the requirements of a \`chosen people:' rewarding them with conquests if they were righteous, making them suffer at the hands of nonbelievers whenever they strayed form the prescribed path.\\"IMHO this is the heart of the matter! Breaking down the criticism of the Jewish Bible, \\"the previous revelation\\", it involves two charges:1. God is a tribal deity of Jews alone, not Creator and Sustainer of all mankind. The bible considers Jews as a \\"chosen people.\\"2. The Sustainer rewards Jews with conquests (presumably unfair to the conquered) if they are righteous, and makes them suffer at the hands of nonbelievers when they stray. The main criticism here is not so much the principle of reward and punishment, but rather rewarding with conquests.Asad is not the first to state these criticisms, and it is easy to obtain such impressions following a cursory reading of the Tanakh. It does frequently refer to God as the God of Israel, and Jews as a chosen people. Also, the Bible does describe displacement of indigenous nations by Israel. However, a deeper study shows Asad's view to be sufficiently wrong so as to be considered false for all intents and purposes.When Asad began studying Islam he was comparing it unfavorably not with Judaism, but with Christianity. \\"Nowhere in the Koran could I find any reference to a need for \\"salvation.\\" No original inherited sin stood between the individual and his destiny -- for. \\"nothing shall be attributed to man but what he himself has striven for. No asceticism was required to open a hidden gate to purity: for purity was man's birthright, and sin meant no more than a lapse from the innate, positive qualities with which God is said to have endowed every human being. There was no trace of dualism in the consideration of man's nature: body and soul seemed to have been taken as one integral whole. (Pg. 138)\\"The above concepts are straight out of Judaism. Asad is, of course, writing this in his 50s and probably did not realize that he was talking equally about Judaism because he had only his childish stereotypes to rely on. When he wrote, further, that \\"no aspect of [man's] life could be too \`trivial' to come within the purview of religion,' he could have been quoting Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch, the 19th century great German rabbi, on Judaism but he evidently did not know this either. So he concluded, falsely IMHO, that \\"[Islam's] approach to the problems of the spirit seemed to be deeper than that of the Old Testament... (ibid.)\\" He then added, \\"... moreover, [Islam] had none of the [Tanakh's] predilictions for one particular nation.\\"Asad has plenty of evidence, if he choses to focus on it, for the charge that the Tanakh treats God as a tribal God of Israel. However, he neglected the very substantial evidence of Judaism's conviction that God is THE universal God of all mankind. This evidence is stated in every benediction; Observant Jews make at least 100 such benedictions daily. Each begins, \\"Blessed are You The Lord our God, King of the universe, Who...\\" Would we say this 100 times each day if we considered God as our tribal God? More likely the prayer would have read, \\"Blessed are You The Lord, God of Israel...\\"A few weeks ago I submitted a message on the universality of Judaism and I will resubmit it again, following this one, so that new subscribers can judge for themselves on whether the God of Israel, and Judaism, care about non-Jews. For now, it is sufficient to note that Asad's criticism of Judaism's choseness could be equally applied to Islam because of its self-identification with the chosen one; Abraham (AS).Why did God chose Israel? Why did God chose Abraham? Who can say to God, \\"What are You doing?\\" Why did God inflict a flood on the world and chose only Noah and his family to be saved? Why did God allow the righteous Job to be persecuted by Satan? Noah and Job were not Israelites.Who are the villans of Job? His \\"friends\\" who purport to know why Job has suffered, and continue to tell him that God would not have punished him unless there was a good reason for it!How did God answered Job following Job's repeated pleas for a response as to why all the calamities happened to him? God's first words are to criticize the \\"analysts,\\" Job's friends:\\"Who is this that darkens counsel, speaking without knowledge? (Job 38:1)\\"Then He responds to Job, giving him the \\"reasons,\\" of which the following are only excerpts (from Ch. 38-42): \\"Where were you when I laid the earth's foundations? Speak if you understand. Do you know who fixed its dimensions? Who closed the sea behind doors when it gushed forth out of the womb, when I clothed it in clouds ... and said, 'You may come so far and no farther; here your surging waves will stop?'\\"Have you ever commanded the day to break, assigned the dawn to its place? Have the gates of death been disclosed to you? Have you surveyed the expanses of the earth? If you know of these, tell Me.\\"Can you tie cords to Pleides or undo the reigns of Orion? ...Do you know the laws of heaven or impose its authority on earth? Can you send up an order to the clouds for an abundance of water to cover you? Can you dispatch the lightning on a mission and have it answer you, 'I am ready?' Can you hunt prey for the lion, and satisfy the appetite of the king of beasts? ... Do you know the season when the mountain goat gives birth? Can you mark the time when the hinds calve? Can you count the months they must complete? Do you know the season they give birth ... ?

Whoever confronts Me I will requite, for everything under the heavens is Mine.\\"Gird your loins like a warrior;I will ask and you answer Me.Would you declare Me wrongIn order to make yourself right?\\"Job then answered The Lord, and said:\`I knew that You can do everything,And that nothing can impede [Your] purpose...Who is it that would deny [Your] counsel without knowledge?Therefore I declared,Yet I understand nothing.It is beyond me. I shall not know!Therefore I renounce [my words] and relent,for I am but dust and ashes.'\\"Then God gets back to Job's friends who pretend to know why he was punished. \\"My anger burns against [you], for you have not spoken the truth about Me as My servant Job did. And let Job, My servant, pray for you; for his sake I will show consideration, and not treat you vilely, since you have not spoken the truth about Me as did My servant, Job.\\"Or, to quote the Qur'an, \\"Who could be more wicked than they who attribute their own lying inventions to God? (Surah 11:18)\\"Asad complained about Israel's being rewarded when righteous, and being punished when not. But doesn't the Qur'an confirm this view of the way God acts?\\"And [on that day] you will see all people kneeling down [in humility]: all people will be called on to [face] their record: \`Today you shall be requited for all that you ever did! ... Now as for those who have attained to faith and done righteous deeds, their Sustainer will admit them to His grace; ... But as for those who are bent on denying the truth ... they will be overwhelmed by the very thing which they were wont to deride. (Surah 45:28-33)\\"\\"Thus, indeed did We destroy people like you [in the past]... [Hence, too,] behold, the God-conscious will find themselves in [a paradise of] gardens and running waters, in a seat of truth, in the presence of a Sovereign who determines all things.... (Surah 54:51-55)\\"True; there are many references in the Tanakh to the God of Israel. Judaism has both universalist and particularist aspects; but for sound historic, logical reasons. Sticking to the universal, for the moment, if the Tanakh was a strictly Jewish document why did it begin with the creation of a single couple? The Talmud replies, \\"So no one can say, \`My ancestors were better than yours.'\\" We consider the Tanakh to be not merely Jewish history, but the foundation of man's purpose. The first commandment to the nation Israel is not given till Exodus 12:2, the commandment of the new moon. The sages reasoned that the purpose of the earlier narrative is to establish that God is the King of the universe, the Sustainer of all mankind. \\"The earth is The Lord's; and all its fullness.(Ps. 24:1)\\"When Asad states, as he argued to Chaim Weizmann around 1921, \\"Long before [the Hebrews] there were many other Semitic and non-Semitic tribes [that] settled [in Palestine] -- the Amorites, the Edomites, the Philistines, the Moabites, the Hittites,\\" he is consciously contradicting the thrust of the \\"earlier revelation.\\" Asad must have been familiar with the negative view that the Tanakh has of these nations, and has rejected it out of hand, without considering the reasons.Did Asad also feel this way about Sodom and Gomorrah? When God wanted to destroy these evil cities, Abraham pleaded with Him, as Asad might: \\"Shall the Judge of all the earth not act justly? (Gen. 18:25)\\" God told Abraham that if there were ten righteous people in those cities He would not destroy them. Asad should have known that this is the paradigm of God's punishment of a city; ten men make a community, as well as a quorum for public prayer. Why would God change the rules for the peoples Asad listed?\\"God is not man to be capricious, or mortal to change His mind. (Num. 23:19)\\"\\"My plans are not your plans; nor are My ways your ways. (Isaiah 55:8)\\"\\"Yours, The Lord, is the greatness, the strength, the splendor, the triumph and the glory, even everything in heaven and on earth. Yours, The Lord, is the kingdom and the sovereignty over every leader. Wealth and honor come from You and You rule everything -- in Your hand is the power to make anyone great or strong. So now, God, we thank You and praise Your splendrous Name. (1 Chron. 29:11-13)\\"\\"You alone are The Lord; You made the heavens, the most exalted heavens and all their legion, the earth and all that is upon it, the seas and all that is in them, and You gave them all life; and the heavenly legion bows to You. You are The Lord the God, You selected Abram and brought him out of Ur of the Chaldes, and changed his name to Abraham. You found his heart faithful before You, and You sealed the covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite and the Perizzite and the Jebusite and the Girgashite -- to give to his offspring; and You affirmed Your word, for You are righteous. (Nehemiah 9:6-8)\\"It is interesting that Ruth was a Moabite (Ruth 1:4). The Bible says, \\"An Ammonite or Moabite shall not enter the congregation of The Lord; even their tenth generation... (Deut. 23:4)\\" Yet Ruth not only did enter the congregation of The Lord but her great-grandson was none other than King David (Ruth 4:13-22), and her great-great grandson, King Solomon, from whom the Messiah will descend (2 Sam. 7:12-16). Micah 5:1 referred to this irony: \\"Bethlehem -- Ephratah -- you are least among the clans of Judah, but from you one will emerge to be a ruler of Israel for Me; and his origins shall be from early times, from days of old.\\" Ephratah is another name for Bethlehem of Judah (Gen. 48:7). These verses are used by Christian missionaries as a proof text for Jesus, though they, of course, refer to David).The irony is resolved by the fact that the tribe of a person is that of his father's line (Num. 1:2, 18), so that Deut. 23:4 was not violated. Ruth, the Moabite, entered the tribe of Judah and her son, Oved, was not a Moabite but a Judaite.The Bible also says, \\"You shall not abhor an Edomite for he is your brother... Children who are born to them in the third generation may enter the congregation of The Lord. (Deut. 23:8-9)\\" (Edom is descended from Esau, Jacob's brother, who settled in Edom -- Gen. 32:4). According to the sages, the prophet, Obadiah, was a proselyte from Edom.Why did Asad and the Qur'an accept what God did to the people of Noah's generation, and to Sodom and Gomorrah; but Asad did not accept what God caused to happen to the nations he discussed with Weizmann?In conclusion, I am of the humble opinion that Muhammad Asad, great man that he was, moved to the Middle East and converted to Islam not completely for objective reasons. In many respects he was the quintissential self-hating Jew or non-Jewish Jew, one who shed his prior identity -- right down to his style of dress -- before he knew anything at all about Islam; yet who was able to successfully transfer his core Jewish values to the very similar religion of Islam. Peace be upon him."},{"Title":"Adaptation","review":"I first saw this piece done in a community theatre workshop and loved it.

Also liked the emphasis on clear communication with the client and common pitfalls. The discussion of color in chapter 8 was particularly well done with clear examples printed in full-color.Weaknesses: Reliance on SVG.Although I am an avid supporter of SVG, I found that this book's reliance on the technology and excessive printing of code to be distracting. I counted 75 pages of verbose SVG code and 25 pages of general XML/XSLT/ASP/HTML code printed in a 350 page book. Also, although well suited for bridging the technical-aesthetic gap, SVG still lacks widespread browser support, and no web developer worth his salt would actually build a professional website in SVG today, a point which the authors should have acknowledged more clearly. However, the XML/XSLT/XHTML/ASP examples used later in the book effectively illustrate how these emerging technologies can be combined into a single project.Summary:As someone with experience in web technology and design, I found several minor flaws in the technical assertions made in the book (browser compatibility), but enjoyed the non-technical design / interface portions which, to be fair, was the focus of this book."},{"Title":"Design Concepts with Code: An Approach for Developers","review":"One of the books I recently finished reading for review was Design Concepts With Code: An Approach For Developers by Kelly Carey and Stanko Blatnik (Apress). While this book might appeal to some niche of website design and development, I don't think I'm part of that group.The chapter breakdown: Introducing Interface Design; Introducing Design Principles; Project 1: Building an Open Source Portal; Implementing Design Elements: Line, Type, and Shape; Implementing Design Elements: Texture, Space, Size, Value, and Layout; Project 2: Building an Online Resource Center; Working with Content and Typography; Using Color; Project 3: Building a Webzine; Exploring Site Issues and Accessibility; IndexThis is a different book that is hard for me to describe. There are a number of abstract sketches in boxes that are about 1&quot; x 1&quot;. The reader is asked how they would interpret the lines and they are given three choices. They are then told which answer is correct as far as the attitude and mood that is suggested by the design. Each sketch is followed by Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) code to show how that sketch is coded. After a number of these exercises, the concepts are used to show a design of a web page or site that incorporates that type of design to create the proper sense and feeling.If you're a graphic designer of web sites, you would probably get something from this book. A developer (or at least *this* developer) would have a much harder time getting past the &quot;here's a picture and here's the right answer as to what it should mean to you&quot; style. Outside of that, the incessant use of showing each sketch's SVG code seems to be nothing more than a space filler. I would have much rather seen something like this be downloadable from a website and to skip the endless code listings. I guess I misread the title Design Concepts With Code. I was thinking the book would cover how your code can show design concepts, not to show design concepts with code printed for each picture.I won't say it's a bad book... It's just got a few flaws I would have done differently, and it definitely isn't a book that will appeal to everyone."},{"Title":"Design Concepts with Code: An Approach for Developers","review":"I don't know who the authors thought the target audience for this book is, it's defenetively not me.

File on the Tsar, is an extremelly well researched investiagtion into an alternative theory about the fate of the Romanovs.Many people dismiss this book because it does not hold that the family was massacred at Ekaterinburg. The fact is that contrary to popular belief the massacre is still a theory, it has not been proven as fact, and the File on the Tsar provides informative generally unknown information on how some of the evidence for a massacre was fabricated.WARNING SPOILERSpoiler; For instance when the massacre theory was first being investigated shortly after the Romanovs disapeared, it was claimed that they were shot in the dinning room, not the basement.Secondly three seperate investigations were conducted, the last investigation is the only one that ever saw light, primarily because it was the most shocking. Early investigators did not find nearly as many bullet holes, bayonet holes, ect . . . as later ones.SPOILERS END HEREEven the discovery of bodies does not prove that the alternative theory in File on the Tsar is untrue. The Imperial grave was opened more then once after the family was believed to have been shot and buried, and the remains could have been disturbed.In short File on the Tsar simply provides comprehensive information, and an alternative theory as to the familys fate, whats more it also could explain the absence of two bodies from the Imperial grve site. The massacre theory does not.Is it somewhat dated? Yes. Unproven by modern science and DNA? No.All scientific and fernsic evidence can equally be used to support the File on the Tsar's theory, as it can the massacre.I recomend if nothing else, that even if you disagree, that you read it."},{"Title":"THE FILE ON THE TSAR.","review":"Many people have criticized this book because it can be labled as a \\"conspiracy theory.\\" However, it is remarkably well-researched and has some valuble info, such as the fact that Anastasia and Alexey couldn't possibly have been burned to ashes within one night out in the open. The authors can be forgiven, as it is an attempt to explain the fate of the Romanovs before the definitive DNA analysis concluded that at least 9 of the inhabitants of the Ipatiev house were brutally murdered. Also, it was written before Yurovsky's testimony came to light. I don't think it merits Henry Kissinger's \\"crap\\" statement about it. It is outdated, but its authors nevertheless command respect from historians. It was right about one thing - that the Sokolov investigation was fixed and Medvedev's testimony is unreliable, as Yurovsky's \\"confession\\" demonstrates.

The Russians are desperate to close the case and are still fabricating evidence just like they did in 1918, 1919, etc.Read this book (the updated 2002 edition) and you will understand the enormity of the Biggest Con in History."},{"Title":"THE FILE ON THE TSAR.","review":"Despite the many years that have passed since the first publication, Summers and Mangold provide many clues to what really happened to the Imperial Family of Russia. They were not massacred...they just dissapeared and lived under fake names in different parts of Europe, USA and Japan. I recoment the readers to get that latest edition (2002)since there have been several, (including one in Spanish). Still in 2011 the Russian Orthodox Church and the Head of the Romanov Family don't accept the remains that appeared in 1979 as those of the Romanovs. That just supports some of the theories in this book that the family was evacuated and that Anna Anderson was indeed Grand Duchess Anastasia of Russia."},{"Title":"THE FILE ON THE TSAR.","review":"THE FILE ON THE TSAR (2002 edition) by Anthony Summers and Tom Mangold is quite the little book. It is a good, clean and scholarly work dedicated to studying the horrid tale of the execution of the last Czar of Russia and his family. In fact, it endeavors to examine the possibility that at least the Czarina and the children escaped the slaughter that has been peddled more or less successfully to the public for so long.This book carefully dissects various documents and even letters and diaries, piecing together a compelling story about how not only Germany but also England may have planned - even attempted to execute - rescue plans for the Romanov Imperial Family. Did they fail? Is it possible at least part of someone's plan came to fruition?The authors do a terrific job piecing this story together - they even address Anna Manahan, who was alleged to be the Grand Duchess Anastasia. Note that only the 2002 edition of this book contains a postscript with some deeply moving facts about the DNA testing on the alleged Romanov remains from the Koptyaki Forest. Some scientists don't agree that the testing was properly done. A few don't believe those remains belong to the Romanovs.Interesting chapters include one on various claimants who have surfaced, and the very next chapter is about Anna. These authors do not argue a case for her or against her - but they find so many inconsistencies with the accepted DNA findings and Anna's life story that they wonder aloud whether or not she was Anastasia. But that is only one chapter.This book will thrill you with true stories of intrigues, duplicity that can never be pinned down to the responsible parties, Bolshevik and imperialist propaganda and lies, the whole ugly tamale that gave us a fascinating propaganda pastiche that we continue to accept without a word of wonder. The authors researched this book to perfection, and I am especially appreciative of the notes and bibliography. It is that scholarship that moved the authors to wonder why the public simply accepts everything Russia tells us.The food for thought here has not been changed by any DNA findings. As I said, the book traces a chain of facts that will lead you to wonder about DNA and its validity in this case. For me, the DNA has proved conclusive, I have been forced to that viewpoint - yet this book still intrigues and compels me. Good for the authors, when their book can move a science-minded believer in DNA (I wasn't always, you might be or you might be against it) to wonder about its integrity relative to a particular case.There is no way an interested reader can claim a working knowledge of any of these subjects without having read THE FILE ON THE TSAR - and be certain to get the 2002 edition."},{"Title":"THE FILE ON THE TSAR.","review":"Anthony Summers and Tom Mangfold did something extrordinary when they discovered Sokolov's original file on the Tsar. They discovered he had withheld evidence to what he found on the Tsar's murder. The book pretty much dispells of the Sokolov investigation and its faults and is way ahead of its time in that sense. But of course the second half of the book has lost most of its validity since the bodies have been located. But it is interesting how many people claimed to have seen the Empress and her daughters alive and being used by Lenin as pawns. It's a perfect story for those in Russia who still believe that the Romanov bones are not authentic. I think they are though. The part of the book which discusses Anna Anderson is very interesting as well, and makes you wonder how this woman could have truly been a Polish factory girl."},{"Title":"THE FILE ON THE TSAR.","review":"Sadly, with the advent of DNA and the fall of the iron curtain there is less and less mystery in history.This book is a fine example of the fog and questions which surronunded the death (or disappereance) of the russian imperial family. However, as time has moved along, we now know that most of the ideas the authors suggest never occured.That said I liked the book and felt that it gave a good treatmeant of the context within which the last Tsar and his family met their tragic end.

He presents multiple points of view bantered by experts in this subject matter, and this debate enlivens the discussion. He firmly roots the research by drawing upon imaginary but real-sounding folk tales and legends, made more real by invoking actual historical figures.

Some consider it hilarious, others a mere spoof, but certainly it is more than that, for Mr. Lionni expended considerable effort and time to document this imaginary segment of the plant kingdom. The fact that a major publisher issued the book in hardback suggests someone thought highly of this idea.I take away a sense of astonishment at the amount of detail invoked to underscore the verisimilitude of the premise, and see this book as a wry jab at the reductionistic tendencies of a scientific method that seems at times to value cataloging over understanding our world.(I also once had a vision many years ago that may have come from whatever source Mr. Lionni tapped for Parallel Botany, a vision of an asylum that housed crazed and dangerous plants that I rendered in an oil painting a friend of mine smuggled into the art gallery in the Saturn Bar down in New Orleans.)"},{"Title":"Parallel botany","review":"Leo Lionni created a baffling, even maddening, encyclopedic compendium that describes, illustrates, arrays, and summarizes a host of imaginary plants---his parallel botany.

The authors of this volume describe their reconstruction of such a ship, which they named the OLYMPIAS. They used the ancient shell-first method of ship construction. Planks were fastened edge-to-edge by tenons.This method is superior to the more recent plank-on-frame method of wooden shipbuilding. Coates comments: \\"By that method, common in Europe for about the last thousand years, planks forming the skin of a ship are not positively and directly fastened to each other, but only via the frames. Only the caulking rammed between the planks prevents them from sliding on each other, like the leaves of a carriage spring, when the hull is subjected to longitudinal bending and to shear forces. Framed construction is heavier, cheaper, easier to repair, but inherently weaker and structurally less elegant than the shell construction of the ancient Mediterranean.

It is much better as part of a very entertaining series. Most of Griffin's magic comes from his character building, and it takes time to get into the lives of the wonderful characters he creates. This book is also leaving a very large stepping stone into the next book, so I can't wait to read that one. Griffin opens the door with a glimpse into the world of cop corruption.

Whether or not you care for the spiritual aspects of the Jesuits, their extraordinary success from the earliest days and the principles which drove them apply directly to the modern day enterprise and offer lessons that counter many current management techniques. After all, a group that taught its members to be flexible in the face of rapid change, to set ambitious goals, to think globally, and to take risks seems to have had in mind the challenges facing many managers today -- yet those modes of thinking were developed more than 450 years ago. Not author's thunder, but any 10-person start-up with no experience in education which had 30 colleges up and running in a decade -- without modern day communications or transportation -- and then surpassed its competitors to become the largest of its kind, 450 years later boasting 21,000 professionals -- bears taking a look at in an era of 3 year wonders. How did they do it? Read the book."},{"Title":"Heroic Leadership: Best Practices from a 450-Year-Old Company That Changed the World","review":"Leaders need followers, right? This engagingly written book warns us that it is precisely this kind of thinking that has produced the vacuum of leadership that has recently rocked corporate America. Lowney finds a profoundly different way to think about leadership in the early history of the Jesuits. Through fascinating stories about Jesuit astronomers, linguists, explorers, and high school teachers, he illuminates a kind of leadership in which \\"everyone leads, and everyone is leading all the time,\\" and in which leadership consists of unlocking the leadership potential in others. Certainly this is a book for \\"professional\\" leaders, like corporate managers. However, it is equally, if not more, a book for those of us whose leadership will always occur in less conspicuous venues."},{"Title":"Heroic Leadership: Best Practices from a 450-Year-Old Company That Changed the World","review":"Jesuit high school and college. But then again I think just about every Jesuit school graduate would say the same thing.Ten men, no money, no business plan and within ten years they had thirty schools established and running.And not only has the Jesuit order survived for over four hundred years (after its abolition by the Pope everywhere but in Russia), but it has thrived. There is simply no comparable for-profit corporation with that same history of longevity and success.Igantius Loyola set out some clear policies that survive and work to this day.Almost thirty years out from high school graduation I value my Jesuit education more than ever. What I've found is that the ability to reason, calculate, write and think is much more rare than I previously thought. To this I have the Society of Jesus to thank. I really can't imagine my life without my Jesuit education.The Jesuit high school course of study is essentially the same for my son's class of 2007 as it was for my class of 1975. But it should be noted that the Jesuits have adapted and requirements in Greek and Latin are no longer there. The key here is some foreign language is essential for a high school student.Money can come and go but education lasts and that can't be taken away from you.There were lots of things I didn't know about the Jesuits that I learned in this book. Looking back I can see where these principles were applied. Things such as \\"only the best teachers.\\"There is a definite Jesuit \\"way we do things\\" which is consistent at all Jesuit schools.The references to \\"The Spiritual Exercises\\" were helpful and enlightening.Some of the historical discussion about Paraguay, China and India was either unclear or slightly too long. Jim Rogers of \\"Adventure Capitalist\\" said it best about Paraguay. He described how the Jesuits had created a civilization there in the jungle and once the Jesuits were kicked out of the country,it relapsed and hasn't been the same since.The readership for this book isn't limited to Jesuit school alumni or even those in business. If you want to lead a better and more productive life look at Lowney's distillation of Loyola's leadership principles, apply them and learn. ..."},{"Title":"Heroic Leadership: Best Practices from a 450-Year-Old Company That Changed the World","review":"Chris Lowney has written a beauty of book bringing into focus leadership principles first implemented 450 years ago when Jesuit founder, St. Ignatius Loyola, established a leadership culture that led to one of the great organizational success stories in history. And along with the lessons on leadership, Lowney's readers also get a great story on several important chapters in world history.Loyola builds on love driven leadership, an approach to leadership based on the notion that everyone has leadership potential, and true leaders unlock that potential in others. The how of unlocking potential is rooted in an orientation to \\"greater love than fear.\\" This notion of leadership fits well with the growing trend of \\"people centered leadership\\" as evidenced by best selling books authored by Pat Lencioni, John Maxwell, and others. This is a welcomed change from former corporate speak where sports figures and a towel snapping, take-no-prisoners model took center stageLowney details Loyola's four pillars of success: self-awareness; ingenuity; love; and, heroism. The first step to leadership is self-leadership which springs from personal beliefs and attitudes. Throughout the book, Lowney highlights Loyola's belief that self-awareness is linked to leadership showing through example how leaders thrive by understanding who they are and what they value, by becoming aware of unhealthy blind spots or weaknesses that can derail them, and by cultivating the habit of continuous self-reflection and learning.Loyola's spiritually based approach to leadership also identifies attachments in life as obstacles to leading. He also underscores how ingenuity disposes people not to just think out of the box but to live outside the box.\\"Heroic Leadership\\" is organized around the following chapters:Of Jesuit's and J.P. MorganWhat Leaders DoThe JesuitsLeadership Role Models\\"To Order One's Life\\"The Spiritual Exercises\\"The Whole World Becomes Our House\\"\\"Refuse No Talent, Nor Any Man of Quality\\"\\"An Uninterrupted Life of Heroic Deeds\\"\\"Exceptional Daring Was Needed\\"\\"The Way We Do Things\\"A strong leader relishes the opportunity to continue learning about self and the world and looks to new discoveries and interests. And real leaders - real heros - find fulfillment, meaning, and, yes, even success by shifting their gaze beyond self-interest and serving others. And they become greater - enhanced as persons - by focusing on something greater than self-interest alone.This is a book that most will use as a reference for years to come."},{"Title":"Heroic Leadership: Best Practices from a 450-Year-Old Company That Changed the World","review":"Truly refreshing. Mr. Lowney blows through cliches about leadership and infuses the subject with life. At the same time, he reclaims from the clutches of bookstore preachers serious discussion about spirituality in daily life.Mr. Lowney begins from the undeniable premise that there is a lack of genuine leaders in our business world and our civic life. He finds in the history of the Jesuits numerous individuals -- who would never be labeled &quot;leaders&quot; by Forbes or Time -- who have exerted tremendous positive influence on the world. Starting with less-than-nothing, the Jesuit &quot;company&quot; quickly became the brand standard for higher education, science and language. It remains a powerful international force. Its impact is the envy of every other &quot;multinational.&quot;Mr. Lowney's argument is that the secret of their success is no secret at all: If you carefully recruit and train leaders at all levels, your organization will flourish. Those leaders must have self-awareness and discipline . . . and love. For it is the honest concern about your brothers and sisters that reflects leadership and elevates the shared enterprise.But like the Jesuits, Mr. Lowney does not settle for platitutes and formulas. His book challenges you to examine your own life. For those of us mid-career, the book is nothing less than a call to renewal and a reminder that Loyola was older than we are now when he started this whole thing. The book extends a warm and positive encouragement to reinvest in yourself so that you can invest in others.Heroic Leadership is the product of deep reading and deeper thinking into its subject. But it is written with a brisk and lively voice that is never preachy. Think instead of that teacher who first got you excited about learning and who gave you a glimpse of what you could become. If &quot;empowering&quot; weren't such an overused term, it would fully apply to this book. So consider the book &quot;refreshing&quot; -- it is bright, different, rejuvenating, bracing, and nourishing."},{"Title":"Heroic Leadership: Best Practices from a 450-Year-Old Company That Changed the World","review":"'Values' have a bad reputation in business given the Enrons, Adelphias and WorldComs of the world. There seems to be a lack of heros in the workplace, much less, leadership. Having had the privilege of not only reading, but listening to a presentation by, Chris Lowney, this book should be added to the booklist of any individual who aspires to supervise, manage or lead effectively and ethically. It should be required reading for MBAs as well as veteran CEOs to remind them about their responsibility to nurture excellent &quot;follwership.&quot; Lowney provides readers with the four pillars of Jesuit values, plus the principles of personal accountability (see opening sentence) and that we all lead no matter where we are in the organization. Great history on the Jesuits, their history, zeal for excellence in education, political acumen, adaptability and ethos. We would all benefit from going forward in our personal and professional lives &quot;with one foot raised.&quot; And, yes, I hold undergraduate and graduate degrees from a Jesuit university."},{"Title":"Heroic Leadership: Best Practices from a 450-Year-Old Company That Changed the World","review":"This is an interesting, informative, insightful and inspiring book. Lowney teased out four strands or principles of leadership (self-awareness, ingenuity, love and heroism) from the heritage of St. Ignatius Loyola and has woven a very impressive tapestry based on the history and lives of outstanding Jesuits. The book is not just for organizational leaders and managers, but suitable for anyone who wants to lead a better and more fruitful life. I wish to thank all the previous reviewers for their excellent comments and summaries.Having been a Jesuit for well over 40 years, I've found the book a timely wake-up call.I have known personally and indirectly so many outstanding Jesuits who have continued the tradition. Yet there is also room for reflection. In contrast to the early boom and the revival after the Suppression of Jesuits (1750-1773), the Society of Jesus has been declining in numbers very steadily from the peak in the early 60s of 36000+ to just below 20,000 last year. Although the decrease in vocations to the religious life is a fairly universal phenomenon, except in some developing countries, it is still worthwhile for the Church, Christian organisations and Jesuits in particular, to look in the mirror of this book.Are we are too set in our patterns or have we got off track at times, lacking in 1) self-awareness, 2) innovation, 3) love, and 4) the passionate and heroic desire for the greater glory of God (In Latin, Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam, Ignatius' motto). (Excuse a digression. St. Iranaeus, whose feast is today, said that the glory of God is the human person fully alive and being alive is the vision of God. One may think of \\"To love one another is to see the face of God.\\" from the musical, Les Miserables,seemingly based on St. John.)The value of The Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius has been much stressed. But sometimes the transforming effect seems to be still limited and not lasting. Are people just going through the formality and the stipulated hours of prayer without ongoing personal appropriations of the \\"death and resurrection\\", or \\"call, exile and return\\" that are manifested in so many of the life-stories in the book, or in \\"The Hero with a Thousand Faces\\", \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" or \\"Star Wars\\"?\\"Finding God in all things\\", and being \\"contemplatives in action\\" are the hallmarks of Jesuit spirituality. But do we not often just get too involved in action without deep contemplation? How self-aware are we? Are we just being driven along, even in lofty aspirations and zealous busyness, by our own compulsions to save ourselves, as depicted by the Enneagram types? How receptive to grace are we?From Dec. 3rd this year, there will be the Jubilee Year for the 450th anniversary of the death of St. Ignatius and 500th anniversary of the birth of St. Francis Xavier and St. Peter Faber. May this book continue to inspire and to awaken Jesuits in their life-long renewal and also share the perennial spirit and wisdom of these three giants and the Jesuit legacy with the whole of humankind."},{"Title":"Heroic Leadership: Best Practices from a 450-Year-Old Company That Changed the World","review":"Chris Lowney's &quot;Heroic Leadership&quot; is as rare as it is brilliant. The fluency of Lowney's prose and the compelling appeal of his thesis are such that &quot;Heroic Leadership&quot; offers invaluable lessons to anyone seeking to raise one's career or company to its highest level. Certainly, those who attended a Jesuit high school or college will have a particular affinity for Lowney's anecdotes about intrepid Jesuits, and will readily see the application of the Jesuit method and Jesuit achievement to their own working lives. Unlike most of what is offered on the &quot;leadership&quot; front, &quot;Heroic Leadership&quot; is written in a witty, engaging style that is as amusing as it is instructive. There is undoubted pleasure and pride in seeing how this ingenious band of far-flung priests managed to create their extraordinary enterprise. Actually, the real treat is not in learning about the most famous Jesuits, such as Ignatius himself or Francis Xavier, but in following the adventures and achievements of more obscure if no less accomplished men such as Matteo Ricci and Christopher Clavius.

How does one discover and nurture a capacity for ingenuity, for heroism, for love and above all for a healthy self-awareness.If you have met a Jesuit you liked, this book will help you understand why he choose to be one in simple, understandable, everyday terms. No spiritual razzle-dazzle or mumbo jumbo. Just down to earth stuff about having the courage to look at yourself honestly and fully live your life. That takes courage, work, and persistence and it pays off on a daily basis in an attitude towards life that is rooted in realism yet animated by a spirit of freedom and choicefulness.The book is more about the Jesuits than about leadership per se, so if you are of the Sam Harris school of Atheist Fundamentalism you would probably prefer another book, say the Leadership Secrets of Attila the Hun or Winnie the Pooh.If you have a more open mind on such matters, read this to find out why the personal and organizational insight of a 16th century Spanish soldier turned mystic has produced such remarkable results for the past 450 years.To my ears, most ring true today.

Even though they were and continue to be theological competitors with those of an evangelical faith, the Jesuits provide a leadership model that is in contrast to many Protestant organizations.The Jesuits rose to worldwide influence within a generation from their \\"no great leader\\" organizational practice. Whereas evangelicalism is often built around singular personalities and monolithic structures formed to achieve one man's vision, the Jesuits attempted to build all of their recruits into great leaders who, in turn, swarmed the world. That is the singular refreshing lesson that evangelicals can gain from the study of this book.However, what is disturbing about the book is the inability of its author, or the Jesuits whom he cites, to grasp the biblical message of salvation by faith alone in Christ alone. With a works-based salvation the Jesuits were - and still are - about moralizing the world with biblical principles rather than affording individuals the New Testament teaching of the free gift of new life in Christ - and the power to live the Christian life - by receiving Christ as Lord and Savior through faith alone."},{"Title":"Heroic Leadership: Best Practices from a 450-Year-Old Company That Changed the World","review":"My daughter is now a freshman at St. Louis University (a Jesuit school) and this book was her summer reading assignment. I was drawn to the book's title since I never would have characterized the Jesuits as a 450 year old company! Lowney's insights are compelling and the stories of the early Jesuit leaders are fascinating as an albeit biased glimpse of the early Catholic Church during the time of the Reformation. I kept waiting for Lowney to describe how he applied his learnings from the Jesuit seminary to his successful career at a major investment firm, but he does not. Perhaps he is applying the Jesuit philosophy of letting us figure that out!

Where most works on leadership are a string of the latest findings and a set of statistical reviews, this work delves deeply into the lives as well as the practices of the Jesuits.The many vignettes of Jesuits through the centuries and around the world were especially enlightening. Each story traced the successes and failures of several individuals and their ventures, and mapped them well onto the core principles of the Jesuit \\"company.\\"Of particular interest to me was the emphasis on \\"self-awareness.\\" For the Jesuits this was not only a personal inventory of traits and talents, but of spiritual depth and maturity as well. Many readers of spiritual growth works will find this book exciting as the spiritual exercises of the Jesuits are tied directly to their world-changing influence. As mature Christian theology will tell us, growing deeper in our faith and walk with God changes our daily lives; spiritual discipline is not an esoteric exercise for purely personal gain.The Jesuit backdrop for this book should not deter readers looking for good works on leadership and business theory. The author does not press Christianity to a point that might make others uncomfortable. There is a lot to glean from this work and from the Jesuits when it comes to leadership and good business practice-Heroic Leadership expresses it well and, in this reader's opinion, convincingly."},{"Title":"Heroic Leadership: Best Practices from a 450-Year-Old Company That Changed the World","review":"First I'll let you know I am a raving fan of this book.Second, I am enormously influenced by the Jesuit approach to spiritual formation.Third, my profession has to do with leadership development.Finally, I am always looking for how to improve the process, the delivery system, the content, the relational engagements and the outcomes when I design leadership training environments.Oh, by the way, I am not a Jesuit and I am not Roman Catholic. I am an evangelical Protestant who is deeply appreciative of a variety of religious traditions and grateful for help I can find in different traditions.The book, Heroic Leadership: Best Practices From a 450 Year Old Company That Changed the World, by Chris Lowney (a former Jesuit) is rich in ideas, insights, illustrations and a \\"system\\" that was designed by Ignatius of Loyola in the mid-1500's.In a nutshell, Lowney organizes the Jesuit genius around four organizing pillars that are not individual pillars, but which weave together in a synergistic whole where the whole is much greater than the sum of its parts.Here are the four pillars: (1) Self-Awareness and the reordering of one's inner world, (2) Ingenuity and the ability to radically innovate in a changing world, (3) Love as essential to a worldview that generates the resonance of emotional intelligence, (4) Heroism and having great desires, great resolves. Put these together and you have a process for helping people run full speed into perfection. The Jesuits went way beyond good, they stopped briefly at great and then soared on to atmospheric heights above that. They were truly one of the greatest missional organizations ever created.Lowney explains each of these pillars clearly. He provides historical examples of the Jesuits in action who illustrate these pillars. Rabbit Trail Note: I really like these historical examples for I am involved in cross cultural missional work and I love history. If neither of those are of interest to you, you can skim through those sections. Not that I would advise doing that... but you can. Second Rabbit Trail Note: If you ever saw the movie The Mission with Robert De Niro and Jeremy Irons, read chapter 8 to get some of the historical and political background and then watch the movie again.Lowney also pulls into his book, themes from the Spiritual Exercises. For someone who is not familiar with the Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius, you won't fully benefit from his allusions to them. I have gone through the Exercises and am currently going through them again. Lowney gave me some new windows to appreciate the greatness of the Exercises and actually expanded my vision on their usefulness. I now see them, not just as spiritually formative exercises, but as leadership forming exercises.For me, the desired outcome of reading a book is that I come away with ideas for change, motivation to do so and a few practical ideas for how to run full speed toward perfection. Chris Lowney has provided all of that and more.Brian RiceLeadership ConneXtions International[...]"},{"Title":"Heroic Leadership: Best Practices from a 450-Year-Old Company That Changed the World","review":"I must confess that Lowney was preaching to the Choir being that I am jesuit educated. For those who have experienced jesuit leadership this book will only reinforce your image of the Society of Jesus. However, there is much to be gained from this book for those who may have never even heard of the Jesuits.Lowney articulates well the four principles of Jesuit leadership and gives stunning historical eaxamples which illuminate them. I believe these historical examples, though a bit simplified and most certainly glossing over some unflattering instances, are particularly forceful since they leave the reader amazed at how a group of pre-enlightenment men in the overt service of the Papacy achieved such a high degree of insight into the world and, yes, enlightenment. Lowney leads you to the conclusion that the Society's four principles of leadership are responsible for this.If you accept that Lowney is certainly only giving the good news, much can be gained from this book."},{"Title":"Heroic Leadership: Best Practices from a 450-Year-Old Company That Changed the World","review":"this book has some good points about the Jesuits leadership but it was repetitive and i could categorize it as one of the most boring books that i read, there is a lot of fluff to be cut"},{"Title":"Heroic Leadership: Best Practices from a 450-Year-Old Company That Changed the World","review":"I first read this book about a year ago when participating in a class on understanding the Jesuit heritage of my place of work. I re-read it on the plane a couple of days ago returning from an overseas location where we recently established a program. The first time around I thought it was wonderful; re-reading it, I found it both wonderful and also profoundly relevant to our new enterprise.Lowney takes as his thesis the idea that the same precepts that have animated the success of the Jesuit order can likewise inspire personal and business accomplishment. I have to say he has me convinced. He boils down concepts - like Cura Personalis, Magis, and Ad majorem dei gloriam - that will be familiar to those who attended Jesuit schools to what he describes as the four integrated \\"pillars\\" of leadership: Self-awareness, Ingenuity, Love and Heroism. He then uses the history of the Jesuit order to demonstrate how, through application of the four pillars, the Society of Jesus grew from a motley band of 10 likeminded University students of different nationalities, with no agenda beyond doing work \\"to help souls,\\" to become arguably the most successful and influential Catholic religious order.Lowney's work is not without controversy, especially his contention that the Jesuit's' leadership lessons can be replicated minus their overtly religious agenda. No doubt the order's founder, Inigo (Latinized to Ignatius) of Loyola - for whom doing it \\"for the glory of God\\" was all that mattered - would disapprove. However secular research would suggest that the 16th century Basque had some very profound insights that have application beyond turning back the tide of the Reformation and making converts worldwide. I have to say I find Ignatius to be an intensely attractive character, not least because he advocated active engagement in the world, not withdrawal from it. Here's a guy who for most his life just can't get it quite right - and who along the way experiences some incredible reverses - but who never stops trying to perfect his muddled thinking. He just keeps plugging away until it starts to become clear. And it turns out that it's his very lack of success that leads to his deepest insight: that an intensive regimen of active self-reflection will help him make better decisions.What resonated with me during my most recent reading was how the Jesuit order faced the daunting task of preserving their purpose in remote lands among peoples with unfamiliar traditions - the same challenge facing my organization. Lowney provides many examples of how the Jesuits succeeded at that task. The training that the novice Jesuit undergoes involves frank self-examination, the letting go of attachments (the concept of \\"indifference\\" or the freedom to choose any course of action unencumbered by ingrained habits and prejudices), while learning, through active and repeated self-reflection, to validate one's own instincts to action. This creates a confident, prepared and self-reliant individual, eager to embrace life's challenges. In addition, the Jesuits teach a methodology for self-reflection - the Spiritual Exercises and the Examen - that can be used (the Examen everyday) to reinforce their initial training. Their selection process is tough - they take only the best and most purposeful. Those who are selected are encouraged to innovate and shown how love adds passion and purpose to the pursuit of heroic ambitions. The result, says Lowney, is an organization that can adapt easily to radically different circumstances while preserving it's core values (the same \\"preserve the core, stimulate progress\\" that Built to Last author Jim Collins sees as the hallmark of companies of enduring greatness).At times during my visit to our new overseas location I found myself wondering if our task was just too daunting, the culture just too alien, to hope to transplant our unique brand. After reading how the Jesuits managed it, I feel more confident than ever that my organization can do likewise and should do likewise - not shrinking from full-out engagement - through the innovative application of our fundamental values to this new environment. Thanks Chris, and Inigo, for the reinvigorating lesson!"},{"Title":"Heroic Leadership: Best Practices from a 450-Year-Old Company That Changed the World","review":"Author Chris Lowney turned in his Jesuit name badge on a Friday. On Monday, he clocked in at J.P. Morgan. Named a managing director of this huge investment banking firm while still in his 30s, he held senior positions with them in New York, Tokyo, Singapore and London.Bemused and amused by the proliferation of leadership lesson books (Leadership Secrets of Attila the Hun, to name just one), Lowney responded. \\"I was intrigued by what sixteenth-century priests might teach us twenty-first century sophisticates about leadership and about coping with complex, changing environments.\\" He adds, \\"What often passes for leadership today is a shallow substitution of technique for substance.\\"I know. I know. I recommend a \\"must-read\\" book often. But, this one really is a five-star must-read. \\"Obedience issues in an uninterrupted life of heroic deeds and heroic virtues,\\" writes Lowney. When's the last time you rubbed shoulders with a truly heroic leader?The Company of Jesus (the Jesuits) was founded in 1540 by \\"ten men with no capital and no business plan.\\" Yet within a generation, they built the world's most influential company of its kind. In 10 years, with no experience, they launched 30 colleges. \\"Instead of talking about leadership, they lived it.\\" Founder Ignatius Loyola trained every recruit to lead. Jesuits believe that self-leadership emanates from four unique values: 1) self-awareness, 2) ingenuity, 3) love, and 4) heroism.If you salivate at the chance to lead people through complexity, build global teams, control out-of-control growth, mediate turf battles, cultivate wealthy donors, and enforce rigorous hiring standards--you'll feast on this gourmet book. Chris Lowney's real world experience keeps it honest. His delicious and dry wit embarrassed me multiple times last week while reading on airplane trips.

It wasn't a trading company, nor a consumer retail company. It was the Society of Jesus, or commonly known as the Jesuits. They conquered the world, spreading the word of God in an uncommon fashion. Chris Lowney's \\"Heroic Leadership\\" (2005 Loyola Press) is a excellent synopsis of Jesuit travels, ideals, and procedures that builds a hybrid between the Jesuit lifestyle and the ideas of modern management and leadership.Lowney's compilation of stories of Jesuit missionary's to India, China, and the Americas outline a heroic tale of leaders. Selected by Jesuit founders as the \`very best', Jesuit's traveled the world at a moments notice to serve others. When first recruited, Jesuits experience a 30-day \`ordeal', called the Spiritual Exercises, which are centered around the idea of self-awareness, a concept coming forward in modern management techniques.Self-Awareness, Ingenuity, Heroism, and Love all form the four pillars of leadership, according to Lowney. He beautifully ties these together through Jesuit stories, historical events, and contemporary literature. Lowney's experience as a Jesuit and a modern banker contribute great ideas to this book, and is a must read for anyone interested in leadership, teaching, or serving. Heroic Leadership isn't a spiritual self-help book, nor is it another one of those books on the shelves of the \`management' section. It is something that is of a different type, a different craft. Having used it personally to teach and help lead others, it is a underestimated tool to help serve others."},{"Title":"Great Grilled Cheese: 50 Innovative Recipes for Stove Top, Grill, and Sandwich Maker","review":"I went on a grilled cheesse binge a few months back and bought this product to faciliate my habit.

Even the other third wave analysts like Rogers and Maslow still take a more abstract approach: they suggest ideas on how to function optimally in interpesonal relationships, but don't dig very deep into the application, or the how. This book uses practices that have parallels in Zen buddhism and other sorts of experience-oriented disciplines, but doesn't praise any particular system or thinker. The presentation of the material is very simple and informal--taken from live lectures. Thus, nothing is academically obscure. Rather, its as though one is listening to a very integrated human being who is beyond the need to aggrandize himself through helping others. This is a very good book for people that wish to open themselves up to the full experience of living."},{"Title":"Gestalt Therapy Verbatim","review":"Fritz Perls was very masterful at working with people. The book contains transcripts of how he interacted with others in a therapeutic context. He was able to effect changes very rapidly. The book has the theory, too, but it would not have made as much sense without the transcripts. I felt I got what Gestalt was about from this book. I have since prefered the Focusing approach, even as an explanation of how Fritz Perls worked, but this book inspired me and gave me the courage to confront my own challenges and then work with others. The key is that our organism is trying to meet a challenge and find closure, to integrate a gestalt, come to a kind of wholeness. We block ourselves from this, partly by not giving ourselves permission to feel our anger."},{"Title":"Gestalt Therapy Verbatim","review":"Fritz was a genius, and this book proves it.

Fritz Perls got it. Inside out, he was the original. In my opinion, there is no other figure in recent history who understood human beings quite as well as he did. He is still perhaps the only person who ever turned the key on compulsive repetition...and they all tried. He shows in this book that the way through our misery is not the more logical approach of fighting and resisting things, attempting to build a better concept, but instead, through fully accepting and experiencing all the discarded bits of ourselves that didn't seem to fit. It's a monumental paradox that human beings still cannot fathom. If we ever do finally turn that corner, this book will become one of the ideological cornerstones of that discovery.Verbatim is rich material, a must read. Pure genius presented in an easy, conversational way. His only shortcoming was perhaps his inability to find the perfect word in English to translate some of his ideas, but even then, he keeps it real most of the time."},{"Title":"Gestalt Therapy Verbatim","review":"This title is a must have for the library of any therapist.Gestalt demands a deep understanding and this book offers exactly that."},{"Title":"Gestalt Therapy Verbatim","review":"Fritz Perls walks you through the process of Gestalt Therapy.

I will try to be brief as well as illuminative.First off, the author has culled a handful of books that support his case against a global financial elite, and these tend, with the exception of the Quigley book, to be left of left of center. I am however happy to add a number of books that support his essential theses that a handful of banking families control the central banks which are NOT government banks, and through loans, control governments, impoverish the middle class, and harvest profit without conscience from the \\"working poor.\\"Try these on for size:1)Confessions of an Economic Hit Manby John Perkins. 85% rock solid, 15% flakey, but in my view, a perfectly reasonable slam on the World Trade Organization and the International Monetary Fund as instruments for impoverishing lesser developed countries, not empowering them.2)The End of Poverty: Economic Possibilities for Our Timeby Jeffrey Sachs, another slam on the WTO/IMF, which he relegates to third rate out-dated economist ranks, not at all focused or able to achieve what he calls \\"developmental economics.\\"3)The Global Class War: How America's Bipartisan Elite Lost Our Future - and What It Will Take to Win It Backby Jeff Faux, a fine discussion of how our elites bribe the elites in other countries, and the both screw the public by looting the commonwealths of gold, oil, etcetera, without returns to the people whose families have lived on top of these resources for centuries.4)Running on Empty: How the Democratic and Republican Parties Are Bankrupting Our Future and What Americans Can Do About It, by Paul Peterson of the Council of Foreign Relations (which the author hates, in my view it has two types of members--one manipulative like Henry Kissinger, another honest, like Paul Peterson), in which both the Republican and the Democratic parties are lambasted for being the ignorant slaves of the ultra-rich elites, and hopeless out of touch with reality and unable to represent We the People.5)War Is a Racket: The Anti-War Classic by America's Most Decorated General, Two Other Anti=Interventionist Tracts, and Photographs from the Horror of Itby General Smedley Butler, the highest decorated Marine of his time, who complained about being an enforcer for banks and businesses that lent money to the Third World then sent the Marines to get it back for them.There are many other books that support this author's book reviews in great detail and from many varied perspectives. I refer you to my various lists, including the list on \\"Screwing the 90% that do the work.\\"The author has some pretensions and some slop, his arguments are not always consistent, but then neither are mine. On balance I regard this book as a first rate personal effort that should be read by every middle class person wondering, as Lou Dobbs on CNN has wondered, why we are exporting middle class jobs and importing poverty in the form of illegal aliens.The author wraps up his varied reviews with a focus on the relationship between organized crime and the super-elite as well as their political elite (e.g. the Bush family, the best of the servant class), and on the relationship between drugs, covert operations, and Wall Street. Here again the author draws on a very tiny sub-set of books while not listing many others that support his thesis so I will mention a few here.Having been through both Viet-Nam as a youth and the Central American Wars as an adult, I am quite certain that there are at least four different slices of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) where I served for ten years as a clandestine case officer:A small slice does what the White House wants, including black bag jobs.A small but more important slice does what Wall Street wants, and helps Wall Street with access to financially relevant information that the public which pays for the CIA does not get. Buzzy Krongard, until recently Executive Director of the CIA, comes to mind as the most recent leader of this section.A larger slice, that does covert action off the books with funding from Saudi Arabia and others, sometimes called the Safari Club, sometimes having off-shoots like Ted Shackley's Southern Air Transport, and so on. This slice can provide the intersection between criminal activities, white collar crime profits, illegal White House activities, and plain profiteering.Finally, 90% of the CIA, folks like me that did not realize they were simply going through the motions and giving the local counterintelligence service a full-time rabbit to follow while the commercial clandestine boys and girls looted the bank in bright daylight.I have two intelligence lists that can be helpful here, but I have not focused on creating crime lists. I'll just say that between the books on theThe Working Poor: Invisible in Americaand on beingNickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in Americaand books on immoral predatory capitalism and unilateral militarism of the Dick Cheney variety (I have compiled a list of 25 specific impeachable actions by Dick Cheney based on three books:The One Percent Doctrine: Deep Inside America's Pursuit of Its Enemies Since 9/11Vice: Dick Cheney and the Hijacking of the American PresidencyCrossing the Rubicon: The Decline of the American Empire at the End of the Age of OilThere is a very clear-cut and direct relationship between dictators, transnational organized crime and terrorism, and Wall Street as well as the Republican and Democratic National Committees (see Running on Empty: How the Democratic and Republican Parties Are Bankrupting Our Future and What Americans Can Do About It)That reminds me: there is an entire literature on petroleum, peak oil, petrodollars, and so on. Americans have been betrayed by their government since at least 1975, and more likely, back to the 1950's when naivet&eacute; about international affairs was replaced by active complicity.Good news. 1) Internet leveled playing field. 2) Not enough guns to kill us all. 3) A few of the really rich have realized they need to help us create infinite wealth for ourselves, or lose all they have to locusts.

Hayek)Money Masters of Our Time"},{"Title":"How The World Really Works","review":"The best way to describe this type of book is to show you it's table of contents. I have taken the time to do this for you because I feel that after seeing the titles of the books that the author reviews in each chapter you WILL make the decision to buy this book.1-A Century of War2-Tragedy and Hope3-The Naked Capitalist4-The Tax-Exempt Foundations5-The Creature from Jekyll Island6-19847-Report from Iron Mountain8-The Greening9-The Politics of Heroin10-Final Judgment11-Dope Inc.12-Let's fix America!The author has researched the works of writers who are seeking to find out WHO is impoverishing us, and WHY and HOW they are doing it. The findings are presented via a series of in-depth reviews of a carefully selected set of books, mostly little-known but a few famous. Taken together, a coherent picture emerges which precious few among even our political activists understand or care to admit to knowing."},{"Title":"How The World Really Works","review":"The main purpose of this book is to give the reader a trail to follow. Like breadcrumbs in the shape of an arrow, Alan B. Jones has selected and reviewed 12 books that will further lead to the details of the well oiled machine running the state of world affairs into the ground.These books collectively establish common threads that point to the powers behind what has been happening in slow motion for the last 100 years, robbing individuals worldwide of their liberty and livelihood as the wealth of nations slowly spirals into economic decline and the hard earned money of the middle class disappears into the void.The formats of the reviews are straight book reporting, which frankly diminishes the reading enjoyment, but is necessary for the amount of information covered. After reading the often shocking contents, an overwhelming need arises to investigate further by reading one or more of the titles reviewed. The importance of the material covered in this book cannot be overstated, and are of topics that the imbecile TV news \`experts' you see prattling away just in time for your morning coffee wouldn't have a clue about.I must advise however, that you will not read this book and come away believing everything. The means for this would be in the details of the 12 books themselves. Jones does an admirable job in trying to sum up almost 6000 pages of information into just over 300, but the pace is often overwhelming. However, he gets the point across and makes the connections that in all these books, whenever certain stones were overturned, the same manipulators came skittering out from underneath."},{"Title":"How The World Really Works","review":"We are teetering on the brink of oblivion or utopia. Our corrupt Federal Reserve System is bringing economic collapse to the USA unless people quickly awaken to what is really happening to our freedoms and our economic prosperity.My own review would closely mirror Robert D Steele's excellent and comprehensive analysis below. I also agree with the excellence of the additional works he recommends. I've read them all and have nothing but praise.I might add to Robert's list a couple more titles:1. \\"When Corporations Rule the World\\" by David C Korten ... also visit his website (Google it).2. \\"The Road to Serfdom\\" by FA Hayak.3. \\"The Money Masters\\" website, book and DVD... (Google it).4. \\"Web of Debt\\", by Ellen Hodgson Brown. [...]5. \\"The Lost Science of Money\\", by Stephen Zarlenga [...]6. \\"Money as Debt\\", Paul Grignon (Google the 47 minute video)There are no more important subjects on earth than these. Nearly all wars, poverty, media manipulations, societal and educational problems such as drug dealing, smuggling, flesh peddling, high taxation, and... well, you name it... are rooted in the problems revealed in these works.I strongly disagree with those who think such works are either fear-based or impractical. Nothing can be more practical than the knowledge of the secret and occult powers that are now the motivating forces shaping our modern world.However, I do find much of the second half of the book flawed, along with Jones' final chapter, \\"Let's Fix America\\". His recommendations miss the boat because of a political bias.We can only remain asleep (in denial) at our grave peril, and more importantly, the peril of our children and grandchildren.No problem can be fixed without a thorough understanding of it's root causes. Sooner or later these international money and banking problems must be fixed, and to do it properly we must fix... or rebuild... these institutions in the right ways.The issuance of money must be taken out of the hands of private bankers and returned to the government's of \\"We the People\\" where it belongs. Only then can we stop paying exorbitant interest rates on the money that is put into circulation. Only then can we begin to use our taxes for purposes other than paying needless interest to private bankers.Unchecked, unbalanced and unlimited power always leads to tyranny and despotism, some form of totalitarianism. Today that power is quickly becoming the materialistic \\"Golden Rule\\" - \\"He who has the gold, rules.\\"Will we let it happen here? Is it already too late to stop it?"},{"Title":"How The World Really Works","review":"The 'Introduction' explains this book as a shortcut to the essential knowledge needed to fight for democracy and freedom. Its 12 chapters are the author's reviews of a dozen books that present facts and views censored from the daily corporate press. Today's problems are interconnected in ways that will surprise you.Chapter 1 explains how the wars over the past century were for the control of oil. American and British oil companies control their governments and eliminate any competition. Third world nations are exploited through \\"foreign aid\\". Any country that tries to develop nuclear power is punished, as that will lower the price of oil. Chapter 2 discusses the restricted book that documents the secret \\"international Anglophile network\\" that controls much of the world's history. The Rhodes Scholarships are part of this, and other organizations are named. It explains why millionaires subsidize \\"left-wing\\" movements (p.30). Tax-exempt foundations were created to pursue a hidden agenda (p.31). Read the secret 'seven points' to understand 1930s Europe. Did the bankers of England and Germany put Hitler into power (p.42)? Chapter 3 tells how banking dynasties have replaced dynastic monarchies. These banking families control the political and economic life of the world (p.45). The super-rich want to take over the world (p.49)! They control the educational systems (p.53). Who gets the oil and natural gas concessions after a revolution (p.57)? Chapter 4 explains how tax-exempt foundations are used to control the government and people of America to benefit the super-rich. One method is to control the teaching of history (p.63). Do they give funds to organizations for covert activities (p.70)?Chapter 5 examines the Federal Reserve Bank and its history. It names the real person who inspired the \\"Daddy Warbucks\\" character in a comic strip (p.89). Its purpose was to attack smaller banks and corporations that finance their growth from profits (p.89)! The public pays more to enrich the banking cartel (p.93). Pages 107-111 tell how the Carnegie Foundation brought America into WW I. Who benefitted (p.118)? Chapter 6 discusses George Orwell's \\"1984\\", a satire on England and the world of 1948. England is under fascist rule (called \\"English Socialism\\") where telephones monitor everybody's lives. [Like today's cellphones?] It is a dark world without hope. [Yes, Orwell said \\"television\\" to avoid prosecution under the Official Secrets Act.] Chapter 7 discusses \\"The Report from Iron Mountain\\" which fictionalizes reality and projects its logical conclusions. Advertising, education, and the broadcast media controls the thinking of most people. [The chemical found in birth control pills is in most of the fresh water supplies to a limited amount.]Chapter 8 asks if Environmentalism is just a power grab to control the wealth of the world (p.150). Is \\"global warming\\" a newer version of these fears (p.155)? Page 161 explains how this scam would work to benefit the banks of the rich. Populations in the Third World are oppressed to create wealth for their oppressors (pp.162-163). There is a warning against independent agencies and their administrative law (p.169). Chapter 9 tells about the lucrative business in drugs, such as opium and cocaine. US Intelligence agencies helped the drug trade (p.177). This was called \\"fighting Communism\\" (p.180)! CIA supported forces increased opium production in Burma (p.189). The war in Afghanistan supported opium production (p.201), cocaine in Nicaragua (p.202). Chapter 10 discussed the assassination of JFK as the conspiracy between intelligence agencies and organized crime to safeguard the lucrative trade in drugs, and related issues. The policy changes after JFK's death are listed on page 237. Chapter 11 uses a report, not a published book to tell about the many prestigious banks that are used for financing the world trade in drugs. Chapter 12 has the author's review of his own book. It seems to want to repeal the New Deal. This seems very fantastic and idealistic. To the extent its been done the result has been another depression today. The 'Epilogue' by Taylor Caldwell seems to be more fiction than history."},{"Title":"How The World Really Works","review":"This book will give you a great introduction to what is going on in our world, based on several past written books about the \\"Powers that Be.\\"If you know nothing about the Illuminati, The Council on Foreign Relations, Trilateral Commission, Bilderbergs and various other secret socities, then I suggest you start with this book and progress from there. I have studied these \\"Elites\\" with great detail and still learned a lot of valuable information including resources and books written by people that spent time working for these global power brokers. This has been a plan that has passed down through the various families for generations if you go in depth you will understand who they worship and that they believe in reincarnation which explains why the circle continues to cycle.This book will enlighten you to the money trail of narcotics, mafia, globalization, IMF Bank, Ford Company etc.After you read this move on to the Committee of 300.Check out the resources given and the books reviewed you will no longer trust our government (if you actually did), but instead of getting angry or worse denial Do something to try and stop THEM. They are few we are many that is what made us a great country only a few hundred years ago."},{"Title":"How The World Really Works","review":"Since I didn't want to read all of these books, but was very impressed with those I did (Tragedy & Hope, A Century of War), I figured a synopsis of the rest would do. This book certainly does that as well as it can in its 15-20 pages devoted to each book.As long as you take these kinds of theories with a grain of salt, you'll come away more knowledgeable about our world than when you started. Jones' book does a good job of describing many of the topics found in the various books. He also uses it to weave a conspiracy conclusion of his own: that rich people have always run the world and seek dominance over the rest of us.I can certainly attest to that, given my most recent Visa card statement.As for Jones' book, if you don't want to read all of the rest of these books, his compilation is a good effort and worth the $15. Heck, you'll pay almost 50% more for a total work of fiction like \\"Da Vinci Code.\\"And you'll thank Jones for his 20-page summary of \\"Tragedy & Hope\\"--it's better than plowing through the actual 700+-pages of the real thing."},{"Title":"How The World Really Works","review":"Mr. Jones in effect has written a series of book reviews. His stated goal is to \\"save for our posterity the great experiment in freedom that was launched 200 years ago by our country's founders.\\" His method is to expose the essence of the centuries-long effort by the international banking houses, their corporate associates and intellectually corrupted useful idiots who undermine the American Republic and its Constitution. That essence includes means, methods, strategies and goals. Their diversity and comprehensiveness is a tribute to the generational perseverence and expertise of those shadowy protagonists.The work has much in common with the old \\"College Outline Series,\\" in that it proposes that it is no substitute for delving into the books themselves. It hits the key elements and much more, but cannot be more than a brief related to the several elephantine works that are reviewed. Having read several of the key works prior to discovering Mr. Jones' book, I can testify that he fairly and comprehensively dealt with them. Also I will second his recommendation that his book is not a substitute for reading each and all of the books in question.This is a book that every American should read. After that, one should read the books themselves.The final piece in the book, the \\"Epilogue,\\" is an essay by Taylor Caldwell in which she clarifies the motives of the elite, and their central goal: the destruction of the middle class. This was no new theme for Mrs. Caldwell. She brought the entire scheme into fictional focus in \\"Captains and The Kings,\\" which fictionally approaches the world of the movers and shakers who are determined to destroy the American experiment.Will reading this book make any real difference, as Mr. Jones hopes? Perhaps, but one of his reviewed authors, Carroll Quigley, writing in the 1960s, asserted that already it was too late to frustrate the elite's drive for dominion and power.I am more optimistic, based on the notion that anything that can go wrong will go wrong, no matter the plan or the planner.Mr. Jones certainly believes that an informed public will place our Republic beyond final usurpation. Read his book."},{"Title":"How The World Really Works","review":"The book is mainly a summary of list of books that the author considers as essential reading. And it is. The tone is fairly dry and hard to follow sometimes because you have to read the books that the author is presenting yourself and form your own judgments. The chapter on his own book reads the best as he understands it best himself.Note to future readers of this book : You should not buy into stories that cannot provide facts, evidence, legitimate documentation, reasoning, scientifically or historically tested theories, and others.But you should at least consider the ones that can do provide those support. And when you do go through all the legitimate processes and find out what is really going on in the world, what is causing all these problems, who cause them, and what to do about them you will have learned probably the single most important truth.IF you are really lazy and cannot afford time and money to read this book then simply go onto youtube and check out things like Loose Change, Architects and Engineers for 9/11, Presentations by Mike Ruppert, Alex Jones, Ron Paul, Cynthia McKinney, Max Keiser, Peter Schiff, Jim Rodgers, Marc Faber, Ralph Nader, Jeff Rense, and their affiliates."},{"Title":"How The World Really Works","review":"I have done alot of reading in the area of inquiry covered by this book. It is basically a synopsis of a number of books written by others, some of which, like \\"The Creature from Jekyll Island\\", I have read. Really Jones has done a public service writing this book and none of it is copyrighted. He wants you to copy it and disseminate it! You should at least read it, objectively, and then I think you will not be the same person anymore. If, however, you want to remain the same person you are now (assuming you know nothing about these issues) then don't bother with it. There is a massive on-going conspiracy to take away your liberty, this is fact. And the groups in on this conspiracy want to make sure that you ignore all \\"conspiracy theories\\". Like any conspirators, they like to remain unknown behind the scenes. But this is not a conspiracy theory, it is a conspiracy fact. And alot of things will make alot more sense to you in current events after you digest this book."},{"Title":"How The World Really Works","review":"Most of us know there's something wrong with the way the \\"world\\" works. And we figure that folks with money and power will use their positions to do whatever it takes to accumulate more money and power at the expense of anyone or anything that get's in their way. Unfortunately, this book doesn't help clarify or give us tools to win the class war. If you're looking for clarity, start with Noam Chomsky's 2 CD audio \\"Propaganda and Control of the Public Mind.\\" Chomsky offers a much more insightful and easier to grasp view of how the world really works.For someone who hasn't cracked open this book yet, I would suggest that you read Chapter 12 first--\\"Let's Fix America\\". Jones has a few good ideas there, but for the most part his \\"tough love\\" ideology meshes perfectly with that of the \\"elites\\" he supposedly opposes. So it's difficult for me to assess if his work is designed to assist the working class, confuse it, or destroy it. Because destroying it is exactly what his taxation and social program ideas would do. If you examine these notions closely you can't help but notice that they sound like ideas that would be sponsored by far right-wing Think Tanks--typically funded by corporations and elite old-money families.There is certainly a lot of info in the book. And some of it is likely correct--(Professor McCoy \\"Politics of Heroin\\" is considered a first class researcher)--with this kind of shotgun approach, it couldn't help but hit something. Unfortunately for Jones, \\"Report from Iron Mountain\\" was outed by the author, Leonard Lewin, as fictional satire--dead on satire, but fiction none the less. This leaves me with questions about the author's ability or desire to separate fact from fiction."},{"Title":"How The World Really Works","review":"I started to read this book and found it quit interesting, but I reached a point where I began to get sick of all what's around us. If you are really prepair to receive bad news about our world, then read it, I guess some ligth can blind people's eyes.There still is a remaining question I haven't found anywhere, \\"Why\\" why so much power, money, how did we reach this point. It really seems to me we are living just as the slaves did 4500 years ago in the ancient Egypt, with the difference we have more \\"rights\\" and less mysticism."},{"Title":"How The World Really Works","review":"This book is a must read for those who operate \\"in the spirit of trust.\\" Before reading this book, I wrote a book published in late 2001 called \\"Blacks In The Spider's Web\\" which substantially views the world as the subject book, but from a black American perspective. Although I have not read all of the books reviewed in \\"How The World Really Works\\" (I'm sure most are out of print now), my analysis of the world situation corresponds materially with Alan B. Jones' book. Much of what we see of the world is a false facade that must be pierced in order to come to the reality of the truth. \\"How The World Really Works\\" helps to pierce the veil of secrecy covering the \\"military industrial complex,\\" the \\"Kennedy assassinations\\" and the \\"dumbing down of America,\\" among other \\"unsolved mysteries.\\""},{"Title":"How The World Really Works","review":"Although I agree with the complaints that Jones failed to properly frame Iron Mountain as fiction (as he actually did for 1984), both books are still useful in forecasting the end result of a 'New World Order'. Since this book was written it is hard to not agree with Jones' conclusions. We now have a 'war on terror', which conveniently will probably never end, and will result in much cost to the average American. Drug use is still a problem, social programs are just as much an issue (and drain on the economy), global warming and all the environmental concerns are moving more towards the mainstream (not that I endorse polluting). All in all, even if you seriously doubt the existence of some group of powerful individuals pulling the strings behind the scenes, it is hard to ignore the evidence of the last few years that shows there is a consistent drive to weaken the American middle class, while benefiting the rich few. In fact the trend across most economies is that the people at the wealthy end of the spectrum gain a greater share of the overall wealth. If this trend continues, we will find ourselves with a small group of elites that run everything, and they will not need to be secret about it by then. Unfortunately I feel it is just a function of human nature: as long as someone can gain more power (either economically or politically), someone will abuse that power (at the expense of the powerless) to gain more power. The only way to stop that would be to enforce 'equality', but that would come at the expense of liberty, which most would be loathe to do."},{"Title":"How The World Really Works","review":"An excellent way to give a great view of the history behind modern society and where we are headed if we don't change course. The book is a review and summation of 13 books that formulates the reasoning behind many government and government created organizations and their role in controlling our existence. This is a book that I will be recommending to all my friends and family for their sake and the sake of their children."},{"Title":"How The World Really Works","review":"The whole point of this book is to introduce the reader to the worldwide political/economic consolidation called the New World Order (NWO). Each of the 10 or 12 chapters is a synopsis of some other book exploring some facet of the NWO. This is a quick way to get an overall vision of how (for example) the Federal Reserve System (The Creature from Jekyll Island), tax-free charities (The Tax Free Foundations), environmentalism (Report from Iron Mountain), and CIA participation in the narcotics trade (Dope, Inc) are interrelated. Each, in its own way, advances the goals of the world ruling class towards \\"vertically integrating\\" us into a single totalitarian oligarchy. As you might guess, the United Nations, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Trade Organization are all players in this scheme. The most shocking chapter is the analysis of George Orwell's \\"1984\\" as a work of NONFICTION masquarading as fiction. It's all a lot to swallow at first, but followup with research supports the overall thesis. This book was my first step towards a much more coherant and predictive understanding of current events than what is offered on FOX News. Is this a \\"conspiracy theory\\"? If by \\"conspiracy theory\\" you mean that it supposes that two or more people have agreed to commit a crime together, then yes, and it is a worldview which deserves to be evaluated on its merits."},{"Title":"How The World Really Works","review":"I enjoyed the format and the books selected for review were mostly comprised of ones I would read. I used this book as a cross-reference to THE SHADOW OF POWER BY JAMES PERLOFF. Certainly for anyone researching history, this book is an excellent reference. The last book reviewed was the one which I found most disagreement. It is entitled: Let Us Fix America and was written in 1994, so Jones was not privy to our recent events. On the whole, I would recommend this compilation of book reviews without reservation."},{"Title":"How The World Really Works","review":"A must read for everyone who wants to cut the strings of the puppet meisters. Stands on its own, and is a valuable reference. This book is a great launching pad for anyone becoming interested in why things are the way they are right now."},{"Title":"How The World Really Works","review":"Someone's review points out that the Report from Iron Mountain is in the Genius Book of World Records as the longest running \\"hoax\\" in history. Lets clear something up...the \\"Hoax\\" part has to do with the \\"authorship\\" of the report, not the content thereof. Lewin initially claimed President JFK commissioned some brain children from universities and industry to study the real possibility of peace, real peace, defined as the absence of war, on earth. The \\"Hoax\\" part is Lewin's claim that the report was written by the men JFK commissioned to write it...which he later recanted and claimed it was he himself that wrote the book. That is the \\"hoax\\" part.Who cares if the authorship of the \\"Report from Iron Mountain\\" was a \\"hoax\\" or not? Since the \\"hoax\\" part has NOTHING to do with the \\"content\\" of the report, only the \\"author's\\" real identity. Maybe Lewin did write it and was trying to protect his sources. Who cares!? The REAL question should deal with the report's content. Is LEWIN'S (or his \\"hoax\\" phantom author's) assessments of the need for war as a tool for those who wield government power over their \\"own people\\" accurate or not? It should not matter if Lewin wants to claim \\"Mickey Mouse\\" wrote the \\"Report from Iron Mountain\\" if his (or their) assessments about war, and war's role in aiding those in power to maintain their power, are accurate. Which they are!!!As I finished reading the report for the second time, with my wife who was also a Marine Officer like myself, she said; \\"This has been our government's play book for the past 40 years.\\" Who wrote the play book, Lewin, his \\"hoax\\" brain children, or Mickey Mouse is irrelevant to me! The content is spot on! Every American should read the Report from Iron Mountain. It is on line for free. Read it! WAKE UP! WAR, plays a pivotal role in modern society which \\"peace\\" canNOT easily replace...or so the author(s) of the report would have those in power believe!This book answers questions that just don't make sense without it. Why America \\"lost\\" the war in Vietnam? Those who profited most from Vietnam did NOT \\"lose.\\" Why did we go from \\"Russia\\" as \\"the enemy\\" to \\"Terrorism\\" as \\"the enemy\\" in less than a few years? What is the REAL PURPOSE of war for those that cultivate war? All of these questions are answered in this short report."},{"Title":"How The World Really Works","review":"For someone who has not done any research on the subjects involved this book it is a very good start.

This book ought to be mandatory, repetitive reading and reference material in grade school, high school, and university. It whets the appetite for reading the referenced books. It opens the readers eyes to what is truly going on behind the scenes, and who really pulls the strings both on the planet, as well as in our lost republic. It educates and it stimulates the reader to dig deeper and learn more. As a point source, this book throws harsh light into many otherwise very dark corners the leadership would much rather keep hidden from the public at large. It is, after all, this same public that is the cash cow (pronounced \\"chattel\\") of truly brutal, monstrously arrogant sociopaths who have put themselves in the driver's seat of an out-of-control coach into financial and physical hell.This book should be updated. This reviewer got the book when it came out, is now reading it carefully for the third time, and is dumbstruck by the absolute congruity of the carefully crafted sinister plans laid bare in the book and the world's reality, which absolutely, precisely mirrors those ugly plans today, in 2012.At all costs, by any means, get your hands on a copy of this book and read it carefully from cover to cover, and for your own good, and that of your family, take notes.C.

This is a book only for the courageous and open minded who are willing to consider the reasons things happen the way that they do. This should be a mandatory read for every high school student in America."},{"Title":"How The World Really Works","review":"The realm of conspiracy theory is full of many books that range from insightful to outright ludicrous. So how does one go about finding the most credible ones to read first? Let this book be the guide. First published in the 1990's, this book reviews 12 previously published books that are among the most widely read works in the realm of conspiracy theory. Taken together, they provide an insightful analysis of 20th century history. Each of these books is summarized in one chapter of \\"How the World Really Works\\".Nine of the reviewed books are non-fiction, and would probably fall in the realm of investigative journalism in a standard library. Most of these nine are unknown to the casual reader, with one exceptions, \\"The Politics of Heroin\\". Written by Alfred McCoy, the information in the book and McCoy's testimony itself were submitted as evidence in Congressional hearings into the CIA in the wake of the Vietnam War and Watergate. Together, the nine books examine the relationships between corporations, organized crime, and governmental intelligence agencies in controlling the course of history. Of the remaining three books reviewed in this work, one is the high school classic \\"1984\\", one is the \\"Report from Iron Mountain\\", and the third is a book previously written by this work's authors. 1984 is included to serve as an example of how Western society would look like at the end of 20th century. Report from Iron Mountain is included as a testimony to the aims of the elites of creating a world of perpetual war, in fact a keystone of the society described in 1984.In terms of political slant, the books are more aligned with the libertarian right, with most of the books arguing against the existence of a central bank, and opposed to the veracity and authenticity of the environmental movement. The rightward slant of this work is also demonstrated by the absence of all of the most influential non-fiction works of the 20th century: Ralph Nader's \\"Unsafe at any Speed\\", \\"Silent Spring\\" by Rachel Carson, and of the course the various tracts from the feminist movement such as the \\"Second Sex\\", and the \\"Feminine Mystique\\". Also excluded are probably the most important works of fiction from the progressive left; with classics such as \\"Grapes of Wrath\\", \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\", and \\"All Quiet on the Western Front\\", and \\"The Jungle\\" not even mentioned.Overall, this is a good book, though not a great one due its rightward slant. It serves best as a database of references to other works that taken together, help explain the functioning of the modern world."},{"Title":"How The World Really Works","review":"this is a really enlightening book.

The idea of a compilation of summaries of other books seems interesting. And the first few chapters read reasonably well.Near the middle, however, some oddnesses begin to creep in: The author's use of \\"we\\" when refering to himself alone; summaries that lose some coherence or became more commentary than summary; a summary of Orwell's 1984 included as supposed evidence.The proverbial \\"straw that breaks the camel's back\\" is in the summary of Report from Iron Mountain. Jones doesn't even mention that this book is a famous hoax, as confessed by its author in 1972, just five years after its publication, and 24 years before Jones's book itself. The Guinness Book of World Records recorded it as the very greatest of literary hoaxes. For Jones not to address this fact casts a serious shadow on his scholarship and sincerity.With that in mind, the self-published nature of How the World Really Works--and the lack of recognizable publishers among nearly all of the books it reviews--sets this pretty firmly in the camp of ultra-right-wing conspiracy theorists."},{"Title":"How The World Really Works","review":"This is amazing how much of whats in this book you can see right around you everyday.

The perspective is decidedly Western, however, and tends to overstate the relevance of \\"fine arts\\" as opposed to the so-called \\"minor arts\\" and crafts. Thus, woodblock prints are given less space than their cultural impact would imply. More importantly, ceramics are accorded very little space - a major shortcoming to any art history of Japan."},{"Title":"History of Japanese Art","review":"Depending on what your intended usage for this book will be, this book may be somewhat helpful. I needed this for an art history class my senior year of college as an art history major. Thing is, the class was pretty ridiculous. It was supposed to be an introductory class into the art of japanese art & tradition, but the professor spoke more of Chinese art & traditions.This book will give you a pretty thorough knowledge in Japanese Art, as well as some of its culture, more through the introductions of the eras and periods and through its pictures. But that's it, do not buy this if you're looking for a complete knowledge, because that's not what it is. Also, if you are looking for early (i.e. ancient!) japanese history, there really isn't any, in this book or just in general.Definitely buy it here on Amazon, because I found it to be a lot cheaper in comparison to my friends who had spent a fortune on it through eBay and the university bookstores. You may also want to get a soft cover if you want to sell it back later on or use it solely for class, because it's such a heavy book (I have the hard cover).

It will just disgust you."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"If you're an Ellis fan, than this is necessary reading. The problem I found, however, is that it is almost an exact replica of Don Delillo's White Noise. An out of place father is stuck in generic suburbia drifting quickly away from his medicated trophy wife. Both books have an excentric younger daughter, a prematurely disillusioned son and (if memory serves from reading White Noise a few years back) a freaky dog. In both books the main character is a professor at a local university. Then strange events begin to take place in town and things begin to unravel. I think the dead father in White Noise plays a part too (though i don't remember exactly). I'm not saying Lunar Park isn't worth reading, but as I think about it more, it seems as though Brett Easton Ellis has pulled off some serious forgery here. I think both books touch on important aspects of a disjointed modern society, but simply updating Delillo's White Noise (1991) for the new mellenium is pretty cheap Brett."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"When I started reading this book it immediately hooked me in.

I got an advance reading copy of LUNAR PARK a few months ago. I'm so disappointed. The beginning and the end are AMAZING, but the rest is just a bad Stephen King novel. The whole middle section is extremely tedious, and honestly, pretty dumb. For this we had to wait seven years? What a bummer."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"So why the 5? The book is perfectly constructed, the characters are real, the choice of making the author the main character and his books important to the plot brilliant; the horror is spectacular. You are sucked into the vortex. But I hated this book. I was disgusted by the Ellis person, real or imagined, and his wife Jayne. They are failed persons: using drugs, prescription or felonious, alcohol, the works. But it's the utter narcissistic existence they live which is the real horror. The demon of Ellis' alter ego is apparently taking over the lives and home of this family. Jayne, the wife, is an actress concerned mainly with keeping family life on an even enough keel to be able to pursue her career and not be alone. While paid help are raising the kids. The little girl Sarah is on meds and so is the son Robby- so as to cause as little trouble to the parents as possible. To my thinking the demons were/are present from the beginning of Ellis life, and he's destined to have them as his only constant companions. The author chucks us a thin bare bone of hope and love (?) in the last few pages of the book. Thanks.Like many, I wonder what author Ellis is doing today. Why has his book tour been cancelled? Then again, I don't want to know anything further about this character, this author, this person, this mind. I'll never read another of his books, I'm certain."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"...oops, wait, this isn't a Dean Koontz novel? The first chapter was pretty fascinating, and I would be completely unsurprised if it was revealed that Ellis had subcontracted the rest of the novel out to Koontz for finishing.\\"Here you go Dean, I banged out a pretty good first chapter. Now maybe you can write one of your formulaic supernatural thrillers for the body of the novel, using the characters I introduced in chapter one. I'll wrap it all up with a closing chapter after you're done. Thanks buddy.\\"2 caveats - I actually kind of like Dean Koontz novels sometimes, so parts of this were a nice easy read. Also, the only Bret Easton Ellis novel I've read was Glamorama, roughly 8 years ago, so I am by no means a Bret Easton Ellis expert. I don't remember much about that read other than being slightly nauseated. Interestingly enough I was also a bit nauseous while finishing up this book, but I was on a somewhat bumpy transcontinental flight at the time, so that may have nothing to do with the novel."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"Nothing special at all about this book. Just a lot of vodka, weeping and a poor stab at ghosts and or demons. I read the countless instances where he was weeping, and couldn't feel an ounce of his sorrow. I read about the demon toy doll and just fought to get through those pages. The terby ripped apart a horse, the toy scratched up a door and then a mound of hair attacked him. Almost like a bad R rated episode of scooby doo.BEE's previous novel, Glamaroma, a masterpiece, makes this book read even worse than it really does. If writing Glamorama almost killed him, then writing this book was just a stroll to the bank in comparison. It's only fitting that in Lunar Park, his dog, properly named Victor, despises him and eventually almost kills him. I'd give this 1 star, but at least the author writes that his desire to create characters like Patrick Bateman has come to an end, which warns that this book won't have any special characters. Which it doesn't."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"this book starts out with ellis telliong you about his succesful and rocky career. Then it goes on to tell about how his life supposedly is now. It reads like a memoir and is very convinving for awhile, and then the s*** hits the fan and he turns the reader upside down. yeah, his entities sound like something out of the musters or the addams family, but the writing is excellent. ellis really knows how to suck the reader in. this was my first experience with his work and i have heard him be compared to authors like matthew stokoe and poppy britze but really he is in a league all of his own...few authors have the imagination and determination to hit success at such a young age and still write good books twenty years later...this book is hilarious sad, touching and brilliant...worth the money if you ask me."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"One of the best books written in the past 10 years..Excellent!"},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"I had not previously been a Bret Easton Ellis fan. I read \\"Less Than Zero\\" when it first came out and thought it was over-rated. None of his subsequent books appealed to me until I read about the new one. I'm glad I overcame my prejudices.\\"Lunar Park\\" is funny, scary and moving in equal measure. It can be enjoyed merely on its surface level, but it is much better appreciated as an allegory about family, failure and forgiveness.The only reason I gave the book 4 stars instead of 5 is that I think there is one significant gaping hole in the plot (unless I missed something). But even that flaw does not diminsh the entertainment value of the book or the profundity of the moving experience one will have from reading it and, even more, thinking about it after its ended.I am even inspired now to read more of Mr. Ellis's work."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"Having read good reviews of this and seen the author read parts himself, the reality turns out to be awful. There is no narrative tension, is aimed at a very low intelligence and at times is simply pompous. It's cynical criticism of rich suburban life in America is breathtakingly arrogant given the poverty of the world. The story borrows shamelessly from everything from cheap horror films, Spielberg, Ghostbusters and of course Stephen King. The main character staggers through the book not noticing the most basic clues until too late. For anyone who has read any half decent books in their life with real characters, this is just rubbish. My suspicion is in fact that it is written as a film script with dollars attached."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"Brett Easton Ellis has done it again. Throughout his career he has managed to \\"up the ante\\" with each successive piece of work to produce fascinating if not disturbing social commentary on the human condition while producing a vastly amusing and frightening read. Lunar Park is no exception as Eliss continues to mess with his readers while basically producing a brand new genre, which in it's own right is a worthy accomplishment.I kind of lump Ellis' books into two distinct categories. Less then Zero and Rules of Attraction fall into the first grouping- both centering on depraved and \\"emotionally dead\\" college students. American Psycho and Glamorama both fall into a kind of surreal uber-violent reality tale and obviously share similar themes with his first two books. Each has its own personality and niche in the Ellis cannon, and I was curious how he would follow up the underappreciated and hallucinatory Glamorama.So what is great about Lunar Park? First off, just like his other books, it's like nothing I've ever personally read. It's kind of a fictional self-autobiography meets Stephen King. This works so well because Eliss sucks you into his fascinating past while merging it with a fictional present that seems it could be real except for all the paranormal events that take place. He cleverly ties in characters and events from his literary creations that into the story, for instance in one scene a character shows up to a Halloween party dressed as Patrick Bateman, much to the dismay of Ellis. He talks about his past books and the way they've since affected him emotionally while going through the motions of his everyday fictional life. On top of all this, he is often his usual hilarious self while uncharacteristically being very poignant.Ellis had mastered the cautionary tale of moral ambivalence and I wasn't sure what to expect. Upon completion of the book, I'm ecstatic to see Lunar Park so personal, contemplative and touching. Even better is that he accomplishes this while repeatedly transgressing a line between reality and imagination in a throwback to his previous works. The way it all comes together and the little details of his fictional life are the frosting on the cake.Unfortunately I'm not sure how this book would read to someone unfamiliar with Ellis' previous works and I feel that it might not work at all since there is so much referencing (especially to American Psycho). You really need to have read his other books first and I pretty much was consciously thinking this throughout the entire book.Bottom Line: Arguably the best of Eliss' books and a worthy entry into his body of work."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"The latest Ellis novel was one of his fastest page turners to date. I loved the memoir style, an obvious riff on the many \\"real\\" memoirs that have recently been exposed as fiction. Fiction bifurcates from the truth around page thirty or so, when Ellis cracks up from the drugs and alcohol and marries an ex-girlfriend with whom he shares a son (which he had kept a secret for years). He moves into her house in an attempt to clean himself up and establish some sort of family life and at the same time write a new novel.Strange things start to happen, including a toy bird that seems to come to life and a copycat killer who emulates the murders from Ellis' book American Psycho. The most interesting aspect of the book is that we don't know if Ellis is telling the absolute truth, if he is hallucinating and imagining things because of the drugs, or if he is blacking out and committing the acts himself. We really don't know for sure about any of it until (SPOILER ALERT!) the ash ghost comes down the stairs in front of the ghost hunter's crew (unless the fictional Ellis hallucinated the entire film crew and the incident with them in the house, which would be impossible because they tented and fumigated the house later).The end of the book produces as many if not more coincidences as a Charles Dickens novel, but I was willing to suspend my disbelief because the fictional Ellis is an unreliable narrator and his minor details can be called into question. A lot of people mention having questions about unresolved issues, but I only found one loose end, one thing I wanted to know that was never revealed. What was the word his son wrote on the picture that was also written in his father's ashes in the bank box? Maybe I missed it, or maybe it wasn't there.I would recommend being familiar with Ellis' previous works before you read this (I've read all of his books several times), but I know people who have read this one first, enjoyed it, and moved on to American Psycho to fill in the gaps. I thought it interesting that he didn't mention the Rules of Attraction movie, even though he did talk about the other ones. I also liked the inclusion of Jay McInerney (writer of Bright Lights, Big City and Ellis' literary counterpart who I like okay but who is nowhere near as good as Ellis) as a character. It actually prompted me to pick up McInerney's new book, The Good Life. Overall, Lunar Park was a brilliant addition to the Ellis collection and well worth the wait."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"\\"Lunar Park\\" should be read as the 6th and latest experiment in a lifelong thesis by its author Bret Easton Ellis. One by one the literary reviewers, with their thumbs -up/thumbs-down approach to criticism, have fallen predictably into line and written its final chapter.Ellis is an extreme moralist writer who understands that the failure of this genre has been in the effective communication of its message through its chosen literary medium, the Parable.Ellis has been conducting an in-depth exploration, since the early 90s, into the \\"Parable\\", and how it can be tailored more effective as a means of communication. Ellis has gone about this in a much disciplined manner. He has taken the literary \\"novel\\", as an art form, and over the space of four novels (LTZ, TROA, AP & TI) has slowly chipped away literary conventions to try and indirectly get his message across. Ellis, as a moralist, has no mercy and he discovered that for a modern parable to be effective it must be merciless. This came to its natural crescendo in \\"American Psycho\\" when he discovered that a merciless parable, when misunderstood, can result in its main focus becoming the writer, not the parable.Ellis, learning from the aftermath of \\"American Psycho\\", turned his attention to this celebrity world in his following novel \\"Glamorama\\" which ultimately failed as he himself couldn't escape his now own \\"celebrity\\" writing style. \\"Glamorama\\", in my opinion, whilst satirical in a conventional way, is his most populist book.There was no where for Ellis to go, he couldn't \\"detach\\" from his novels anymore. Ellis had become mercifulAs almost a direct result of the disappointment of \\"Glamorama\\", \\"Lunar Park\\" has no mercy at all. \\"Lunar Park\\" has no feelings for any human expectations that you may have from this supposed \\"semi-autobiographical\\" novel. Ellis has quietly removed his heart from his sleeve in the only way he knew possible, by becoming as disciplined as he was during the writing of \\"American Psycho\\" and by trying to invent a novel that can release the author from the trap of stylistic expectation. By inserting a man called Bret Easton Ellis as the main character in this novel Ellis is not breaking new literary ground nor is he achieving any great stylistic liberation. Ellis has tried to move beyond this by slowly removing the \\"narrator\\" (i.e the writing, descriptive voice of the \\"real\\" Bret Easton Ellis) from outside the novel to become a major part of the dramatis personae of the book. Ellis has tried to create a complete work of fiction in every respect, including the narrator (i.e what we imagine is the descriptive voice of the \\"real\\" Easton Ellis. We have no problem believing that the man called Bret Easton Ellis in the book is fiction; a trip to his website will illustrate this clearly. However we still remain under the power of the traditional \\"narrator\\" of the book. Why wouldn't we? If we can't trust that convention, what can we trust? The narrator at the beginning of \\"Lunar Park\\" and also reintroduced in parts at the end is part of the fiction and it is behind the smokescreen of these two distinctly different but fictional \\"Bret Easton Ellis\\" characters that he manages to achieve his disappearing act and write his parable. But a parable it is and there are no facts present, no matter what you feel at the end, you truthfully know nothing more about Bret Easton Ellis than you did when you opened page 1. This complete fiction does however contain an underlying parable about father son relationships and about dealing with loss which is definitely worth the effort he has made to communicate to his readers.While undoubtedly a superior experiment to \\"Glamorama\\" this novel falls short of his \\"American Psycho\\" parable and may turn out to be his last, as you can only reinvent yourself so many times before you return to your original form."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"There has not been a time in recent memory that a modern novel has held me captivated to such an extent as Ellis' Lunar Park. Ellis has taken the first person narrative in the novel to a new level, cleverly mixing realism and the supernatural, confessional writing with celebrity gossip and urbane, suburban humour with the utterly macabre. The author's talent for writing terror is without question, i.e., American Psycho and particularly some of the short stories in The Informers, however, Ellis' true talent is his ability to satirize modern western culture, pointing out its inconsistencies, hypocrisies and insanities, revealing the irony in our values and making his observations seem very funny, uncomfortably funny. Lunar Park is horror in the suburbs with a humorous twist, yet at the same time, it is a serious and moving portrayal of drug use, personal loneliness and the dysfunctional modern family.Ellis begins the tale in a confessional style, giving the reader an inside look at his instant success with the novel Less than Zero, and his rocket ride into celebrity, including all the debasement - cocaine, orgies, literary groupies, twenty-thousand a week condos in the Hampton's - that one associates with major rock stars. Ellis did become a literary sensation, the alleged spokesperson for the young debauched 80's generation. The story of his last book tour is particularly painful as he was stoned and plastered most of the time. His father dies in 1992, and his world really crashes, when his ex-girlfriend, movie star, informs him that she's pregnant with his child. Of course he denies responsibility, blaming another man, but the tests proof he's the father, and eventually he marries her as she whisks him off to the suburbs to save him from himself, with promises of sobriety.Everything seems to going fine, writing a new book, a teaching job at the local Arts college, except he doesn't get along with his 11 year old son, he and his wife are in marriage counselling, (he sleeps in the spare room) and he is trying to have an affair with one of his students. At a Halloween party at their home, he packs his nose with a drug store, slugs down the vodka and attempts to seduce his student in the bathroom, and suddenly strange things start to occur. His stepdaughter's robotic toy bird becomes nasty, a man shows up to the party looking exactly like Patrick Bateman, the famous serial killer in his novel, American Psycho, and the lights in his home begin to do strange things. Is it the drugs and alcohol making him paranoid or something more sinister? In fact the novel just gets stranger and stranger until poor Ellis free falls almost into oblivion.What I found most enjoyable about this novel was the fine line Ellis walked between the incredible and so-called reality (are these events really happening) and his caustic observations on suburban middle-class values. These observations are curiously disturbing and hilarious at the same time - he knows how to write black comedy.I believe this is Bret Easton Ellis' best work to date."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"Where does sanity begin and end? Can moving to the suburbs bring you sanity, or lure you into insanity? In Bret Easton Ellis's brilliant new novel, LUNAR PARK --- his first in six years --- these ideas surface through the life of a character who surprisingly has the same name as the author. Is Ellis trying to tell the reader that this story is autobiographical, or is it some elaborate coincidence?Ellis's previous novels are disturbing, but they usually escape being categorized as horror. LUNAR PARK, despite its classification as literature, absolutely earns itself a place among the top works of horror. Interestingly, this is Ellis's least graphic and gruesome work. The highly symbolic gore and explicit sex that fills his other novels is sparse here. Its place is filled with intricate descriptions of the daily activities of a suburban family and the aesthetics of Ellis's home --- activities and settings that for most families would seem monotonous.The horror gradually builds throughout LUNAR PARK and takes place over twelve days. Bret Easton Ellis, a young and highly successful writer and author of five novels --- several of which brought him not only fame at a young age but also incredibly harsh criticism for insidious violence and sex --- has reconnected with old girlfriend/superstar/actress Jayne Dennis, the mother of his only son. Dennis also has a daughter, but from another relationship. Ellis joins the family and their mysteriously intuitive dog in a paradigmatic Suburbia where he hopes to leave drugs behind and focus on a new novel that has a purposefully lascivious and tawdry name. He also will perfunctorily teach one class at a nearby liberal arts college that highly resembles his alma mater.But Ellis's plans for peace are hindered by a reoccurring figure from his past. In addition, it seems that an obsessed fan and student at the college where Ellis now teaches is carrying out the murders from AMERICAN PSYCHO in nearby towns and trying to contact Bret and ruin his life.There is a supernatural element in this novel --- unique to Ellis's work --- that climaxes in the last seventy pages and leaves the reader completely transfixed and hooked. Glimpses of unnatural activity such as strange lights, ambiguous figures, peeling paint, vanishing children and sinister dolls continuously appear throughout the book, and all relate to that recalcitrant figure from the past. Further, Ellis, in a schizophrenic manner, develops a subconscious voice that makes itself very clear and calls itself The Writer. The reader follows Ellis through his dwindling cognizance and watches him teeter on a very thin line, not knowing which way he will turn, or fall. Ellis may regain a normal life and be a father to his son, forgetting about the innumerable missing boys that show up in the daily paper, or he may crumble into drugs, alcohol, money and delusion, never to be seen again. It all depends on a reconciliation with his past.LUNAR PARK, and especially its opening autobiographical format, has any serious Ellis fan --- like myself --- immediately hooked and impossibly trying to discern what is real from what is not. The novel remains compelling throughout with its magnificent description and seemingly banal dialogue for which Ellis is famous. This book is not only for the diehard fan. If this is your first Ellis novel, it will leave you craving more in a desperate attempt to fully understand what AMERICAN PSYCHO and LESS THAN ZERO are really about and why they brought this author so much fame and criticism. Bret Easton Ellis, who wrote the novel of his generation as a junior in college, has done it again.--- Reviewed by Scott Handwerker"},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"Really? A killer Turby? An apology for American Psycho? This autobiographical farce is impressive only in the number of way it manages to fall off target on so many levels.If you're familiar with his earlier books, there are some nice continuity references and a few insights into how all the nonsense that is Brett's writing career started.If you're not familiar with Ellis, this isn't a good book to start with. If you're a fan, you know what you're getting yourself in to when you start reading this garbage....."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"\\"Lunar Park\\" by Bret Easton Ellis is a haunting and complex masterpiece that is addicting, enjoyable and at times horrifying. I have only read two of his other novels (that being \\"Less than Zero\\" and \\"American Psycho\\"), and I can easily say that this is my favorite of the three. It's odd that those two are the only other ones I have read, as the book references those two exact books quite frequently. What starts out as a typical biography (that's the tone, anyway--doesn't mean all of it is exactly true) ends up being an account of something mysterious and at times terrifying.In the novel, Bret Easton Ellis has made himself a narrator and character. He takes us through the success of \\"Less than Zero\\" and the controversy that haunted him with the publication of \\"American Psycho.\\" He tells us that it wasn't exactly himself that wrote the novel, but it was something else inside of him. Success came too quick for Bret, as he is immediately plunged into a world of drugs and one night stands. His only saving grace was a relationship with an actress where a son was produced. Years later, Bret decides it's time to clean up his act and be there for Jane and his son, along with his stepdaughter.Easier said than done, Bret finds out. He is still boozing and drugging every chance he gets. Not only that, but there are some very odd things going on with the house that he and his family occupy. Paint peeling off the outside of the house, terrible scratching at the walls and doors that happen at night, blank e-mails from the Bank of America that keep popping up at the exact same time everyday, boys in his town disappearing without any explanation or trace, and the fact that furniture seems to rearrange itself without anybody's help. Of course, with Bret still being nowhere near sober it makes it hard for anybody to believe him that all of these strange things are really happening and that they are targeting him for whatever reason. All of this adds up to a mysterious and dark odyssey that will change Bret and his life forever.This may seem like your typical horror story, but I can promise you that it is not. This novel does a wonderful job of combining elements of horror, and also works as a meditation on the very act of writing and one coming to terms with his or her past. I found myself hooked on every word and found it almost impossible to put down. Ellis has written a superb book that has a lot of memorable moments, both scary and funny at times. It's a daring work of fiction that I have to believe he had a lot of fun working on. Nobody can produce a book like this without getting some sort of enjoyment or satisfaction out of it.\\"Lunar Park\\" won't be for everybody, that much is for sure. Some may not like how odd or bizarre it can get. And then there will be others like myself who end up loving every word. You do not have to have read the other books to enjoy this novel, although it really does help if you're familiar with \\"Less than Zero\\" and \\"American Psycho.\\" While there are some pretty gruesome moments of violence, it is nowhere near as graphic as \\"American Psycho\\" was.I am really glad that I took this bizarre and mysterious journey. I was also happy to find a book that ends up being complex and have many layers within itself. Not everybody will agree, but I think this is Bret Easton Ellis' masterpiece, and it shows us a writer who is still evolving and who is not afraid to take chances and go where others may fear. A 5-star book, without question. - Michael Crane"},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"When you read Ellis, you expect a twisted darkness that he has become known for. But the thing that fascinated me most with Lunar Park was his ability to combine fact and fiction so cleverly in this narrative. Reader beware that you should be familiar with his earlier works, namely American Psycho, and, to a lesser extent, Less than Zero prior to reading this novel.The first thirty pages are devoted to Ellis's autobiographical recollection of his early rise to fame as an aspiring young novelist upon the publication of Less Than Zero and the subsequent years of wealth, notoriety, drug abuse, and further publications. Then the fiction begins. A fiction so bizarre that the fabricated Bret's sanity is in question. Is his father really haunting him? Are his fictional characters really manifesting to come after him and his family? Is there a conspiracy involving his son and a multitude of missing boys? Is Patrick Bateman recreating violent murders straight from American Psycho?There are bits of Ellis's real life peppered throughout the horror that is Lunar Park, but the fiction is so unbelievable, one has to wonder what the lasting effects of heavy drug use and drinking had on both the author and his fictional self. There is the deep-seeded guilt involving his father, the paranoia and indifference that goes along with substance abuse, and the repercussions of the publication of American Psycho. Lunar Park is a great sinister book full of everything disturbing readers have come to expect from Ellis over the past twenty years."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"I've never read any of Bret's book before and I regret it because I've never laughed out loud so many times while reading a book in my life... in fact I don't know that I have ever! Bret's wit and sarcasm about the american way of life, particulary of living in the suburbs of Northeast US, is chillingly accurate. From the idiot neighbors competing with the Jone's, his sneaking around with drugs behind his wife's back and of course the great super natural twist... this book is a great escape."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"For the first thirty pages or so, I absolutely detested this book and wasn't sure that I could finish it. I was afraid Ellis was trying to and about to succeed out Austering Paul Auster (that isn't a compliment in my world). Then, around page 150, it hit me. This is an incredibly good book. In fact, it may just go on the short list of absolute, must-take-to-desert-island favorites.For those who love Ellis's wry depiction of violence and lack of sentimentality, this might not be a favorite. It's a huge departure from the usual Ellis themes - a morally flat society where violence, drug use, sex and any social taboo you can name is just another fashion. Here, the world isn't morally flat. Everything does have consequences, but not in the Dr. Phil sense he seems to be parodying here.This is also more of a writer's novel than his previous works. He definitely wrestles with the issues of what a writer creates; beyond that, he also seems to be addressing more difficult ideas such as Auden's idea that (to paraphrase) we choose our own traumas. In that sense, and in the Stephen King sense, it is a horror and one that resonates.To anyone looking for a haunting, more mature story I would recommend this and recommend sticking with it through the bombastic first section. As obnoxious as it can be, at the end it makes sense and it is the first time I've seen Ellis develop a character. The posturing, blas&eacute; enfant terrible Bret Easton Ellis in the first section is very different from the father who ends the novel and how Ellis moves the story between those points is entirely striking."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"Bret Easton Ellis has said this was his finest novel but it's just sentimental. Some of it seems unnecessary but I'm sure the author knows what he's doing. For my tastes I preferred Less Than Zero and American Psycho."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"Lunar Park had which I consider to be the mark of a good book; I did not want to stop reading though I also did not want to get to the end of it. A good dilemma to have and warranted by the engrossing writing and well thought out characters."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"One of the most introspective and creative novels I've ever read, Bret truly reaches the height of master with this emotionally engaging work"},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"I'm beginning to regard Ellis as the voice of generation X, but this slice of wealthy family life topped with a scoop of Dean Koontz never quite gels (like \\"Imperial Bedrooms\\" never quite blends it's famous characters with the movie industry.) Ellis has stunning powers of observation and fascinating literary language, but often struggles to tie them into a resonant conclusion. Still, it does have important things to imply about marriage and raising children today."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"This is a tough one to describe, but it's my favorite Ellis novel. Ellis aims this story at the classic horror genre but keeps steering the wagon off the rails into postmodern metafiction, a weirdly false autobiographical indictment of his own celebrity image, and some Cheever-esque forays into modern suburban gothic. If you have a twisted sense of humor, many scenes are genuinely hilarious. Perhaps most importantly, Ellis visits the complex emotions and dynamics of father-son relationships many times and with great effect - building to a transcendent ending to a novel so bizarre it almost feels unfair. In this reviewer's opinion, Ellis pulls it off masterfully and I look forward to reading it again."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"I believe many people don't \\"get\\" Ellis. If you don't you may expect more out of this autobiographical novel than you are going to get. I found the mix of \\"truthful\\" autobiography with allegorical narrative interesting and creative, but not compelling. On the more practical levels of plotline and readability I thought it was fairly tough going. I constantly wanted to \\"read ahead.\\" In retrospect I wish I had because I wouldn't have missed much. The middle of the work was horribly (ha-ha) repetitious. His important points (the domination of addiction in the life of the addict; the blurry line between a writer's real experiences and his invented ones; the elusive nature of truth; the psychoanalytically ironic aspects of parenting) were made early - that was enough."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"The blurring of fact and fiction had me for a while, but so much of Lunar Park is just redundant. I found myself skimming a lot in the second half and often saying, aloud, \\"Boring!\\" and \\"Stupid!\\" Ellis's intentions and influences are perhaps more interesting than the book itself. Still, it made an impression. Just barely squeaks by to 3 stars."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"Read more: http://cjlistro.blogspot.com/2012/08/review-lunar-park-by-bret-easton-ellis.htmlThe Basics: I've been slowly working my way through Ellis' life works, and I'm still going strong. While not as iconic as Less Than Zero or as breathtakingly brilliant as American Psycho, Lunar Park is still a fantastic, multilayered novel. I laughed from the very beginning, got a little teary sometimes, wanted to knock something over in rage otherwise. The Bret of this fictional autobiography is endearingly messed up. Even as you're screaming at him, you want so desperately for him to succeed. Embedded in an exciting murder-mystery plot is a beautiful commentary on the nature of writing and what it does to the writer.Plot (5/5): The first bit was slow and took me a while to get into; then I couldn't put it down. The majority of the book covers a short space of time, but so much happens that you're ever, ever bored. There's illicit affair, intrigue, missing children, murders, and plenty of Bret doing silly things. There's never a boring moment. Even when nothing is actually happening. That's true talent.Concept (5/5): Most of the characters are real. Most of the happenings are not. Or are they? It's confusing at times, delving between reality and fiction, but I think that's the most brilliant part of this book. You don't know what's real. Even in the plot--is Bret really watching the house magically transform, or is this a side-effect of his drug-addled mind? It's the perfect way to look at where stories come from and what they can really do. And it's just damn clever.Characters (5/5): Even when you hate them, you love them. Bret drove me bonkers. I wanted to throttle him and say, \\"Get your life together! Stop cheating on your wife! No more cocaine!\\" But I also wanted to hug him. A lot. Because you're in his head the whole time, and you realize just how lonely and ill-prepared he is. Jayne is frightfully annoying but you feel for her, dealing with her husband's antics. The kids are wonderfully eerie.Style (5/5): I miss the minimalistic style of Less Than Zero, which Bret mourns himself in the first chapter. I do love the style of this book, though. It's excessive. It's winding. It goes well with Bret's confusion and ever-working mind. You'd probably ramble too if you were on several different drugs, legal or not, and hallucinating evil beasties in your backyard. Makes it a little hard to follow, but I like a good challenge.Mechanics (5/5): I suppose you can add \\"run-ons galore\\" to this piece. But it's a style. It works for him. It's clearly not a mistake of editing."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"Ellis's novels have always bordered the threshold of horror. With his wild characters, and improbable scenarios, Ellis has always written about the darkest of human nature. His masterpiece to date, American Psycho, is a horror novel set in so-called real life mixed in with a bit of fantasy.With Lunar Park, Ellis goes one step further and surrounds his novel with a classic horror premise that could have been lifted right out of a Stephen King novel. Here, told in the first person by Ellis himself, the author recounts the horrors he faced during a so-called haunting. Living with his wife, son and step-daughter, Ellis is soon haunted by relics of his past. First, he receives weird emails with an attachment that shows a video of his deceased father. Then the police notifies him that a man dressed in a suit is killing people in the same way that Bateman did in American Psycho.Mixed to that a teddy bear that comes to life, an evil ghost dogs and weird happenings around his house and disappearing boys and you have a true tale of terror. And weird thing is, all of it works pretty well. I never thought Ellis's writing style would be well suited for suspense, but it is. Ellis has created a narrator that is so winy, so hastily disturbed it is both fun and thrilling to see him go through all these events.Although the story falls short in the end, and although some scenes feel somewhat repetitive, it is fun to see Ellis try something new and different for a change. Unlike his last effort, Glamorama, this novel is not over bloated with unnecessary subplots. This one is a very tight story that never bores.It's a great concept that King has used before; a writer is terrorized by a character in his own novel. But Ellis has fun with the idea and has created something wild, original and at times very funny. Any Ellis fan should greatly appreciate this one."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"If you like Bret Easton Ellis - and by that I mean you find him thought provoking, funny and twisted - I can't see why you wouldn't enjoy the hell out of this book. Lunar Park is a play on just about everything and it's an engrossing pager turner to boot.There are so many interesting threads being woven in this story that it is impossible not to be impressed with Mr. Ellis' evil genius. The story may drop you off a bit in the end, but you may find yourself, as I did, pondering the book in awe and grasping several layers of meaning that are well worth the thought."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"Ellis is such an intelligent writer, and really always has been. No one else can combine his level of biting humor with such a tangible sense of unease and deep paranoia. His work has always been somewhere in the realm of contemporized heightened satire--almost as if Oscar Wilde had done a lot of coke and had a lot more open sex.But Ellis has always been sharp enough to cleverly wrap himself up in the ever-more synthetic shades of illusory narrative he creates, casually eviscerating his own image along with his deadpan reports (not even really clear-cut condemnations) on the murderous and hedonistic indulgences of the corporate 80's, the wasted-out youth writhing on L.A. beaches, the sloppy sexual meanderings of snobby New England liberal arts majors, and the like. Violent outburts are immediately followed by a snickering tease. In Glamorama, for instance, a cataclysmic event rocks the narrative, but the protagonist, a self-obsessed model du jour, and bristling radioactive scenester, doesn't pause a beat before name-dropping all the celebrities wandering, dazed, out of the ash.In Lunar Park we are once again in the hands of a bruised narrator we can't entirely trust. Yea, there's something just so real and so unreal gurgling simultaneously that the book is rarely un-mesmerizing. I mean, let's say that all those painfully funny moments really occurred in the fantastic tell-all opening chapters. I can picture Ellis, in a heroin daze, being propped up by Barnes & Nobles employees while he attempts to get through his book tour, vomiting in limousines, getting drunk and throwing cash around with Jay McInerny at Spy Bar, dodging the paparazzi, getting into scuffs with Keanu--but I also know it didn't happen. There's a tormented and pained psyche dealing with the fallout of a monstrous father, of peaking too soon, of addiction, of forever being an outsider in a demanding world of insiders, of the challenges to fit in, the struggles to succeed as a husband, as a father.The Bret Easton Ellis of the real world lives a fairly quiet life in Manhattan. We all know this. His boyfriend of many years recently passed away, and Ellis seems to talk candidly, if not guardedly, of his childhood troubles and 80's-era bad boy behavior. But the Bret Easton Ellis of this novel is catapulted into suburbia by his longtime girlfriend Jayne Dennis, a movie star who he recently married, who wants Ellis to help raise their son, an 11-year old named Robby, and her daughter from a previous marriage. As hard as Bret seems to try to make it work, the harder his \\"family\\" seems to shut him out. We know he's a rich brat who seems to be always buying a bottle of Stoli, or calling his dealer, or wrapping his arms around the alluring female grad student doing her dissertation on him, and we know Bret isn't cut out for this world, that he's only trying because the alternative is far worse--drugged out loneliness, isolation, waking death...can we really sympathize with that?Actually, yea. As messed up as it all is...yea. At one point Jayne accuses Bret of putting on his \\"Jack Torrance act\\" and that pretty much really sums it all up, because what happens to Bret out in the suburbs tends to make The Shining look like a Disney movie.Ellis is masterly at slowly building the tension, until before you know it, we're knee-deep in a full-fledged nightmare--the horror intense, palpable, unashamedly ugly. As Bret tries so hard to lose all his demons, his demons find him. Literally. There are missing children, possessed toys, nighttime stalkers, crumpled monsters gliding down a winding staircase--and through it all, the rather formidable realization that Bret's literary creations are coming to life, and taking their revenge. And in a way, that's what all this is really about. How does one escape their past, their wounds, their bad memories, or their fears.Not all questions are ultimately answered. I think this may be intentional, but it doesn't make it less frustrating. The pages burn, but the ending is somewhat incomprehensible. We're left with a man yearning for salvation in a corrupt and glistening world of monsters and phonies. He can't be saved by his talent, by his wealth, or even by love. It's dark, sad, and tragically beguiling. It's true and yet maybe it's not true. I guess it doesn't all have to make sense. There are certainly mysteries left here, and holes not filled.It's simple, in a way. All great artists, it is said, just say the same thing over and over again in different ways. And this is what Bret Easton Ellis has to say."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"If anyone ever wondered about an NC-17 version of Catcher in the Rye, then he/she found out in 1985 with Less Than Zero. If any parent ever wanted the real phone call from their college kids, then they picked up The Rules of Attraction. American Psycho anyone?Bret Easton Ellis writes books on things society swears it doesn't want to hear about. He also writes books that are commercially successful and usually finished within two hours. Whether the pages flip through the corroded, matted streets of Los Angeles or flutter up toward the skyscrapers of New York, Ellis creates a world that is nothing but uncomfortable, campy and interestingly realistic. This time he's turned to \\"non-fiction.\\"Lunar Park is about a haunted writer named Bret Easton Ellis who's highly successful, has written four to five books, is raising a broken family, and is the sole creator of Patrick Bateman. Wait a second, you're thinking, who wrote this book? Bret Easton Ellis.In what was earlier described as a memoir, Lunar Park is everything that is not linear. The book passes over generic horror, familial melodrama, and of course, Ellis's tongue-in-cheek cynicism. This is a book with Bret Easton Ellis, but think of a parallel universe, one where stuffed-animals attack and fictional characters actually become reality. In other words, this is the melting down of a writer who writes about melting down.No real tricks here, but the formula is so exciting, so enticing, that this is a highly original and organized piece of work. One might even think Ellis went so far as to live some aspects of his life just for the pages themselves. Anyone who reads it might wonder where the lines between fiction and non-fiction dissipate, and the barriers of fictional reality and fictional fantasy lie. Perhaps this is the melting down of the reader; the writer is just taking anyone along with him.And while Ellis has recently discussed a follow up to Less Than Zero, look no further for his follow up to American Psycho. Lunar Park acts as the predecessor, only the complexities in dealing with the real life Patrick Bateman. Imagine the remorse the writer might feel if such a character could exist. Lunar Park takes the reader into alleys and passages of American Psycho that only Ellis would have known when typing the actual book.Interestingly enough, Lunar Park is the first novel of the new millennium for Ellis. Just reading the first 50 or so pages, it is quite clear Ellis' eyes have been open for quite some time. Duly noted descriptions hint that this seemingly present world is an America deeply distraught, where terrorism exists everywhere, and surprisingly, nobody cares. Life is just as it is: medicated children running rampant and clueless adults adapting to newer ways of achieving oblivion. All the horror in the book shadows his commentary, making them more of a subtle hint than a flat out statement.While Lunar Park is original for Ellis, the book is not so important on a literary sense as it is for Ellis himself. This novel is Ellis cleaning out the closet and throwing the skeletons either in the grave or some far away, damp swamp. He really digs into his own soul, and it shows. Regarding his writing, however, rather than having a free sway with his words, Ellis seems to carve and sculpt a story. Some of the areas are fast and alarming, while other pages are drawn out and slow. This is one of the first books of his where it actually reads like a different writer at times. A new ground for Ellis and, after seven years, I'm impressed.So curl up, grab the book and perhaps enjoy being scared of the things under your bed, outside your home, working in your office, living in your neighborhood, driving next to your car, and maybe, just maybe, the demons dwelling in your country.In this book, as usual, there is no exit."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"Bret Ellis' latest novel is far and away the best of his three novels I have read, the other two being LESS THAN ZERO and AMERICAN PSYCHO. Gone is much of the nihilism as well as the endless gratuitious sex scenes among people of all persuasions from his former writing. Of course the snow in this novel is still in the bathroom and not on the front walk, and designer labels and name-brand products abound. The protagonist, however, is a writer approaching middle-age named Bret Ellis who desperately seeks to establish a relationship with both his wife and his young son as well as to put to rest the ghost of his recently deceased father.While I'm usually put off by writers who name characters in novels after themselves, Mr. Ellis had to do that here in order for the reader to make any sense out of a character who keeps turning up named Patrick Bateman, whom we recognize from AMERICAN PSYCHO. For the most part the technique works.In a recent interview Mr. Ellis said that LUNAR PARK is in part homage to Stephen King, the acknowledged master of horror stories, as this one is. It is much more than that with an intricate plot with clever plays on words-- \\"terby\\" and \\"307 Elsinore Lane\\" for example-- a most moving ending that is beautifully written and the universal theme of a man who seeks to be a decent father and to make peace with the memory of his own father. The most interesting thing about Mr. Ellis' interview was that he announced that he was reading Marilynn Robinson's GILEAD, a novel about as far away from Mr. Ellis' stories as one can get and still remain on the same planet.I almost didn't read this book. I'm glad I did."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"Ellis is as narcissistic, detached and cynical as he has ever been in his previous novels, but Lunar Park has a little something extra.It's wonderful to follow an author and slowly see his/her writing change, to develop and fill in those gaping holes. Ellis promises halfway through this painfully self-aware bit of meta-fiction that he will change, that there will FINALLY BE CHARACTER GROWTH. Ellis will confront the ghost of his father and reach a sort of reconciliation with him. In fact, the character of Ellis is constructed to be much like his father, and there is a strange blending between Ellis, his Father, and his Son, Robby. The trouble with this book is not only that the horror segments waffle between the vibrant and haunting and the trite and farfetched, but Ellis gives the reader what I considered to be an extremely vexing middle finger. There is only the illusion of progression, the HINT of a point to his narrative. Lunar Park explores and almost hopefully reaches forward into the narrator's life, but in the end, Ellis only frustrates. He's such a tease.But at any rate, this book offers so much more than any of his previous novels, which wallowed around in superficialities, hoping to rise above them through satire. Maybe he finally realized that his writing style alone can't pull him through a career focused on sex and drugs. He has to break new ground, and he does. Ellis is brave enough to ALMOST take a stand for something in this book, and for that I applaud him."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"I was very suprised with this book, especially since it was Bret Easton Ellis's first horror style novel. It started off telling about Bret's tour to promote Glamorama and his drug and alcohol use during that time, this part of the book seemed almost non-fiction very descriptive. Then it suddenly turned into a book about a man trying to become a good father and husband. This book was very good from cover to cover even though some might not think so. Also I would like to warn that the end of the book is very sad, I did shed a few tears after I was finished reading it and I am not usually affected by books the way i was by Lunar Park."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"After finishing American Psycho, someone mentioned a preference for Lunar Park. Since I happened through the library later that day, I grabbed it off the shelf. Lunar Park is a very different kind of Ellis book--much more Dean Koontz than it is the Easton Ellis of yore--a departure from the grim characters living in an uncaring society to a story about a man that is trying to find answers; to move from death back into life. Conversations in this book have more meaning than in previous books. That is to say, speaking about material things in previous books was objectively important, but I'd lump all conversations into that one category, seemingly repetitive. In this book, each conversation was more its own unique entity and purpose.Lunar Park is touted as a semi-fictional autobiography, which made it interesting. Before I knew this, I actually looked up the actress Jayne Dennis to see who she was. As much as I love/hate Ellis' work, I was disappointed that his style had changed. Instead of a bold statement cut from a slice of someone's life and recorded in words, this was practically a complete story from beginning to end. I wasn't fond of his foray into the world of fantasy, but I did like how he wove characters and plot into this novel from his previous books. Enjoyable read, but not thought provoking."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"As a huge Ellis fan, I really wanted to like this book, and approached it with an open mind, despite having heard quite a few negative (as well as some highly positive) reviews from fellow Ellis fans.While the first chapter of the book (where Ellis recounts his own life and success) was captivating, I just found the rest dull and redundant overall. This is not to say that it doesn't have its merits - its account of suburban life is spot-on, and the book also gives you a glimpse into Ellis' inner world. For me, this last aspect alone made it worthwile to read, but after finishing the last page, I was missing that \\"Oh my God...\\", staring into space for long seconds moment that I got from his other works (Glamorama, Less than zero)."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"I found this to be one of the most bizarre, creative, and entertaining books I've ever read. It's so hard to describe, though, that I've had to leave and come back to this review a dozen times!Ellis, who shot to what was really unprecedented stardom in both literary and Hollywood circles with Less Than Zero, then followed it up with one of the most controversial publishing events in history with American Psycho (historical because the original publishing house was pressured so heavily from the media and local activist groups that they pulled the book and forfeited the advance, at which point another house snatched it up and ultimately garnered Ellis ten gazillion times more from its publication than he probably would have without all the hullaballoo), makes himself the main character here, writing in the first person and using his own name as well as his ex-wife's, son's, and other family and friends. Harrison Ford and Jay McInerney make appearances. Yet it's not an autobiography, as Ellis is quick to remind us, and while much of it is a true story, much of it is invented - and the kicker is that you have no idea where that line is.You can't even put it in a genre. It starts out as a pseudo-autobiography, evolves into a mystery, and ends as a horror novel! (Ellis has even said at one point that he was paying homage to Stephen King, whom he admires). The first third of the book, where Ellis gives us a wonderfully detailed, razor-sharp snapshot of his life and times as The Big Thing in both Hollywood and New York, was so funny that I burst out laughing more than once. That doesn't happen often! I remember sitting outside by the pool as I was reading one part - a description of the newest novel the Ellis \`character' was working on - and started laughing so hard that my neighbors, also outside, went quiet. I know they were wondering about the crazy lady next door laughing to herself. But god, it was HYSTERICAL.But Ellis is no David Sedaris (although he CAN write that kind of humor, as this book makes obvious), and soon, a real-life incident wherein the murders in American Psycho were being copycatted becomes the focus, and Ellis' deceased father, Robert, plays a key role. Those who know any trivia about Ellis are aware that he had a very volatile relationship with his father, who died under somewhat vague circumstances during a period that he and his son were no longer speaking, and this lack of resolution is very obviously a key issue in Ellis life. The main character in American Psycho, Patrick Bateman, was partly based on Ellis' father. Most of the story is told during the time period that Ellis was married to actress Jayne Dennis, with whom he has a son (Ellis is bi-sexual and later had a long relationship with a younger man who died of AIDS a few years ago, and to whom the book is dedicated along with Ellis' father, Robert).At the end of it all (no spoilers, don't worry!), this book is about Ellis' struggle with himself and the demons both created and inflicted, and is a candid and creative dissertation on coming to terms with the things that haunt us. I found it absolutely compelling, funny, surreal, and touching, and somehow very honest and sneaky at the same time. A really good read and I enjoyed every word."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"I am a big fan of Mr. Ellis's work and I just finished this book this morning. I am left with a haunted feeling and actually cried during the last few pages. I can't say that I loved this book because at times, I wanted to strangle him because of his self absorbtion, his lack of seeing anyone but himself but toward the end, I began to understand. It's a very complicated book, and very dark, with a hopelessness to it. I found it hard to get through sometimes, meaning that it was kind of muddy, but I am glad that I read it. It had more of a message than his other books and I do suggest reading his other books first because you may be kind of lost if you don't since there are so many references."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"Every time I read the professional and \\"semi-pro\\" reviews on each of Ellis' works, I'm always amused at how much extreme impact he has on people - whether positive or negative. I look at how many people are deeply offended by his words (for good reason) and how many other people are deeply moved (also for good reason), and I am just thankful that he has the degree of impact on people that few authors do.\\"The Tale of 2 Brets\\" is another solid entry in a long line of successful novels about the emptiness of modern life and the road it leads to, and \\"Lunar Park\\" is the one that ends on the strongest note up to this point in his career (still haven't read \\"Imperial Bedrooms\\" so I can't say on that one).While the beginning and ending sections of this book are phenomenal, much of the middle lacks a narrative that fully captivates me in the way that some other novels do. Granted, it's a very good story, but just not on the same level with other works that have kept me fully entertained from start to finish. In any event, the beauty of Ellis' writing is that there is so much depth and significance that I'm continuing to glean on additional readings of his work; if you have read any of his books and only see \\"surface, surface, surface\\" then you need to take another very critical look at it.What this novel can teach us about human life in an insulated (yet paranoid and soulless) society - and what it means to face up to who and what we have become in the context of inter-family relationships, it's exceptional. If you're reading this novel and getting anything less than that, take another look. For me, there are few works that are as fulfilling as this one.*****___(Perfection) The highest degree of enjoyment / fulfillment I've personally experienced with reading****___(Excellent) Only lower than five stars due to falling short on any number of \\"subjective\\" categories****____(Influential) A very satisfying experience and has me looking for more from this writer/genre***____(Good) Keeps me engaged but unlikely to look for more by this writer unless highly recommended***_____(Average) Could take it or leave it and will not be looking for more by the same writer**______(Poor) Constantly asking myself, \\"How much worse can this get?\\" every few minutes*_______(Terrible) Belongs in the dumpster...

I've never even seen any of the movies that have resulted from his books. In fact, the only reason that I stumbled upon Lunar Park is because I am a huge fan of the band Porcupine Tree, and I read that their album Fear of a Blank Planet was partially inspired by ideas in this book. That was enough to make me check it out. I'm glad I did.Right away, from the very first chapter, I was captivated by this book. Ellis's writing style is very easy to comprehend and filled with strong imagery. I thought that the story was presented in a very unique way; told in the first-person point of view of Ellis himself, beginning in a way that is very close to being autobiographical and transitioning into fiction. Through the book we see Ellis's character grow as he is forced to confront his own inner demons as well strange events in the world around him, all while attempting to fix his personal relationships. The book does well at dealing with themes of alienation, regret, responsibility, growth, and the dehumanization of society in general (especially the younger generation). All the while, the book remains very entertaining and becomes very suspenseful, almost frightening, at times.Lunar Park is a great piece of introspective literature from Brett Easton Ellis. It has been a while since I've come across a book that took over my life while I was reading it, and this book did exactly that. The book was a highly entertaining read that was near impossible to put down. The social commentary embedded in the story also made me think, albeit not too favorably, about the youth in the world today and where we are heading to. All in all, I highly recommend this book, whether you are a fan of Ellis's work or not. Incidentally... it made me appreciate the Porcupine Tree album even more!"},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"Why Brett, why? This novel started off so well, it made me curious, it made me laugh out loud, and I was recommending it to people before I even finished. But then came that ending, that dreadful empty nothing of an ending! It was beyond cryptic; it was devoid of the answers I finished the book for in the first place. I actually had to come and read some reviews to see if I somehow missed something but apparently I didn't. Brett, you really should have sat on this one for another year until you had an ending that was worthy of the story."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"I thought this was Ellis' best book yet!

Less than Zero, the Informers, yes... American Psycho, Glamorama (he lost me there. totally, completely). I always forget about the rules of attraction. Meh.Lunar Park is, by far, my favorite one. Even above American Psycho. I guess it's because I, too, have settled down a bit. Had a child, quit the coke. The soda, I mean. It really spoke to me. How it can be a little hard looking back at what you've been through and the habits that you've made and now, you must TRY. Family dynamics, drug therapy. lol, the DOG is on anti-depressants. THE DOG!This is the funniest and most truthful I've ever seen Mr. Ellis be. After reading Glamorama, I knew he had to kick the dope habit. I mean, GEEZ! I felt like I was high. American Psycho is always going to be a classic, personally. There's nothing like it. But this novel is flippin' awesome! I laughed out loud in a couple of spots (which is VERY rare for me when it comes to a novel). So, buy it.

I wish I would have read his other books prior to reading this so I wasn't as out of touch, however, most was explained and it didn't impact my enjoyment from this book at all. I only wished I had more of an insight into his mind!"},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"I've never been so divided by a book's first and second halves. A longtime Ellis fan who read Glamorama with one eye closed but came to appreciate it deeply long after it was finished, I can say that the same is not true of Lunar Park.The first half is amazing. It's a great return to form for Ellis, but adds new layers of self-reference and pitch-black comedy that I found very refreshing and daring. Seriously, the first half is one of the funniest books I've ever read. He makes no bones about criticizing himself (via a hall-of-mirrors alter ego named Bret Easton Ellis) or his own reputation as a writer. It's great stuff.And then it falls apart. I can't say he didn't take a big risk with the second-half descent into Stephen King-like internal torture, but it is neither enjoyable reading or revealing of anything at all. At least with Glamorama, I may not have ENJOYED it exactly, but I couldn't ignore its ability to reveal, re-contextualize and then distort its own world. In this book, I couldn't help feeling like the steps taken in the second half worked only to its detriment. It felt easy. Granted, great writers sometimes please (read: tease) their audience into thinking that their style is effortless, but that isn't the case here.Not recommended. He's written far, far better books."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"Absolute masterpiece, this is Ellis's best book in my opinion..It blows my mind to read some of the negative reviews here, but then again I would be skeptical of a Bret Easton Ellis book that was a critical success."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"It's really hard for me to position this book as if I like it or not. I have read all his other books (except for The Informers) and enjoyed every one, I think Glamorama is my favorite. Anyways the beginning of this book is very, very interesting since Ellis puts himself out there and has such a story to tell with becoming famous at a young age. But when it moves toward the actual story, I found quite a disconnect. I find it really hard to explain the book since it gets fairly twisted and disturbing but if you are looking for a similar book to his others, this is not one of them."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"I had never read a Bret Easton Ellis book so I didnt know what to expect.

These things made me appreciate the writing and story line, but i just couldn't connect with the charicters, I could see the drama but couldnt feel it.I felt that i was looking in on somebodys deep and personal problems who had written them down to help them work out thier problems. I felt that B E E was using me ( or the audiance) to help him out and i just diddnt want to get drawn in. I felt like i diddnt belong.

Don't buy into that! This terrible waste of perfectly good blank paper is nothing more than Ellis indulging his love for his own ego, and accomplishing two things at once: turning out another book after being off the literary scene for nearly a decade, and getting himself talked about once again, this time by making his main character, more or less, himself.Ellis can write. Rules of Attraction and American Psycho prove that. And that's why I have so little patience with this man who wasted my time back in college when I read Glamorama, and now did it again with this cliche-ridden goes-nowhere commercial for his own past books. This story about a writer (Ellis himself) and his miserable life with his estranged son, dead father, unhappy ex-lovers and pursued college girls is, I kid you not, a really, really bad read right down to its apparently possessed stuffed animal and annoyingly under-utilized re-visit from Patrick Bateman.No, Bret, the good times I had reading the novels you wrote that I actually liked will not get me to give you one more star on this piece of junk, not even out of sympathy.

It was so promising that I kept reading at breakneck speed hoping for the pay-off. Instead what I got was sleezy Stephen KIng rip-offs.

Much like his alter-ego character, Mr. Ellis got lost instead of making the effort to be found."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"I've never given a book a negative review, preferring to \\"say nothing at all if you can't say something nice ..\\". This, however, was a truly awful book - one I am sure would never have been published if the author wasn't already Someone Famous. I've never read a novel and had to take so many breaks to puzzle over what in the world was the author trying to say; flipping back pages and rereading in the hopes that this (previously excellent) author was perhaps making sense after all. No dice. I had to laugh out loud when I saw that there were positive reviews comparing this effort to Lovecraft or Poe. The only \\"dream-like\\" quality this book had was that it is nightmarishly bad. It is self-indulgent, disjointed, disorganized, and poorly imitative of a half-dozen horror authors.

It's truly one of those books you wish you had never read so that you could have that Virgin Voyage experience all over again. Read it, if you have not. This is a very, very fine work."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"\\"Lunar Park\\" is probably Ellis' best, most readable novel since \\"Less Than Zero.\\" The influences you can spot are many. The writer using his own public persona as the protagonist surely comes from Philip Roth, most notably his classic \\"Operation Shylock.\\" Ellis provides some pungent satire on contemporary suburbia, so the title probably hearkens back to John Cheever'sBullet Park. (The revelation after his death of Cheever's ambiguous sexuality no doubt also interested Ellis.) But the main thing Ellis does is offer up an homage to Stephen King (Ellis' fictional wife even calls him \\"Jack Torrance\\" at one point, who of course is the protagonist of \\"The Shining\\", a book to which this novel owes a whole lot.)The first chapter of \\"Lunar Park\\" may be the most clever thing Ellis has ever written. It's an autobiography that agrees with every bad review, every unflattering press article ever written about the guy. He says he wrote all his books under the influence of drugs, quickly and for the money; he's a monster of sexual promiscuity and excess who incidentally sired a son out of wedlock more than 10 years before. He recounts his tortured relationship with his late father (to whom \\"Lunar Park\\" is dedicated). You get the feeling here that Ellis is burning down the edifice of his public career, burning all the bridges to his past. It's hilarious and horriying, and must have taken a lot of courage to write.The first half of \\"Lunar Park\\" is mesmerizing (I managed to finish the book in one night.) He paints an alarming picture of Parenthood In The Suburbs; eveyone, including the very young children, is on some sort of mood-stabilizing medication; the children are scheduled, dieted, and psychoanalyzed to within inches of their lives; the main focus of eveyone's life is money, possessions, and how to get them. It's a society full of living corpses, which is where I suppose Ellis got the idea to turn his book into a horror novel. This proves to be a mistake. The second half of the novel wobbles badly because he simply doesn't have the storytelling chops to make it work. Elite critics can sneer at Stephen King all they like, but he is a master of his craft, and Ellis suffers badly by comparison. Ellis just piles up one horrific incident after another and hopes they cohere into some kind of organic whole, which they really don't. The imagery in the climactic \\"attack\\" of the demons seems to have been inspired by the dog scenes in John Carpenter's masterpiece \\"The Thing.\\"The most striking thing about this book is how, depending on how literally you take it, Bret Ellis hates himself. The demons attack because they want to force him to confront the \\"disaster\\" of his life. The ghost of his father (\\"Hamlet\\" is also a big influence) wants to warn Ellis of an impending loss, as well as to force Bret into dealing with his memory. These metaphors are powerful and true and overcome much of the technical messiness of the book. As a man enters middle age the past screams at him for resolution, and Ellis does his best to meet the challenge in this flawed, interesting book"},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"This really surprised me. Despite what some of the major reviews have implied, this book has very little of the sort of druggy debauchery, and none of the sex, that Ellis' earlier books are known for, despite a plot which forces us to travel back through those same books. What it does have - and have in spades - is a sense of underlying dread that, while present in much of his previous writing, has never been brought to life quite this well. It's horror, but a dreamy horror, more like Lovecraft or Poe than Thomas Harris. Another reviewer here likened \`Lunar Park' to Stephen King, and while that reviewer meant it as an insult (I think) it's not a bad comparison. This is a book filled with ghouls and hallucinations, but also real-world horrors: alcoholism, self-hatred, and \`antagonism', which, as we learn from a well-drawn exorcist towards the end of the novel, can literally turn a man to ash. There is also the horror of children. In \`Lunar Park' we are both afraid FOR them, and afraid OF them - one minute they're having nightmares and need protecting, the next minute they're keeping secrets from us and possibly faking their own abductions. The parents in the book all medicate their kids mercilessly, which only serves to underscore the separation between parents and children, between our lives as we would like to see them, and our lives as they really are.And then there's the writing. It's wonderful. There's a passage on p.55 - \\"The newspapers kept stroking my fear. New surveys provided awful statistics on just about everything...\\" - that offers one of the better descriptions of the post-9/11 mindset I've come across. And the last few pages, in which Ellis makes a shaky truce with the ghost of his father, are heartbreaking (my eyes filled up - I'm not kidding). The only weak scene in the book is the Halloween party that kicks off the whole story - the dialogue between Ellis and Jay McInerney (who makes a cameo appearance) seems so empty that one wonders why Ellis bothered writing it down (then again, maybe he was making a point about those brat-pack days of yore). But this is nitpicking - on the whole Ellis is terrific here.**On a side note, one book that \`Lunar Park' seems to echo, and not just in its title, is John Cheever's classic \\"Bullet Park.\\" Cheever's book was another story of suburban horror, drenched in alcohol and general despair, with an ending that Ellis could only admire: a guy uses a chainsaw to cut through the doors of a church to save his son from being burned to death by a cold-blooded sadist. Ellis' book does for our generation what Cheever's did for his, and they make great tandem reading (I went back and reread Cheever right after \`Lunar Park.')"},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"Lunar Park is a supposedly true account of terrifying hauntings that occurred in writer Bret Easton Ellis's life over a series of days immediately following Halloween. Ellis's first chapter alone makes the book a worthwhile read--he recounts his entire life, all of his published novels, all of his excesses, and it makes for great reading. Any Ellis fan should definitely read the first chapter to see a glimpse inside a larger-than-life literary figure.Starting in Chapter 2, the strange occurrences in his small Northeast college town start taking place. Ellis is, for the first time, trying to live a family life with the mother of his eleven-year-old son, as well as her younger daughter by another man. Ellis is haunted my memories of his father, his father's death, and mysterious emails at the time of night when his father died. Then murders ala Patrick Bateman from American Psycho start occurring in the town (but not in the newspapers), and the Ellis household starts to unravel completely. No one believes Ellis's accounts of the hauntings due to his excessive drinking and drug use. Ellis himself casts doubt on many of the occurrences. His children witness some of the hauntings, but prove to be unreliable witnesses when questioned by other grown-ups after the fact.One shocking aspect of the book has nothing to do with the hauntings, but with Ellis's conflict with his super-children and the way privileged youngsters are raised these days. Ellis is coming off being a hard-partying self-reliant (but not completely functional) man, and it is hard for him to relate to his children, who are on numerous cocktails of medications to perfect their behavior. They attend a school where violent costumes aren't permitted for Halloween because some children might get scared, but when children tried to find \\"appropriate\\" costumes, everyone freaked out en masse, so no Halloween costumes at all were permitted. They go to birthday parties which have \\"rehearsal\\" parties to ensure that all the young attendees will get along and respond positively to the enrichment activities. None of the food at these parties contains any dairy, wheat, gluten, or corn syrup (heaven forbid!). At dinner parties, parents obsessively discuss nothing but their children--nursery school as a \\"portal\\" into the world, acupuncture for nine-year-olds, the need to cut pasta from the school lunch program, Pilate's for two-year-olds, all of which Ellis describes as a fanatical need for parents to get a return on their investment [p. 133]. At parent-teacher conferences, Ellis overhears a teacher explaining to a concerned couple that the average platypus should look \\"less deranged\\" than the one their child drew. The reader can hardly blame Ellis for turning to alcohol to zone-out from this child-obsessed world, so foreign from anything he's lived in before.Overall, this book is creepy, as Ellis continues to see and experience stranger and stranger things, and no rational adult believes what he is witnessing. It'll keep you up late at night if you try to read it then. It also provides excellent insight into why Ellis wrote American Psycho and how it related to his true-life experiences with his father. I would recommend this book to any Ellis fan as a must-read, because of what he reveals about his personal life, but as someone who has only read one Ellis book (Less Than Zero), it was still completely readable. Ellis doesn't assume the reader knows anything about his novels, and fully explains any references. Pick this one up and prepare to be chilled!"},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"Like many, I was so impressed by Bret Easton Ellis's first three novels that I was prepared to read anything with his name attached to it. I stuck by him after the tediousness of The Informers and the absurd and overlong Glamorama because, for the most part, his writing was as good as ever - he was just losing his thematic edge. Unfortunately, Lunar Park represents a further step into banality as not only is its plot ludicrous and its theme largely irrelevant to society at large, but for the first time Ellis's writing appears awkward.Lunar Park tells the story of a celebrity novelist making a tentative attempt at fatherhood and a life in the suburbs. As the novel progresses it becomes apparent that his house is haunted by the ghost of his father, his daughter's doll is possessed by an evil spirit, a string of murders copycatting American Psycho are being committed, his son may or may not be kidnapping his classmates, the oil leaking from his BMW is the blood of JFK, the nuts in Snickers bars hatch into the things from the Alien movies, he eats an undercooked Whopper blah blah blah who cares. Terrifying, right?It is ironic that there is so much that can be said about Lunar Park while the book itself says so little. Ellis zig-zags haphazard through the themes of father-and-son, overmedicated society, fiction-into-fact and supernatural occurrence, but spends so little time on each and links them so clumsily that it is impossible for the reader to gain any insight into them, assuming that Ellis himself had any insight to impart to begin with. The supernatural portions that dominate the last third of the book are particularly cringe-worthy as Ellis makes a self-confessed - and poorly advised - homage to Stephen King despite the obvious incompatibilities of their styles. There comes a point when the absurdity of Ellis using his hyper-realistic style to recount the occasion on which a possessed mechanical toy bird grew fangs and gnawed at his trousers becomes apparent. The blurb's conceit that this is an autobiography of sorts is really just a poorly conceived vice to mask Ellis's comprehensive failure to create a suspension of disbelief in his fiction.It is strange that despite using himself as the lead character and musing on his reactions to his father's death, Ellis still cannot create any sort of emotional resonance within his work. This is a particularly salient failing as one of Lunar Park's primary drives is the assumption of empathy on behalf of the reader, predominantly in relation to Ellis's own character. Ellis begins the book by characterising himself as being only slightly less vacuous than Victor Ward and only slightly more sensitive than Sean Bateman, yet come part two we are immediately meant to empathise with this self-absorbed idiot because he's making some small attempt at self-betterment. This is a stark departure from Ellis's previous novels in which such characters were always presented, rightfully, as objects of derision.Plot has not traditionally been the focal point of Ellis's novels either, however in Lunar Park it forms the unsteady structure around which the rest of the story is awkwardly plastered. Multiple plots and sub-plots are created and dropped on a whim and ultimately fail to combine into any sort of cohesive whole because the connections that Ellis eventually draws between them are so patently stupid. The lame anagram in the doll's name, the unknowable significance of the house's address, the dumb coincidence in the Harrison Ford movie. It's like, please baby, spare me.Towards the end of the novel there is a scene in which Ellis (the character) writes the death of Patrick Bateman. The symbolic significance is not hard to grasp. Ellis wrote American Psycho over a decade ago so let's just move on. The problem with this is that American Psycho was an insightful, entertaining, devastatingly funny, razor-sharp social satire. It is one of the best books I have ever read. Lunar Park is self-indulgent drivel. Despite his relentless shallowness Patrick Bateman was a remarkably complex character while the Bret Easton Ellis of this novel can be read clearly straight up-and-down like so many other clich&eacute;s - daddy daddy why don't you love me - and his problems are simply uninteresting. So if Ellis wrote Lunar Park to cleanse himself of his past, where to from here? Let's hope that it's somewhere much closer to Earth."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"It was hard for me to know how to read this book. I had read all of his previous work, but did not remember much except that none of his books could ever come close to the power of AMERICAN PSYCHO. (And regardless of your feeling about the book, you can't argue it wasn't powerful.)I was therefore convinced that Ellis had peaked and that everything else he wrote would be points marking his descent. Convinced that LP would be derivative, weak, or worst of all, a shock-filled imitation of AP, as I sometimes felt with his previous novel, GLAMORAMA.Nothing could be further from the truth. Ellis can write! Instead of finding a stylish copy of previous works, I found that LP is mature in its handling of each moment. More mature than any of Ellis' previous works.Instead of characters moving listlessly from one profound (yet unexplored) situation to the next, as in previous work, these characters interact with each other and learn and grow and react! I know this sounds very clinical, but that was sometimes how his previous characters felt to me, even the fully realized ones.These characters do their best to respond to an increasingly surreal environment. An environment which closes in on them even as they are trying to control it. The result of which is the most easily accessible plot in his catalogue, deftly told and even an intelligent mystery in it's own way."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"I wanted very badly to like this book. The first chapter was excellent. There was so much promise. I even got excited when I found characters from the book with their own homepages. There are so many ideas that I love in this book that I was sad to see them wasted. It is intense and spooky... but thats about the only thing going for it. In total I found it to be a mess. There was no direction whatsoever. There was no character development (the main character is so frustratingly oblivious you will want to strangle him).With much of the books lifted from what I attribute to Stephen King novels and The House of Leaves by Danielewski I say read the originals. At least those writers are not completely full of themselves."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"First of all, I am a huge Bret Easton Ellis fan. I've enjoyed all his previous books - even the less coherent ones - and I loved Glamorama. So waiting seven years for his next book may have given me unrealistic expectations for his latest work. Having said this, though, I have to say that I found this book pretty disappointing. The first \\"autobiographical\\" chapter, as pointed out by other reviewers, was hilarious, biting, and insightful. However, the story that followed it was not. At least, not at the level I expect from this author. I thought the ideas the book began with (esp. re: his writing and his father) were great but unfortunately, they lacked any real coherant follow-through. I know this can be said of most of Ellis's work, and as a fan of his, follow-through and coherence are not totally required for me. However, here's the important distinction - his earlier books were thrilling to read, and hilarious, even when they were incoherent at times. And they eventually made sense. Even though there were some good moments, at times, reading this book is a little bit of a chore, as the narrator meanders around some of the issues in a kind of uninteresting way, and the reader waits for the other shoe to drop. Which, for me, it never did. Not at all what I expect from Ellis (who I think is usually the exact opposite). It has been said that this is his most personal book, and I wanted to appreciate that, but I got the feeling, reading it, (and re-reading it) that he was just skimming the surface of darker issues that he had previously explored so amazingly head on. The book was a lot more linear than I expected (which I didn't like, from Ellis) and sort of was missing his \\"voice,\\" in my opinion. And most of all, the ending disappointed me and didn't leave me feeling satisfied (a first for me with an Ellis book). In sum, this was a good book that could have been great, which is probably what disappoints me most. I'm not sure what went wrong - was this book heavily edited? has Ellis' style changed for good? does he have writer's block that can't really be cured? These thoughts worry me even though Lunar Park was a decent book, only because I felt it was really lacking his previous genius. So, in any case, three stars, but I will be awaiting, hopefully and faithfully, for a return to the old Ellis I know and love."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"I'm a huge fan of Ellis's work and I've enjoyed all of his books. Until this one. An intriguing drama about adjusting to suburban life and giving up the youthful days of partying gets lost in a subplot of cheesy horror. But the scary part is: Ellis was actually trying to be genuinely frightening. And the horror was NOT scary, in fact it was completely ridiculous, and not even funny like it should have been. If the book stuck to the story of fathers, sons and the need for love and family, I could have been open-minded enough to appreciate this new and more mature style of Ellis. But it looks like he's losing his edge, and not to mention, his creative steam. I still give it two stars just because he has such a unique way with words. The words flow across the page beautifully. It's unfortunate, however, that the story itself demands sympathy, and as with all of his other books, I just can't find it in myself to give it to his characters. But unlike the rest of his books where satirical apathy is the key ingredient, this one takes itself a little too seriously for a plot containing demons resembling Cousin It and a homicidal stuffed animal."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"I have been a Bret Easton Ellis fan since American Psycho came out in the movie theatre. The movie interested me so much that I had to find out all I could about the author. Since then, I've read all of his novels and enjoyed them. I sometimes feel he gets more credit than he's due and I believe he feels that same way as he hints to this fact in Lunar Park. I have enjoyed all of his books; I \\"get\\" them and what he writes about. But it makes me laugh when people quote him as a \\"genius\\" or something.Going along with this, the reviews I always roll my eyes at and laugh at are the ones who profess that a certain book is \\"about something intrinsic to our society\\". For instance, looking at the flap of this novel, you get the blurb, \\"Lunar Park confounds one expectation after another...toward an astonishing resolution--about love and loss, fathers and sons--in what is truely the most powerfully original and deeply moving novel of an extraordinary career.\\" This statement alone could be found in the most glowing reviews, showing to the world that they \\"get\\" what Ellis was trying. Its also shamelessly arrogant and pretentious and usually off base.So it pains me with irony when I have to write this review in a similar way. Lunar Park comprises exactly what the flap says. While arrogant, sure, it really does encompass everything. And more. It is a witty, intelligent and dare I say profound novel (and I hate myself for sounding possibly sounding pretentious). What's striking is that while Bret (the narrator) focuses on his own demons he also focuses on society demons. In descriptions of what he sees, he's quick to point out that the children are on legal drugs (Ritalin etc) and are living life in a disassociated and amnesiac way. The parents are either popping legal drugs or smoking illegal. Everyone is in a haze, not just the main character who is, of course, a drug addict and an alcoholic.Ellis walks this fine line well, by the way, so that us as readers are never quite sure if everything Bret sees is truly real or if it is due to, like everyone says, his addictions. What surprised me most about this novel was how it started out so light and humorous, his own autobiographical look at his writing career and life, and then slowly, ever so slowly, transformed his life into a waking nightmare, a horror story that was brutally effective. Horror novelists could take a cue from the way Ellis writes the horror, bringing in every day things (Terby, the stains) and slowly tightening the net so that at the end things have become horrific.At the beginning, what struck me as most comical was how Ellis discussed how everyone wanted his novel \\"Less Than Zero\\" to be autobiographical. How everyone assumed that he was the main character. Take that with the dichotomy that he stressed Lunar Park is an autobiography and that everything did happen, and you have this hugely humorous connection. Its almost an \\"eff you\\" to people who kept trying to pigeon hole him as an author.Lunar Park is also Ellis at his most focused in years. I loved American Psycho and Glamorama, but they couldn't exactly be called focused (particularly Glamorama). Here his writing style is much much different from earlier novels (another point he alludes to in the beginning), more streamlined and not as much stream-of-consciousness (for lack of better word).As Lunar Park continued, I was amazed at how many different stories could be pulled together; there's the \\"haunted house,\\" the serial killer, the missing boys, the father, the college student, the familial drama, et al, all combined into 308 pages and honed so well that it works. And all of the threads tie together at the end, making this novel rise above some of its contemporaries. It is his most accessible and readable novel in years. At times arrogant, Ellis undercuts himself by showing what a putz he really is. This works well, given the public persona he's given in real life.Fans of Ellis will most likely enjoy this novel. I also think, however, that fans of horror will also enjoy it a ton. Being a fan of both, I have to say this novel is probably my favorite of his. Its been a long time coming and, for me, it was more than worth the wait. I hope it hasn't been too late.Ultimately, this novel was about Bret (both the narrator and the author) exorcising his demons of his past. Ironically, by writing a fictional story involving phsyical manifestations, demons, evil toys, a serial killer and a haunted house, Ellis has written a uniquely personal and profound novel. As cliched and surprising as it might seem, given the author, this novel really does become an ode to parents and a plead for them to actually be parents."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"I set about reading the works of Bret Easton Ellis after I saw the film \\"American Psycho\\". The third Ellis book I read was his latest - \\"Lunar Park\\".The book's main character is named Bret Easton Ellis. He has written numerous novels, all of which have been considerable successes. Yes, kids - the main character of Bret Easton Ellis' \\"Lunar Park\\" is, in fact, Bret Easton Ellis. Bret is trying to start over with his new wife, the famous movie star Jayne Dennis, and Jayne's kids, Robby and Sarah. Bret is Robby's father, though they met only recently. Perhaps unsurprisingly, things are not going well for the family. Bret's drug addiction and alcoholism irritates Jayne, who is trying to force Bret into a relationship with detached Robby and young Sarah.And the paint starts peeling. And the lights start flickering. And there are strange scratch marks on Robby's door. Bret begins to suspect that they may be caused by Sarah's eerie little bird-headed doll, Terby. Is he right, or is it just a druggie's paranoia? What really is happening in that house?Part of what I love about B.E. Ellis is how different each of his novels are. \\"Rules of Attraction\\" was a moody drama, while \\"Glamorama\\" was a David Lynchian novel about terrorism. \\"Lunar Park\\" is like a more grotesque Stephen King novel. Ellis succeeds in making a novel which scares you and leaves you guessing. I avoided reading \\"Lunar Park\\" at night because it was so damn creepy! It's not continuous scares, but there are some definitely frightening moments in here. I found the mystery elements of the book to be fun as well.Some B.E.E. fans may be disappointed - \\"Lunar Park\\" certainly isn't up to par with some of his previous work. But if you're looking for a fun read, you won't be let down."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"This is Mr. Ellis' finest work -- mature, serious, but also funny (at times), fantastical, ironic, reflective (and self-deprecative), and, most important, wise. The way he winds fiction and non-fiction (mostly the former), the genres of the story, and the modes of authorial voice is astounding -- I would say, groundbreaking. The strongest theme is the fictional Ellis' attempted reconciliation with his father -- or more precisely, his memory of his father, and coming to grips with the meaning of that for him and his own son. All this in the hazy space of alcoholism and addiction, rendered in brutal, unforgiving honesty. Ellis has masteed a an unusual new style which places himself as a character and as the author, distinguishing between the two, and examining the relationship between. It's most unusual but pulled off with the ease of a master magician.A great book, even for those who might draw the opposite conclusion before reading a single page."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"This book was hugely disappointing to me. I was knocked out by American Psycho and Glamorama, two books that provided rare, first rate reading pleasure. The prose in those books is electric; it rocks and rolls on the page and swaggers with a truly unique and terrific literary voice. The first forty pages of Lunar Park have that same rythmn; they are outstanding, and I zipped through and loved all of them. Then, however, the book grinds to a complete stop. It begins to read exactly like a Stephen King novel--not one of the better ones--and worse, in some places like Dean Koontz, something far scarier than any of the banal bumps in the night which fill this huge disappointment. Like one critic correctly said, the book \\"lurches to nowhere.\\" Nothing is resolved, and the only impression I really came away with is that Ellis, who claims that every word is true, is actually crazy. Who would have thought that real monsters and phantoms, if they were real, would be less interesting than Ellis' make believe world? The book's even more disappointing when one considers how much time was spent on its creation and publication. Ellis' personal life may suffer on drugs, but his muse doesn't seem to show up without them."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"Bret Easton Ellis knows he is an egotistical drug abuser, whose dysfunctional relationship with his now deceased abusive father still leaves him unable to hook up with his own son. His former lover, movie star Jayne Dennis offers him redemption through marriage and jointly raising their eleven years old son Robby, whom Bret barely knows. He agrees and the trio along with Jayne's daughter Sarah sired by another freak settle in the New York suburbs while he works on his next porno shocker, Teenage Pussy.Bret cannot cope with the three people he shares a home with especially his distant non-communicative son. He returns to his drug and alcoholic past while chasing college student Aimee. That is until the weirdness begins starting with Terby the mechanical bird suddenly like Chucky coming alive ready to harm all. Neighbor boys vanish, e-mail from his dad's ashes arrive, and gruesome murders from out of his novel AMERICAN PSYCHO haunt the town as much as the spirit haunting Ellis's house demands he writes the sobering paranoid truth; hence this novel.This novel is best for those readers who know Bret Easton Ellis's writing career and \\"brat pack\\" days of LESS THAN ZERO in which the author and his cronies symbolize the acceptable excesses of the Reagan Era. The story line lampoons the writer as he stars in an autobiographical fiction in which uses real people that he knew and events to tell his self parody that critiques and criticizes his celebrity status now that he no longer can claim the folly of youthful self indulgence. Terrific biographical fiction just not for everyone as the knowing the \\"Brat Pack\\" is a great part of the fun.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"As long as ghost stories have been around, the tale of the haunted house has figured prominently in them.Bret Easton Ellis's mercilessly malevolent, relentlessly creepy \\"Lunar Park\\" is certainly a ghost story---though a very specific, peculiarly idiosyncratic one---though it's not about a haunted house, not really.\\"Lunar Park\\" is about a Haunted Man.It starts out as something of an autobiography, or more accurately a Confessional, a kind of Portrait of the Artist as a Not-so-Young Man, the priapic Pirate approaching 40 and grappling with the familiar Rogue's Gallery of Middle-Age ghosties and ghoulies and long-legged beasties.Like? Like settling down in the Suburbs, sacrificing the carnal cesspool of your trendy Manhattan writer's pad for the deep-abiding security of the marriage bed in your own McMansion. It's about coming to terms with severely dismal sh*t: kids, death, respectability, and parents.Parents?Without a doubt. \\"Lunar Park\\", as I mentioned, starts out as a kind of gonzo autobiography of a disintegrating author and his increasingly chaotic oeuvre, before the narrative spirals into the hellish, terrorist-plagued near-future and then completely out of control.And the catalyst, the Big Red DEFCON1 Button that at first sends a ripple into Ellis's scene of domestic (Xanax-induced) tranquility, a ripple that turns into a maelstrom, is the death of Ellis's domineering, philandering father.But let's not confuse the issue: it's not that Ellis Sr's death triggers a crisis is due to a surfeit of filial piety on the part of his long-lost son: quite the contrary. Bret Easton Ellis's life, personal and literary, has been practically defined by the looming absence of his father, nor does Ellis carry out the grim old Pater Familias's last wishes and consign his ashes to Cabo San Lucas: instead, he leaves them entombed in a safety deposit box in some Newport Beach Bank of America.It's just that---well, if it's true you can't go Home again, it's not necessarily so that Home can't come looking for you.Anyway, Ellis is on the verge of a particularly self-indulgent total meltdown, moves in with erstwhile flame (and possibly the mother of his estranged son Robby), B-movie actress Jayne Dennis (nah, stay off Google, she's not real). He bivouacs at her palace in Midland, New York. He attends staid parties with the neighbors, mostly investment banker & stockbroker sorts. Hey, if mobster Tony Soprano can make it work in the Burbs, why not Ellis?I'll tell you why not: it's the way things start to zig when they should zag, starting with the blank e-mails from his California Bank of America account at 2:40 a.m. It's the mangled corpses of birds, cats, and squirrels left as little offerings on the porch every morning, perhaps a nice little present for Bret from his step-daughter's vulpine doll.Or the gaping, stinking, slime-coated pit in his back lawn, discovered after a hallucinogenic Halloween party in which Patrick Bateman---you know, the Wall Street investment banker & serial killer, Ellis's character---shows up. Or maybe it was just some joker, going out for laughs.But what about the grisly murders sweeping the county, with startling similarities to those from \\"American Psycho\\", starting just weeks after Ellis moved in?And what about all the disappearing boys?\\"Lunar Park\\" isn't Ellis's masterpiece---for that one let me point you in the direction of \\"American Psycho\\"---but it is a compulsively great read, and one that succeeded admirably in giving me a fine case of the crawls---try to read the sequence in which some nameless intruder with a camcorder films Ellis's unsuspecting father without feeling your hackles rise.In the end, I suspect \\"Lunar Park\\" works so deliciously because it's really not just about Ellis: it expands the sick vision and the vertigo of \\"American Psycho\\" to the level of Patrick Bateman's grand vision---to inflict the suffering on a massive scale, whether that's tourists getting machine-gunned on the Vegas Strip, suicide bombers in Times Square, or little wealthy suburbanite boys disappearing into the jaws of time.This---truly---is not an Exit.JSG"},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"Clearly his best book yet. A metafictional horror story or a suburban gothic memoir written by a deranged heir of Schopenhauer and John Rechy. His technique is impressive as he sustains a Klein Bottle of a novel that reads like William Burroughs and John Irving channeled by Vladimir Nabokov. The last twenty pages not only provide a sublime lyrical coda, they exemplify suberb contemporary prose."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"Unfortunately, it's not very often that I find a book with a plot line so engrossing that I'm itching to get home from work just to read it, or tempted to hide it behind my text book in class. The last experience I had like that was with Chuck Palahniuk's Invisible Monsters, back in 2003.Anyways Lunar Park is supposedly a true story of the \\"posession\\" and hauntings that the author, Bret Easton Ellis, experienced after writing, and producing into a movie, the book American Psycho. The book is intro'd by a quick story of Ellis' overnight fame & success, up until the point of his long-term relationship with a famous actress. They break up for a time, then she takes him back in to help him get out of the rut he's been in, with drugs and whatnot. She has 2 children of her own, one of which is Ellis' son, and the emotional deficits & awkward tension between the family members is overwhelming, almost nauseating. Ellis can't help but be reminded of his own broken relationship with his father, never reconciled before his death.The rest of the book roll out slowly and steadily, with never a dull moment once the hauntings begin. The paint starts chipping off their brand new house, to reveal a pink stucco like the house of his childhood. He catches glimpses of a character (who looks alot like Patrick Bateman in the American Psycho movie) driving around in the old car his father used to drive. His step daughter's doll \\"comes to life\\" at night, proven by claw marks in the walls and eventually, on the children. Also tied into the plot is the dissappearance of local boys, all around Ellis' son's age.And that's barely scratching the surface. What makes it most honest is the way in which Ellis reacts to everything, in a very normal way, the way you or I would react.It's terrifying, gripping, sharp-witted, emotional, frustrating, twisted... the list goes on, it's everything I need in a good novel to keep me up past my bedtime (although I'll admit, sometimes I kept reading because I was just too afraid to put the lights out!)."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"Just finished \\"Lunar Park,\\" and it's another incredible Ellis novel. I still think \\"American Psycho\\" is his best, followed by \\"Glamarama,\\" but this certainly gets the bronze. The very beginning, which is embellished autobiography, is endlessly entertaining, as is Ellis' initial introduction to the suburbs. Ellis' portrayal of himself as a dead beat dad is hysterical and leads to plenty of laugh out loud moments in the first half of the novel-my favorites being a breakfast scene in which Ellis requests that his hyper step-daughter be given a sugar-free donut, and a hysterical trip to his couples counselor, \\"Doctor Fajita.\\" The novel then takes a dark, dream-like turn in a similar fashion that his last novel, \\"Glamarama,\\" took. This time the theme is more horror than terrorism though, but the lines between reality and fantasy are once again blurred. This is the only part of the novel that slips a bit as Ellis seemed to keep the manic events that occurred in \\"Glamarama\\" together a bit better than he does in \\"Lunar Park.\\" It's still fun to see Ellis trying to tackle horror- even though it's obviously not his strong point. He does do a good job of tying up loose ends in an interesting fashion and completely hits the ball out of the park in the final couple of pages describing the release of his father's ashes. Damn this guy can write a book! Hopefully it won't be as long a wait till his next one. Maybe we can be treated to a \\"Lunar park\\" film in the interim..."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"Bret Easton Ellis might just be the author that best captures the current mood of America. While writers such as Updike is best at celebrating the country, and Roth and Foster Wallace disseminate it, Ellis with his celebrity profile, frequently blown up and misunderstood in the media, is uniquely placed to comment on society's obsession with fame, money, excess, drugs and personal failure.Ellis incorporates all these elements in Lunar Park. Using his own persona, or at least, his persona as portrayed in the wilder fabulations of his media coverage, he paints an interesting portrait of a famous writer struggling with suburban family life. Ellis reflects on the novels he has written and the effect on his life. How it was destroyed, then rebuilt. Now married to the glamorous Jayne Dennis he struggles with the vanities and manias of wealthy suburban middle class life - the 'rehearsal parties' for kids, fad diets, the testing for Ivy League schools in first grade - and tries to finish his latest novel 'Teenage Pussy', which is a sort of blown up parody of Ellis's previous work. There is a healthy strain of humour in Lunar Park, one gets the feeling Ellis wrote much of it with his tongue firmly in his cheek.Laced in with this portrait is a Stephen King style horror story in which strange things happen after a Haloween party in Ellis's house, the writer Bret Easton Ellis becomes bifurcated from the man himself, and the protagonist of American Psycho, Patrick Bateman, comes back to haunt the community. The book becomes jumbled towards the end as all these fragments struggle to resolve themselves. I found it lost some of its narrative grip as it became overly convoluted and pretentious. Nevertheless, Ellis has succeded in producing a work of genuine originality that is a wonderful meditation on family life in modern America."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"Never having read a BEE book before, I can hardly call myself a fan of his, but I heard he had \\"done a Stephen King\\" (and I can call myself a fan of SK), so I gave this a read.The book is very well-written, and the pseudo-biographical (or self-referential, whichever you prefer) asspects of the book were very fascinating. Again, not knowing BEE from BOO, I had no way of telling what was accurate or not, but it certainly was convincing.The story evolves from an interesting \\"autobiography\\" into a tale of terror in small steps, then huge leaps.The author has excellent touch with his dialog and focus on everyday details, and the book was surprisingly emotionally satisfying when all was said and done.While I can't say it made me hunger to read his other books, it did pique my interest, and I can certainly recommend it to those who enjoy horror books."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"I am a huge fan of Bret Easton Ellis and have been anxiously awaiting this new book...The beginning is an autobiographical account of his life and is very engrossing. Then it slowly takes the form of what could be referred to as a ghost story and includes some haunting real-life accounts he claims to have experienced. This different style of literacy was a bit of a bummer but none the less Bret Easton Ellis' extroardinary writing capabilities do not let you down! I would recommend this book to any die hard fan of Ellis..."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"\`Lunar Park' opens and closes more than splendidly. It actually may contain Bret Easton Ellis' greatest work yet. It's elegant, graceful, blunt and satirical while remaining completely original just like his work preceding. In fact, Ellis makes his life seem so unbelievable that while he opens and closes with pretty much a fact based fictional retelling of his life, past and present, your drawn to his character as if he were the most debased and unthinkable creation Ellis has ever penned. In short, he makes the auto-biography/biography enjoyable. The sad part is that when Ellis breaks away from his biography and begins telling his Steven King inspired horror story he loses touch with what made his open and close so brilliant. He starts to wane.This isn't to say for one moment that \`Lunar Park' is not in it of itself a fine literary journey. Ellis is still a masterful storyteller, it's just that the horror that Ellis so beautifully orchestrates is most effective when tearing at the fabrics of what makes us human, not when he's seeing ghosts and demons. In fact, the hardest part about reading \`Lunar Park' is realizing that it'll never frighten you. Ellis tries maybe too hard to get a scare in here or there but he fails to instigate even a chill. Instead he builds a wall of frustration around the reader until he's dulled to Ellis' tempting and teasing and gives up even hoping for a blood-curdling scene or a heart-racing realization.Come to think of it, Ellis does a lot of tempting and teasing in this novel, when it comes to pretty much everything. As far as an Ellis novel goes this is by far the tamest. There's almost no sex and the violence is far from explicit. In fact it almost feels as if you're reading another author all together. The only real shedding of light as far as the basis of anything Ellis comes in his relationship with his children. In Ellis novels past he has always built a wall around family interaction, giving us the battered and torn version of the family circle, but what's interesting here is that Ellis decides to delve a little deeper and give us a man trying in his own strange way to revert that and make a difference. This is Ellis breaking his own mold, and it is the first clue amongst may that this is going to be a ride least expected.So here, Ellis paints for us his life in another realm so-to-speak. This is the life Ellis could have had and he tells it as if it is the life he is now living. What's interesting is that he claims everything in this novel really happened, and in a way I believe that to be true. This is a novel about a man coming to terms with inner demons. So did Ellis really find himself chased by a strange ghastly demon? No, but in his mind he's run from many I'm sure. So here, in this life, Ellis is married to an actress and finds himself father to two children, one biological, one not. Living a normal life is a far cry from what he's used to and it's slowly driving him mad. But during a Halloween party he's tossed out of the normal and into the paranormal and his life starts to spiral, beginning with that night and moving forward day after day, night after night.From the return of his dead father to the emersion of Patrick Bateman in the flesh, Ellis is tortured by a slew of horrific daily occurrences, and as his house takes on an evil demeanor of its own Ellis is forced to reevaluate his life decisions, his own human mechanics and its here that Ellis takes true form. That is why I say in my title that I'll stand by this novel despite its many shortcomings, because, while Ellis may not illicit shivers with his demonic toys he does evoke fear in the pit of my stomach as he falls apart on paper, dissecting his own spirit as he battles the demons within, and that my friends is Ellis as his finest and most horrifying."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"Being terribly overrun by a stuffed animal, affectionately called Terby, night after night upon making a decision to leave your \\"old ways\\" and tread in the waters of rekindling love, which means two kids, one a son and another a stepdaughter, can in no way do justice to the drug-addled writings we as an audience have viewed Bret Easton Ellis in the past. He's the Eighty's Brando of writing, the young punk with nothing to lose, but instead of a leather jacket and smug swagger he began being published straight from college with a calm explicit voice. With this fresh voice, capable of defining the vague hue of an emerging and relatively young in-ecstatic generation; \\"the MTV generation\\", he has written books such as Less Than Zero, Rules of Attraction, and American Psycho - all of which have been made into large budget feature films over the past two decades.In his most recent book, Lunar Park, Ellis has taken a compelling move to describe better to any reader familiar with his works how deep a writer's rabbit hole can go. In this faux- memoir Ellis recounts his past, complete in the style of efficient nihilism that made him the voice of a generation, as he slowly decides to live beyond his fame's proclivity to ambiguity and self-indulgence when he re-unites with an ex, Jayne Dennis, in an attempt to help raise their son, who's life Bret, until now, has been devoid. As Ellis' makes steps to become a part of an already existing family, his life, dreams, sleep, and all together reality are broken down when his past begins to reconstitute itself within a series a bizarre yet eerily familiar murders.In this brilliant jaunt aimed at contemporary writing itself, Lunar Park can act as indirect directions for the process of writing, itself, at certain points of the book. Any aspiring writer realizes the importance of the initial line of any poem, short story, or prose so, Ellis takes this opportunity to re-familiarize the reader with the somewhat yet probable past stardom of his life until now in the first chapter. The first chapter acts as the first line. You need to know the author of this book in order to know the main character in this book. The main character is the author, and the author is the setting of the reality of this novel. Ellis manages to fully immerse the reader into his world this way, both in the reality and the hallucinatory properties of the story.During the mental cataclysms experienced by the author a new identity is fully realized by Ellis' own decision making as a writer. Emanating from this alter ego, \\"the writer\\", the main character is given guidance, direction, shown visions, and tidbits of information to help him solve the mysteries of his life in order to protect his family's. There is a dualistic reality that is based in the only vantage point supplied to the reader, Ellis, which is ultimately initially based off the reality of Ellis' life. Even then the physical and metaphysical aspects of human emotion and confrontation of demons within self-history blur creating one of the most mesmerizing books of Ellis to date."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"I have read two other books by BEE and really enjoy his writing style and sociological observations on modern American life. Lunar Park has a great beginning where he summarises his life from the early success of Less Than Zero to the present before weaving in the Lunar Park Story. He's taken a lot of drugs along the way and has basically shambled through life, one excess after the other, writing the occassionally good novel. He writes about this with humour and wit.However the second half of the story dosn't really work - the horror story format has been done far better by other people and I found it a bit weak.I would really like to see BBE write something different from material concerning the vacuous lives of the spoiled, rich and beautiful. Less than Zero was good and so was American Psycho but Lunar Park seems to be a therapy session where he comes clean about his relationship with his father and all his addictions. This is a brave thing to do, but dosn't really make absorbing reading."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"During the reading of this book I thought it was actually a quite good book. But after discussing it with fellow students and a teacher I realize that while the story is good and well thought out, it is simply another book dragged out of the cliche box. The writing in reality is not even something that could drunkenly misconstrewed on a half thought as above par. I admit that I liked the book but that is only because I liked the story. It was not displayed in a fashion that I could in retrospect say was something particularly spectacular to me. If you feel that you enjoyed any of Ellis's other books then you will most likely enjoy this one at least a slight bit. But if you are interested in readingh a book that will make you think beyond what previously read books have then this is not the book for you..."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"I'm somewhat divided after reading this book. Part of me can understand that the author is clearly ageing and dealing with certain issues that pertain to his troubled existence - so I could see this is being some kind of carthartic experience for Bret.But although the book starts off quite well, it morphs into a boring and kind of pointless series of \\"shocking\\" ghost stories.I've read all of Ellis' books, this to me is easily his weakest story. If you want to read a great scary book, written the way Ellis used to write when he was in his prime, check out \\"Lullaby\\" or \\"Invisible Monsters\\" by Chuck Palahniuk.I found \\"Lunar Park\\" to be very disappointing, especially after a seven year wait."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"A fascinating psychological horror novel that's also metafiction about the life of \\"Bret Easton Ellis\\". Compelling and page-turning."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"Whilst in San Francisco in 2005 was in a bookstore where Ellis read the first few pages of this book at a book signing. Now 3 years later after finally picking up a copy to take on holidays the great expectant read I anticipated never happened. The book just went on and on and never really went anywhere. Every page you turned waiting for the story to step to the next level,but it never does. Very disappointed."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"I feel like every novelist, or at least talented one has to write a novel that somehow incorporates his or her persona into the very fabric of the text. Philip Roth did it with \\"Operation Shylock\\" in such a way that you have to question what is \\"real\\" and what is \\"fiction.\\" The same can be said with this Ellis outing. He takes a novelist who shares his name, wrote a novel \\"American Psycho,\\" and does more drugs than a recreational junkie and throws him into suburbia and a nightmare of his own creation. Was it good? Hard to say. I read this incredibly quickly, as in all Ellis novels, because the prose is always so clear and quite frankly, readable. And know I was entertained because I couldn't put the book down, but I think the novel was flawed from the start because of the way it's built up and then sputters into the finish line. Maybe the form of the novel is supposed to recreate the psychological development of a recovering and recurring junkie, but with the eerie serial killer elements and family drama, something didn't gel in the end. I think fans of his work will rave about the book as will people who enjoy psychological thrillers. People who are looking for something closer to literary fiction, whatevert that label may mean, will not find that here."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"This is the sixth and final book by Bret Easton Ellis, and the least Ellis-like of them all. It's broken down into neat chapters that are of average chapter length. It flows at a steady pace and tells a linear story with a beginning, middle, and end. But that's not really what Bret Easton Ellis is known for is it?The book starts out very promising, sounding like an autobiography with the author revealing himself and his history in a shockingly frank way... but soon enough you start realizing that some of the \\"autobiographical\\" information he is revealing is fictional. The moment I realized this, the book lost a little bit of its charm to me. Although it was still interesting to read about his relationship with his father and his reactions to being thrust into stardom as a star writer at such a young age.The novel itself is nothing that special. It follows the narrator, a fictional Bret Easton Ellis (who claims that \\"every word you are about to read is true\\") through his humdrum life in the suburbs. Bret has married an old girlfriend who had his child and has been raising him ever since. Bret is trying to fit into the family, but is too self-destructive to connect with anyone else. After reading American Psycho, Rules of Attraction, and other Ellis novels, it's hard to find anything Ellis does shocking: snorting coke at a party with Jay McInerney, attempting an affair with a college student. Everything just seems tame after his other novels.A good deal of this novel deals with Patrick Bateman *maybe* coming to life and recreating the murders from the novel. At the same time, several boys Ellis's son's age have been disappearing from his neighborhood and surrounding areas, his house is mutating into something else, his dead father is trying to contact him, and his daughter's doll is coming to life. Although Ellis really tries, none of this ties itself together into a cohesive horror story, and honestly, by the end, none of it really makes sense.Throughout the novel the fictional Bret Easton Ellis is talking about his difficulty writing his newest novel \\"Teenage Pussy\\", but I think that Lunar Park turned out to be harder to write than he had expected.Since this is the last Ellis novel and I've now read them all, I'd like to rank them just for my own self-indulgent benefit:1. American Psycho2. Rules of Attraction3. Less Than Zero4. The Informers5. Lunar Park6. Glamorama(Lunar Park only bests Glamorama because it was about 200 pages shorter)"},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"Lunar Park reads like a cross between House of Leaves and The Dark Half. Whereas those were both very chiling reads, Lunar Park is not and instead comes across as an indulgent self promoting gimic.Ellis casts himself as the protagonist and after a compelling first chapter the novel falls flat under it's ridiculously unbelievable plot. I'm not sure if it's unbelievable because it's horror and I don't think Ellis is a good horror writer or because it was just plan bad. Maybe it's a combination of both. Don't get me wrong, I am a HUGE fan of Ellis and his writing is as crisp and breezy and enjoyable as ever but the story stinks. The plot in a nutshell: Ellis' house is morphing into another house, his daughter's stuffed bird is haunted, he's receiving blank emails from his dead father, Patrick Bateman (crazy guy from American Psycho) is real and recreating the murders from American Psycho and young boys are coming up missing. Bret is constantly drunk and drugged up so we're unsure if it's real or all in his head.Ellis is a great yet stagnant writer who has essentially been rewritng the same sotry over and over again. I can understand wanting to branch out but this novel is disappointing, convoluted and collapses under the weight of it's ambition. Since Glamorama, Ellis is hitting a downward spiral in nonsensical bloated egomaniacal novels and Lunar Park is no exception. At one point in the novel Bret proclaims this will be his last novel. Let's hope that's true if he plans on writing more drivel like this."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"Bret Eason Ellis' newest novel is a waste of time, paper and money. The ridiculousness of the plot line, the bloated egotism and the poor Stephen King rip-off used to gather incompatible story lines makes for a read that a high school English teacher would characterize as \\"needing focus\\".I think this book was an attempt at creating a modern day tragedy. Man fights inner demons. Man fights societies rules. Man fights pressures to be responsible to his family. Man fights, and fights and fights - to what end? Drug and alcohol abuse? A failure to reach any of his goals? Ok - then let that be the story as opposed to having to resort to absorb plot twists utilizing demons to try and pull divisive story lines together."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"very disappointing read - it seems as if he said to self - \\"i will throw together this lame attempt and the public will buy it on the strength of my previous work\\""},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"This book is SO BAD, and Ellis' writing is executed at such a low level that it is hard to even critique it; it would be like writing an in-depth review of a double cheeseburger at Burger King: it makes no sense.The intro is lazy, self-absorbed, and stupid. You did drugs, drank, wore fancy clothes, blah, blah,blah...: who cares?The middle picks up and the writing between Ellis and his female assistant is the most truthful emotional writing that Ellis has ever done, and then BAM!The book drops off as if Ellis was like , \\"What can I do now, Knopf will pay me on delivery for this book, I'll toss some inane thriller story and call it surreal, yeah, that's it.

Almost immediately, unexplained events (a stuffed bird come to life, weird email) in the house lead Bret to believe that his dead father is trying to communicate with him and that his son may be in danger.After a brief, funny, chapter recounting Bret's drug-soaked life to this point, most of LUNAR PARK is the story what ultimately becomes Bret's desperate attempt to deal with his feelings about his father and save his new family. Depending on your level of cynicism, this novel is either filled with regret at missed connections or a sendup of popular genre fiction tropes. The uncynical interpretation would lead one to believe that Ellis regards himself as totally devoid of value as a human being and incapable of sustaining the most basic of human relationships........still, the guy can write. Even though I think the story gets away from Ellis in the end - I'm still confused about the fate of Ellis' son - his spiteful descriptions of overmedicated kids and unhappy parents kept me reading. LUNAR PARK is shot through, though with a yearning to be part of that community, or any community.A difficult, problematic, novel....one best appreciated by those familiar with Ellis' other work.

As a long-time fan of Bret Easton Ellis, reading about the main character's outrageous life in the literary brat pack of the 90's was a fun romp, but the story itself was a bit tedious."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"How did we get started on this trend for writers to name their main character after themselves? First there was Jonathan Foer Safer, who made himself, or made a character with his name, the bemused protagonist of \\"Everything is Illuminated.\\" I'm not sure what that actually did for the novel, but it was probably the first time this device had been used outside of sitcoms. Now there's Bret Easton Ellis and \\"Lunar Park.\\"Ellis writes very well, so well, in fact, that I'd like to see him write about something besides taking drugs, getting drunk, and behaving like a pig. That's what he, or the character named after him, does in this book. Give the guy credit for not making excuses or trying to improve his image because it would be hard to imagine a less flattering self-portrait than this one. The \\"Lunar Park\\" Bret writes graphically violent, well-written novels with the same titles as the possibly real Bret and is quite the celebrity. The reason for his popularity is a mystery because he comes to every appearance too drunk or stoned to function and is rude and arrogant to boot. In \\"Lunar Park\\" he is married to a movie star and living in the suburbs. He is a stepfather, but the kids might as well be hitchhikers for all the effect they have on his existence. Then, strange things began to happen in and around his house. In a rather silly sequence, one of his stepdaughter's toys goes berserk, shredding the bedding and leaving scratch marks on the ceiling. But other, uglier, episodes occur until Ellis becomes convinced these demons want him to atone for the disaster of his life.I have always found Bret Easton Ellis a very overrated writer. When there are so many good books out there to read, why waste time on this stuff? Yet reading \\"Lunar Park\\" is like watching a train wreck-prurient interests you never knew you had are piqued by this arrogant creep's self-hatred and the price of his actions. I didn't hate \\"Lunar Park\\" but I didn't like it either. I do find it hard to recommend."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"Reviewed by Charles Shea LeMone www.allwordman.comIn his fifth novel, Lunar Park, Bret Easton Ellis has found the perfect anti-hero: himself. In an overview of his life he recounts selling his first novel while still attending college; receiving huge advances on future novels; his addiction to cocaine; numerous seedy sexual romps; abusing the limelight as a best-selling novelist (with more than one Hollywood film based on his books. Finally, he describes his eventual decline and fall from grace in the eyes of his once adoring public and publisher.In an effort to clean up his act, Bret marries a former flame, a successful actress who gave birth to his illegitimate son, Robby, now 11 years old. At this point, the novel detours away from its self-effacing autobiographical tone and slips into the chilling province of horror, as Bret declares, \\"Every word is true.\\"Starting with a Halloween party held at his suburban home, Bret's new life begins to unravel as a series of supernatural events cause him to question his sanity. Following the first incident, when his step-daughter's mechanical doll takes on a life of its own, initially, Bret attributes the blood on the claws of the toy to delusions produced by the cocaine and the vodka he has once again begun to abuse.But too many other sinister events convince him otherwise. He starts receiving mysterious e-mails from the bank where his father's ashes are deposited. His home begins to transform, taking on the physical appearance of the unhappy home he lived in as a child. Boys in the neighborhood, the same age as his son, disappear. A woman he has been trying to seduce is killed. And a wave of grisly murders -- which mirror the acts committed by a serial killer he created in a previous novel -- bring a perplexed detective to question him. Meanwhile, his marriage appears doomed and his son's alienation and distrust of him intensifies day-by-day.This novel of angst and despair is as mesmerizing as a ten-car collision but is also frequently amusing. The climax and resolution of the story that Bret reaches, however, left me feeling unsatisfied. It was like being a guest at a sumptuous feast only to discover that the last dish served is half-baked. Still, I recommend this book to all Bret Ellis Easton fans and to all readers of fiction who enjoy delving into cleverly crafted tongue-in-cheek page turners."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"For a book that starts out with a pseudo autobiography, for a book that features a self-indulgent main character, for a book that draws its themes from a series of obvious inspirations (including Shakespeare), I was pleasantly pulled along. Unlike some of Ellis' other stuff, it was clear to me that the construction of the book was well developed and tightly layered. The tension builds slowly. The book dabbles in straight detective stuff, then veers gently (how is that possible?) into horror turf. Yet when the blood comes, it seems even more real, even more damaging, even more of a catharsis. If you can't get past the self-centered main character, put the book down. If you feel yourself surprised to be with this guy for so long, keep reading because the end is worth the trip."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"The first chapter of this novel is among the funniest things Ellis has ever written. True, it may seem a bit insensitive to laugh at the descriptions of debauchery and drug addiction, but this is pure Ellis, and this time it's his \\"own\\" story he's telling, from his youth to celebrity adulthood. With the \\"biomythography\\" (to borrow a phrase from Audre Lorde) intact, Ellis brings us into his present: he's newly married to a movie star, lives with a son (conceived years earlier) and stepdaughter out in the posh suburbs where he's trying (and failing) to build a new life, teach a writing course, hosting parties that Jay McInerney attends and working on a new edgy novel with a sure to be controversial title.A quick word about Ellis's descriptions of his fanciful novel his character is writing, entitled \\"Teenage P____.\\" (I'm not going to type it out here.) I was reading this section of \\"Lunar Park\\" on the subway ride home and started laughing. Out loud. I couldn't help myself, it was that funny and over the top, so I forced myself to close the book for a few minutes because even though I was reading, a man sitting and laughing hard by himself on the train still looks odd.The opening chapters of \\"Lunar Park\\" are so sharp, taking place as it does in an alternative America where the terrorist attacks have never ended and all kids are doped up before being sent to school, that it draws blood. Even when the story starts to veer into the preternatural, it's so well-written that I didn't have any problem \\"suspending my disbelief.\\" (Interestingly, I read a comment that this is Ellis's first novel not written in the present tense.)Midway, the novel starts to suffer from a little bit of overload, full of stop and go moments, references to \\"Hamlet\\" coming at us from all sides, Stephen King-style parenthetical breaks and horror story moments. In \\"The Haunting of Hill House\\", Theo and Nell are outside and Theo starts screaming at Nell to run and not look back; Ellis shows us what we'd have seen if she'd looked back, as it comes lurching up the backyard to him. There is also a possessed toy and a boy named Robby, like in \\"Poltergeist,\\" although that may just be a happy coincidence. The novel's conclusion left me with more questions than I like, but this book is a great step in Ellis's growth as one of our best chroniclers of contemporary life."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"I've been a huge BEE fan since watching American Psycho for the first time, thinking the movie sucked. Then I decided to watch it a second and third time, where then I relized that the novel had to be read. After reading the book, the scum on my skin would not come off no matter how hard I scrubbed. It was the book that got me back into reading!Lunar Park is not very thought out and lacks originality. I Do Like the fictional character of his wife, and the 2 websites that are linked to her name. Easy read that starts off suberb, declines throughout the 2nd half of the book.I would pick this book up if your a fan of the author, or just want to read something to your kids on halloween, jk.Hope BEE can make a comeback, the generations are passing him by while the fog is very hazy."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"I really live Ellis, and the beginning of this book really made me excited. I know that there are others that have made themselves the protagonists, but I cannot believe it is an easy thing to do, or to write successfully. Needless to say, I was stunned by the honesty that Ellis was able to turn onto himself as he did on the rest of the world in his other novels, but as he turns the page from himself to a story, he lost me. I was never caught up in the mystery of what was going on around him. It all struck me as a type of bad Dean Koontz novel. Of course, Ellis is able to poke fun at all the insanities of suburbia, but the end left me very dissapointed. The problem is that I expect more from Ellis, which he delivers in the beginning, but is woefully inadequate in the end. So, the three stars go for the first half of the book, and no stars for the end. If you must read Ellis and have not, this shouldn't be the first place to look. But you should read Less Than Zero, and The Informers. This book should only be read by hard core Ellis fans, who will be dissapointed in the end."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"Bret Easton Ellis is, at his core, a moralist. And, due to this, all of his stories are true terror tales; this just happens to be the first one that's marketed as such.And, again, he returns to his best--creating a protagonist you cannot like, with horrible traits and an anti-social demeanor. The only difference here is that the unlikeable protagonist turns out to be Bret himself, living a terribly quaint suburbian life with his terribly quaint suburban family; his wife, a model/actress, is the only part of the family who doesn't quite fit the normal role of 50's era family-hood; she's a jetsetter, though that's the only difference; she still fixes breakfast and readies her kids for school.Perhaps the most disturbing part of the novel is that it's not a novel about Bret being scared at all; it's a novel about fathers and sons, lost chances, and the inability to predict an outcome. Plus, there are some pretty terrifying moments relating to the Terby (a Furby-ish doll that belongs to Bret's fictitious daughter), lights, and the family dog.I wouldn't rate this at the top of Ellis' writings, and I also wouldn't start reading here, if you're new to Ellis. This isn't his strongest work yet, though it is his most off-the-wall and mature book. Start with either The Rules of Attraction or The Informers, which will give you more of a sense of his prosaic style."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"The first thirty to thirty five pages are everything an Ellis fan could possibly want but the novel slowly devolves into a horror story that, unfortunately, fails to captivate. I've read every one of his novels to this point, with Less than Zero and American Psycho two of my favorite books of all time, but this book, while I eagerly anticipated it, is just not up to those standards. It is a different novel altogether in that it is not a social commentary and is decidedly more personal and I'm not against this new direction for Bret, every artist and writer must evolve, but this is just not a great book. If you are a fan, you must pick this up, but if you are just a casual reader Bret has better books."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"Since \\"Less Than Zero\\" I have been a HUGE Bret Easton Ellis fan and he doesnt dissappoint with his new read. Writing in the style that has made him famous, every page is so engrossing you do not want to put it down. I highly recommend this to any Ellis fan and to anyone who wants a book that will take you away from cover to cover."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"No doubt about it Bret Easton Ellis is an amazing writer. He can take anything and make it entertaining and make the most disturbing of social lites into a commanding lead protagonist. In Ellis' latest novel he touches apon a subject he's never really delved into before. I've never thought of Bret as a horror writer, and although anyone only familier with 'American Psycho' may beg to differ if you read any of Ellis' work you will see that he is above all a moralist and less and less a horror writer. He delves into what makes us as humans tick, working on out own selfish ambitions and how we will fight and kill and destroy to get to the top or to whereever we see fit to be. I felt that although not my favorite book by Bret, Lunar Park is deffinatly is easiest read. I read it in a few hours while flying from Texas to Alaska and I have to say that I enoyed it emensly. This is a read for any fan, but also for anyone wanting to get to know Ellis as a writer. I would recomend you start with 'Less Than Zero' which to date is still his best set of work and will give you an overall view of what Ellis is all about. This book revolves around a haunted house and demon possesed toy and a Pattrick Bateman copycat who is following the murders set out in the manuscript for Amercian Psycho. It has its moments of thirlls and chills but for the most part Ellis strung a story of redemption and acceptance of who we are and how we can change to make our lives and the lives of our loved ones better. Ellis throughout this novel comes to grips with parenthood and actually begins to make decitions to best suit his son and step-daughter. As I said, Ellis is a moralist, and if you look at this novel for what it is it becomes less and less of a horror novel. SO I guess my opening statement is wrong because this novel really is a stab in the right direction and is something that Ellis can so effertlessly portray."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"I was so relieved when I found this book by Ellis at an obscure airport gift shop with no other book options. I was excited to read something on the flight & to really get into a book. I typically have enjoyed Ellis' ideas & his style of writing. However, this book seemed to me to be written as some sort of lame joke. I do not think that Ellis spent a lot of mental energy developing characters or thinking out the plot. It read like a B rated thriller, & a bad one at that. I almost wonder whether he wrote this book to meet contractual obligations of a book contract. Check it out from the library or borrow it from a friend."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"This is one of Easton Ellis' best works. If you are familiar with his writing style & have always enjoyed his books, you will truly love Lunar Park.This book is loosely based on his own personal life, but not a 'true' autobiography. You will find his usual variations of humor, irony, terror, & symbolism.However, if you have never read any of Easton Ellis' works, this may not be the one to start with. His writing style is very unique & not enjoyed by everyone. I would recommend Less than Zero as a starting point.Lucky for me, I LOVE Bret Easton Ellis' work & found this to be one of his best books."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"American Psycho was sick, twisted and blackly funny in equal parts. Lunar Park is a lot less sick, but just as twisted and blackly funny. Highly recommended. Also highly recommended: 3 by Grant King - just as twisted as AP in many ways, but a hell of a good black comedy."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"Brett Easton Ellis is one of the finest writers we have. He has an original voice and an incredible ability to put a sentence together. And most impressively, he created a totally original style of writing at the age of 21! And anyone who doubts it should read the first paragraph of \\"The Informers\\", one of the all time great book openings. That said, \\"Lunar Park\\" was a major disappointment, not because my expectations were so high, which they were, but because with the exception of a few beautifully written sentences, the book was nauseatingly egocentric, the plot was flimsy, the characters weren't interesting, and to add insult to injury, the book was about 150 pages too long.Really, after reading \\"Less than Zero\\" and a few chapters of \\"The Informers\\" (it would never dawn on me to read anything entitled \\"American Psycho\\" and I was unable to get through \\"Rules of Attraction\\" or \\"Glamorama\\"), I'd really hoped that Ellis was going to give me something more engaging. I haven't read an interesting new book in several years and I'd hoped this might be it. But \\"Lunar Park\\" was just boring. And at the risk of mentioning Jay McInerney in the same sentence as Ellis, I'd compare \\"Lunar Park\\" to \\"Brightness Falls\\", both were pretentious and uninteresting. Both disappointed not just because they were unimpressive, but because they were so clearly impressed with themselves.If you want to read a great book, pick up \\"The Informers\\". It'll make an Ellis fan out of you. And if you're already an Ellis fan, stay the hell away from \\"Lunar Park\\". It'll just leave you disappointed in another writer who got carried away with himself; another writer who started believing his own press clipings. In the case of Ellis, I guess it was inevitable given that this is the same guy that is comfortable putting \\"He is the model of literary filial piety, counting among his parents Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Nathaniel West, and Joan Didion.\\" on his jacket covers."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"Ok, 1st let me start off saying that I am a big fan of Brett Easton Ellis. I love the characters in his books and where Brett takes them. So when I heard about this book I was excited and couldn't wait to read it. As a gift I got it in audio which I am not usually in to. Then I saw James Van Der Beek was reading it. Not a big fan but he was good in the Batemen role in The rules of Attraction. His narrating was fantastic. Eerie. Creepy."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"I'm a pretty big BEE fan, and I love his cool, detached writing style, and how all his books are slightly deranged. I love how the protagonists are always a bit off - a big part of you detests them, a little bit of you feels sorry for them, and a tiny piece of you is jealous of the seemingly glamorous lives they live (the sex, drugs, parties, dining at Spago with supermodels stuff...not the ax murder Patrick Bateman stuff).Lunar Park is a bit different, because while I felt the expected pity and disgust toward the main character in the beginning of the novel, toward the end he made a turn for the better and I found myself somewhat invested in him. The story follows an accomplished and somewhat unhinged author (named, err, Bret Easton Ellis), as he tries to settle into a \\"normal life\\" of marriage and fatherhood. The book is semi-autographical, in that the background of the main character is based on the author's real life (several references to and quotes from BEE's past novels are cited); but the story itself is mostly fictional.The satire and social commentary BEE is known for is definitely not missing from the book. Whereas his past books commented on the casual drug abuse in the 80s and 90s by social upscale slackers, I found it interesting that the most shocking form of drug use (abuse?) in Lunar Park is by children, by prescription. But this is just a side note to the main story of Lunar Park, which is basically a ghost story. And it's really quite scary - complete with ghosts, stalkers, poltergeists, a demonic Furby-like doll coming to life, and an appearance of Patrick Bateman.Overall, there were parts that didn't seem to fit together quite right, and the ending left me slightly confused about certain things, but the story kept me riveted. It was almost refreshing to read BEE's writing after having a break from him for so long (I hadn't read one of his books since college), and I think he has a truly original voice."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"I thought this book would have more of a Sci Fi/FAntasy/Horror feel to it, of course it did have that element, but fans of Sci fi/Fantasy should steer clear, as there are alot of better books out there about the supernatural and self exploration. Bottom line, the book was written well, but i was pretty bored with the story coming from a sci fi background.Alright, i said i was bored....but why, well some of it has to do with the writing to be sure, BUT...i think the bulk of the bordom comes from MR JAMES VAN DER BEEKS reading of the novel. I cant tell if i would have been more intrigued with the book had MR BEEK used some emotion in his reading. I think he read it in a certain way on purpose...the narrative parts are read with such a detachment that i couldnt care less that he was being chased by a 'monster', cause it was read in the same drab tone as him describing his drive to the store. The dialoge parts were a little better, but not much.You know there might be a reason for his tone, Mr Ellis may have even wanted it this way (in which case i blame Mr Ellis), but regardless, this book couldnt have been a more boring listen. It started out well, you dont even mind that Mr BEEK is half sleeping while reading, but once you get about half way through, you will curse the fact that there are 11 discs in this set.i give 2 1/2 stars to the book mainly for his writing (he did have a few beautiful passages in there, and he is obviously a talented writer), but i barely give 2 stars to the Audio Editon."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"i am a fan of ellis' early work, but kind of lost track of him after american psycho. i was excited about this one after reading the first chapter, but wow-- this book is excruciatingly boring. i read about 150 pages and gave up. what a relief it was to stop reading this book."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"and this book is one of its bests... certainly the first \\"autofiction\\" ever wrote with such a talent, humor, style... you should not hesitate to read it !"},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"Lunar Park is probably Bret Easton Ellis' best book since The Rules of Attraction - which isn't saying very much at all. But then, his books have never \\"said\\" very much at all, beyond expressing their basic (two-dimensional?) themes of existential alienation, (in)human cruelty and indifference, and adolescent self-pity. Much has been made about Ellis' supposed \\"courageousness\\" to \`cast' himself as the lead character in his latest book - but certainly one hopes for something more illuminating than the egomaniacal, alcohol-and-drug-addled, unshaven slacker who simultaneously thinks of himself as \\"the greatest writer of my generation\\" and yet spends days on end wandering aimlessly around his family's house in a bathrobe, utterly ignoring and neglecting his wife's children, and desperately dreaming of ways to escape sexually fulfilling his gorgeous imaginary movie-star wife.Lunar Park is at least a step up from Ellis' previous & very worst book, the almost incomprehensibly pathetic Glamorama, which was to the contemporary New York City fashion world what Fellini's Satyricon was to the Roman Empire - a lurid, pseudo-carnivalesque wallowing in grotesque characters and situations for its own sake, almost completely devoid of plot or character nuance or development of any sort. In this latest novel, Ellis at least marginally attempts to entertain his readers in some genre-based sense; he takes himself on as his (partially) fictional lead character and then puts himself and a fictitious suburban family through a series of horrific, supposedly supernatural happenings \`ala' Stephen King or Dean Koontz. As I read this new book I was admittedly mildly diverted by the supernatural elements, but unfortunately nothing comes of anything - it's entirely smoke and mirrors, clutching at straws, and setting up surreal events which lead to nothing. By the time the totally uneventful third act rolls around, you think to yourself, this isn't a skillful con; rather, it's the epitome of an absolute storytelling gyp.It's no secret in literary circles that Ellis dedicated this book to his longtime, recently deceased (o.d.'d) gay friend and lover. What IS strange is that Ellis still seems to harbor guilt, shame and/or disgrace over being uninterested or unable to want to be part of what mainstream society would consider a \`normal' family unit; he is totally reluctant - defiantly & brazenly so - to truly allow his character to pursue his alternative sexual/emotional desires with any amount of emotional rationality or peace. Insofar as self-analysis in fiction is concerned, on some level Lunar Park is very much about Ellis' inability (and possible renouncing of his interests whatsoever) to play the patriarchal role in a heterosexual family unit: at the book's end, after his fictional marriage collapses and his ex-wife leaves with her children, the Ellis character discreetly moves in with a new boyfriend, and it's only in these very final pages that some remote sense of inner peace and calm is touched upon. And yet, this 11th-hour spiritual epiphany is so temporary and fleeting as to almost descend upon the proceedings like a psychoanalytic deus ex machina; it therefore fails to provide Ellis' obviously hoped-for profound re-analysis of the 300-some previous pages of the lead character's tortured (and torturous) self-condemnations. The reader is ultimately left with the impression of Ellis' character furtively slinking off at the last minute into the blessed sanctuary of anonymity, his deepest desires and feelings still unexpressed.Orson Welles once observed, \\"There is an angel and a devil in each of us.\\" Thus far, Bret Easton Ellis' self-imposed creative lot in life has been to ignore the angel in us entirely and focus exclusively on our devils. There may have indeed been something new, unexplored, haunting and visceral about reading Ellis' first novel Less Than Zero back when I was sixteen years old and still eager as an adolescent reader to be exposed to the corrupt adult world. But for me, now in my early thirties, reading Bret Easton Ellis has become a downright @#$% waste of time. There's nothing new to learn about the human condition in Lunar Park, no (real) new stories that Ellis is telling here, no new insights to be shared - only another colossal exercise in thematic, intellectual and emotional self-persecution and cowardly self-denial. His insistence on having Lunar Park's lead character (read: himself) despise himself for his sexuality reminds me of the later work of the late Italian gay filmmaker Pier Paolo Pasolini, who also produced works of spectacular (spectacularly shallow, some might argue) hostility, violence and self-loathing towards himself and the entire human race.It's not a stretch to see how Bret Easton Ellis has become about as (ir)relevant to our current cultural landscape as Trent Reznor from Nine Inch Nails. Both \\"artists\\" found success in the late 80's and early 90's by exploiting pre-millenium anxieties and urban angst and paranoia. The year 2000 has since passed, Y2K never happened, the saga of the human race continues to unfold - and yet both Ellis and Reznor keep fixating on their aesthetic assembly line of self-loathing and self-inflicted torments of living everyday life, stubbornly - embarrassingly - refusing to give up their ridiculous adolescent posturing and idiotic, uber-banal cynicism even as they move into their forties. Really, it's almost as if they've suffered from aesthetic O.C.D. since childhood; at this point one has to wonder if either of them would have anything left to write or record about whatsoever if they started on a daily dosage of Paxil?(One might also wish to refer both of them to a different Ellis: the renowned psychiatrist Dr. Albert Ellis, who since the 1960's has been writing brilliant books on rational-emotive therapy and the right to live one's life with a sense of genuinely mature emotional rationality, self-love and inner fulfillment, while allowing onesself to pursue whatever one conscientiously wishes in this world, free of self-condemnation and self-damnation. For anyone interested in reading up on Dr. Ellis' books and ideas on self-betterment, A New Guide To Rational Living and A Guide To Personal Happiness are wonderful places to start.)Finally, if you're looking for quality contemporary reading that will enlarge your view of the complexities of our world and our human capacity for beauty and joy as well as chaos and despair, try reading Michael Chabon, Mona Simpson, Tobias Wolff, or Alice Sebold. Interestingly enough, Chabon's marvelous first novel \`The Mysteries of Pittsburgh,' a coming-of-age tragicomedy written when the author was all of 25 years old, features a 20-year-old bisexual male protagonist struggling with similar emotional intricacies who finally attains the psychological maturity and self-acceptance that Bret Easton Ellis in his forties still seems committed to recoiling from and railing against for the rest of his life."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"This was the worst Ellis book ever written. It was boring, arrogant and a complete waste of time. I bought the book for my vacation where i can read anything and I forced myself to read it... assuming it would get better, which it never did.If Ellis really cashed in his chips and moved to the 'burbs, well, he completely lost his edge.If your shopping for a read, buy something from McInerney who can still write without the drugs."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"Used library book, but still in good condition. Book came quickly and was cheap. Overall good deal!"},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"Kinda a mixture of Ellis's earlier work (lots of drugs and parties) quite a vacuous lifestyle to some weird Stephen King stuff."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"This book is great if you want to read a rejected Stephen King novel. nuff said"},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"A fantasy tale about (but not about) the author (or a fictitious alter ego), who deserves no sympathy for destroying his own life, and most precious relationships, while living high off gratuitous fame as a gonzo writer. More horrid than scary. Kind of a confused and confusing narrative from which one should be able to expect more, based on the pleasing quality of the writing style. I could easily have done without this one."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"Having read all of Mr Ellis's previous works, there is no doubt that they get worse with time. As another Amazon review points out they are basically the same story re-hashed.So Mr Ellis, as you do have a good grasp of the nilhist world in which we live and you can string together a great narrative, why don't you pull that finger out and write the novel that you are capable of?You never know, you might even enjoy it :-) Ho HumUnless you are real fan, I wouldn't really recommend reading this rather introverted and dull diatribe."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"Lunar Park embodies the maturity of Ellis as an author. For fans of all of his earlier works, this was definitely worth the wait. And, like the others, it wets your appetite for more. I could not put this book down. Nice work, Mr. Ellis."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"Let me start by warning you Bret Easton Ellis is my favorite author, hands down. I received this book as a gift a couple of years ago and while it wasn't exactly what I had hoped for his style was still there. This book is more of follow up to his other novels and contains hints of Glamorama type mystery to it, but overall it was more bland than some of his other work.I would reccomend this to Ellis fans, but I wouldn't reccomend it to first time Ellis readers."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"Just finished reading this book, what can I tell you...I am still recuperating from it.I would segment the book in two parts, the begining where you have a simple screwed-up man describing his rise and fall from grace and the later part where the supernatural kicks-in. The main character is very well developed throughout the book, his personality is unbelivable -you'll need to read it to understand - even though he has so many problems he still comes around as a nice guy...difficult to understand.The end was a bit clumsy for my liking, hence the 4 stars. Still a good book to read on a winter night."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"Brett Easton Ellis doing what he does best: social commentary with a plot which twists and turns, and rants and raves, and gets bloody and gory and disgusting in parts... it definitely made me dizzy but did I like it? Still not sure. This one is more intellectually challenging than his previous novels and I couldn't put it down while I was reading it, but I doubt I'd ever want to read it again."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"This book is certainly the BEST novel I read in a very long time.Whatever Ellis' purpose was, it will last, less because of the story (but a great book does not have to be an amazing story), than because it is exactly what an excellent novel is: a piece of work that challenges the form, that focus on the style and force the reader to question his/her assumptions and what he/she used to consider as the boundaries of a novel.It is not a fantastic book because of its obvious references to other styles or dead and living writers, but because it creates \\"something\\" unique."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"Bret Easton Ellis must have had a hell of a good time writing this novel, a faux-memoir about....well, himself! The first 30 pages or so read just like an autobiography, with the writer recounting his life of excesses, following the smashing success of his earlier, scandalous, novels. No one says that this is the actual truth, mind you! The basic trick that lies at the heart of a mock-memoir is that you can mix truths with lies, knowing that no one could possibly use the former against you (this is supposed to be a work of fiction, remember?). The novel's main character is named Bret Easton Ellis, just like the author, and various details from his life seem more than plausible (some are even intriguing, including revelations about \\"American Psycho\\") but there is no way of telling the truth from the mere fiction.Shortly after this recap of BEE's dissipated life, we're introduced to his recent past (again, entirely fictional...with maybe a pinch of truth mixed in between): BEE is now married (with a famous movie star) and lives with his wife, together with his son (with whom he has conflicting relationship) and his wife's daughter.Amid reflections on suburban life, marital problems and today's Zeitgeist, several supernatural elements start to seep into the storyline and the book morphs into a horror novel, involving a creepy toy that haunts the narrator, missing children (who might have escaped for obscure reasons), literary creations (from BEE's own novel) taking life, ghosts and, more in general, a \\"surreal vibe\\" that prevents the reader from telling the actual events from the hallucinations. This reminded me of American Psycho, where BEE hinted (as he patiently explains somewhere in the present novel) that Patrick Bateman's violent crimes might in fact exist only in his mind.When you really get down to it, \\"Lunar Park\\" is a literary divertissement, genre-fiction mixed with a classic literary device that allows BEE to make fun of his audience and indulge in his well-known narcissims, by detailing a life that might or might not be his own.All in all, Lunar Park is well-written and extremely engaging and it bodes well for BEE's future works. Hence, the 5-stars rating"},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"Well I saved the book 3 weeks for the plane journey home between Japan and the UK hoping that it would not be as bad as Glamorama and American Psycho (both which I would describe as compelling like a train wreck/car crash). I was immensely surprised that beyond the familiar drug/sex/alcohol themes that BEE was able to deliver a very unpleasant and flat picture of American suburban life which the lead character wants to fit into, but is far too \\"normal\\" in his desires and opinions to fit. The horror aspect is gradual in it's arrival but when it does, BEE makes a slick transition into paranoid horror from mockbiography and social observation. This sets kind of a mix of Jane Austen (sans the love story) and Stephen King, which for me, surprisingly worked well and as opposed to American Psycho and Glamorama had me hoping that the writer would produce more of the same in the future."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"But if it is, then what a great novel to end it all! Lunar Park takes such a dark, sci-fi turn. I did not anticipate anything that happened in this book, but after all isn't that what being an Ellis fan is all about? If you loved any of Ellis' orevious work, Lunar Park is something you will love and appreciate."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"Starting out in the land of tongue in cheek meta fiction, the story of Ellis' rise to stardom and dealings in drugs and debauchery is instantly riveting. The novel starts wobbling, however, as soon as the Ellis character moves to an affluent suburb to be with his wife and kids, and the novel crosses over into the territory of pure fiction.This is not a grown-up, mature Ellis writing. His riffs on fatherhood and stabs at coming to terms with his own childhood aren't exactly incisive. But what Ellis lacks in humanity he makes up for in detached, dry wit combined with a freaked-out gonzo sensibility. As his cocaine-addled experience of the suburbs turns from alienated bewilderment to genuine terror it reads like a wasted Hunter S Thompson reporting from suburbia.The novel gains momentum after it has completed the transformation from auto-biography into full-fledged horror story, not shying away even from genre clich&eacute;s such as evil dolls and creepy children's drawings. But Ellis' unreliable narrative is scary not because Patrick Bateman (the murderous protagonist of American Psycho) is stalking him or because a hairy beast materializes in his hallway at night, but simply because as Ellis realizes that being a normal, grown-up, suburban dad is far beyond him his sense of reality slips, blurs and flickers, pushing him and his family inexorably toward catastrophe. It is a feeling of rapt unease that makes Lunar Park a page-turner.While Lunar Park is not as shocking as American Psycho or as novel as Less than Zero, it is thrilling and readable, and welcome progress from the monstrous Glamorama."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"I've been a Bret Easton Ellis fan since his first novel, Less Than Zero. I'm not alone in this respect. I believe every other review here also says the same thing. But I'm in agreement with Norman Mailer in his opinion that \\"Ellis...has forced us to look at intolerable material and so few novelists try for that anymore.\\"Clearly, his is a unique voice, one of absolute, irresolute authority on his subjects. Often, his subjects aren't clear, but he does speak with that authority. His characters are frequently under the influence of drugs and sex, tainted and poisoned by the same.In Lunar Park, Ellis' main character is more than himself. Having read, after the book, his recent biography, it seems that he chose to follow a literary path that was a departure from his real one. Its a literary might-have-been haunted by grief, guilt and irredeemable flaws.Recently, I described the process of writing (I write as well) as a search for a string of words that sing, harmonically. Every once in a while a sentence is born that seems in tune to the universe. Occassionally, a paragraph can carry the tune. Reading for the sake of literature is looking for an entire book that can pull of that tricky little trick. I've read maybe 20 in my life. I'm 41 and I've read thousands of books, several a week since I learn how to read.Of that 20, two were probably written by Bret Easton Ellis.Lunar Park is no exception. It is literate, knowing and his dialogue pops. The story is a good one (the haunted house story with the author as both house and haunter) and it proceeds quickly. I had some problems with the length and breadth of Glamorama but this new one has no pacing troubles. When you're done, you're sorry the trip is over.I recommend this book heartily to who ever is reading this. I'd caution that a study of Ellis' other books (particularly American Psycho but also Less than Zero, Informers, Rules of Attraction and Glamorama) before hand will enrich the experience.Hope you like it. I have a question though for those who read the book. If you haven't, stop reading this review immediately.Still there? What in hell happened to the boys?"},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"Ok, so maybe I am easily gullible, but the whole time I was engrossed with this book, I actually thought that it was based on Bret's actual life and that it was a valid memoir (a genre I seem to be reading a lot lately). The good news is that it took me finishing the book and reading a bit more on it, to find out it was a \\"fictional\\" memoir! That is how compelling, and shockingly good it was! Plus the publisher creating \\"fictional\\" websites related to Jayne Dennis and Bret, help spread a bit more of the \\"fictional\\" beliefs into reality.I have read Bret's past trumpted books (like Less than Zero and Rules of Attraction) and was intrigued by how much more \\"into\\" Lunar Park I became as the story progressed. Bret keeps us on our toes. Was a book I would definitely represent. Because of it, I also went out and bought American Psycho (which was referenced a bunch in the book, and which I had not previously read..although saw the movie with Christian Bale).Good to have you back in the mix Bret!"},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"There's a lot to like about \\"Lunar Park\\" and one or two things not to like. Hearing an adult Bret Easton Ellis talk about his life and past work in somewhat harsh terms is enlightening, letting people know he doesn't see himself the same way the media has, whether good or bad.There is an extremely heavy mood to this book. The miserable life he is leading in the novel, the sad and angry wife, the children he can't connect to, even the dog is actively against him! I took longer than usual to read the book because I would have to put it down after a chapter or two.On a selfish note, the single greatest part of the book is when he vindicates my nearly twenty year old belief that Patrick Bateman did not, in fact, kill ANYONE in \\"American Psycho\\". Of course, Ellis is about as unreliable a narrator as Bateman was, so who knows?It's interesting to see him weave this fictional life for himself, incorporating real and imagined events, complete with wife and kids in the suburbs, which may (MAY) represent the pressures on him to lead a 'normal' life. This book would seem to be his answer to those pressures (and since so much of this book concerns his father) an answer to him as well. \\"Lunar Park\\" would seem to say 'Yes, I could have tried to live this life, but I could not have lived it well.'I am surprised to see so many comparisons to Stephen King, just because there are elements of horror in the book. The only thing Ellis seems to share with ol' Stephen is the occasional inability to come up with a good ending to a novel. In an interview, Ellis said that his editor, reading the first half of the novel, kept calling him telling him how great it was. Those phone calls stopped when the second half came around.The book really loses focus when the 'house exorcist' is called in, and never recovers. The ending really is the only thing keeping \\"Lunar Park\\" from being a true classic."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"this book started off great - ellis writes in an entertaining fashion as in his other novels (and takes it back to the basics as he claims to do in the opening chapter). as i got into it, it got a bit too fantastical for my liking. if you are looking for a quick 1-2 day read, you can grab this book. my main problem with the book is that i expected to be moved and feel for the characters, but just when i was about to, uncanny freak coincidences take over and ulitmately those take away from the character development."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"Ellis a great writer with a fantastic way with words, but Lunar Park is not his best work. It's definitely a fast entertaining read, due mostly to his excellent style and dark, witty descriptions of the lifestyles of the rich and shameless. Whether living it up in the city or trying the family thing in the burbs, Ellis really knows how to portray depressed drug-using sex-obsessed Americans trying unsuccessfully to fill a void in their godless lives.However, the whole horror story haunting theme as a metaphor for the past gets tired and the book starts to lose steam toward the end. Not to spoil anything for you, but once the ghostbusters show up, you know Ellis was running out of ideas. Still it was a \\"fun\\" read with some good ideas that could have been carried out a bit better.Oh and as a bonus, this book contained only one gaping anus!"},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"If there's ever a book with a split personality, that book is \\"Lunar Park.\\"In his fifth full-length novel, Bret Easton Ellis seems torn between writing a fictionalized memoir and a Stephen King horrorfest, complete with leaf beasties and ghastly bird dolls. He builds up a confusing if compelling storyline, only to have it spill into an unholy mess at the climax.Bret Easton Ellis wrote a gloriously nihilistic novel called \\"Less than Zero,\\" sparking off a bestselling career, drug addictions, and a hedonistic lifestyle. A few years later, he's wed to girlfriend Jayne, and living in dysfunctional tranquillity in the countryside with two kids. He's working on a new book, the perpetually pornographic \\"Teenage Pussy,\\" and still doing lots of drugs with pal Jay McInerney.Then weird things happen: A bird toy is killing animals. Bret's dad's grave appears. Monsters are invading his house. And a mysterious police inspector tells Bret that someone is emulating the gruesome murders from \\"American Psycho.\\" And as he tries to keep his family safe, Bret finds that his own fiction is what is spawning all this horror.\\"Lunar Park\\" is an intriguing self-exmination; I can only imagine what spurred Ellis to write it. It seems like an exorcism of the cynical, drug-dealing demons of excess that ran rampant throughout his novels. And in the world of \\"Lunar Park,\\" those novels -- especially the controversial \\"American Psycho\\" -- have an influence on the real world, whether it's bringing horrors to life or inspiring a serial killer. It's a fascinating look at fiction vs. reality.And despite the literary conceit of having himself as the lead character, Ellis' examination of his fiction is a thorough and brutal one. He even goes down to his writing style. The book opens with him looking back on his books, and noticing how the Spartan style of \\"Less Than Zero\\" evolved into babbly rambling. With this book, he's settled into a comfortable middle-of-the-road style.Unfortunately, Ellis also gets locked into a Stephen King fantasy, complete with a see-it-a-mile-away plot twist right out of \\"Rear Window.\\" He creates some genuinely chilling moments, such as when his alter ego starts seeing graves and monsters. But by turning all that good horror into self-examination, it loses most of its punch. And as the novel builds to its anticlimax, Ellis doesn't seem sure what to do with the plot threads he's woven together, like the disappearing boys.Metafiction runs wild in \\"Lunar Park,\\" a novel split between literary study and total horror. But Ellis seems to lose the grip on his plot, and it spins out of control like the book's events themselves."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"I haven't enjoyed a novel this much in a long time.There is horror, humor and suburban truth (or perhaps that is to be included under horror). It's just a damn good read, I couldn't put it down until I was done.If you do have a sense of humor, an appreciation of the horror novel, and a bit of irony, I can't imagine you'd be disappointed."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"I'm a little surprised by all the lukewarm reviews - I found this book a rare gem, combining familiar elements (Stephen King style horror, crash-and-burn autobiographical confessions) into a new mix and an intriguing book. There are laugh-out-loud moments (the outline for 'teenage pussy' cracked me up) and there's heartbreaking reflections on Ellis's failures as a human being (the last chapter.) The picture he paints of suburbia as a land of medicated zombies is as droll as it is chilling. Yes the book shifts gears quite often, keeps you guessing and maybe unsettled - but I have to salute the courage Ellis showed to write so honestly about himself. His experiment with horror devices was, to my mind, successful - if you're going to go over the top, Ellis understands you go way over. He pulls it off with style."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"As a fan of Ellis' earlier work, I was very disappointed when Glamorama finally made its appearance after the long drought. Where American Psycho could support its length, Glamorama seemed to sink under the weight of too few ideas and too much prose. Enter Lunar Park.Lunar Park most resembles a style and substance literary retread of Glamorama. It's like a bad film sequel where instead of fighting the bad guy, the hero fights the bad guy's brother. The book opens with the quote \\"You do an awfully good impression of yourself\\" and then Ellis astonishes the reader by doing just that.The twilight zone world of the narrator exactly mirrors the conspiracy within a conspiracy of Glamorama. This time the group of Wizards-Behind-the-Curtain are psycho-sexual-magical forces instead of fashion model-political-terrorist forces. Don't get me wrong, though - there is no real difference. As you turn the last page of either novel, it's clear that the powers of control are unknowable, unreasonable, and ultimately nonsensical.When I reached the halfway point, I was pretty bored. Still, I held out the vain hope that Ellis was taking previous work and refining it. Throughout the book, the narrator is terrorized by a demon toy named Terby (a supernaturally enhanced Furby \\"emoto-tronic\\" toy popular in the 1990s). The toy's name turns out to be a mind-numbingly silly anagram. Unfortunately, Lunar Park represents the same type of insignificance."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"The introduction was stunningly great, the way Ellis barreled through his metoric rise and into his drug impaired soft middle age lost years got me excited for the rest of the book. It seemed like Ellis had shaken off the haze of Glamorama and was ready to dive head first into an amazing piece of literature. Then the rest of the book happened.A horror novel that was not scary, a suspense novel that was not suspenseful.Basically, blah.You know it's bad when you start reading about a book Ellis the character in Lunar Park is writing called Teenage Pussy and you find yourself wishing you were reading that book instead of Lunar Park.That about sums it up."},{"Title":"Lunar Park","review":"While initially appearing to be a much more narrative based work, than his past writings, Lunar Park reveals itself to be B.E.E up to his old tricks. Utilizing the multi-faceted possibilities of the true confession, horror/sci-fi genre \\"the writer\\" continues to strike out into new territory, (this time tackling a sentimentality that had eluded him until now). While many passages feel like a little more than a nod to Stephen King, they always end in an introspective and sobering tone, with the writer/antagonist looking ultimately in the mirror. Gone for the most part is the ambivalent, apathetic tone of most of the author's previous work, instead we are treated to a work of fiction that so blurs the lines betwen what is expected and what is reality that the \\"one\\" word that most sums up the novel is left a blank. While the narrative may just be the hallucinations of the guilty fevered mind of the protagonist, there are enough details served up to make the reader constantly question the intentions of these details and to make note of them. Effective on many levels and inspiring to this reviewer in particular, I am left only to thank Mr. Ellis for his most important work (at least to me personally)to date."},{"Title":"Simon and Schuster Short Prose Reader","review":"The text brings back fond memories of essay writing in school. All the timeless advice about how to write a concise article is here. Exemplified by passages from a wide variety of short stories, some of which must surely get any reader's interest. The main idea seems to be to transition the student from being a passive reader to becoming a writer. Part of this involves training the student to read a passage more analytically. With some purpose in mind.There are many exercises. Some are quite short, involving just writing a sentence or few about a topic. To gently get the student into the act of writing, without having her churn out an entire essay off the bat."},{"Title":"Simon and Schuster Short Prose Reader","review":"With selections from writers as varied as Asimov and Dave Barry, this book has something for everyone.

For the newly diagnosed patient, validation of this diagnosis, from a physician that has fibromyalgia himself, is so important.For the long term patients with more resistant forms of fibromyalgia, like myself, it is comforting to encounter a physician that can state (p. 231)\\"There are no easy answers.\\" \\"I try to emphasize that their pain is not their fault or caused by something they are doing wrong.\\" In my interactions with physicans, it is rare that fibromyalgia veteran leaves the doctor's office without being blamed for their condition. I think Dr. Pellegrno shows a perspective rarely considered by most physicians and it is the biggest strength of the book.I think this book can help you, help yourself."},{"Title":"Fibromyalgia: Up Close & Personal","review":"To say that Dr. Mark Pellegrino has done it again is quite the understatement. At first glance, you may be a bit overwhelmed but don't let the size of Up Close and Personal intimidate you. While it's not a weekend read-I tried that for my review - the 400 plus pages are worth their weight in gold even if you risk a fibro-flare carrying it home from the bookstore! It's a reference book that mixes a blend of fibromyalgia history, diagnosis, therapy, research and legalese with a twist of Dr. Pellegrino's unique sense of humor. Dr. Pellegrino puts it best in his own words, \\"My approach has been to help all patients deal with their symptoms, first by helping them understand fibromyalgia, and second to encourage them to use successful strategies to become a fibromyalgia survivor\\". Author of several other fibromyalgia books and a physician with a clinical practice experience of more than 15,000 patients, he's more than qualified to share his opinion.Still, you may be asking why you would need another fibromyalgia book. After all, is there really anything new to write about? For the newly diagnosed, this book is an easy to understand reference. For the seasoned, it's updated to include the latest in fibromyalgia research including chiari malformation, nutrition and the legal aspects of post-traumatic fibromyalgia, updates gleaned in the three years since his last book, Inside Fibromyalgia. While 400 pages may seem daunting, the book is divided into six sections, with 6-8 chapters in each section, which helps the reader break down and absorb the well-presented information. In addition, exclamation points on certain pages draw your attention to helpful bite-sized facts. For those wanting more, at the end of each chapter is a resource list \\"If You Want to Know More\\" that satisfies their appetite. Illustrations help the reader get a visual focus on what is being explained verbally and the only stick figures you'll find are the ones getting tastefully into \\"comfortable positions\\" in the chapter on Sex & Intimacy.Even the title Up Close and Personal, Dr. Pellegrino explains, was chosen because \\"I see it up close in my patients, and I deal with it on a personal basis every day. I understand fibromyalgia\\". Throughout the book, he profiles several of these patients in Up Close Patient Snapshot like \\"The Rodeo Roper's Rotator Woe\\", as well as himself in Personal Profile. One of my favorite glimpses of Dr. Pellegrino that he shares is how his deafness helped him later in dealing with fibromyalgia. Nobody likes to think they are different. But with his great sense of style, you almost want fibromyalgia so you can be \\"just like Mark\\". Not to be left out of the updates are familiar favorites from previous books -- such as FMS Greeting Cards, Famous Last Words Before a Flare (FLAWS) and Fibronyms. Dr. Pellegrino also includes what he calls his \\"diversionary writings\\" which lighten up the complex task of explaining fibromyalgia, although he doesn't need much help as he does it so well. Previous topics are expanded -- nutritional approaches (including weight loss!) and post-traumatic fibromyalgia -- and new topics on disability and legal issues are added, written by attorneys who deal specifically with medical-legal issues.Is there any that Up Close and Personal lacks? I don't think so. Even if Dr. Pellegrino's explanation that \\"As part of my therapy, I enjoy writing\\" may be true, it is therapeutic as well for his readers who benefit from this catharsis. His dedication to educating and empowering the reader into becoming a \\"fibromyalgia victor\\"--his new slogan-is both a support and a challenge. Dr. Pellegrino claims that \\"his simple philosophy is treating fibromyalgia is to find whatever works\\", but it's his personal caring that comes through in each of his books. This one is no exception. Buy the book - it may be the only fibromyalgia book you will need-until he writes his next one!"},{"Title":"Fibromyalgia: Up Close & Personal","review":"As with all of Dr. Pelligrino's books one knows he knows what he speaks of. Both as a DR. who treats people with this and other allied conditions and as a person with Fibromyalgia. He is up to date with research and writes clearly and informatively. I have and will continue to recomend this book to the many people with FMS I speak to."},{"Title":"Fibromyalgia: Up Close & Personal","review":"Dr. Pellegrino does it again! He has provided us with another great book about Fibromyalgia and living with this chronic illness.\\"Up Close And Personal\\" not only encompasses the areas we face in daily life but also gives us the latest education and techniques to improve its quality, thus bringing encouragement and hope many times to the hopeless.I can go to this one book for a fast answer or study it in detail to make life changes to help me regain control.We at Fibromyalgia Training Services (FTS) recommend \\"Up Close & Personal\\" in our courses to the participants and their support person and we are excited to be able to do so."},{"Title":"Fibromyalgia: Up Close & Personal","review":"Stars: 4 for information, 2-1/2 for style.As with his other books, the information provided is first rate, especially on fibro-specific drugs coming to the US market. Compared with THE FIBROMYALGIA SURVIVOR, there is much more information here.And, in some ways, that's just the problem. This is a \\"second-stage\\" book for taking next steps in handling life with FM, not a quick how-to-handle-life guide for the newly diagnosed. The information here requires time and effort to apply, certainly worth doing, but AFTER tackling simple but dramatically helpful fibronomic changes much better outlined in THE FIBROMYALGIA SURVIVOR and by Miryam Ehrlich Williamson (a support group leader) in her volume THE FIBROMYALIGA RELIEF BOOK: 213 IDEAS FOR IMPROVING YOUR QUALITY OF LIFE (excellent--my first \\"go-to\\" book).Readers of THE FM SURVIVOR will recognize the many of the same ideas, usually amplified and explained in more detail. However, some of the chapters (e. g. managing the holidays) are disappointingly similar.The most detracting and denigrating \\"features\\" are the author's shallow attempts at humor, usually in sidebars. Though anyone with FM knows humor is vital, at best, these snips are distracting to the author's main points. At worst, they're incredibly insulting. The chapter on weight control in particular is condescending and downright insipid, completely lacking in compassion while seeking to \\"teach\\" simplistic concepts most of us know. I would walk right out of any doctor's office that treated me the way this chapter \\"speaks\\"!!While a useful addition to the bookcases of persons with FM, this is not the most concise or incisive of this author's work, and certainly not the first book I would buy."},{"Title":"Fibromyalgia: Up Close & Personal","review":"I diagnosed myself with fibromyalgia after reading several articles about the condition and ordering books from Amazon.

On receiving it, however, I was taken aback by the amount of the book that is taken up by \\"jokes\\" made by this doctor, because in his words 'laughter is good medicine' and we shouldn't take ourselves too seriously. I'm all for trying to see the good in this illness, but in my opinion, jokes like 'people with fibromyalgia don't need alarm clocks!', 'they save money because they don't need to buy things like vacuum cleaners!, 'they have a convenient excuse whenever they make a mistake'. We have enough of a hard time being taken seriously by doctors, friends and family. We hear comments that downplay this life changing disease every day. Comments like those don't advance the dialog on this illness, and they don't make someone in pain chuckle at their predicament.All in all, this doctor does have some advice for strategies in living with this illness, but none that you couldn't find in another book.

Liberty is nearly universally valued as a good thing, but defining what liberty really is and applying it correctly has produced much more difficulty. Gregg's book is a short but fruitful tour of the competing theories on how to preserve the liberty everyone so desires.The first six chapters are organized by function: the first two chapters provide some philosophical background on the topic; the third chapter analyzes what people are talking about when they speak of liberty (\\"freedom to _____\\"); the fourth and fifth chapters concern how to make laws and establish a state, respectively, to preserve these rights; the sixth chapter discusses the role of nongovernmental associations and the importance of providing a check against the state's power if necessary.Throughout these chapters, the same types of issues permeate the discussion. Does liberty carry with it a moral obligation to be virtuous and to require it of others? Is an appeal to an absolute standard of truth necessary in order to make the case for liberty? If the answers are yes, then what virtues or truths should they be? Can we rely on our human nature and capabilities as a guideline, or do we have to tailor our government to assume that left to our own devices, we will destroy ourselves? What principles do we use to mark out a position in between? Although ordered liberty is most associated with a question of designing an optimal government, this necessarily carries some assumptions about the nature of mankind, and this is not left out of the discussion.The last chapter is a more informal and personal one, one in which the author discusses how the Catholic Church and individual Catholics should engage in the public debate, as well as the danger of having public policy expressed by people of faith disqualified because their motivations are labeled as religious in nature.This is a good gateway book, complete with endnotes at the end of each chapter for further exploration."},{"Title":"On Ordered Liberty: A Treatise on the Free Society (Religion, Politics, and Society in the New Millennium)","review":"If I knew it would be so difficult to read I would not have purchased it.

It takes away from Jackson's 'mysterious' personality, but then again, show some of his thoughts.One of the things that I noticed right away was, because the writer was different, the writing style was different. Although it followed the series well, the characters seemed a little out of character. Especially Jackson. There was also less comedy and sarcasm then the first one. The writer of the first book wrote it like D.J. MacHale would have wrote it. This style is totally different. It doesn't take away from the book, though.

Twelve-year-old Wally lost his brother Jon-o in an awful accident. The accident happened when Jon-o jumped into the river trying to help a little kid form drowning. Jon-o rescued the kid, but Jon-o drowned in the water. Jon-o died like a hero, but his spirit appears so only Wally could see him.Jon-o's spirit helped Wally with a lot of things. When Wally needed Jon-o's help with the skateboard, Jon-o taught Wally how to ride the skateboard.

The issues that most people face are those in the middle, which is where the most extreme behavior generally starts. Early in the book, the author makes an educated guess that less than 1% of the people are pathological crooks and they know they are and don't care. He splits the remainder into the two groups:*) People who have lost sight of what is unethical or illegal (30%).*) Good people who occasionally do dishonest things (69%).I don't quite agree with these percentages, I consider the percentage of people that occasionally do dishonest things to be much higher.The main point of the book is that \\"Every society normalizes its own moral sickness.\\" In other words, if unethical or illegal behavior starts becoming more common in a group, then it becomes normal and accepted behavior. This is not news, having been well known to psychologists and sociologists for years. Arthur uses religion as a basis, often quoting scripture to make his points. He also argues that religious influence is declining in America, a point that I disagree with. As the current presidential campaign so clearly demonstrates, religious influence is on the rise and has been for many years. The percentage of people who classify themselves as evangelicals has steadily risen over the years and their influence on the choice of the next president is substantial.While the recent instances of corporate malfeasance are disgusting, to argue that they demonstrate a moral decline is simply not true. Any student of American history knows that what is going on now is minor compared to what business leaders did a few decades ago. The reality is that the current crop of political and business leaders are now much more ethical that they were a short time ago. I remember the savings and loan and insider stock trading scandals of the 1980's and over time new information continues to leak out about the unethical actions of the Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon administrations. Despite the enormous amount of press that Bill Clinton's ethical lapses in the Oval Office received, in terms of impact on the nation, it was not at the level of the implications of the Iran-Contra scandal of the Reagan presidency or Watergate.These criticisms aside, Arthur does discuss the fundamentals of how unethical behavior can get started in a company and grow from the trivial into a cancer that can severely damage the organization. This advice is sensible, in that while some simple transgressions can be tolerated in unusual circumstances, one must draw a firm line.I am ambivalent about the book. Since I do not agree with many of the major premises that the author puts forward, I cannot rate it very high. However, since I do agree with his arguments for the need for a moral compass, I consider the book worth reading. Therefore, the balancing of these two leads me to give it three stars."},{"Title":"Slipping to Normal: A Matter of Leadership","review":"I applaud and agree with the author's point of view in this book, but didn't find his way of expressing his points to be very direct or effective until near the end.Slipping to Normal looks at business ethics from the point of view of what a Christian executive should do who is living up to his or her faith.Mr. Arthur argues that in the absence of good Christian education about moral behavior in the workplace and good Christian examples by the leaders in that workplace that most young people (and many older people) will simply go along with whatever the crowd is doing. Unfortunately, \\"monkey see, monkey do\\" does apply here in both the positive and negative senses.Although the book argues from a Christian perspective, Mr. Arthur points out that other religions also espouse the golden rule to do unto others as you would want them to do unto you.The best part of the book comes in the examples in chapter 8.The book's arguments are nicely summarized in chapter 10. Unless you haven't heard of Adam Smith, Karl Marx and Lord Keynes before and don't know your New Testament, you can skip the parts that come before chapter 8, and you will probably like the book better.The book's main weakness is that it doesn't say very much and repeats its key messages too often. The writing style seems to be the cause of those problems.I compared the book in my mind to Dr. John Maxwell's There's No Such Thing as Business Ethics and found Dr. Maxwell's book to be much better than this one. I recommend that book instead to those who are looking for guidance on what they should do in the workplace.Slipping to Normal will primarily be of benefit to those who are involved in teaching ethics in business schools and churches, and young people who want a perspective on how they should relate to their Christian faith when they first enter business.May God bless you and your business activities!"},{"Title":"Slipping to Normal: A Matter of Leadership","review":"this book right off the bat had me thinking of Enron&other companys that got a bit greedy for there own good&when there is no balance&the Quest is all out there for Power&Grand wealth.

They lost so much money, in fact, that someone had to take a fall. Why? If the public couldn't pin the blame for their own ignorance of how the stock market works on someone, a loss of confidence in the free market could have resulted in serious and long lasting repercussions. Enter into the picture Enron, Tyco, Martha Stewart, Imclone, and a bunch of other corporate drones. I'm not saying any of these companies or individuals are innocent--not only are they not innocent, it's probably the tip of the iceberg. My own limited experience with the corporate world provided plenty of evidence that corruption, greed, and general lawlessness run rampant amidst the cubicles. I once worked for a chap who was so unethical that I shed nary a tear a few years later upon learning his business failed. As I prepare to embark once again on a voyage that may well carry me into the corrupt cesspool of corporate America, I'm glad that I read Bill Arthur's \\"Slipping to Normal.\\" Not that I think the book will do an ounce of good, mind you. The privileged few have turned the workplace into such a cutthroat arena that I think redemption is out of the question. Yet reading the book at least gives one the sense of how much better the world could be.The impetus for \\"Slipping to Normal\\" came from thousands of encounters Arthur had with business executives. Many of them poured their hearts out to the author, at the time a dean at a business school, about their horrific ethical quandaries in the dog eat dog world of corporate America. The torrent of comments made Arthur realize that business schools largely failed to instill in the students a sense of proper ethics. According to the author, the business world (along with the world at large) suffers from a moral malaise that has only gotten worse with time. Difficulties start at a microcosmic level with stolen staplers, dishonest use of sick leave, and other seemingly minor acts of deceit. Leaders who refuse to nip these problems in the bud, due to an affliction which Arthur labels \\"passive self-interest,\\" fail to avert later, serious problems because it is easier to just let the small stuff pass by unchallenged. The Enron collapse didn't happen overnight, but was the result of a series of small infractions that coalesced into a bigger problem because no one took steps to correct the deceit when it first appeared. Arthur provides plenty of real life examples and case studies to illustrate the dangers of passive self-interest and unchecked immorality in the workplace.Perhaps the biggest difficulty in arresting the growth of immoral practices in business and the larger society centers on the economic system currently in vogue in the United States. It's not capitalism that is the problem per se, as Arthur vigorously supports Adam Smith, but Keynesian economics. Arthur sees this system, its heavy emphasis on spending now with no thought for tomorrow, as a primary cause of immoral behavior. After all, if you don't have to worry about what happens in the future, you're more likely to do whatever it takes to succeed today. Even worse, Keynesian economics relies heavily on manipulation of the money supply and the creation of increasingly baroque governmental bureaucracies. Increased government spending and bureaucracies result in loss of personal freedoms and dependency on federal handouts, not to mention a bigger role for the government in the economy. And an increasingly visible and heavy-handed government actively influencing the economy is not a good thing in the long term. People come to expect things from the government--entitlements, handouts, whatever you want to call it--that act as a corruptive influence in every aspect of our daily lives. Where there is corruption, there is moral ambivalence.So how do we emerge unscathed from the dilemma erected around us? Arthur claims that good old-fashioned Christian ethics may well save the day. You know, Christian ethics--the stuff Jesus talked about in the New Testament. Our reliance on human centered ethics (Arthur calls it consensus ethics) has led us down the path of disaster. In the author's opinion, Christian ethics can be as simple as just treating other people as you would like to be treated. It's more than that, of course, and the book frequently pulls citations from the Bible in order to demonstrate how the teachings of Jesus apply to our frenetic modern world. In a way, some of the stuff contained in \\"Slipping to Normal\\" should be a no-brainer--when has the human race ever done anything right on its own? It makes sense that we should rely on something beyond ourselves, something timeless and immutable, to motivate us to do better. You definitely don't need to subscribe to the Christian faith to recognize the timeless and immutable ethical implications of the Bible.At the same time, I think Arthur's reliance on Christian ethics is a central flaw of the book. He does acknowledge that other religions support similar ethical systems and would thus do as good a job reining in immoral behavior in the office, but I don't see people making the distinction. Can you imagine any consensus emerging over the mass imposition of Christian ethics in the corporate arena? Maybe it would work after they settled the millions upon millions of lawsuits filed by people shrieking about the violations to their personal belief systems. The recent election alone reveals in spades just how polarizing a force Christianity is in this country, and I think it's a bit too much to expect citizens to separate the Christian religion from Christian ethics. It's like separating class from Marxism. Despite this problem, the book is worth reading."},{"Title":"THX 1138","review":"Wow! I expected a typical 1970s hack job, but this novelization really adds to the experience of this film.Ben Bova's vision is ultra-violent where George Lucas' savagery is implied...but it's compelling because it's believable.

As far as I recall when THX emerge from the underground shaft's grating; he was standing up from a mound or a hill and was amazed by the sight of the sun (rising or setting?) on the horizon against a clear blue sky.This was similar in George Lucas' screenplay and film. Only difference is, is the film's oversized sun on the screen with a yellowish red background with some silhouette of birds flying instead of the clear blue sky.Also on Bova's book when THX gazed down from the hill; he saw trees,a field, a farmhouse (like a pastoral landscape). And outside by the farmhouse and the trees, he saw a family dining on an wooden table and those long wood bench.I think Bova extrapolated a tiny tiny bit on the conclusion of Lucas' original story to give readers a little more conclusion on the ending. The reason(s) for omitting this part on the other editions is unknown."},{"Title":"THX 1138","review":"At least the movie has some sense of resolution but left me wanting more. Usually the books expound and cover more elements than the movie.Such is true here as I could not put the book down. The major disappointment here was the ending, what ending? It was as if someone took out the last pages, but there were 2 pages after the &quot;end&quot; and they were blank. It does not appear that the text faded away, and oh would that be just convienent; the text is fully intact and readable (even thought the book is old) and the last pages' text is faded. I DON'T THINK SO. What a cruel joke. Unless this book has a sequel or it is first in some kind of series, I am HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED as it definitly left me with wanting more.So what happened? I guess it's obvious that the Superstructure is not radioactive, at least not lethal anyway. So our hero decides to go &quot;Outside&quot; which is said to be polluted and unlivable. Well? The dude makes it to the top where a rusted grating is in place and he pushes on it, can't get it open. So he pushes up against it with his back.... Well did he get it open or not? What was the outside really like, it would have made the read worth the while. SPOILED THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE."},{"Title":"THX 1138","review":"What an extremely disappointing ending to such an intriguing, captivating story. The storyline to this seemed to just \\"stop\\" at the end. The story's plot is an excellent exploration of a society living off of pills and generic food-like items. A structured society with rigid rules of employment, social interaction, and a ban on sexual activity, among other things. The characters do not have names, but rather three letter designators and a numeric suffix. People are seemingly programmed to handle life as near automatons, with real robotic figures handling disciplinary and enforcement positions. The ending, however, leaves one completely flat. Not at all an ending with some sense of closure, but it left me feeling flat - like the story had impacted against a brick wall and exploded into nothingness. Mr. Bova is an excellent writer, and this particular short story seems to be based on a George Lucas screenplay. It may be that Lucas had the movie end in such a low, depressing moment - where there are more questions than answers. This might be great for a movie, but it sure sucks for a book."},{"Title":"Channels to Children Early Childhood Activity Guide for Holidays and Seasons","review":"I have loved this book since the 80's.

Many board members have never had to face the daunting, time-consuming process involved in executive transition. ED turnover is more rapid than in years past, owing to reasons such as the increase in nonprofit organizations, changing (and often more demanding) board and stakeholder expectations of EDs, and increased willingness on the part of both boards and EDs to part company over issues of mission, policy, and management.This book is an excellent description of the basics of executive director transition, including descriptions of factors that lead to executive director transition and checklists for board members, interim EDs, and others to use in making the transition in nonprofit management as painless as possible.The authors cite seven \\"factors,\\" or reasons, EDs leave a nonprofit: career ladder (advancing in a career), godfather (\\"they made me an offer I couldn't refuse\\"), gone fishing (the ED who is no longer attending to business), sudden loss (injury, illness, or death of the ED), burnout, cutting the mustard (not getting the job done), and the ten-year factor (many EDs sense it's time to leave, or board culture changes over time to signal to the ED that a change is needed). My consulting practice has included many clients with examples of overlapping factors (the burnout ten-year ED who no longer cuts the mustard and goes fishing), but the basic categories are valid and recognizable.I especially like the chapter on building strong board-ED relationships. Hiring a new ED represents a fresh opportunity for the board and ED to clarify roles, set expectations, and build the trust and respect that are central to effective nonprofit governance. Of course, part of that process is building transition planning into the new ED's job responsibilities and the board's expectations for its own performance. After all, one goal of ED transition should be that it's easier the next time."},{"Title":"AutoCAD 2000 Manual completo del Usuario con CD-ROM: Manuales Users, en Espanol / Spanish (PC Users; La Computacion Que Entienden Todos) (Spanish Edition)","review":"Es un buen libro, tanto para principiantes como para usuarios avanzados, como yo, que lo utilizo continuamente como manual de consulta.Ademas hice el curso on-line de la Facultad de Arquitectura de la Universidad de Buenos Aires, que dirige Sorhanet y esta basado en este libro."},{"Title":"AutoCAD 2000 Manual completo del Usuario con CD-ROM: Manuales Users, en Espanol / Spanish (PC Users; La Computacion Que Entienden Todos) (Spanish Edition)","review":"El libro es bueno, porque, los coamandos estan en espa&ntilde;ol e ingles, asi que cualquiera que sea el idioma, ingles o espa&ntilde;ol, es muy utiL, tiene muchoes ejemplos, y es de bastante ayuda!"},{"Title":"Pillar of the Sky","review":"Cecelia Holland is one of my favorite authors because of her book Until the Sun Falls, which is a novel from the Mongol perspective about their invasions of Russia and Europe. It is on my top five list definitely.In fact, because of that book, I have bought several of her other books and I have come to the conclusion that she is one of the best novelists in the world at doing what she does. And what she does is take an event or a person or a group from history and recreate them as accurately as possible in novel form. She does this whether it makes them more interesting or less, whether it aids the novel or makes it worse.And, so as I look for Until the Sun Falls part two I chanced upon Pillar of the Sky, a novel about a man living in ancient Britain who tries to build something great. There are many interesting forces at work in the novel, including the difficulties the protagonist faces as he confronts his primitive peers and even his own nature, which is slightly more developed than those around him but is still prone to many of their weaknesses.The writing is smooth and powerful and if you like historical, or in the case of Pillar of the Sky, pre-historical, novels you will probably find it excellent. The characters are interesting and realistic, the main character even has flaws and makes mistakes!However, being the weakminded pulp media reader that I am I wouldn't mind if she wanted to make the book a little more exciting by adding a few more fights or even a battle. I guess my problem is I am still looking to find Until the Sun Falls part two."},{"Title":"Pillar of the Sky","review":"I first read this story from my local library about ten years ago.

It will become a classic in time. For those who like historical fiction, this author is the very best!"},{"Title":"Pillar of the Sky","review":"Cecelia Holland has a gift for creating authentic historic characters -- so authentic that a 21st century reader might at times struggle to relate. I've found myself assuming her characters will develop along a certain arc - yearning for love, chasing wealth, seeking revenge -- only to end up surprised that, in the time and place of the story, that isn't necessarily what people did (I found this the case in Great Maria, and The Angel and the Sword). It's a question that good historical fiction forces us to explore: How much of our concept of \\"humanity\\" is truly human, and how much is influenced by our own culture? What would life be like under a completely different worldview and religion -- to value tribal loyalty over family, or status over safety? What values, then, are fundamentally human - The need to belong? Sex? Transcendence over death?The truth is that, throughout history, people did things for reasons we might never understand. This is Holland's realm: writing beyond the \\"what\\" and \\"how\\" of history and delving into the \\"why.\\" In Pillar of the Sky, she creates a world where the why (in this case, of Stonehenge) is magnificent and mysterious - but also fundamentally human. It is the story of Moloquin, an \\"unwanted one,\\" exiled from his tribe, forced to develop extreme personal strength and ingenuity to survive. Moloquin grows up to be a force of change on the world around him, within his own prehistoric tribe on the Salisbury Plain and beyond. As an outsider, Moloquin finds solace in the (then-ancient) \\"circle of stones,\\" which except for a small guild of astronomers, serves only as a place of the dead; As a leader, the stone circle becomes the focus of Moloquin's sole ambition -- an ambition larger than any before him. His ferocity may be borne of the pain of being an \\"unwanted one,\\" of a spiritual awakening, or the sheer need to prove his own strength -- it's not always sympathetic. But his deep need to create a new world, the integrity of his mission, the price he and his community paid - I felt it. His story resonated with me as a human story.We know Stonehenge was not built by slavery, organized religious or political powers, commerce or industry. When it can't be explained by familiar examples of large-scale human enterprise, it's tempting to imagine that it must be \\"alien.\\" Why would a small human community expend such immense, raw power over so many years? We may never know the exact answer, but Pillar of the Sky shows how the most intimate human stories can culminate in massive and mystical achievement. In a sharply-rendered world with unfamiliar rituals, food, and family life, we can recognize the familiar tenacity of human will: the need to transcend, the need to create, the drive to belong - a strength that might just move mountains."},{"Title":"The Northridge Wheelers","review":"I thought this book was one of the best I have ever read.

I can't wait until the author writes a sequel!"},{"Title":"The Water Baby: Family Man (Harlequin Superromance No. 686)","review":"Temple Wyatt had money, power, hotels, resorts, but none of that mattered. More than anything Temple wanted his little girl back. His ex-wife Miranda kidnaped her and now no one can find them. After months of agonizing and praying for his little girl he sees his daughter Rebecca during a TV interview. Rebecca was on a yacht that exploded killing her mother and her mother's rich friend. Rebecca was flung out to sea and rescued by a shrimper, Daisy Sloan. For some reason Rebecca remembers nothing and says nothing. The only person she allows to comfort her is Daisy. The doctors seem to think that Daisy is the little girl's anchor. Temple is distraught at the senseless act that took his ex-wife's life and could have killed his daughter. Temple is even more distraught that his daughter does not seem to recognize him or anyone else except the strange Miss Sloan. Like it or not Daisy and Temple are stuck with each other for Rebecca's sake. Hopefully they will survive the danger that surrounds them, not to mention surviving each other, long enough to face the attraction that simmers between them.Interesting and captivating story. I was sucked into the story from beginning to end. In the beginning, however, I was not at all happy about Daisy's attitude regarding Temple's place with his daughter. I realize that everyone was looking at this through Rebecca's emotional state. However, Temple went through Hell and back while his daughter was gone. Than to get her back under such awful circumstances, only to be told that Daisy Sloan was trying to take charge of the child. What if Rebecca never recovered? I would think that it would be in her best interest to have her father in her life. Oh well, that is just my own complaint. The story was well written and deserved all five stars."},{"Title":"The Water Baby: Family Man (Harlequin Superromance No. 686)","review":"This was an unusual romance. It had a lot going on, but surprisingly the pace was somewhat slow. Just not what I'm used to from Harlequin novels.Temple has been looking for his daughter for awhile now. She was kidnapped by his ex-wife and he hasn't heard from them in weeks. So when he sees a tv interview with his daughter's picture, he becomes alarmed when he realizes that she was on a yacht that was blown up. He rushes to Galveston to find her only to discover that she won't let him near her. The only one she'll let near is Daisy, the shrimper who rescued her from the ocean. Having regressed quite a bit, his daughter is only fit to be around Daisy, who had to put her life on hold to help this little girl. Temple realizes that he'll have to stay on the island until his daughter is better, but he's not sure what he thinks about Daisy.Daisy is actually a really good character. I like that she's a shrimper, which is usually more of a masculine job. It gives her strength and makes her interesting. She's compassionate too, she'd have to be in order to take care of this little girl that is just thrust into her life. Temple on the other hand I didn't like as much. I thought he did way too much of a personality change in the beginning and the rest of the book on he just doesn't seem authentic. In fact, most of his motivations are really hard to align. The little girl, Becca, since she's mute most of the novel is more of a prop for Daisy to take care of too. She does have a little personality, but really Daisy is the lead of this story.Explosions, rescued girls, gun shots; this is a pretty exciting tale. But it reads rather slow and drawn out because its more of a character building type of book. And that's just fine. I'm just glad it had a little excitement and a plausible storyline. Since this is a romance its got some risque scenes in it, but there's really only one and it goes pretty quickly. The rest of the reading is about Daisy interacting with other characters and taking care of Becca. There are a few scenes of Temple doing his thing, but not many. I think the length on this book was pretty good, any longer and it might have gotten boring, any shorter and I would have felt cheated.Decent enough romance with some action. I can't say I'd really seek the author out, but I didn't mind reading this at all.The Water BabyCopyright 1996299 pagesReview by M. Reynard 2012"},{"Title":"House and Household in Elizabethan England: Wollaton Hall and the Willoughby Family","review":"This book takes a grand tour of just what it is that made up an Elizabethan House and Family. Starting in the Early Tudor Age, It deftly compiles much historical information about just what went into building the marvelous house at Wollaton, Nottinghamshire. Focusing on the life of Sir Francis Willoughby, it shows what the differing tensions and situations were that led up to the building of the grandest example of Elizabethan Architecture. While this book is wonderful for anyone researching Gentry Life in England, and the general situation under which most houses were built in that time, It suffers in some areas from incorrect historical information, and leaves some items regarding the family strangely in the dark. As a historical performer who portrays Sir Francis at a Local Renaissance Festival, This book has become a staple in my library. One should note though, that sometimes more information is included in the footnotes and bibliography than is included in the text of the book, and any historical researchers would do well to make sure to reference the extensive footnotes. Otherwise, this book is wonderful! It is surprising that there are not very many books such as this, considering that the Willoughby's are one of the most well documented Elizabethan families. But anyone searching for A well written and researched book will not go wrong with this one!"},{"Title":"Human chemistry","review":"Aside from Goethe's classic 1809 novella Elective Affinities, which argues that human lives are bound by the laws of chemical affinities, Fairburn's Human Chemistry is the ground-breaking historical book in the new field of interpersonal chemistry. For such early period in history, and knowing that Fairburn is essentially a sociology writer, we find eloquent statements such as \\"men are like chemicals elements in a well-stocked laboratory, and the manager, foreman, or handler of men, in his daily work, may be considered as the chemist.\\" The job of the handler of men, according to Fairburn, is to assemble the optimal reactions resulting from ideal combinations of individuals. The book is short, only 55 pages, and written in terms of verbal analogies, essentially, but all-in-all an excellent book. Fairburn even states that people can be classified by divisions of individual entropy values. Fascinating little booklet!"},{"Title":"Coincidence of Memory","review":"There are so few real artists today. Mr. Mortensen is one of them.

Some poems made my head spin to say, \\"this is one deep guy\\"."},{"Title":"Coincidence of Memory","review":"I loved this book!! It's an awesome collection of Viggo's very many talents! great photography, poetry, painting skills all in one book. I bought it and happy to have it in my book collection. his photography picks captured the true beauty often not seen in many pics, they make you see what isn't often noticed by our human eyes and the things often taken for granted in our lives. all life is beautiful and there is beauty in all things. great book I recommend it to every one. I love it personally."},{"Title":"Coincidence of Memory","review":"It's a lovely book of poetry and photography. I gave it to a friend as a birthday present and she loved it too :)"},{"Title":"Coincidence of Memory","review":"A wonderful, multifaceted, book from a truly talented man. I especially love the poems, they keep making my mind go dizzy in a good way. I've never owned an art book before, and this was a great choice for my first one."},{"Title":"Coincidence of Memory","review":"I have enjoyed this book a lot. Being a Viggo Mortensen admirer I found it to be a Great Read."},{"Title":"Coincidence of Memory","review":"I was thrilled to find that Viggo Mortensen, classically talented actor, had a flare for art that was more complex and unique than his beautiful face. Once I got this book, though, I found that \\"different\\" didn't even begin to describe it.This beautiful little book is comprised of three artistic areas: Paintings, photography, and poetry.The photography: gorgeous and original. Viggo catches beautiful moments of nature, reflections, light, and human form. Often, pictures that are already beautiful captures of color will have added features, like slashes and flickers of light, which you'd almost think were photographing errors except that they add so perfectly to the pictures. Sometimes these flashes of light merely add brightness, whereas at other times they take whatever mood the picture already possesses to a new level. For example: one of my favorite photos shows three dogs, two on leashes and one standing off to the side. One of the leashed dogs, a dalmation, is straining on the leash and has fangs bared towards the lone dog. In this picture, the two leashed dogs are blurred in motion and all three of them have glowing eyes! Again, you'd think that this was a photographic error, but it suits the picture perfectly: the dogs already look almost ethereal and the glowing eyes just enhance the aggressive and surreal mood of the image.The paintings: beautiful and abstract. These paintings often feature slashes of color across blank backgrounds and are gorgeously presented; they are artistically abstract without being frusterating or making the reader feel like they're developing a migraine trying to figure them out.The poetry: ah yes, the poetry. The poems in this book, unlike the paintings and photography, most likely will give you a migraine if you try to figure them out. Remember the title of this review? That rather abstract sentence was a small sample of the form of poetry in this book. Let's just say that if Picasso was a poet instead of a painter, his poems would probably look like this. Don't get me wrong, I love the poems. They're just not like any poetry I've read for a good while.I actually wrote this review mainly to discuss the poems. You'll probably only appreciate them if you're willing to be very open-minded; in fact, the best course of action would be to knock the walls of your skull down and let your brain unravel in all its unlimited, unhindered glory. Maybe I'm making this sound too complicated, but I'm used to complex poetry and the sort in this book required an entirely new kind of mindframe. It's clear that Viggo totally let his mind run when he wrote these, and that's good; that's the beauty of poetry, after all. Just be warned not to take it too seriously or solidly.Some of the poems are definitely more clear than others; if you have trouble reading the more complex ones, just do what I do: don't try to make sense of them until after you read them. Once you finish and turn your head away from the page, the different pieces of the poem start to become clearer.Altogether, this book, in all its abstract and geometric glory, is a unique treasure that I'm happy to own. If you've an open, traveling mind and wish to possess a gem of new shape and beauty, I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Coincidence of Memory","review":"I concede that the author has come up with some interesting photos/paintings as well as poetry. I was at first excited when I saw a few images from Miyelo, his latest book of photography. However when I browsed it in the bookstore, I found I couldn't justify buying it. It just wasn't that great.I wonder really if he weren't a &quot;movie star&quot;, would Mr. Mortensen be so readily embraced or celebrated as a writer or an artist? Certainly I don't begrudge him from seeking out other forms of expression that are more restorative than the film industry. But I know many anonymous painters and writers who are far far more original and every bit as good, if not better. They aren't conventionally handsome or beautiful.And they aren't celebrities."},{"Title":"Coincidence of Memory","review":"This book is definitely NOT a coffetable collectable! I found it lacking in professionalism of photography, tasteless in \\"poetry\\" and the paintings garish collages. The photos with red lines obliterating half the picture are amateurish. I showed this to a photographer who looked & was not impressed. The \\"poetry\\" has no form, cadence, rhyme or rhythm and is vulgar in nature. Sorry, but this book will not be part of my collectable books."},{"Title":"Coincidence of Memory","review":"Actor. Musician. Photographer. And, last and perhaps most intriguingly, poet. Viggo Mortensen wears plenty of different hats as an artist. \\"Coincidence of Memory\\" collects assorted poetry, paintings and photographs ranging from the late 1970s to 2002. Whenever they are from and whatever they are, his creations are vivid and very striking.In both his visual and literary art, Mortensen shows a sort of evocative simplicity. His poetry can bring to mind very powerful emotions that are left up to us to imagine (\\"Tried to say something/that filled my mouth/and longed to rest/in your ear/Don't dare write/it down for fear it'll/become words, just/words...\\"). He can also bring to mind simpler, more everyday things like arguments, frozen roads and observing the changes in nature.His photography has the delicacy of a painting, with skilful use of light and color -- and the paintings are even better. For example, one is a simple shot of a mossy tree trunk surrounded by dry grass; another is of a leafless tree reflected in a car hood, and yet another is a darkly-lit picture of some little plants on the ground. Most striking is a photograph of electrical cables \\"intruding\\" on a grassy spot.There's an intimate, capture-the-moment feel to Mortensen's photographs, as if you can see these things through his eyes for a moment. The paintings are just as good, such as \\"Self-Portrait, April\\". It's a picture of Mortensen's lips and chin, with all other featured obscured by a collage-like swirl of hazy artwork. The paintings are definitely absorbing, even if you don't understand the story behind them.Viggo Mortensen's evocative, thoughtful artwork is shown in three different forms -- poetry, photographs and paintings -- in the beautiful \\"Coincidence of Memory.\\" A haunting, remarkable collection of Mortensen's work."},{"Title":"Coincidence of Memory","review":"Several poems in this book shook my soul. Viggo is not using his fame to publish a bunch of crap that he's had in his old journal's since college. This is the real deal. The images brought forth by his words are spellbinding and unforgetable.There is honesty and bravery in his words.The visuals are an added bonus and enhance the experience of this book.I recommend this book to anyone who appreciates poetry and art. I recommend savoring every stanza."},{"Title":"Coincidence of Memory","review":"This book spans 25 years of Viggo's art. It includes paintings, photographs, and poems. I wanted to get inside Viggo and see things from his perspective, which he does allow.I was a little surprised by his poetry. It is not composed of rhyme or alliteration. It is often off-the-wall topics. My favorite is Keepsake about a letter opener. The poems are philosophical and definitely not ordinary. Other favorites are Communion-about a relationship and Edit-how one's work is reduced to a movie with the theater its grave.He likes to catch subjects in motion in photographs. Often they are blurred or have light coming in them as if someone opened up the door to the darkroom. They are skillful and interesting.His paintings (which are abstract) are surprisingly good. The blending of colors is beautiful.Viggo is definitely not just an actor; he is an artist in every sense."},{"Title":"Coincidence of Memory","review":"This book contains beautiful black and white and colour of Viggo's photographs with some poems and his paintings. Some images are crisp and others haunting and blurred which is very intriguing. Lovely blades of glass and old moss covered tree and flowers and lakes shows beauty of the country of New Zealand. You can see some of the images of the cast of the Lord of the Ring as well. Viggo shows us what he sees everyday through his lenses or with his paintings and his thoughts by his poems. They are very personal and delicate.I love the photograph of shadowy trees in black and white very much yet every time I open this book, I found more images whispering, talking and singing to me. It is a lovely book to pick up time after time."},{"Title":"Coincidence of Memory","review":"Coincidence of Memory is a very eclectic journey of thoughts and visuals which keep you mesmerized from one page to the next. It is a book that can be displayed and shared with friends or picked up in the need of some tranquil and thought provoking times. By reading the poems, verses and viewing the images created both through photography and paintings with much diversified mediums and imagery you are taken on a journey of creativity. The cover of the book drew me to it, as it brought me back to my own childhood when my parents used to take me to \\"El Retiro\\" a beautiful park in Madrid, Spain. The picture captured those feelings of peace and happiness of long ago and brought them to the present. That interpretation is what art photography is about, capturing an image in the physical and transferring it to feelings of the heart. Viggo exemplifies so many creative people's dreams and goals that you can be successful in doing a multitude of endeavors. He serves as a mentor to the creative mind and this book typifies that conviction. It is clear from immersing one self in this book that the author has acquired much wisdom, knowledge and deep seated feelings through travel and being exposed to different cultures at a young age. If this book is representative of his other literary works I for one will definitely be awaiting their many arrivals into my observer's view."},{"Title":"Coincidence of Memory","review":"The poems are vivid in imagery and filled with quiet emotions that gave me pause.

The images evoke the same response. You wonder what inspired them and want to know more. Some images and imagery are vivid; others are shrouded and mysterious. A couple of striking photographs were made, I imagine, while the author was filming LOTR."},{"Title":"Coincidence of Memory","review":"I wasn't aware that Viggo was a poet or photographer, but he is very good at both.

Many were attempting to grasp the significance and the nature of the democratic changes that were occurring. Tocqueville, a French aristocrat, took it upon himself to describe and explain in great detail to his fellow Europeans the American experiment in democracy, which had lasted a half century at the time his treatise \\"Democracy in America\\" appeared.For Tocqueville, the essence of democracy was equality. First political and social equality, but in addition rough equality of condition. But he was very concerned with issues of the power of the majority and centralization of government. It wasn't just formal governmental power, but the power of majority opinion to restrain independent thought that troubled him. He also thought that the liberty that people enjoyed under a regime of equality led to excessive individualism with the potential for forming an economic elite - a contradiction for a democracy.Commager touches on these concerns of Tocqueville. With the advantage of a century and a half of hindsight it is possible to quibble with Tocqueville and Commager does some of that. For example, Tocqueville's claim that only a democracy can form a just order is countered with obvious examples of injustice. Commager is surely correct in noting that the federal government has a better record of broadening individual rights than do local governments. But those observations do not really detract from the relevance of Tocqueville's insights.The book is far more a platform for Commager's views in the same areas. He finds the modern national security state to be akin to the paranoia of the slave-holding Southern aristocracy in its manner of dealing with threats - perceived or real - with an equal potential for aggressive action. He contends that American democracy has been essentially short-circuited by the consistent failure to take seriously the general welfare clause of the Constitution, the main exception being FDR's New Deal. He sees private enterprise (Tocqueville's individualism) as creating all manner of environmental and other problems that threaten our very survival.The book is really a compendium of Commager lectures. It is not a systematic treatment of Tocqueville or of the issues associated with democracy. It is a nice overview."},{"Title":"RUBAIYAT OF OMAR KHAYYAM, Translated into English Quatrains.

I've learned that piece now, and I play it every day. The only thing about the book I don't really like is the binding. It's bound like a paperback book you'd buy in a store, which makes it difficult for the book to stay open on the stand when you're playing.

I mean, everything is simple!!. So all in all, from homer to hans moleman, my reveiw says that if you are a little kid, you might get this book, but only if you are a super duper drawer, and anyone older than 10, it would be a waste of your time."},{"Title":"Cartooning with the Simpsons","review":"I am an illustrator, animator, AND I work at Fox. My copy of this book has gotten so much use over the 7-odd years I've had this, it should be falling apart. This is why this is such a great book:1) IT'EASY AND IT'S FUN. Many &quot;how-to&quot; aniimation and cartooning books purportedly cater to children, yet the drawing level is way beyond most entry-level artists; the Simpsons, by Groening's own admission started out as lame doodles. Everything is made up of circles and squiggles - perfect!2) IT'S WELL ORGANIZED AND VERSATILE. There are many poses and expressions to try drawing, which set you into the whole &quot;vocabulary&quot; of the Simpsons.3) IT'S FUNNY, AND REALLY EDUCATIONAL. Tips like &quot;Bend those elbows!&quot; and &quot;Marge's hair hides two bowling balls,&quot; not only get a laugh, but really give you an insight on how to contruct a solid animated figure.I refer to this book all the time, even for my own drawings. For the money, this has been one of the most useful pieces of reference I have. Get it for your favorite starving artist, or doodling kid."},{"Title":"Cartooning with the Simpsons","review":"I am a professional illustrator and am very impressed with Mr. Groening. Of course, it doesn't hurt I'm a huge fan of the show but this book is for everyone. The problem with most cartooning books is they create characters simply for the book so they always end up looking stupid. This book came after the characters were refined and it shows people of all ages how to approach cartooning. I'm adding it to my reference collection of illlstrating techniques."},{"Title":"Cartooning with the Simpsons","review":"This is just great! I'm sure every Simpsons fan has wondered if they could draw America's favorite family, and I'm sure plenty of you have got it down-packed. But if you just can't draw Bart's head, or Marge's body, I strongly suggest you buy this book (and afterwords, if you STILL can't draw them right, trace, hee hee). The book teaches you how to draw Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie's anatomy, and the best thing about the book is if you look at a picture of another character (for example, Apu), you can use Homer's anatomy (not making him so fat, mind you) and draw Apu from there. It's a great guide, so if you're a Simpsons fan and love to draw...buy it.

If anyone believes he or she will be able to instantly draw cartoons well after simply reading this or any other book, they need to get in touch with reality. The bottom line is: the secret of doing ANYTHING well -- and that includes cartooning -- is to PRACTICE. A LOT. That said, this is a great little book. It's written with a generous dose of humor, and it tells you exactly how to draw the Simpsons in certain poses. In other words, it's a good basic cartooning book if you are interested in drawing these specific characters and are willing to do the practice necessary to learn to draw them well. Once you're familiar with the construction of those little yellow bodies, then you can start making them do what you want them to do. (PRACTICE, remember?) If you have talent and imagination, it may also help get you started on drawing your own characters. No magic, no secrets, just a good book on how to draw the Simpsons."},{"Title":"Cartooning with the Simpsons","review":"Let's start this review with some reality.

You learn the secrets to the scale and balance of these characters....that Marge's hair is about 2 bowling balls high, bart's hair has 9 points, Lisa's hair has 8 points, you learn how many eyelashes each character has and how to place them, how the eyeballs should be placed on the head in comparison to the nose, how each characters hands and feet details should be drawn..... True, it is only 36 pages but it does give you all you need to start drawing the Simpsons family. What did I not like about this book? I really wanted tips on Mr. Burns, Moe, Smithers, Krusty.. Who is this book for? This book might be for a beginner but I doubt it. Want to learn how to draw? Look elsewhere. Someone with some skill or ability who wants to learn how to draw the Simpsons? Yes! On the side for extra cash do you street sketch, air brush at the local mall, do cartoons, do charicatures? Well, then get this book and use it to expand your portfolio. Are you just a kid (8 yrs to 88yrs old) who loves the Simpsons and wants to be able to look cool with your friends by drawing them?Get this book, live your life, be happy and have fun!"},{"Title":"Cartooning with the Simpsons","review":"This is a book that was published by Scholastic for the grade school market. It is less than 40 pages and pretty simplistic. It only shows you how to draw the 5 members of the immediate Simpson family.That being said, I am very glad I came across a used copy of this booklet. I have the large hardbound 'The Simpsons Notebook', but it is too valuable and cumbersome to carry with me to work. I take the bus 45 minutes each way and use this time to sketch and draw. So this older, smaller version is a copy I can carry with me easily and still have a decent, not great reference guide if the urge to sketch Homer, Marge, Lisa, Bart or Maggie suddenly strikes me on the bus."},{"Title":"Cartooning with the Simpsons","review":"This is a very good basic book on how to draw Simpsons characters, including motion and emotions.

It is organized alphabetically by author but has a detailed index that is helpful because it directs the reader to topics.All quotation books differ in one respect or another from each other so it is wise to consult and/or own many of them in order to cover these differences. The Penguin book gives many more quotes from classical sources such as Shakespeare and the Bible than other quotation books so offers depth not available everywhere.I recommend that anyone who needs access to quotations consult the Penguin book.Mary MacKenzie"},{"Title":"The Penguin Dictionary of Quotations (Penguin Reference Books)","review":"The \\"Penguin Dictionary of Quotations\\" makes a nice desk accessory for writers, lecturers, and academics. Those interested in citing or referencing classic quotes will find plenty from the expected sources of the Bible, Shakespeare, Milton, Dr. Johnson, Boswell, Swift, and Tennyson, for example. Euclid, Buddha, Emerson, and Dostoyevsky make appearances, along with a vast array of others who have multiple citations. Yet many others luminaries, such as Jane Elliot, Galileo, and Caligula, have but a single utterance cataloged.One third of the book is given over to the indices, an indispensable utility that really serves as the engine, allowing users to search by name and more importantly by key words and topics, which serve to propel most quotation seekers on their quests.The typeface used for the quotations is quite small but readable, but the even smaller point size employed for the index may push one's trifocals to the limit.Now that many of these quotes are available on the Internet from various sources (not all are entirely accurate and many are specialized), books of quotations seem quaint and musty, no doubt.

The authors stress that to start using instinct more you have to be physically in touch with your market - use your senses to absorb what is going on, rather than be insulated from it and only receive your business information through reports and statistics. It's full of examples that bring the authors' core messages to life - such as the billionaire retailer Philip Green's habit of walking around his stores in the dead of night so that he can walk where his customers will be walking tomorrow, see what they see, touch what they will touch and so on. A powerful argument for getting bosses out of board rooms and out to where the action is.There's a realization in most organizations now that we over-complicate and over-analyze. Jack Welch's book Straight From The Gut and Malcolm Gladwell's Blink are part of the correction that we are going through, as we look to work faster, 'truer', and with more of an emotional connection to our customers and our work. Smith & Milligan's new book is a welcome contribution to this 'return to instinct' - full of practical examples of how to put it into action.

Our hero is a loner with his own moral code and, when justified, kills without compunction, a deep believer in meeting out just deserts. Our hero is also equipped with unique abilities that allow our hero to discover what nobody else can and take out large groups of trained killers single handedly. Oh, also our hero doesn't talk much and likes sex. Sound familiar?Well, neither The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo nor One Shot were particularly original in any event. This was my first Lee Child, recommended by a very literate friend who is a fan. On the plus side, it kept me turning the pages. I wasn't bored, and didn't quit in frustration. On the downside, the legal part, the rules and events leading up to a criminal trial, were so wrong, so completely divorced from reality, that it bothered me. I'm afraid some people think this is how the justice system \\"works,\\" which would really be a shame. In sum, a decent thriller; no more, no less. If you haven't read The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo trilogy, cover those first; they at least have the novelty of their Swedish setting."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"One shot is for sure the best jack reacher novel out it is amazing and extremely difficult to put down!"},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"Most crimes want to know who, what, where, when, how, and why for a full solution. Then there is the question of plausibility. Does everything seem real? Now look at Lee Child. I have read eight of his novels and I have concluded that he has set a goal for himself, concentrate on the crime. Develop a character the reader empathizes with, then turn him loose to solve various crimes. Plot the crimes well, with the perpetrator concealed, and have the protagonist go to work and solve the case. Child then seems to set problems in his path (not the protagonist, the author), he takes the why and sets implausible motives then cranks the crime on high, every crime, regardless of motive is well plotted and made interesting. Then the action unfolds and motive is not necessarily made of interest to the solution. The solution always requires sympathy for the protagonist and the reader is drawn into the story due to the ability of the author. When the conclusion is reached it may be weak due to implausible restrictions imposed by the chosen motive but the story is still interesting because the crime, or crimes, are so well constructed. My advice is, with Child, ignore motive, grant him perpetrators with equal reasons for their crimes regardless of weak or implausible reasons for the crime itself, it is the solution that is being sought. And Child does a good job. In \\"One Shot\\" the perpetrators do the job themselves, they are fighting for millions of dollars, high millions, but do they hire outside professionals? No, they are the perps. But the story is interesting, I am not going to complain, although I did complain about why someone wanted to kill the vice-president of the U. S. There are other things, in the novels they all occur in different states, but all contiguous, Is Child going to work through all fifty, and maybe some foreign countries? And Reacher is magnificent, in each book he knows a branch of learning at the college level, different knowledge as is necessary. By keeping it all in each individual novel, the total amount necessary is hidden, so why complain? Read and enjoy, even learn a thing or two.Tags: Reacher, crime, mystery, army cover-up, city financing, city projects"},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"Do not be misled by the lack of summary to tempt you at the end of the book. Describing more would have spilled the plots. NOTHING is what it seemed. Reacher really got his hands full this time.The suspect in question for the shooting can't help Reacher much for investigation. Thus Reacher got to re-walk the case backward singlehandlely by himself. That means it's full of investigative works and conjunctions on what happened. And though that were PLENTY of surprises till the end, the author managed to make everything clicked with reasonably explanation to each suspense and question posed..Without giving much away, the book put through the meaning that those who understood you best need not be your best friends or families. For someone as observant as Reacher, even a distant ex-colleague, acquaintance from previous cases or even ex-adversary may trust can trust that Reacher would know them well given sufficient interest and interaction.Between Reacher and the shooting suspect, they kept a promise to each other for 14 years and were bonded together by a classified case. It was no secret that Reacher would always live up to his promise, be it to be a best friend or someone's worst enemy.Throughout the story from the shooting, right to the mole to Reacher's investigation, what appeared random or obvious may not be so. Who appeared to have done something, may not have been so.I can't give more explanations without giving the suspense away. Those who used to read novels like \\"The 3 investigators\\" in their teens, would surely love this.Lee Child also peppered the book with lot of trivial facts to expand the knowledge of the reader and you could tell that the research was well done such that the author could neatly relate and express various experiences of the characters.However, the author might have been abit too thick in his description of the environments, but it helped the reader to visualize the scene well, even as we skimmed through to rush down the plots.On the whole this is a recommended read, even if you are not a fan of the Jack Reacher series. As long as you are interested in suspenseful investigative work, this should be the book for you.This story is too good to be turn into a drama serial. It got to be read for the audience to fully appreciate the twists and turns. To give anything less than 5 out of 5 would be an injustice to the author and the story."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"In this novel, one of Reacher's successes in the army comes back to haunt him. A soldier he tracked down (although was unable to convict) has now killed 5 individuals in much the same way that he had before. Hiding in a parking garage, waiting, shooting ...Jack Reacher had promised Barr that if he ever heard that he'd done anything similar he would personally come and make sure he didn't survive. For 14 years, there was silence, then Reacher hears about Barr's arrest on television.The only thing Reacher can't explain is why Barr asked for him - the one person who could tell the world that he had committed a similar crime before. While the DA and Barr's attorney search for him, Reacher arrives.Every piece of evidence proves that Barr is responsible - and Reacher is certainly NOT going to mess with the case. All he wants is to make sure that Barr is convicted. After all, he escaped justice before when the Pentagon made it their business to cover up the whole event.But in the background there are those who are worried, and unfortunately they manage to push Reacher's buttons a little bit too hard. And Reacher decides to push back. As always, he pushes hard and fast ... leaving body parts along the way.Intriguing and unusual, this novel held my attention all of the way through - both times I read it.

All the evidence points towards an ex-marine colleague. He gets a slightly unsatisfactory $6 haircut, ditches his old clothes, buys a pair of deck shoes, some green trousers, and a green shirt, then proceeds to wear them for the entirety of the book (when he's not ironing them by placing them under his motel mattress at night), and yet women still can't resist him. He also manages to evade the entire police force, plus a vicious gang of Russian baddies on foot (whilst dressed all in green) as he negotiates his way round town kicking ass, taking names and concocting theories in his pursuit of the truth, which not only fly in the face of conventional thinking, but are also always proved to be 100% correct. These are two of the problems I encountered with Lee Child's 9th Jack Reacher thriller \`One Shot'. However, the main problem I had with it was the fact that last night I stayed up until 2am to finish it and am now quite tired.One Shot was my first experience of Lee Child's \`Jack Reacher' series, and was purchased solely on account of being half price. From the assorted reviews listed on the dust cover I was able to glean that Reacher was an irresistible and uncompromising rebel hero who I naturally assumed I would be rooting for over the course of the next 490 pages. I was somewhat surprised therefore, to find that as Reacher's luck finally ran out and he stood on the sidewalk, hands aloft, yet still wheeling out his \`dry' one liners to the Russian sniper who's crosshairs were trained on his head, my overwhelming feeling was \`It'd be quite funny if he shot him'. Herein lies the fundamental problem with \`One Shot', namely its highly unlikely lead character.In Reacher, Child has created an ice cold, all-action, fortysomething ex-forces tactical genius with an eye for the ladies, who isn't afraid of who he has to go through in pursuit of justice. In many ways you could draw parallels with Jack Bauer, a man whose maverick ways have kept TV audiences on the edge of their seats through 5 series of 24. But in many ways you couldn't. For example Bauer isn't 6ft5 and 250lbs. He probably never held the title of worlds best shot from a 1km distance. He might struggle to kill a man a lot bigger than him with a minute-long bear hug. And if he walked into your workplace out of the blue, smelling of five day old green clothes and started rabbiting on about conspiracies, you might be more inclined to ask to see some identification or call security, than to lend him your car then join him on a daring midnight raid on a Russian gang's secret lair without the assistance of the police. Jack Bauer is also employed by the government to uncover corruption and root out the bad guys, killing them if need be. For the unemployed Reacher however this is more of a hobby. Well, that and the ladies obviously.However, it is testament to the genuine suspense generated by 400 pages of ultra-descriptive scene setting and impressively in-depth development of multiple characters that I, like pretty much every woman Reacher has spent more than 5 minutes talking to, didn't get to sleep until past 2am last night. To bring the reader to the point of not only remembering the names of, but also simultaneously being genuinely intrigued to learn the individual fates over the next 90 pages of: a suspect, his sister, a lawyer, his daughter, a chief of police, a district attorney, a news reporter, a shooting range owner, a Russian gang leader, his 4 cronies, and, to a lesser extent, an ice-cold all-action ex-military hero, is no mean feat. The final set piece, Reacher's daring one-man mission into the depths of the Russian gang's hideout, whilst slightly far-fetched is an exciting and satisfactory reward for paying attention to the elaborate, yet not over-complicated, series of events that have gone before.Through Child's almost almost-obsessively descriptive narrative, a mind's-eye picture every location and character that Reacher encounters can be easily formed, which is the key to ensuring the reader's continued sense of involvement in the story. Unfortunately the picture one is invited to conjure up of Jack Reacher is an unlikely cocktail of Schwarzenegger, Rambo, McQueen, Casanova and the Green Cross Code Man. Difficult to empathise with, and certainly from my point of view, difficult to actually like."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"If you haven't yet read a Jack Reacher novel by Lee Child, you have a great treat waiting for you. One Shot is a great place to start.As the book opens, a sniper moves into position in a crowded urban area . . . and quickly kills five people. The scene is like one that we've read about and watched on television all too often in the last few years. You'll feel it in your gut.The police move in quickly and do an exemplary job of tracking down the sniper, one James Barr. Barr's finger prints are everywhere and there's lots of trace evidence. While his attorney interviews him, Barr stands mute . . . except to tell his attorney to get Reacher.Reacher is soon on his way . . . not because anyone can find him . . . but because he hears about Barr's actions . . . and comes running (at least as much as one can run by taking a bus). Barr has killed before and Reacher has promised to take him out if it happens again.But circumstances aren't what they seem, and Reacher finds himself drawn into helping Barr's attorney check out the evidence. More and more the evidence doesn't make sense. What does it mean?In the background, mysterious figures track Reacher and try to derail his efforts.Reacher is one of those iconic characters who define new dimensions for fiction. Reacher is an ex-MP who wants to stay off-the-map and live his life in peace . . . with occasional interesting interludes with beautiful ladies. He travels light. When his clothes get dirty, he buys new clothes and throws the old ones away. He always registers under assumed names (obscure baseball players from the 1930s are his favorite choice), pays cash and usually moves on the next day. He combines the bravado and battle skills of James Bond with his taste for ladies, but operates more like Dr. Richard Kimble in a Fugitive-like scuttle away from the limelight and police attention. Intriguingly, he operates on virtually no money so he has to talk his way into wheels to do his investigations. Reacher is a sort of antihero in other ways. He doesn't tell the truth, encourages others to lie and gets away with it. The results are unexpected, interesting and unique. Very nice!"},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"Each one of the Jack Reacher books seems to be better than the last. I absolutely love Child's shotgun style, and Reacher is definitely my favourite character in the thriller genre. Child's pared-down writing style makes his books beg to be read quickly. And Reacher is the quintessential tough guy. He's always one step ahead of everyone else, including the bad guys, and he's not afraid of a fight in a good cause. In this book Reacher gets mixed up with some Russian bad guys who will stop at nothing to achieve their goals. There's a lot about snipers in the book, and that is incredibly interesting. We also get to meet some wonderful secondary characters. I particularly like the ex-marine Cash in this one. A guy right after Reacher's own heart. They are almost like two sides of a coin. Child excels in describing these \\"Buddy-scenarios\\". But Reacher never hangs around with any of them afterwards.

Now it seems he's done it again.Reacher gets on a bus & heads for the American heartland where, with his usual keen eyes & heightened senses he begins to see the inconsistencies in this case of perfect clues.& when Barr is beaten into a coma in jail & a young, harmless woman who had set Reacher up for a group fist-fest is killed, the evil doers have stepped across Reacher's lines, & now he's determined to find the puppet master.Classic Reacher -- taut, provocative & entertaining. Could not put it down!"},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"Lee Child's Jack Reacher is in my opinion the finest hero in contemporary fiction of any kind. I'm sure others have their favorites, but Reacher to me represents the epitome of the hero. An odd kind of hero to be sure: a couple or so decades ago, Reacher would have been considered an anti-hero.Reacher, a veteran of more than a decade in the military (and eight prior novels) has decided to fly under the radar. He has no permanent address; no credit cards; no phone; nothing that can be used to locate him. No job or significant other either. Reacher goes as the spirit moves him.And the spirit often seems to move him toward involvement in troublesome situations.This time, Reacher is enjoying the morning after with a Norwegian he picked up on a Miami Beach. He glimpses a television news report that one James Barr had gone on a shooting spree. Reacher, wearing only the clothes on his back, boards a bus --- airplane travel leaves a paper trail --- and heads off to an unnamed Indiana city.As it happens, upon being arrested for shooting down four people, Barr had asked for Reacher. The reason turns out to be a surprise.Child's Jack Reacher novels are loaded with surprises, one after another. The man (Childs) raises plotting to an art. His characters are rich and multifaceted even when introduced only peropherally. Lee Childs is simply a master of his craft and every page is a delight.I don't like to describe the plot and action of a novel in any great detail because I thnink that steals the pleasure of it from others who have yet to read it, so I'll spare you a lengthy description of what happens in \\"One Shot.\\" What I will say is that I devoured it in a single night because the novel really is a classic page-turner.Jerry"},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"I look forward to each new Jack Reacher book and, to date, have never been disappointed. \\"One Shot\\" never lags, with a twisting plot and interesting characters.

I lost interest and finished it because I had only so many chapters left.There wasn't any big surprise. It was a novel about trying to figure out who the bad guys are. I'm just used to Dekker-style plot twists. So nothing against Lee Child. But I won't be reading anything else by him."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"Lee Child is a gifted thriller writer, who unfortunately in ONE SHOT, has come down with a major case of James Patterson-itis - the tendency of crime suspense writers to destroy the logic of their entire narrative in their eagerness to spring a surprise villain on the reader at the last moment. Patterson began this lamentable trend at the end of ROSES ARE RED, when he identified the arch-criminal of the novel as a hitherto mousy FBI ally, who had meekly aided Alex Cross in several previous adventures. And ever since this most unconvincing psycho has haunted the Cross novels with all the menace of a fla ccid noodle. But Patterson assures us he really, really is one bad dude.Similarly in ONE SHOT we are asked to swallow that a character who, in the early pages of the novel, was obviously totally confused in his own mind as to the nature of both the book's central crime and of its perpetrator is, in fact, a key insider. Evidently, Child shifted gears somewhere mid-novel and selected his bad guy at random in spite of having already logically ruled him out.Too bad. Otherwise this was a decent page-turner in line with the other Reacher novels."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"One Shot opens as five people in a small town are killed by a sniper who is quickly caught. Or so it seems. Actually, nothing is what it seems in this fast-paced, absolutely riveting novel. The hero is Jack Reacher, who used to be an Army cop. Reacher is smart, honest, likeable, and MEAN when he needs to be! The author wastes no time or words in this cut-to-the-chase thriller."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"I first was introduced to Jack reacher when I read, 'The Enemy', which I thought was well written and entertaining, being aware that that was a prequel to the other books. However, as good as that was, I was in no means prepared for how fantastic and addictive this character could be in present day. I'm a huge fan of Roert Crais, and if you've read his Elvis Cole mysteries and are familiar with, and love Joe Pike, you'll go crazy for Reacher. He's Joe Pike with looks and oodles of charm. I remember first reading Crais and Michael Connelly and thinking I'd discovered a gold mine. I'd say the same is true here. This thriller revolves around a sniper taking out five civilians in downtown Indiana. There are mounds of evidence against one man, and so consequently, it seems to be an open and shut case. The man has one request while pleading his innocence, and that's to find Jack Reacher. When Jack arrives the seemingly easy case suddenly begins to become more complex and Reacher might be the next target. This is a top notch thrill ride garanteed to have you turning pages late into the night. Now I can't wait to start back at the beginning with his other books."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"As usual, Lee Child delivers. Jack reacher is every woman's fantasy and then you add the suspense, twists and surprises that Lee Child always emerges his character in and you have an unstoppable combination.Picked Killing Floor up at an airport, having left home without enough reading material and have been a Lee Child fan ever since. Can't wait for the next book!"},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"i couldnt put this book down.. he is back and at his best.. great writing, premise a bit contrived but who cares.. what a gem of a protagonist in reacher!!!"},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"but... A motive that leaves the reader wondering how apt the phrase overkill is.A writer who can weave a spell, tho he still struggles from time to time."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"I originally bought a couple of the \\"Reacher\\" books after reading the one in which he was a MP major which I thought was great. In all the other books, he has apparently left the army so the reader doesn't get the inside scoop on army life. Without Reacher's fight against the army establishment as a backdrop, the various plots are lame."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"Lee Child is a brilliant writer. We adore the Jack Reacher character and can't wait for the next book in the pile."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"But don't start with this one, start with 'Killing Floor' (the first in the series). It won't be long til you've read them all!"},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"I like the Jack Reacher books. He's a good character and I like his role. This is the first book that I have read with him. This is not the best one but it is still a good book. I would buy this again. Try Persuader by Lee child it is another Jack Reacher book but has more action."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"Jack Reacher is ready to take on anyone or anything. Get ready for some good reading."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"No better discripton could be made of Jack Reacher. When the cards are down he is an all American killing machine. No brand of criminal or Assassin can compete. When it comes to kill he makes sure, he usually kills them twice. All that said I have enjoyed each and every one of Mr. Childs novels and will continue to read all of them in the future. You cannot miss when you read his offerings for high adventure and drama."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"The New York Times called ONE SHOT 'pure escapist gold' and for those fans of Lee Child's Jack Reacher character it is just that- a good, action thriller. Of course, there's also the fact that you have to offer up that willing suspension of disbelief to jump into the plot. But hey! Isn't that why we love entertainment? Everytime we open a good book or plop oursleves down in a theater seat we give ourselves up to the storyline or plot and, well, maybe some serious couch time or some overpriced popcorn and chocolate covered raisins.Whether we come away satisfied with the entertainment is the real question. ONE SHOT is a satisfying escape.In this case a former Army semi-combat sniper is accused of gunning down innocent civilians and asks for Jack Reacher. Reacher, of course, shows up and per Jack Reacher social and professional skills, all hell breaks loose.The Jack Reacher series isn't a marathon run that covers new ground. Instead they offer quick sprints that pump up the adrenaline and show Child's ability to get you racing to the finish line in winning form.Another good read."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"Only is this my favorite Reacher book, but one of my all time favorite books. This is just an outstanding read on so many levels. One Shot is well written, great characters, great actions, and many many fantastic plot twists, and of course, Reacher kicking butt.One shot starts off simple enough. A man is in a parking garage and starts to shoot people like a sniper would, and he is a sniper. It seems cut and dry, but not all is as it seems. Soon Reacher is in the middle of it and has to sort everything out, and some people have the idea to get Reacher out of the way. Yeah, good luck on that one. I don't want to give to much of the plot away, but trust me, it has a lot of plot turns.I love how Reacher get involved and how things turn out.If you haven't read any of the Reacher books, then this is one you need to read. I hated to see this story end, and I've read it a lot of times, and enjoy it every time I read it. If you read One Shot, you won't be sorry."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"Another great book in the Jack Reacher series, One Shot opens with an account of the murder of 5 people. It's clear from the start who committed the crime... but Jack Reacher quickly determines that things are not what they seem. Great read!"},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"\\"One Shot\\" by Lee Child is the first of his Jack Reacher novels I've read and it definitely won't be the last. In fact, I finished \\"One Shot\\" yesterday and went out and found \\"The Hard Way\\" and started reading it this morning. I plan on picking up the earlier books of the series as well as the newer ones.The story involved a military sniper, and as a former Army sniper, that is what initially drew me to checking out the book. However, it is the character Jack Reacher that I thourouly enjoyed and made me want to seek out the others in the series. I'm very glad I decided to check this book out.Jack Reacher is a hero I want to know more about. He's tough, smart, with yet a bit of vulnerability. The book was suspenseful with good action, but it also had you thinking along with Reacher as his investigatory skills and keen observation unraveled the mysterious circumstances surrounding the shooting spree that opened the book. It had good bad guys, a critical element in any action story, and enough plot twists and turns to keep you guessing at what was coming next. It is the kind of book you don't want to put down because you just have to see where things are going.Over all, this was a very fun read full of action and suspense. Lee Child has created a great character and I now see why these books are so popular. I wish I would have discovered them earlier, but the good thing is I can read them now and not have to wait so long between them. Highly recommended for a good action story!Reviewed by Alain Burrese, J.D., author of Hard-Won Wisdom From the School of Hard Knocks."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"All the Lee Child books are great, I ordered as many as I could find after I read the first 2."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"This is by far one of my most favorite Recher novel yet. It's No wonder this book has been optioned for a movie deal. I've read all of the novels in order and every one has gotten better than the last(except for \\"Running Blind\\" The ending was a little far fetched in that one). Next to \\"The Enemy\\" this one is my favorite. Now I'm off to read \\"The Hard Way\\". I bet it will be BANGIN!"},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"I trashed the last two Reacher novels I read... but this one I like. Child is at his best when setting his novels in the Heartland. In this book, Reacher is tough, rough, independent, but believable. And the characters are right out of Real America. Read it... you'll like this one. Reacher out of NYC is a better Reacher."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"Between Jack and Lee you are caught in the story from page 1.Lee Childs is certainly one of the best authors of dectective solving crime novels."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"I really enjoyed Lee Child's One Shot. I love the main character. The plot is a page turner. I can't wait to read more of his books."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"This is Childs best plot, but probably least fulfilling novel.I found the action, of which there is plenty, predictable, and not written with the same brilliance that was demonstrated in say, the final acts of \\"Killing floor\\", or \\"Die Trying\\". if someone had said One Shot would all end at someones house in the back of beyond, for the final showdown, I would have said \\"never !, not again, surely\\".The whole story a little flat and lifeless, and I was hoping for the same peaks at troughs of excitement that the other books described in spades.I will still read Childs, but for his next book(s) I hope he works a little less on trying to come up with the 'perfect plot', and a little more on removing the formulaic nature of the action and story progression."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"In this Reacher installment, a sniper guns down several people as they are leaving work and Reacher finds himself in the middle of all the action. All evidence points to a man who has an ugly past which Reacher knows about but it's too much of a slam dunk to be convinced that it's him. The evidence points to a setup and Reacher and the family's defense attorney are out to find the truth.This is one of the best Child books I've read so far. Next to Tripwire and the Killing Floor, this story ranks at the top."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"Not always do books keep my attention but I breezed through it in one flight. Everyone has covered the plot so here is my thought.There were some areas a bit shaky and some that were not explored far enough. But overall, the reading was quick, entertaining and keot you wanting the next chapter. I appreciated how it flipped back and forth between different groups of characters to keeo the timelines in sync. I dislike books that each chapter make you go back in time. This followed realtime on both sides, the good and evilAnother well done Jack Reacher novel"},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"Lee Child remains on top of his game with One Shot.His prose doen't flow like most authors and has flaws and inconsistencies at times,but still a good quick read. His Jack Reacher main character remains almost superhuman at times, but the base story line was as good as any in the series. Don't wait for the softcover, this is worth the price of hardcover."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"Once again Lee Child has produced an extraordinary Jack Reacher tome. I had no idea what to expect. I had read the first few pages some time ago when it was at the back of The Enemy. It took me where I didn't think we were going and that is what I love about Child's prose. Going where you don't expect to go."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"I have also read all of the Reacher novels, and the credibility is getting stretched thin. With Reacher's(Captain Shrug)ease of winning enemies he would have had his brains blown out about 3 books ago in the real world, despite his understated toughness and the authors attempts at verisimilitude. But if you totally buy into the adolescent fantasy of a totally cool and totally invulnerable tough guy (nothing wrong with that as it is FICTION) you will not be disappointed. I am pretty much burned out on the character for now."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"I read all Jack Reacher books and for some reason, this one just didn't quite do it for me. I think part of it was the story wasn't as good. SPOILER! The criminal enterprise which set up James Barr for those killing was just too improbable. Why bother setting him up when they could have done the shootings themselves and noone would have been the wiser. I'm also tired of Jack Reacher being a hobo. Can't he just stay put for a little while? Still, despite all the minuses it wasn't a complete loss so I'm giving it 4 stars"},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"This one has the plusses and minuses of a Hollywood movie. It's fast paced, it's got good action, it's got mildly shallow characters and it has lots of implausibility. But you'll watch it in the theatre, why not read it in a book? Well, usually a book is better, since it is able to develop ideas and reasons better than a movie can, I suppose.This is the second Reacher novel I've read. I think I like this one slightly better than the first. I usually start to really like them, but then some implausibility -- to extend the \\"shock\\" revelation -- just doesn't ring true.The main character is too smart (and has too good a memory), is too tough, too meticulous, and too cool to be a realistic character, but for a Hollywood movie? Sure, why not. He's clearly a guy who plays by his own rules (too much so to be realistic, but who cares)? The guy only wears the cloths on his back and has no possessions...he lives \\"off the grid\\"...of course, his clothes get ruined each time--as does anything on his person--yet he always seems to have just enough cash on him to keep up his lifestyle in the next scene. There must be a secret ATM card in his shoe...I picture the main character as a mix between Steven Segal and \\"Jack Slater\\" from the Last Action Hero movie. He can go around bullying, attacking and even killing people (regardless of whether they are man, woman or law enforcement), and as long as he's got his version of \\"right\\" on his side...it's all good. No ramifications.As with a Hollywood movie, the mildly-too-shallow characters are supporting cast bordering on being \\"extras\\". They speak when they need to, they're uncharacteristically silent when they need to be, they make revelations (as uncharacteristic as they are sometimes) when they need to, even the females get the hots for the main character when they need to...they're perfect support cast to make the main character seem cool.Still, if you can get past \\"scenes\\" where the main character has figured it all out, yet won't tell anyone just yet...even though the support cast is spending hours with him (and are apparently okay just sitting there with him for an hour after he says \\"hold on...\\")...well you get the point.I gave this one four stars. I like action movies. The book is well written and there is enough good description and characterization to get by. For me, it was like a good movie that I enjoyed...I finished with a bunch of \\"how?\\", \\"why didn't he just...\\", and \\"that didn't make sense\\"; but all in all, I then recommend it to my friend the next day."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"Great story - but I can't picture Tom Cruise playing Jack Reacher... he was 6 ft. 5 and 250 lbs and that does not describe Tom Cruise."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"I had looked forward to the mystery, it was as good as it gets.

When the story finally kicked in, it moved.It was hard not to picture Jack as the drastically shorter Tom Cruise, even though I haven't seen the movie yet, but I went with the flow and really enjoyed the story. There were plenty of twists and turns and the writing kept me interested right to the end. Outside of the annoying tendency of the author to use passive phrasing, sometimes in massive blocks, things went well.

There are much better actors out there who could represent Jack Reacher more realistically."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"This is the first Lee Child book I've read. I wanted to see the movie, Jack Reacher, but was curious about the story and wanted to read it before seeing the movie. I will definitely go and see the movie now as I really liked the book. It looks like Child has written quite a few books, so I can happily work my way through them! If you haven't read him yet, I heartily recommend this book, and although I haven't seen the movie yet, I could certainly picture Tom Cruise in the lead role! I read the book in one sitting, unable to put it down until the end.A sniper kills five people randomly one afternoon in a quiet town. It appears to be an open and shut case. Although this may sound too much like what has been in the news lately (which is why I wanted to read the book first), it really isn't about the victims, but about the sniper. Appearances are very deceiving and the investigation turns up all sorts of problems with the case."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"This 9th book started off great but after that it was slow & very little action.

Well, it is nothing but an empty and hollow, cardboard-made model of the film. Jack Reacher (this is my first book) is a boring character, relying on others many times; otherwise, he is relying on his supernatural awareness of his surroundings (creating ridicolous situations).

My bone of contention is with the cover art. Tom Cruise is not and never will be Jack Reacher.

The concept in the teaser was rather nebulous but proved to be enough for me to look into it. Honestly, I'm glad I did as the read was worth my time. It was entertaining, well thought out, well written, and while it started off very slow, and remained so for the majority of the book, it managed to keep me interested enough to make it through to the other side satisfied. I will say I had some major flash backs, regularly, throughout the book to when I read 'The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\\". If you have read that book then you will know what I mean, unless I'm crazy.In the end a good story and I will actually go back and start at the beginning of the Jack Reacher novels because of it."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"Sherlock Holmes sat in his study pondering evidence, sifting through each minute clue over and over. His favorite pipe hard at work wafting smoke from it's bowl tamped full of a blend of Danish Cavendish and Latakia from the Eastern Mediterranian.Dr. John Watson sits directly across from Holmes not saying a word. He knew from experience not to disturb the great detective's thought process at a critical time. He had blurted out his opinion at an inoppertune time in a similar situation years ago. Holmes then spent two hours discussing the concentration required in critical reasoning and use of common sense in deduction.\\"Watson it is of the highest importance in the art of deduction to look at a number of facts and recognize the vital from the incidental. Failing to ascertain this dissipates energy.Like the snow flake no two human minds work the same.

Another page turner from Lee Child. Reacher tops them all. The best thing about Reacher is even when he is doing good, no one scews with him."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"As I am among those looking forward to the upcoming film simply called \\"Jack Reacher\\" [or not, in view of the controversy surrounding the fact that Tom Cruise will play the lead], I thought I'd go back to the book, initially published in 2005 and now with a new \\"Movie Tie-In Edition,\\" before seeing the film. I tried to put everything that's transpired in Jack Reacher's life in the years since 2005 in the recesses of my mind to come at this book fresh [so to speak].The novel jumps right in with a scene fraught with tension: A person described only as \\"the man with the rifle\\" is putting into motion an obviously well-thought-out plan, in a scene that culminates with him using a rifle to kill five people, strangers all, each with one shot to the head, in a business area in the heartland south of Indianapolis, Indiana teeming with people leaving work into the heart of the rush hour, and then escapes scant minutes before all hell breaks loose.Forensics give the police enough data to name a suspect, a 41-year-old US Army veteran, an infantry specialist [read \\"sniper\\"] who they quickly, in the early hours of the following morning, take into custody. Ironically, a newly minted attorney who just happens to be the daughter of the District Attorney handling the case agrees to defend the accused man at the behest of his sister. The man himself has refused to speak with anyone, prosecutors or defense attorney, other than to say \\"Get Jack Reacher for me.\\" Enigmatic, to say the least, since their past encounter had been less than friendly.Reacher himself is en route, having seen and read all about the massacre. As the author describes it: \\"Mostly he had rocked and swayed and dozed on buses, watching the passing scenes, observing the chaos of America . . . His life was like that. It was a mosaic of fragments. Details and contexts would fade and be inaccurately recalled, but the feelings and the experiences would weave over time into a tapestry equally full of good times and bad.\\" And as we all now know, Reacher is an imposing man, in mind and body, and doesn't let anything stop him when on a mission, having been honorably discharged seven years ago as a major in the army, and for fourteen years an MP. (He's also a man who knows every stat about every professional baseball player who ever played for the NY Yankees.) And to steal a line from an old James Bond movie, nobody does it better.The same could be said for Lee Child. Ingeniously plotted, wonderfully well-written, terrifically entertaining, and highly recommended."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"Page turner, Hate to put it down.

Jack Reacher is his usual self, highly intelligent, scared of no-one and with a touch of barely restrained aggression. The story gets you in from the first page and although you think you are unravelling the mysteries yourself along the way, Mr Child has full control of where your mind takes you. A brilliant story-teller. My one complaint about Reacher is how he wears his clothes for far too long before replacing them (not washing even his undies), and doesn't possess deodorant/toiletries, and yet the ladies still find him attractive.To me it seems that he would look dirty and be a bit smelly as well."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"This is a clever, clever book. You start off with a totally unredeeming character who you're totally sure has killed a bunch of people in a sniper attack, then Child starts twisting and turning the plot.As it starts, you keep wondering, 'Where the hell is Reacher?' And when the man asks the police interrogating him for Reacher's help, you wonder how on earth Reacher is going to come out on the side of such a cold-blooded killer and help in the slightest.That's when the book gets really interesting as Reacher gets to grip with a killing scenario puzzle which isn't at all what it appears at first sight. In terms of clever plotting, probably one of Child's best books."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"Heard this was getting made into a movie and couldn't remember having read it. I picked up a paperback of Killing Floor when it first came out and got hooked on the Jack Reacher stories ever since. Went and re-read this and it was great.

Some people think Hemingway was a great writer, everything he wrote, that I have read, was a forced read tom, just not entertaing. If I would rather read a hsitory book.

He does Jack Reacher justice. A hard man that you would not want to go up against in a hurry."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"This was my favourite Lee Child book along with Echo Burning. When it started, I wondered when on earth Reacher was going to come into the game. But that introduction was built up nicely with the shooter at the centre of this drama, so that when Reacher does enter the frame it has more impact.By that stage you're all but convinced they have their man, but Reacher quickly starts picking holes in their theories. This was more of a thinking man's Reacher than some of the previous gung-ho romps - but there's still plenty of action here for die-hard action-man Reacher fans."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"I can't remember who it was that told me to read my first Jack Reacher book but I would continue to thank them to this day if I could.

I simply loved it."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"I want to be Jack Reacher when I grow up. I found Lee Child the first time rather by accident, and I'm glad I did. All of his books are 4 or 5 stars in my world. ONE SHOT gets 5!"},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"ONE SHOT by Lee Child.STORY BRIEF:A sniper kills five people leaving a downtown office building. Several pieces of evidence point to James Barr a former army sniper. James says \\"You've got the wrong guy. Get Reacher for me.\\" Coincidentally Reacher comes to town for his own reasons. Reacher saw the story in the news. He knew Barr when they were in the army together fourteen years ago. Some bad guys don't like Reacher being in town and try to harm him. Of course that's the worst thing they could do since now Reacher won't leave until he finds them.REVIEWER'S OPINION:This is the ninth book in the Reacher series and one of the better ones. If you like the series, definitely do this one. The bad guys trying to harm Reacher was done well. Reacher's investigation and solving the mystery was done well. I liked some of the things Reacher did as he was evading the bad guys and the cops. I would have liked a few more fight scenes, but I won't complain. It's just one of my favorite things - watching Reacher beat up thugs.In the early books the author frequently used the phrase \\"he shrugged.\\" In recent books, he is not using that phrase as much, but he's almost overusing the phrase \\"Reacher said nothing.\\" Some reviewers complained. I was ok with it.THE SERIES:I suggest reading the books in order, but not required. All the books get 4 or more stars from me except three: Running Blind, Without Fail, and The Enemy. Save those for last if you're NOT a die hard Reacher fan.NARRATOR:The narrator Dick Hill was very good.DATA:Unabridged audiobook reading time: 12 hrs and 13 mins. Swearing language: I don't recall any but probably moderate. Sexual language: none. Number of sex scenes: two referred to not shown. Setting: 2004 Indiana. Book copyright: 2005.

Reacher is by character definition, the type of guy that can intimidate the crowd, just by walking in the door.

A sniper randomly picks off 5 people for an unknown reason. The evidence from the 6'th shot, the \\"one shot\\" that doesn't hit anyone is used to solve the crime, yada, yada, yada. Given that alone, I would still be tempted to pick up the book in an airport or to read while serving jury duty. The problem is, 10 pages in I was flipping back to the liner notes to determine if Mr. Child was, in fact, a child. The grammar is TERRIBLE! Every description reads like a shopping list. Just an example from page 16 (but I could honestly flip the book open to any page and give the same sort of example);\\"They photographed the scuff and then picked it up whole with an adhesive sheet of clear plastic.

It is absolutely one of the best and I had to finish it in one day. Lee Child are to be congratulated that it is possible to keep this series going and with such a different approaches all the time. For those of you who have not yet started reading about him I envy you. You have so much to look forward to!Of course part of the story is wildly unbelievable and there are holes in the logic that you can drive a truck through but it is a nice fantasy and it is a pleasure to read a book that is not politically correct and were a man can still be a man."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"This is the first book I've ever read by Lee Child. I bought it on a whim because it was advertised along with reviews of David Baldacci, Michael Connelly, Stieg Larsson, and Nelson DeMille's books. Based on the high ratings for the Jack Reacher series by Mr Child, I decided to buy \\"One Shot.\\" I was not disappointed. It captivated me from start to finish. Great plot that chugs along, keeps on track towards the inevitable violent conclusion. Quick paced dialogue that's true to the characters, never too much or too little. An unexpected type of demise for one of the bad guys at the end was an interesting and welcome surprise. I will definitely be buying more of the Reacher series. My only caveat is that no motivating factor was given for the \\"inside man.\\" I could be wrong, of course, having read the book at a gallop. Notwithstanding this small caveat, the book was a great read."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"Lee Child has created such a great character in Jack Reacher. Love the series, but in some of the books you have to wonder why the law enforcement agency lets Reacher investigate. Not this one, Jack Reacher helping makes complete sense. Great short, easy to follow and interesting. Read the series in order. RECOMMENDED"},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"First... see my review of book one of the series. Second Ekval has written a fine review that I pretty much agree with. The suspense in this one is fine, but character development is lacking for most people. Even his girlfriend seems rather a shallow lover than a person I really understand and want to know more about. I had to really stretch to give this a four star rating. Child can do better, the talent for a \\"deeper and more seamless\\" story. Slow down and give us an award winner for Jack."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"The world is becoming a smarter place. One piece of evidence is thriller/mystery writing, which is sure better than decades ago. Lee Child is part of that trend, but he may be the leader in the race to stay inside the thriller/mystery genre while still finding ways to be more gripping, with top-rate plot twists and deeper characters. One Shot is as good as any of the Reacher novels, but that's very high praise [Nothing to Lose is the only pretty dumb one].After saying that, I have to begin by listing the problems with Child and the book. There are the usual problems with Child's writing--sections of 'People say nothing. Not a thing. No way....' If a beautiful woman doesn't love his hero Jack Reacher, she's a villain or a jerk. People lock Reacher up, but he miraculously gets freed just when the plot needs him to. Vast conspiracies always end up a few people short; genius baddies kill other people for asinine reasons but don't kill Reacher when they have great reasons and opportunities to do so. Long ago, Mark Twain mocked the Pathfinder for showing his hero killing a fly with a rifle at 100 yards; Reacher can shoot way better than that with a rifle he has never even tried. He notices nits where other people overlook ostrich eggs, and the nits he picks are always the eggs of deadly monsters. To tell the truth, authors don't need to write thrillers that way, and occasional Reacher novels veer from that pattern. Here, it's as if Child feels pressured to take up the universal cliches, maybe to escape the Oprah Winfrey club.But Child makes it work. Reacher figures things out at the right pace, with time to move each new puzzle-piece around before fitting it in and finding the next one. He even thinks his fights through before they start--and if he throws punch without strategic consideration, it's a reflex based on vast training and experience. So it's the thoughtful readers [I modestly claim] who are most liable to be drawn in by Child's writing. In this book, Reacher starts out with surplus, clinching reasons for believing that the apparent killer is really guilty. Only because of the villains' overly clever ploys does he, surely but very slowly, gets drawn away from his original prejudice. Two or more of the villains are almost as smart as Reacher--they think things through about as well as him despite some mistakes, and the shock of finding the foes to have outthought him brings on Reacher's most amazing work.I hope nothing in this review is a spoiler for this book. Like always, you the reader know things will turn out not to be what they seem, but the ride to get past the facade and then, chapters past that, on to the truth is amazing."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"This book wery well written and the action , suspense and thrills are better than the other Jack Reacher series books, but I also feel the book was too long.

I poked around and found out that this particular novel has been optioned to be made into a movie, so I thought, why not?This novel begins with a mass killing at a government building which results in an almost immediate arrest. The suspect will only say, \\"Get me Jack Reacher.\\" Enter our protagonist.I won't say anymore about the plot because it's just too easy to give away the rest. I'll just say that I had no problem jumping on with this novel even though there are 8 books ahead of it in the series. Reacher at this point is a former MP living his life off the grid. I don't know how he got there, but I don't really need to know. I just know he's an experienced detective with a past who wants to get to the bottom of this mystery. The only thing that doesn't come across in the narrative until after it becomes apparent is Reacher's physicality. I was picturing a much more anonymous-looking character until he was suddenly described as being 6'3\\" and 250 lbs. Reacher's a big guy, so it's amazing he manages to stay as off the grid as he does. He's hard to miss.In any case, if you want a good mystery, but you're not sure if you want to get involved in one long series, this book stands just fine on its own."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"I started reading the Jack reacher novels a couple of years ago. My father-in-law lent me a copy of Gone Tomorrow, then 61 Hours and then I was hooked. Like some junkie needing a fix, I trawled second hand book fairs for my next hit. These novels are virulently addictive and should come with a health warning. My wife accuses me of having a bromance with Jack Reacher, naturally I deny it, but its true.I had heard that One Shot was being made into a movie, sadly starring Tom Cruise. However, I had never managed to find a copy. Fortunately Amazon.com obliged. One Shot is classic Jack Reacher, so all the other Jack Reacher junkies know what I mean, but for those who don't this is how it goes. Jack Reacher is an ex Military Police officer, but after leaving the army he slipped off the radar and he liked being a man of no fixed address. All he carries with him are the clothes on his back and toothbrush. No assets, mean no attachments. He's a bear of a man, standing six foot five and a couple of feet wide (at the shoulders). Normally he's passing through and gets caught up in local shenanigan's but this time, a man from Reacher's past ios arrested for allegedly shooting five people dead in a crowded square with a sniper rifle. When captured he refuses to talk except to say 'Get Jack Reacher for me'.From here Lee Child weaves an intricate plot filling in some more of Reacher's past. Its a good read and a good introduction to Jack reacher, which is perhaps why Hollywood is making a movie out of it instead of earlier Jack Reacher novels like Killing Floor."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"I have these thoughts that when a sniper goes on the rampage the public should have a signal like Gotham City has for Batman to call in Jack Reacher.....Lee Child continues to impress and stays at the top of my reading list."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"as always lee child gets 4 stars.

Grant provides the usual exposition for those who may not be familiar with the Reacher character. The plot is well crafted as usual and while it follows the pattern of having not much mystery, there's plenty of action, a little sex and a satisfying conclusion in which the villains get what's coming to them. The Reacher novels are fun to read and addictive, more violent than John D. McDonald's Travis McGee, or Parker's Spenser, but much influenced by both of them. An excellent Kindle choice for travelers."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"Intrigue, knowledge and action abound in this suspense and action thriller. Definitely a page turner.

This is a suspensful, and fun book to read."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"I had not read any of Lee Child's work before seeing the preview for the upcoming Tom Cruise movie. I really enjoyed the preview and thought I would read the book before seeing the flick. So I bought it. I really, really enjoyed the book, but I was about halfway through the book when I thought that perhaps this was an ongoing character. Jack Reacher has been the main character is 17 books and counting! But I was disappointed to discover that this book was the ninth book in the series. Only disappointed because I wish I had started at the beginning. Nevertheless, despite being clueless, I loved the book, and I am planning to start at book one and work my way through the whole series. The character is very enticing and the plot was fun and hard to anticipate, which is part of the fun of this kind of novel. Great fun, quick read. Perfect for the beach, for escape, for fun."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"One Shot was the second Jack Reacher book that I have read from Lee Child. I must say that I am quickly warming to the Reacher character and need to go back for more. Reacher's physical and mental toughness, tenacity, perseverance, ruthlessness and survival instincts are on display throughout the book, leading to a very compelling story. Simply put, start to finish, this is a great novel that is impossible to put down. Child grabs the reader in the first few pages and keeps him completely captivated throughout the entire book."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"When there's a treat you can only enjoy on rare occasion, you may wait a bit to indulge in it. The anticipation heightens the pleasure, and when you finally get to it, you need to be careful not to have it disappear too quickly. Such are Lee Child's Jack Reacher books with me: delights I can only read once a year or so, lest I run out of them too quickly.One Shot, the ninth Reacher book, opens with a sniper striking out at people as they leave their work, killing five in just a few seconds. Though the killer disappears, the police are able to determine pretty quickly that the sniper is James Barr. Barr is arrested within hours of the attack and remains silent except for two statements: he declares he is innocent and he wants Jack Reacher.The evidence against Barr is overwhelming, though one of the first rules of thrillers is that the obvious suspect is rarely the actual criminal. It would seem that Reacher, then, would be the one to fight to save Barr, but when he arrives, he actually has a different agenda: he wants Barr convicted. What Reacher knows is that back in the days of the Gulf War, Barr - a trained sniper - had committed a similar crime, and only politics and luck saved him from conviction. Reacher wants to make sure this injustice doesn't happen again.Though convinced of Barr's guilt, Reacher is also certain that there is more to the story. Barr was part of a conspiracy; unfortunately, an attack in jail has left Barr with no memory of the event or his role in it. Reacher is right, though, and the others involved in this killing are willing to resort to additional murder to cover up their role in the crime.I've always believed that the mark of a truly good novel leaves with you two conflicting feelings: you want to turn the pages faster to know what's going to happen, but you also want to read more slowly so the experience doesn't end. As with Child's other books, this one fits into that category. Whether you've read the other books in the series or not (each novel stands by itself), One Shot is a top-of-the-line thriller well worth reading."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"I had just about given up on reading thrillers, as too many authors seem to luxuriate in getting inside the heads of sick serial killers and invest in really unnecessary levels of graphic violence and sex. Then this fell into my hands (almost literally, in a stack of old paperbacks in my apartment's laundry room). I'm glad it did, because - for once - this is a thriller with a good, clean style that doesn't insult the intelligence, and is well-paced and action-filled without pouring on the negativity. The villainy is well-balanced by passages of decency and characters you actually like. The hero has a moral compass. The prose might not be up there with Raymond Chandler or Dashiell Hammett, but the flavor is there.
