Yet too many dying people suffer unnecessarily. While an \\"overtreated\\" dying is feared, untreated pain or emotional abandonment are equally frightening. Approaching Death reflects a wide-ranging effort to understand what we know about care at the end of life, what we have yet to learn, and what we know but do not adequately apply. It seeks to build understanding of what constitutes good care for the dying and offers recommendations to decisionmakers that address specific barriers to achieving good care. This volume offers a profile of when, where, and how Americans die. It examines the dimensions of caring at the end of life: Determining diagnosis and prognosis and communicating these to patient and family. Establishing clinical and personal goals. Matching physical, psychological, spiritual, and practical care strategies to the patient's values and circumstances. Approaching Death considers the dying experience in hospitals, nursing homes, and other settings and the role of interdisciplinary teams and managed care. It offers perspectives on quality measurement and improvement, the role of practice guidelines, cost concerns, and legal issues such as assisted suicide. The book proposes how health professionals can become better prepared to care well for those who are dying and to understand that these are not patients for whom \\"nothing can be done.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=klluAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Buddha and the Sahibs: The Men Who Discovered India's Lost Religion","description":"Today there are many Buddhists in the West, but for 2000 years the Buddha's teachings were unknown outside Asia. It was not until the late 18th century, when Sir William Oriental Jones, a British judge in India, broke through the Brahmin's prohibition on learning their sacred language. Sanskrit, that clues about the origins of a religion quite distinct from Hinduism began to be deciphered from inscriptions on pillars and rocks. This study tells the story of the search that followed, as evidence mounted that countries as diverse as Ceylon, Japan and Tibet shared a religion which had its origins in India yet was unknown there. British rule brought to India, Burma and Ceylon a whole band of enthusiastic Orientalist amateurs - soldiers, administrators and adventurers - intent on investigating the subcontinent's lost past. Unwittingly, these men helped lay the foundations for the revival of Buddhism in Asia during the 19th century and its spread to the West in the 20th. Charles Allen's book is a mixture of detective work and story-telling, as this acknowledged master of British Indian history pieces together early Buddhist history to bring a handful of extraoridinary characters to life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=L7VvCQAAQBAJ&dq=The+Buddha+and+the+Sahibs:+The+Men+Who+Discovered+India%27s+Lost+Religion&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"80X86 IBM PC and Compatible Computers, Vol. II, The: Design and Interfacing of the IBM PC and Compatible Computers","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5palYgEACAAJ&dq=80X86+IBM+PC+and+Compatible+Computers,+Vol.+II,+The:+Design+and+Interfacing+of+the+IBM+PC+and+Compatible+Computers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pope John Paul II: Prophetic Politician","description":"The political scientist examines the close relationship between the current pope's religious convictions and his manipulations of politics, arguing that he stands with Gandhi, Martin Luther King, and Desmond Tutu as religious leaders who affected world change in the twentieth century.

Although studies have been published on virtually every aspect of the Lewis and Clark journey, Wilderness Journey is the first comprehensive account of Clark s lengthy and multifaceted life. Following Lewis and Clark s great odyssey, Clark s service as a soldier, Indian diplomat, and government official placed him at center stage in the national quest to possess and occupy North America s vast western hinterland and prefigured U.S. policies in the region. In his personal life, Clark had to overcome challenges no less daunting than those he faced in the public arena. Foley pays careful attention to the family and business dimensions of Clark s private world, adding richness to this well-rounded and revealing portrait of the man and his courageous life. Coinciding with the bicentennial in 2004 of the departure of Lewis and Clark s famed Corps of Discovery, Wilderness Journey fills a major gap in scholarship.

The resulting friction often eroded Northern morale and damaged the North's war effort. Goss challenges the traditional idea that success was measured only on the battlefield by demonstrating significant links between military success and the achievement of the Union's political objectives. Examining commanders like Benjamin Butler, Nathaniel Banks, John McClernand, John Fremont, and Franz Sigel, Goss shows how many filled vital functions by raising troops, boosting homefront morale, securing national support for the war--and sometimes even achieving significant success on the battlefield.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=B6B2AAAAMAAJ&dq=The+War+Within+the+Union+High+Command:+Politics+and+Generalship+During+the+Civil+War+(Modern+War+Studies)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Liners","description":"Examines famous shipwrecks, from the vessels in their prime to their current ocean-floor remains","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0grkAAAAMAAJ&dq=Liners&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE WONDERFUL WINTER","description":"Winter is the time for bundling up, playing in the snow with a new snowman friend.

Fowler's Dictionary of Modern English Usage is the world-famous guide to English usage, loved and used by writers, editors, and anyone who values correct English since it first appeared in 1926. Fowler's gives comprehensive and practical advice on complex points of grammar, syntax, punctuation, style, and word choice. Now enlarged and completely revised to reflect English usage in the 21st century, it provides a crystal-clear, authoritative picture of the English we use, while illuminating scores of usage questions old and new.

Buddhadatta Mahathera published long ago by the Pali Text Society in Roman script. This publication was then considered a notable event in the life of the Society for it was a great improvement on a similar earlier work by Venerable W. Piyatissa whose usefulness was reduced for the English-speaking readers by the Pali words being given in Sinhalese script. This is a consider ably enlarged form of a concise English-Pali Dictionary compiled by the present author during the second World War. The author has coined many new words and has given more than one Pali word for some English verbs which do not exist in the ancient languages like Pali. This dictionary, though not an exhaustive one, has proved much useful to the scholars of the Pali language as it presents well chosen material in a single volume of a manageable size. (by the same author) CONCISE PALI-ENGLISH DICTIONARY - This Concise Pali-English Dictionary has been prepared mainly for use by students in schools and colleges. The author is not only an eminent Elder of the Buddhist Order but one of the leading Pali scholars recognized both in the East and West as an authority on the subject. It is to be observed that the author has kept more or less to the traditional sense of words while not altogether ignoring the meanings given by western scholars in their translations and lexicons. Many errors in the latter sources have also been rectified. But the basic sense adopted is in nearly every instance the traditionally accepted meaning in accord with the commentaries and the glossaries. This perhaps is of special value to beginners as thereby they get introduced to the indigenous tradition, thus providing a useful basis on which to build up a more scientific knowledge as the study advances.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ciH63qNdjPQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The hounds of God (Popular library)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cpIJuAEACAAJ&dq=The+hounds+of+God+(Popular+library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Searching for Memory: The Brain, the Mind, and the Past (Soft Cover)","description":"Memory.

Are we paying nosebleed prices for \\"feel-good\\" measures? . \\"This book was painful to write. By nature, I am a problem solver. Professionally I have made my career out of solving complex problems efficiently by trying to find the right place to push hard and make a difference. Researching the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, CIA, INS, the PATRIOT Act, and so forth, one falls into a rabbit's hole of interdependent lameness and dysfunction. I came face to face with the realization that there are gigantic bureaucracies that exist primarily for the sole purpose of prolonging their existence, that the very structure of bureaucracy rewards inefficiency and encourages territorialism and turf warfare.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pmq7wAEACAAJ&dq=The+Myth+of+Homeland+Security&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Who will rise up?: A call to confrontational evangelism","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WfHtPwAACAAJ&dq=Who+will+rise+up%3F:+A+call+to+confrontational+evangelism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Attack of the Vampire Worms (Ghosts of Fear Street, No 33)","description":"An extensive anthology compiles eighty stories by genre masters from H.

Moving from theoretical concerns to empirical analysis, he focuses on the crucial role of three institutions that foster protest: black churches, black colleges, and Southern chapters of the NAACP. He concludes that political opportunities, a heightened sense of political efficacy, and the development of these three institutions played a central role in shaping the civil rights movement. In his new introduction, McAdam revisits the civil rights struggle in light of recent scholarship on social movement origins and collective action. \\"[A] first-rate analytical demonstration that the civil rights movement was the culmination of a long process of building institutions in the black community.\\" Raymond Wolters, Journal of American History \\"A fresh, rich, and dynamic model to explain the rise and decline of the black insurgency movement in the United States.\\" James W.

Whether you keep it in your office, on your coffee table, next to your keyboard or your bed, this rich compendium of over one thousand quotations will inspire, invigorate, and illuminate the often challenging, sometimes humorous, but always fascinating task of those who bring words to life.From William Faulkner and Ernest Hemingway to Doris Lessing and Joyce Carol Oates, more than five hundred published writers put pen to paper on what the literary life is all about. Selections come from seasoned professionals as well as those just establishing their voice, and they represent a variety of nationalities and genres. The book is divided into three sections. The first part is devoted to the creative process, including thoughts on where writers get their ideas, the role of inspiration, what kind of people write, and where talent comes from. In part two, the subject shifts to writing as a craft. Here, authors ponder the creation of protagonists and points of view, the writing of dialogue, setting and description, creating plots, and the anatomy of style. The final third of the book deals with the challenges and rewards that come with the writing life. Subjects in this section include the economic realities of writing, classes, conferences, and workshops, dealing with rejection and bad reviews, writing habits and rituals, despair, alcohol, and suicide, and fame.Articulated with elegant metaphor, in straightforward prose, or with wry wit, the carefully selected and thoughtfully organized quotations come together to form a narrative that entertains, informs, and in the case of aspiring writers, shows the way to better writing.Jim Fisher is a professor emeritus at Edinboro University of Pennsylvania. He is the author of five nonfiction books, including The Lindbergh Case (Rutgers University Press) and Ten Percent of Nothing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yFkzftlsVGwC&dq=The+Writer%27s+Quotebook:+500+Authors+on+Creativity,+Craft,+and+the+Writing+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"La\\\\Faim du Tigre","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2gkvAAAAIAAJ&dq=La%5CFaim+du+Tigre&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fellow Passengers: A Novel in Portraits","description":"In this novel by the author of The Golden Calves set in 1930s high society, a young man recounts the people in his life and what he s learned from them. This superb gallery of portraits gathers its wit and resonance from the discerning eye of the central narrator, Dan Ruggles, who in the course of unraveling the dreams, doubts, and loyalties of those around him inevitably reveals his own. Dan spends his boyhood in the company of old-money aunts from Bar Harbor and polo-playing uncles from Argentina. He stumbles upon the complexities of adulthood at Yale in the 1930s, and grows to worldly maturity at the Wall Street law firm that provides him not only with a vocation but with seemingly endless material for his fiction. Fellow passengers are the people in his life, each one a story and each one a lesson. Only Auchincloss can ferret out with such precision and understanding the secrets, foibles, and ironies that lie just beneath the proper Establishment surface. This is Louis Auchincloss at the top of his form a book to please his many admirers and delightful introduction for new readers as well. Praise for Fellow Passengers  This gallery of American upper-class characters, Auchincloss s 41st book, reflects the acutely perceptive insight that distinguishes much of his fiction. Lineage, the right schools, clubs and marriages are of crucial concern to the matrons, debutantes, establishment bankers and lawyers whose vapid lives, as revealed in these stories, often founder on underpinnings of dark secrets and skewed loyalties . . . .

The seated child. With a single powerful image, Deborah Ellis draws our attention to nine children and the situations they find themselves in, often through no fault of their own. In each story, a child makes a decision and takes action, be that a tiny gesture or a life-altering choice. Jafar is a child laborer in a chair factory and longs to go to school. Sue sits on a swing as she and her brother wait to have a supervised visit with their father at the children s aid society. Gretchen considers the lives of concentration camp victims during a school tour of Auschwitz. Mike survives seventy-two days of solitary as a young offender. Barry squirms on a food court chair as his parents tell him that they are separating. Macie sits on a too-small time-out chair while her mother receives visitors for tea. Noosala crouches in a fetid, crowded apartment in Uzbekistan, waiting for an unscrupulous refugee smuggler to decide her fate. These children find the courage to face their situations in ways large and small, in this eloquent collection from a master storyteller.

As such, this book deserves the sympathetic attention of theologians both Catholic and Protestant. To summarize it is nearly impossible in view of the richness and fullness of the discussion. We may say, however, that for Irenaeus God made man for growth, yet man was defeated by that Satan whom God also created. The Son of God served to recapitulate and reverse Adam's fall and to restore humanity's lost God-given potentiality for growth. In the Church, through word and sacrament, Christ's benefits are made available to all. In the final consummation, when man becomes like God he is in actual fact becoming man. God and man are not fundamentally in opposition to one another. The only thing to add about Wingren's book is that it must be read.

Ruth Ben-Ghiat is the expert on the \\"strongman\\" playbook employed by authoritarian demagogues from Mussolini to Putin enabling her to predict with uncanny accuracy the recent experience in America and Europe. In Strongmen, she lays bare the blueprint these leaders have followed over the past 100 years, and empowers us to recognize, resist, and prevent their disastrous rule in the future. For ours is the age of authoritarian rulers: self-proclaimed saviors of the nation who evade accountability while robbing their people of truth, treasure, and the protections of democracy. They promise law and order, then legitimize lawbreaking by financial, sexual, and other predators. They use masculinity as a symbol of strength and a political weapon. Taking what you want, and getting away with it, becomes proof of male authority. They use propaganda, corruption, and violence to stay in power. Vladimir Putin and Mobutu Sese Seko s kleptocracies, Augusto Pinochet s torture sites, Benito Mussolini and Muammar Gaddafi s systems of sexual exploitation, and Silvio Berlusconi and Donald Trump s relentless misinformation: all show how authoritarian rule, far from ensuring stability, is marked by destructive chaos. No other type of leader is so transparent about prioritizing self-interest over the public good. As one country after another has discovered, the strongman is at his worst when true guidance is most needed by his country. Recounting the acts of solidarity and dignity that have undone strongmen over the past 100 years, Ben-Ghiat makes vividly clear that only by seeing the strongman for what he is and by valuing one another as he is unable to do can we stop him, now and in the future.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tDbtDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"George Bush: The Life of a Lone Star Yankee","description":"In the first full biography of the former president, award-winning historian and biographer Herbert S.

Together with the issue of spirituality, the African American search for wholeness is analyzed as a source of creativity and agency. As expressed in the contemporary literature of black women writers, starting in the 1980s, the search for wholeness reflects a beauty realized through the healing of the spirit and the body, and is a process that takes on dimensions of reconciling the past and the present, the mythical and the real, the spiritual and the physical all in the context of an emerging world view that welcomes synthesis and expects both synthesis and generative contradictions. The book will be a valuable collection for scholars of African American literature, comparative American Ethnic literature, American literature, and spirituality, as well as women s studies. In addition, it will be an important text for both undergraduate and graduate students in those fields. As Professor Johnnella Butler (2006) points out, the African American search for wholeness is tightly linked to the search for freedom and agency. Ever since the 19th century, African American writers have given expression to an African American self which functions in Western civilization simultaneously as a  colonized  other and an assertive  self.  Due to the continuous ordeal of the African Diaspora, this self is caught in between the binaries proposed by the material and the spiritual world, seeking a balance where the person can become whole. The search for wholeness feeds from cultural roots that imply the presence of ancestral spiritualism, rememory, and double consciousness. Contemporary black women writers reflect the metaphor of building spiritual bridges, seeking the possibilities of building a bridge to the archetypal African past that is carried in their memories as a presence that offers sustenance via spiritual reconnection. Their works seek to bridge the gap between the myths and traditions of the past and contemporary African American culture. The texts included in this collection are examples of writing as an exercise of what V v  Clark calls  Diaspora literacy.  The texts written by contemporary African American women writers explicitly show how to recognize and read the cultural signs left scattered along the road of progress. In this way, material acquisition is achieved along with cultural dispossession, becoming a metaphor for the history of the African in America. The powerful message is that one should not exclude the other.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bQMrBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Investbeyond.Com: A New Look at Investing in Today's Changing Markets","description":"A certified financial planner helps investors deal with the contradictory desires of acquiring great wealth quickly while simultaneously fearing the loss of capital.

Zweig analyzes the chemistry of a woman's soul from her intimate pleasures to her public suffering as a Queen under the weight of misfortune and history. Zweig describes Marie Antoinette in the King's bedroom, in the enchanted and extravagant world of the Trianon, and with her children. And in his account of  The Revolution,  he describes her resolve during the failed escape to Varennes, her imprisonment in the Conciergerie and her final tragic destiny under the guillotine.

The author reminds us that the word \\"martial\\" means \\"war.\\" While there may be beauty in a perfectly performed practice session, this \\"art\\" aspect takes a backseat to the \\"martial\\" in a life and death struggle. The purpose of martial arts, after all, is to complement your war arsenal. In a battlefield situation, unarmed martial arts are what you use between weapons. The purpose of Cao Dai Kung-Fu is to teach you how to get that arsenal fully armed. To this end the martial arts instructions in this book are written in an easy to understand manner with helpful illustrations and diagrams, so that even one uninitiated to the martial arts can find useful tips to store away in preparation for self defense in general. Dr. Haha Lung says to use whatever you can that works -- headbutting, kicking the side of the knee; there's all kinds of useful information you will be glad you have some day. For instance, \\"Modern day street fighters often dip their fingers into bleach, hot sauce, or any toxic substance that can then be thrust into an opposing fighter's eyes, nose and mouth during a noholds barred fight.\\" Or \\"Any time your hand touches the ground fill it with something: dirt, a rock, a stick, etc. Snowball is better than no ball.\\" Anything on your body -- your head, feet, elbows, knees, hands -- can be used to disable your opponent. Your options as to where and how to strike into your opponent will be limited only by your imagination.

Earning a living throughout his adult life as a postal worker in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, so that he could support his family by day and work as a sculptor by night, he has evolved an individual and powerful African American voice. He worked alone, patiently developing a sculptural language absolutely his own, yet traceable to his primary sources of inspiration, the vitality of African art and American jazz on the one hand, and on the other, two twentieth-century artists, the Romanian sculptor Constantin Brancusi and the Asian American sculptor Isamu Noguchi. From the beginning Thad Mosley has been a carver. His materials have always been those  at hand,  logs from the trees of his native Western Pennsylvania, stones from the sites of demolished buildings in Pittsburgh, and metals from local scrapyards. Finding within each log or block of stone an essential vitality, his carvings invariably bear a syncopation of chisel marks evoking the rhythms and surging freedoms of jazz. Mosley s perseverence and his pride in who he is offer an inspiring example of the unquenchable spirit of a true artists. This short book introduces the life and work of this remarkable man. Davis Lewis, architect, writer, and painter, has been a friend of the artist for twenty-five years. His narrative is distilled from hours of taped interviews with Thad Mosley, as well as from a deep understanding of his art and influences. Lonnie Graham is a nationally known African-American photographer.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-DFOjKKggtsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Making Adorable Animal Dolls: Handcrafts to Treasure","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=E79lswEACAAJ&dq=Making+Adorable+Animal+Dolls:+Handcrafts+to+Treasure&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Miss Minerva on the old plantation","description":"Life on a plantation.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ByjoAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Everquest Realms of Norrath Forests of Faydark","description":"The enormous forest of Faydark dominates the entire northern landscape of the continent of Faydwer.

The book blends politics, economy and culture to show how human and natural resources in Finland have been utilized and the impact its cultural heritage and technological innovation have had on its development. In a departure from most conventional approaches, Meinander gives greater emphasis to recent and contemporary events. In other words, he puts Finland into a range of historical contexts in its Baltic and European settings to highlight how both together have formed Finland into what it is at the beginning of the twenty-first century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oATeDwAAQBAJ&dq=A+history+of+Finland&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Love of Goldens","description":"Showcases one of America's favorite pets in all its glory.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fMDpAAAAMAAJ&dq=Love+of+Goldens&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tales from the land under my table (Children's Braille Book-of-the-month Club)","description":"Four tales concerning a greedy giant and a clever stranger, a grouchy king and his mouse jester, a war between cabbages and cucumbers, and a bird who wishes to be more colorful.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iyw5uAAACAAJ&dq=Tales+from+the+land+under+my+table+(Children%27s+Braille+Book-of-the-month+Club)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Write A .com Business Plan: The Internet Entrepreneur's Guide to Everything You Need to Know About Business Plans and Financing Options","description":"Explores the particulars of e-commerce planning and financing, including locating and utilizing venture capital, search engines, site security, implementation, management, and marketing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_lJEAAAAYAAJ&dq=How+to+Write+A+.com+Business+Plan:+The+Internet+Entrepreneur%27s+Guide+to+Everything+You+Need+to+Know+About+Business+Plans+and+Financing+Options&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"History Gone Mad","description":"Readers can enjoy a MAD rush through history as they witness the descent of man.

On a hot Toronto night in 1933, at an amateur baseball game at Christie Pits field, four Nazi youths flashed a large black swastika, shouting \\"Heil Hitler!\\" Within seconds, a group of Jewish youths charged at them, trying to grab the flag. One of the Nazi youths snatches back the banner and breaks free, running with the flag through the park, setting off a four-hour race riot involving 15,000 people, injuring hundreds, and sending scores to the hospital. In this panoramic novel, Karen X. Tulchinsky traces the fortunes of the Lapinskys from the evening of the riots through World War II and into the 1950s.

Very few people suspected, and even fewer actually knew, that the Duchess cuckolded him and almost gave him up for a gay playboy twenty years her junior. Blond and slender, Jimmy Donahue was the archetypal post-war playboy. He could fly a plane, speak several languages, play the piano, and tell marvelous jokes. People loved him for his wit, charm and personality. The grandson of millionaire Frank W. Woolworth, Jimmy knew he would never need to work. Instead, he set about carving for himself a career of mischief. Some said evil. Gay at a time when the homosexual act was still illegal, Jimmy was notorious within America's upper class, and loved to shock. Though press agents arranged for him to be seen with female escorts, his pursuits, until he met the Duchess of Windsor, were exclusively homosexual. He was thirty-five when he was befriended by the Duke and Duchess of Windsor in 1950. The Duchess was fifty-four, and despite the difference in age, there was an instant attraction. A burgeoning sexual relationship  a perverse sort of love  was formed between Jimmy and the Duchess. Together with the Duke, they became an inseparable trio, the closest of friends. As Jimmy had planned, the royal couple became obsessed with him. With information from surviving contemporaries, Dancing with the Devil by Christopher Wilson is the extraordinary tale of three remarkable people and their unique and twisted relationship.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zYSBAwAAQBAJ&dq=Dancing+with+the+Devil:+The+Windsors+and+Jimmy+Donahue&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Crossroads and Unholy Water (Crab Orchard Award Series in Poetry)","description":"Marilene Phipps s poetry invites the reader to share sharp slices of Caribbean experience: Haiti is both stage and backdrop for people who move in various strata of the social scheme and through the three stages of life, in lieu of answers to the Sphinx s riddle.

Sandy Hook. Columbine. The list of school shootings gets longer by the day, and it often seems like no school is safe. Over the last decades, school shootings have decimated communities and terrified parents, teachers, and children in even the most family friendly American towns and suburbs. We talk about these tragedies as the spontaneous acts of disconnected teens, but this important book argues that the roots of violence are deeply entwined in the communities themselves. Drawing on more than 200 interviews with town residents, sociologist Katherine Newman and her co-authors take the reader inside two of the most notorious school shootings of the 1990s, in Jonesboro, Arkansas, and Paducah, Kentucky. In a powerful and original analysis, she demonstrates that the organizational structure of schools encourage administrators to \\"lose\\" information about troubled kids, and the very closeness of these small rural towns restrained neighbors and friends from communicating what they knew about their problems. Rampage challenges the \\"loner theory\\" of school violence and shows why so many adults and students miss the warning signs that could prevent it.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FcS6tAEACAAJ&dq=Rampage:+The+Social+Roots+Of+School+Shootings&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Herodotus (Hermes Books Series)","description":"This study argues that Herodotus was both a historian and a master storyteller.

How does an honor student at one of Los Angeles's finest prep schools -- a bright, beautiful girl from a loving home -- trade school uniforms and afternoons at the beach for shooting up in the back of a van in rural Indiana? How does her devoted mother emerge from the shock of finding that her daughter has not only disappeared but had been living a secret life for more than a year? Mother and daughter tell their parallel stories in mesmerizing first-person accounts. Claire Fontaine's story is a parent's worst nightmare, a cautionary tale chronicling her daughter Mia's drug-fueled manipulation of everyone around her as she sought refuge in the seedy underworld of criminals and heroin addicts, the painful childhood secrets that led up to it, and the healing that followed. Her search for Mia was brutal for both mother and daughter, a dizzying series of dead ends, incredible coincidences and, at times, miracles. Ultimately, Mia was forced into harsh-but-loving boot camp schools on two continents while Claire entered a painful but life-changing program of her own. Mia's story includes the jarring culture shock of the extreme and controversial behavior modification school she was in for nearly two years, which helped her overcome depression and self-hatred to emerge a powerful young woman with self-esteem and courage. An unforgettable story of love and transformation, Come Back is a heart-wrenching and humorous portrayal of the primal bond between mother and daughter that will resonate with women everywhere.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=K8cob8AuCvEC&dq=comeback+-+a+mother+and+daughter%27s+journey+through+hell+and+back&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Daring Game (Puffin story books)","description":"Eliza's first year at Ashdown Academy is full of surprises, as she discovers the high cost of friendship when her friend Helen starts the daring game among the five girls in their dorm","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jDqy61aDFMsC&dq=The+Daring+Game+(Puffin+story+books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rorkes Drift the Zulu War 1879","description":"This is a graphic account of gallant British soldiers struggling for survival and brave Zulu natives fighting to overpower them, drawn from eyewitness accounts and letters, official reports, and contemporary journals and newspapers.

Many of us believe that the great turning points and opportunities in our lives happen by chance, that they re out of our control. Often we think that successful people and successful companies and organizations are simply luckier than the rest of us. Good fortune serendipity just seems to happen to them. Is that true? Or are some people better at creating the conditions for coincidences to arise and taking advantage of them when they do? How can we connect the dots of seemingly random events to improve our lives? In The Serendipity Mindset, Christian Busch explains that serendipity isn t about luck in the sense of simple randomness. It s about seeing links that others don t, combining these observations in unexpected and strategic ways, and learning how to detect the moments when apparently random or unconnected ideas merge to form new opportunities. Busch explores serendipity from a rational and scientific perspective and argues that there are identifiable approaches we can use to foster the conditions to let serendipity grow. Drawing from biology, chemistry, management, and information systems, and using examples of people from all walks of life, Busch illustrates how serendipity works and explains how we can train our own serendipity muscle and use it to turn the unexpected into opportunity. Once we understand serendipity, Busch says, we become curators of it, and luck becomes something that no longer just happens to us it becomes a force that we can grasp, shape, and hone. Full of exciting ideas and strategies, The Serendipity Mindset offers a clear blueprint for how we can cultivate serendipity to increase innovation, influence, and opportunity in every aspect of our lives.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KSvlDwAAQBAJ&dq=Serendipity&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"This Perfect Day","description":"By the author of Rosemary s Baby, a horrifying journey into a future only Ira Levin could imagine.

Yet it is not the city's power brokers that most concern him but rather its ordinary citizens. All Aunt Hagar's Children turns an unflinching eye to the men, women, and children caught between the old ways of the South and the temptations that await them further north, people who in Jones's masterful hands, emerge as fully human and morally complex, whether they are country folk used to getting up with the chickens or people with centuries of education behind them. In the title story, in which Jones employs the first-person rhythms of a classic detective story, a Korean War veteran investigates the death of a family friend whose sorry destiny seems inextricable from his mother's own violent Southern childhood. In \\"In the Blink of God's Eye\\" and \\"Tapestry\\" newly married couples leave behind the familiarity of rural life to pursue lives of urban promise only to be challenged and disappointed. With the legacy of slavery just a stone's throw away and the future uncertain, Jones's cornucopia of characters will haunt readers for years to come.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=E4oAYcVHm9cC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"U.S. History Through Children's Literature: From the Colonial Period to World War II","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Super Bible Heroes (Lifeguide Bible Studies)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PqnMzgEACAAJ&dq=Super+Bible+Heroes+(Lifeguide+Bible+Studies)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Mountain Road","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Jg3pPAAACAAJ&dq=The+Mountain+Road&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Intelligent Man's Guide to Science. 2 volumes.","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mtTVOgAACAAJ&dq=The+Intelligent+Man%27s+Guide+to+Science.+2+volumes.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Devil on the Run","description":"Nicky's parents were both occultists, and he was expected to follow in their footsteps.

Among the wannabes: Vanessa Meandro, hot-tempered head of Means of Production, an indie film company; her harried and varied staff; a Sikh cab driver, promoted to the office of -theory and practice of TV; a bipolar bicycle messenger, who makes a fateful mis-delivery; two celebrity publicists, the Vanderbilt girls; a thriller writer who gives Botox parties; the daughter of an L.A. big-shot, who is hired to fetch Vanessa's Krispy Kremes and more; a word man who coined the phrase -- inspired by a true story; and a supreme court justice who wants to write the script.A few true artists surface in the course of Moody's rollicking but intricately woven novel, and real emotion eventually blossoms for most of Vanessa's staff at Means of Production, even herself. The Diviners is a cautionary tale about pointless ambition; a richly detailed look at the interlocking worlds of money, politics, addiction, sex, work, and family in modern America; and a masterpiece of comedy that will bring Rick Moody to a still higher level of appreciation.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=K_HVb5RwKB4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The entailed hat; or, Patty Cannon's times,","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=d8wOAAAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bicycle Repair Step by Step: The Full-Color Manual of Bicycle Maintenance and Repair (Bicycle Books)","description":"Bicycle Repair Step By StepBy Rob van der Plas.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0SLPAAAACAAJ&dq=Bicycle+Repair+Step+by+Step:+The+Full-Color+Manual+of+Bicycle+Maintenance+and+Repair+(Bicycle+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Nun","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=t3VFvwEACAAJ&dq=The+Nun&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Boulder & El Dorado Trail Maps","description":"NATIONAL BESTSELLER ? Provocative and illuminating essays from women at the forefront of the climate movement who are harnessing truth, courage, and solutions to lead humanity forward.  A powerful read that fills one with, dare I say . . . hope?  The New York Times NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY SMITHSONIAN MAGAZINE There is a renaissance blooming in the climate movement: leadership that is more characteristically feminine and more faithfully feminist, rooted in compassion, connection, creativity, and collaboration. While it s clear that women and girls are vital voices and agents of change for this planet, they are too often missing from the proverbial table. More than a problem of bias, it s a dynamic that sets us up for failure. To change everything, we need everyone. All We Can Save illuminates the expertise and insights of dozens of diverse women leading on climate in the United States scientists, journalists, farmers, lawyers, teachers, activists, innovators, wonks, and designers, across generations, geographies, and race and aims to advance a more representative, nuanced, and solution-oriented public conversation on the climate crisis. These women offer a spectrum of ideas and insights for how we can rapidly, radically reshape society. Intermixing essays with poetry and art, this book is both a balm and a guide for knowing and holding what has been done to the world, while bolstering our resolve never to give up on one another or our collective future. We must summon truth, courage, and solutions to turn away from the brink and toward life-giving possibility. Curated by two climate leaders, the book is a collection and celebration of visionaries who are leading us on a path toward all we can save. With essays and poems by: Emily Atkin ? Xiye Bastida ?

The first book to explore women's spiritual expression--women's ways--through a study of dance ? Investigates how dance came to be excluded from worship, and reveals how dance is once again being brought into spiritual practices ? Includes resources for further instruction in sacred dance Today we primarily think of dance as a form of entertainment or as a way to exercise or socialize. There was a time, however, when dance was considered the way to commune with the divine, a part of life's journey, celebrating the seasons and rhythms of the year and the rhythms of our lives. Dance is a language that reunites the body, mind, and soul. While the role of women's sacred dance was most valued in goddess-worshipping cultures where women served as priestesses and healers, dance was once an integral part of religious ritual and ceremonial expression in cultures all over the world, including Judaism and Christianity. In this book the author investigates how dance came to be excluded from worship and reveals how dance is once again being integrated into spiritual practices. Sacred Woman, Sacred Dance is the first book to explore women's spiritual expression--women's ways--through a study of dance. It describes sacred circles, birth rituals, ecstatic dances, and dances of loss and grief (in groups and individually) that allow women to integrate the movements of faith, healing, and power into their daily life.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rmIoDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tertium organum;: The third canon of thought; a key to the enigmas of the world","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xdJ66x-v-XwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"True Tuscan: Flavors and Memories from the Countryside of Tuscany","description":"A native of Lucca and the chefowner of Beppe, Cesare Casella is the real thing when it comes to Tuscan food.

Why does every conversation end in an argument? Communicating with our children. Conversing. Connecting. When did it become so difficult? And how do we begin to change it for the better? This book was designed to help parents answer these important questions, and it is based on two fundamental ideas: The first is that there are no bad children, and no deliberately bad parents -- but that sometimes, despite the best of intentions on both sides, there can be bad relationships between parents and children. The second is that, as parents, we must do everything we can to save those relationships, to reach out and really communicate with our children, because it is only through talking to them that we can create an environment for inspiration and change. In this compelling book, Shmuley Boteach, passionate social commentator and outspoken relationship guru, walks you through the critical conversations, including: cherishing childhood; developing intellectual curiosity; knowing who you are and what you want to become; learning to forgive; realizing the importance of family and tradition; being fearless and courageous. As a father of eight, Rabbi Shmuley speaks from a wealth of experience. He has written a book for parents of children of all ages, from toddlers, who are just beginning to become aware of the world around them, to adolescents, who must learn to navigate all sorts of tricky social and academic pressures. 10 Conversations will help you stay connected to your children so that they develop the kind of strong moral character that leads to rich, meaningful lives.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RZ0yOL3sQnQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)","description":"A New York Times bestselling author and  a mythmaker for the millennium, a wiseacre wiseman  (New York Times Book Review) delivers a surreal and elaborate quest that takes readers from Tokyo to the remote mountains of northern Japan, where the unnamed protagonist has a surprising confrontation with his demons.

Booklist  In her signature conversational style, Pekkanen uncovers the truth behind the lies as Josie comes to grips with reality vs. the mirage of her marriage.   Library Journal (starred review) In this intricate and enthralling domestic drama, perfect for fans of Big Little Lies and The Affair, the internationally bestselling author of the  gossipy page-turner  (Glamour) The Perfect Neighbors goes deep into a marriage in crisis, peeling back layers of secrets to discover where the relationship veered off course and whether it is worth saving. Josie and Frank Moore are happy at least Josie thinks they are. As parents of two young girls in the Chicago suburbs, their days can be both busy and monotonous, and sometimes Josie wonders how she became a harried fortysomething mother rather than the driven career woman she once was. But Frank is a phenomenal father, he s handsome and charismatic, and he still looks at his wife like she s the beautiful woman he married more than a decade ago. Josie isn t just happy she s lucky. Until one Saturday morning when Josie borrows her husband s phone to make a quick call and sees nine words that shatter her world. Now Josie feels as if she is standing at the edge of a sharp precipice. As she looks back at pivotal moments in the relationship she believed would last forever, she is also plunging ahead, surprising everyone (especially herself) with how far she will go to uncover the extent of her husband s devastating secret. With her  conversational writing style and a knack for making readers care about her characters  (The Washington Post) bestselling author Sarah Pekkanen paints a vivid, kaleidoscopic portrait of a marriage before and during a crisis and of a woman who fears that the biggest secret of all may be the one she s hiding from herself.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sGBEDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The social system of the modern factory: The strike: a social analysis, (Yankee City series, vol.

A few short years later, she was Alfred Hitchcock's confidante and one of the Oscar-nominated screenwriters of his first American film, Rebecca. Harrison had quickly grown from being the worst secretary Hitchcock ever had to one of his closest collaborators, critically shaping his brand as the \\"Master of Suspense.\\" Harrison went on to produce numerous Hollywood features before becoming a television pioneer as the producer of Alfred Hitchcock Presents.

It was also a period dominated by two intense personal relationships: with Schiller, Weimar's other great poet, philosopher, and dramatist, and with Christiana Vulpius, the mother of his son. Goethe was a poet of supreme intelligence and sensitivity living through political andintellectual changes which have shaped the modern world. The transition into modernity is the theme of this volume: Goethe's harrowing experiences of the Revolutionary wars; the explosion of new ideas in philosophy and literature which he absorbed and adapted and which for ten years made Jena theintellectual capital of Europe; the political upheaval initiated by Napoleon which destroyed the Holy Roman Empire in which Goethe had grown up, and with it the cultural role he had envisaged for Jena and Weimar. Boyle vividly narrates both the large-scale events and the personal dramas of thisexciting time, to give lucid accounts of important thinkers whom English readers have hitherto found inaccessible, and to analyse in new ways Goethe's works of the period, notably Wilhelm Meister, The Natural Daughter, and Faust.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Kgo0k_jtsxYC&dq=Goethe:+The+Poet+and+the+Age:+Volume+II:+Revolution+and+Renunciation,+1790-1803+(Goethe+-+The+Poet&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Teachers telling tales out of school: Hilarious, irreverent tales that \\"rock the boat\\" of the American school establishment","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7LCdGwAACAAJ&dq=Teachers+telling+tales+out+of+school:+Hilarious,+irreverent+tales+that+%22rock+the+boat%22+of+the+American+school+establishment&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Warlock of the Witch World","description":"When Kemoc, brother of witches and son of an Earthman, rode out with his weird allies to pursue the conquest of the lost lands of the East, it was to prove the test of his whole purpose for existence.

Building on philosophers from Plato through Aquinas to John Finnis, Alfonso G mez-Lobo links morality to the protection of basic human goods--life, family, friendship, work and play, the experience of beauty, knowledge, and integrity--elements essential to a flourishing, happy human life. G mez-Lobo begins with a discussion of Plato's Crito as an introduction to the practice of moral philosophy, showing that it requires that its participants treat each other as equals and offer rational arguments to persuade each other. He then puts forth a general principle for practical rationality: one should pursue what is good and avoid what is bad. The human goods form the basis for moral norms that provide a standard by which actions can be evaluated: do they support or harm the human goods? He argues that moral norms should be understood as a system of rules whose rationale is the protection and enhancement of human goods. A moral norm that does not enjoin the preservation or enhancement of a specific good is unjustifiable. Shifting to a case study approach, G mez-Lobo applies these principles to a discussion of abortion and euthanasia. The book ends with a brief treatment of rival positions, including utilitarianism and libertarianism, and of conscience as our ultimate moral guide. Written as an introductory text for students of ethics and natural law, Morality and the Human Goods makes arguments consistent with Catholic teaching but is not based on theological considerations. The work falls squarely within the field of philosophical ethics and will be of interest to readers of any background.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=W5COCgAAQBAJ&dq=Morality+and+the+Human+Goods:+An+Introduction+to+Natural+Law+Ethics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Horowitz His Life and Music","description":"A biography of the piano virtuoso describes the musician's 1986 homecoming to the U.S.S.R., childhood in Kiev, experiences as a Jewish student at the Moscow Conservatory, and more","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RukZAQAAIAAJ&dq=Horowitz+His+Life+and+Music&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pulling Leather: Being the Early Recollections of a Cowboy on the Wyoming Range, 1884-1889","description":"Round-ups, trail drives, a lynching, mail order romances, blacksmithing, bunkhouse humor, Indians, the Blizzard of 1885-86, cattle barons, Calamity Jane, the rise & demise of the open-range cattle era--Rueben Mullins experienced the West as it will never be again.

These men and women used a Cosmic Force which is in the universe and which anyone may use, when he once learns how to focus this higher power within his own mind. There are stupendous miracles such as healing the sick; causing the blind to see; making the crippled walk, but these are not the only miracles with which we are concerned in this Metaphysical study. There are the little, every-day miracles, which you may begin to perform immediately that relate to your health, to your work, to increasing your income, to finding happiness in love and marriage and to healing your mind of confusion, discord, and unhappiness, so that you may find inner peace and security. You will learn in this study that you too may become a miracle-worker; that you may wave the mental wand of Faith and create out of the substance of your thoughts and inner dreams the concrete things that you desire in your life. You may tap the power of this higher Cosmic Mind and create magnificent works, even as did the geniuses of the past who used this Miracle-working power. Beethoven used this higher mind within to create beautiful music, even though he was deaf; Edison tapped this power of the higher Cosmic Mind within and created over three hundred inventions, from the motion picture camera to the electric light bulb, which bless our lives today. Edison used the power which we shall study together, and there is no reason why YOU may not achieve greatness through this self-same Metaphysical power. Lincoln was a miracle-worker, and although a martyr, like Gandhi and John F. Kennedy, he brought the miracle of unity and greatness to a strife ridden nation. J.P. Morgan was a financier and industrialist, but he used the Metaphysical Miracle power which we shall study together to build one of the great financial empires of all time. This miracle power is not dead today; it is still being used by men like Paul G. Getty and Howard Hughes, Ford and Rockefeller to create wealth that not only benefits the ones who create it, but also blesses the world through the public libraries they endow, the research foundations they create and the artistic gifts and treasures which they give to our great art galleries and museums. The Miracles of Lourdes are well known, and I have stood in the sacred Grotto and I have seen the discarded crutches, wheel chairs and braces that the sick have left there when their miracles of healing came and they walked away healed by a miracle power that worked for them, but which does not seem to work for others. The spectacular miracles that the Master Metaphysician Jesus performed, and which we see at places like Lourdes, are not the only evidences that this Metaphysical Miracle Power exists and may be tapped by ordinary mortals; there are other evidences in our own age that this power is alive today and may be used to heal millions of still unborn persons and to save the lives of hundreds of millions today. Salk used this higher Miracle Power to develop his vaccine for polio; Fleming developed penicillin through this higher intuitive mind; Mme. and M. Curie discovered radium by listening to the inner Cosmic Voice that guided them; and Pasteur certainly was a miracle-worker unequalled in history for the perception that caused him to perfect the use of vaccines in the treatment and prevention of disease.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lcxwEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sandra Gustafson's Great Sleeps Paris","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=n3bCxgEACAAJ&dq=Sandra+Gustafson%27s+Great+Sleeps+Paris&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Antarctica","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Bilingual Special Education Interface (4th Edition)","description":"This book offers an understanding of the major needs of bilingual children who also have disabilities.

Lam rim chen mo) is one of the brightest jewels in the world s treasury of sacred literature. The author, Tsong-kha-pa, completed it in 1402, and it soon became one of the most renowned works of spiritual practice and philosophy in the world of Tibetan Buddhism. Because it condenses all the exoteric s tra scriptures into a meditation manual that is easy to understand, scholars and practitioners rely on its authoritative presentation as a gateway that leads to a full understanding of the Buddha s teachings. Tsong-kha-pa took great pains to base his insights on classical Indian Buddhist literature, illustrating his points with classical citations as well as with sayings of the masters of the earlier Kadampa tradition. In this way the text demonstrates clearly how Tibetan Buddhism carefully preserved and developed the Indian Buddhist traditions. This first of three volumes covers all the practices that are prerequisite for developing the spirit of enlightenment (bodhicitta).","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=o7xvDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Great+Treatise+On+The+Stages+Of+The+Path+To+Enlightenment+Vol+1&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"20th Century American Short Stories, Volume 1 (Student Book)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=w_NbAAAACAAJ&dq=20th+Century+American+Short+Stories,+Volume+1+(Student+Book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Used 911 Story, 8th Edition","description":"Porsche Turbo: The Inside Story of Stuttgart's Turbocharged Road and Race Cars celebrates Porsche's five decades of turbocharged supercar performance, both on the track and on the street.

The gripping narrative of \\"Children of the Storm\\" leads you through this haunting experience. The morning of March 26, 1931 began with sixty-degree weather and students excitedly running to board Carl Miller's bus for their routine ride to Pleasant Hill School. By the time they arrived at the schoolhouses, it was dark, windy, and cold---obvious signs of a spring snowstorm. Soon after, following the teahers' orders to drive the children to a nearby home for safety, Miller lost his sense of direction in the ensuing whiteout and lodged the bus in a ditch. When rescuers found the survivors a day and a half later, the blizzard had taken its deadly toll. The media avidly pursued the story, and the children became national and international celebrities. Ariana Harner and Clarkk Secrest have written the first comprehensive account of the tragedy, culling details from interviews, newspaper clippings, and archival documents. This is a tale of media exploitation, false heroism, lifelong heartbreak, and hard-won survival.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_0MCAAAACAAJ&dq=Children+of+the+Storm:+The+True+Story+of+the+Pleasant+Hill+School+Bus+Tragedy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Farmgirl Poems","description":"In tHE FARMGIRL POEMS, winner of the 2004 Pearl Poetry Prize, Elizabeth Oakes looks back to the mid-twentieth century and her childhood on a farm in rural Kentucky, to that land now only in my memory.

Taking us back to the source of all that feeds and sustains us, Oakes shows us the passing of an American way of life with a straight-forward simplicity that's as genuine and powerful as it is moving. --Pearl Editions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4jq0AAAACAAJ&dq=The+Farmgirl+Poems&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Invasion diary","description":"A dramatic and richly detailed chronicle of the Allied invasions of Sicily and Italy from one of America s greatest war correspondents. Following the defeat of Axis forces in North Africa, Allied military strategists turned their attention to southern Italy. Winston Churchill famously described the region as the  soft underbelly of Europe,  and claimed that an invasion would pull German troops from the Eastern Front and help bring a swift end to the war. On July 10, 1943, American and British forces invaded Sicily. Operation Husky brought the island under Allied control and hastened the downfall of Benito Mussolini, but more than one hundred thousand German and Italian troops managed to escape across the Strait of Medina. The  soft underbelly  of mainland Italy became, in the words of US Fifth Army commander Lt. Gen. Mark Clark,  a tough old gut.  Less than a year after landing with the US Marines on Guadalcanal Island, journalist Richard Tregaskis joined the Allied forces in Sicily and Italy. Invasion Diary documents some of the fiercest fighting of World War II, from bombing runs over Rome to the defense of the Salerno beachhead against heavy artillery fire to the fall of Naples. In compelling and evocative prose, Tregaskis depicts the terror and excitement of life on the front lines and recounts his own harrowing brush with death when a chunk of German shrapnel pierced his helmet and shattered his skull. An invaluable eyewitness account of two of the most crucial campaigns of the Second World War and a stirring tribute to the soldiers, pilots, surgeons, nurses, and ambulance drivers whose skill and courage carried the Allies to victory, Invasion Diary is a classic of war reportage and  required reading for all who want to know how armies fight  (Library Journal).

Later, he viewed the question of moral choice within the framework of his ideas about archetypes and discussions about moral choices, conscience, and the continual ethical reflection that is necessary for all of us.

Through the cultural terrain of literature by Toni Morrison, Nalo Hopkinson, Audre Lorde, and Octavia Butler, the art of Wangechi Mutu and Ezrom Legae, and the oratory of Frederick Douglass, Zakiyyah Iman Jackson both critiques and displaces the racial logic that has dominated scientific thought since the Enlightenment. In so doing, Becoming Human demonstrates that the history of racialized gender and maternity, specifically antiblackness, is indispensable to future thought on matter, materiality, animality, and posthumanism. Jackson argues that African diasporic cultural production alters the meaning of being human and engages in imaginative practices of world-building against a history of the bestialization and thingification of blackness the process of imagining the black person as an empty vessel, a non-being, an ontological zero and the violent imposition of colonial myths of racial hierarchy. She creatively responds to the animalization of blackness by generating alternative frameworks of thought and relationality that disrupt not only the racialization of the human/animal distinction found in Western science and philosophy but also by challenging the epistemic and material terms under which the specter of animal life acquires its authority. What emerges is a radically unruly sense of a being, knowing, feeling existence: one that necessarily ruptures the foundations of \\"the human.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nAS5DwAAQBAJ&dq=Becoming+Human&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Napoleon Against Russia","description":"In June 1812 500,000 men of Napoleon's army invaded Russia.

Although the impact of the European tradition on American composers is widely acknowledged, Jack Sullivan demonstrates that an even more powerful musical current has flowed from the New World to the Old. The spread of rock and roll around the world, the author contends, is only the latest chapter in a cross-cultural story that began in the nineteenth century with Gottschalk in Paris and Dvor k in New York. Sullivan brings popular and canonical culture into his wide-ranging discussion. He explores the effects on European music of American authors as diverse as Twain, DuBois, Melville, and Langston Hughes, examining in particular Dvor k's fascination with Longfellow, the obsession of Debussy and Ravel with Poe, and the inspiration Whitman provided for Holst, Vaughan Williams, and dozens more. Sullivan uncovers the African American musical influence on Europe, beginning with spirituals and culminating in the impact of jazz on Stravinsky, Bart k, Walton, and others. He analyzes the lure of Hollywood and Broadway for such composers as Weill, Korngold, and Britten and considers the power of the American landscape--from the remoteness of the prairie to the brutal energy of the American city. In European music, Sullivan finds, American culture and mythology continue to resonate.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_4tUx1x6xqsC&dq=New+World+Symphonies:+How+American+Culture+Changed+European+Music&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Living Bread","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Reformation","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2qb6WLHVf9oC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Al Borboleta Cookbook: Butterfly Wings & Culinary Happenings","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4zebPQAACAAJ&dq=The+Al+Borboleta+Cookbook:+Butterfly+Wings&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The history of Henry Esmond, Esq: A Colonel in the Service of Her Majesty Queen Anne","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Baw2AQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Everybody Loves Ramen: Recipes, Stories, Games, & Fun Facts About the Noodles You Love","description":"Everybody Loves Ramen!

Why was a twenty-nine year old Waffen-SS officer chosen to lead the German spearhead unit during the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944? Peiper was a special leader within the one of the most elite Waffen-SS divisions, the Leibstandarte-SS Adolf Hitler. Peiper was charismatic and extreme loyal to his unit. His men trusted him as a leader, even under the most extreme conditions. In Germany he was a well-known war hero. It was a logical decision that Peiper became the commander of the spearhead unit, but there were other factors leading to this decision: tactical considerations, a we-know-what-to-expect-principle, and Peiper was lucky that he was still alive and serving in the Waffen-SS.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kg5wCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Artificial Reality","description":"Krueger, the father of artificial reality, updates the book published in 1983 in which he described basic features of simulation technology and provided a vision of what was to come.

In her rivetting account, the author experiences racial rejection, abuse and the terrors of war but is lovingly adopted by a compassionate Reverend Mother. Starting in England in 1934, Mary takes the reader on a dramatic journey--from the time of her rejection by her birth family and her adoption by her benefactor (the Mother Superior of a nunnery) through years of struggle, abuse and confusion to the joyful life that she lives today. Mary skillfully writes of her experiences and of the people who were part of her life--those who were very dear to her and those caregivers who abused their authority when she was separated from Reverend Mother by the war, of her many childhood experiences away from her care, the reunion with her at age fourteen and the gradual emergence into adulthood. She tells how she followed Reverend Mother's wishes, reluctantly pursuing a career in nursing, despite her desire to escape the real world through a life in show business. She introduces the reader to Mario, her first love, who swept her into a new world, took her to Paris for their honeymoon, to Italy, to meet his family and eventually to the Bahamas, where they lived with their children. One day her world comes to a crashing halt when Mario leaves her for another woman. Mary's poignant search for her birth family, their rejection and eventual acceptance of her, make for a heart-rending, dramatic story that will bless every reader. This book reads like a novel and yet it is a real life story and true in every way. Only towards the end of the book does Mary come to an understanding of the love of Jesus for her and embrace it with all her heart. She presents the wonderful message of God's salvation in such a gentle way that all readers - those who believe and those who do not yet believe - will receive the message with joy and be glad they have read this uplifting book. Endorsements: \\"An obviously gifted story-teller, Mary writes this riveting account of her own life with heart-warming honesty, charming humor and great doses of grace. In all of it--her birth in unusual circumstances, her childhood joys and struggles in war-torn England, her great loves and painful disappointments and her inspiring walk with her Best Friend--there is never a dull moment.\\" Fay Rowe, Author of 'What's in a Name' and 'Keepers of the Testimony' \\"From the first page, you'll be swept away on the incredible journey that has been Mary Haskett's life.

He got his shot when he sold his script for Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but the movie fell far short of his hopes for it. After a few years of working as a script doctor, Whedon got the chance to doBuffy again, this time as a TV show. Few expected it to succeed, but Whedon's humor and intelligence shone through in the scripts, and viewers quickly became attached to the engaging, witty characters. Buffy kept getting better: each season of the show featured a complex story arc possessed of a real sense of danger and further developed the characters. The last few years have brought the Buffy spin-off Angel, the lamentably canceled Firefly (a space western), and the comic book Fray.

Gore had seemed to float along in an apolitical haze in the mind of the electorate. It was the executive branch and the legislative branch that mucked about in politics getting dirty, the judicial branch kept its robes and nose clean. The U.S. Supreme Court and the Electoral Process makes it abundantly clear however that before, during, and after the judicial decision that made George W. Bush the President of the United States, everything was, is, and will likely be, politics-including the decisions handed down by the highest court in the land. This revised and updated edition takes into account not only the recent famous (or infamous, depending on the reader's point of view) judicial decision on the Presidency, but a myriad of others as well in which the U.S. Supreme Court has considered the constitutionality of a wide range of issues involving voting and elections, representation, and political participation. Practitioners and academics in both law and political science examine a number of court actions that directly affect how we choose those who govern us, and how those decisions have affected our electoral politics, constitutional doctrine, and the fundamental concepts of democracy, including: racial redistricting, term limits, political patronage, campaign finance regulations, third-party ballot access, and state ballot initiatives limiting civil liberties. Of the first edition, CHOICE said, The U.S. Supreme Court and the Electoral Process \\"plumbs the Supreme Court's constitutive apolitical role as 'primary shaper of the electoral system' and reveals the pervasive involvement of the Court in the political process.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3HUndCBMQ3EC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Impact of Genius: Five Hundred Years of Grandmaster Chess","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HZ5IPwAACAAJ&dq=Impact+of+Genius:+Five+Hundred+Years+of+Grandmaster+Chess&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cisco Switching Black Book: A Practical In-Depth Guide to Configuring, Operating and Managing Cisco LAN Switches","description":"-- Written as a comprehensive guide for intermediate and advanced network professionals, who want to install or maintain a Cisco switching environment or learn about Cisco switching technologies. -- No other book thoroughly covers the advanced topics required to achieve this level of comprehensive Cisco knowledge or certification in the new CCNP curriculum. -- Includes valuable information for those studying for the CCNP certification including tips and hints, sample review questions and lab exercises. -- Explores complex topics in-depth, in the popular Black Book format, using a complete systematic approach to Cisco switching along with comprehensive examples and diagrams. -- Covers basic to advanced ISL, spanning tree, switch configuration, and switch technologies featuring Cisco's line of Catalyst switches. -- Provides information on ASICs and bridging modes; virtual LANs; line interfaces and modules; multicast; ATM; fault tolerance and policy switching; catalyst show, set and clear commands; redundant links and network traffic. -- Presents the following topics: basic switch configuration, IOS v 12.x, switches and features in the access layer, distribution layer, and core layer.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GYsLAAAACAAJ&dq=Cisco+Switching+Black+Book:+A+Practical+In-Depth+Guide+to+Configuring,+Operating+and+Managing+Cisco+LAN+Switches&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Book for boys","description":"The bestselling book for every boy from eight to eighty, covering essential boyhood skills such as building tree houses*, learning how to fish, finding true north, and even answering the age old question of what the big deal with girls is.

From the sixteenth-century forays of the Spaniards to the invasion of Union forces in 1861, Lawrence S. Rowland, Alexander Moore, and George C. Rogers, Jr., chronicle the settlement and development of the geographical region comprised of what is now Beaufort, Jasper, Hampton, and part of Allendale counties. The authors describe the ill-fated attempts of the Spanish and French to settle the Port Royal Sound area and the arrival of the British in 1663, which established the Beaufort District as the southern frontier of English North America. They tell of the region's bloody Indian Wars, participation in the American Revolution, and golden age of prosperity and influence following the introduction of Sea Island cotton. In charting the approach of civil war, Rowland, Moore, and Rogers relate Beaufort District's decisive role in the Nullification Crisis and in the cultivation, by some of the district's native sons, of South Carolina's secessionist movement. Of particular interest, they profile the local African American, or Gullah, population - a community that has become well known for the retention of its African cultural and linguistic heritage.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FtbpDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Deep South;: Memory and observation","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nfosAAAAMAAJ&dq=Deep+South%3B:+Memory+and+observation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sacred Eyes","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pdvLYRqKr18C&dq=Sacred+Eyes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Paradise Lost Paradise Regained","description":"The classic epic poem from John Milton of Satan's war with heaven and his eventual temptation of humanity.

The Life is not really an autobiography at all, but rather a confession written for inquisitors by a nun whose raptures and mystical claims had aroused suspicion. Despite its troubled origins, the book has had a profound impact on Christian spirituality for five centuries, attracting admiration from readers as diverse as mystics, philosophers, artists, psychoanalysts, and neurologists. How did a manuscript once kept under lock and key by the Spanish Inquisition become one of the most inspiring religious books of all time? National Book Award winner Carlos Eire tells the story of this incomparable spiritual masterpiece, examining its composition and reception in the sixteenth century, the various ways its mystical teachings have been interpreted and reinterpreted across time, and its enduring influence in our own secular age. The Life became an iconic text of the Counter-Reformation, was revered in Franco s Spain, and has gone on to be read as a feminist manifesto, a literary work, and even as a secular text. But as Eire demonstrates in this vibrant and evocative book, Teresa s confession is a cry from the heart to God and an audacious portrayal of mystical theology as a search for love. Here is the essential companion to the Life, one woman s testimony to the reality of mystical experience and a timeless affirmation of the ultimate triumph of good over evil.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=F9SPDwAAQBAJ&dq=St.+Teresa+of+Avila:+Author+of+a+Heroic+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE GREAT CHEESE CONSPIRACY.

This is, for Joey, that special year when boyhood ends, a year of extremes of joy and grief. He earns money by delivering coffee to the black workers in the neighborhood factory, and becomes aware for the first time of the place of black people in his world. During the traditional summer retreat of the neighborhood's mothers and children to a rural Michigan lakefront town, he experiences the first stirrings of romantic love, but also the numbing pain of the death of his best friend. He comes to doubt the very existence of God, and learns that life is not what he had imagined, that even the joy of a kiss will be forever tinged with mortality. He returns to the city a changed person, his faith shaken but his conscience awakened, and he takes his first small stand against injustice. As the year ends, his family moves away from the old neighborhood and Joey leaves behind its sights, sounds, smells, and people, especially his first love Benita, and a big piece of himself.--Dust jacket.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mTyskgEACAAJ&dq=The+Long+Italian+Goodbye&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lakota Renegade (Leisure historical romance)","description":"Creed Maddigan is handy with six-guns and fists.

The final part of the book discusses how far the idea of revelation must be revised or adapted in the light of modern historical and scientific thought, and proposes a new and positive theology of revelation for the future. The book includes discussions of the work of most major theologians and scholars in the study of religion - Aquinas, Tillich, Barth, Temple, Frazer, and Evans Pritchard - and should be of interest to many scholars and students of comparative religion and theology, and anthropologists.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JSWakNWeL_gC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Warrior Marks: Female Genital Mutilation and the Sexual Blinding of Women","description":"Describes the authors journey around the world to interview a group of women trying to eliminate the traditional practice of female circumcision, a practice forced on women by the men of diverse societies, in a study that includes a new introduction offering an update on the issue.

On the surface, the story seems straightforward -- the party's  free labor  ethos, embracing the opportunity that free soil presented for social and economic mobility, and condemning the danger that slavery in the territories posed for that mobility, foreshadowed the GOP's later devotion to unfettered enterprise and industrial capitalism. In reality, however, the narrative thread is not so linear. This work examines the contradiction that lay at the heart of the supremely influential ideology of the early Republican party. The Paradox of Progress explores one of the most profound changes in American history -- the transition from the anti-market, anti-monopoly, and democratic ideology of Jacksonian America to the business-dominated politics and unregulated excesses of Gilded Age capitalism. Guiding this transformation was the nineteenth-century Republican party. Drawing heavily from both the pro-market commitments of the early Whig party and the anti-capitalist culture of Jackson's Democratic party, the early Republican party found itself torn between these competing values. Nowhere was this contested process more obvious or more absorbing than in Civil War-era Michigan, the birthplace of the Republican party. In The Paradox of Progress, a fascinating look at the central factors underlying the history of the GOP, Martin Hershock reveals how in their determination to resolve their ideological dilemma, Republicans of the Civil War era struggled to contrive a formula that wo uld enable them to win popular elections and to model America's acceptance of Gilded Age capitalism.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=c7VQ_wWB_bYC&dq=Paradox+Of+Progress:+Economic+Change+Individual+Enterprise&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"United States Pattern, Experimental and Trial Pieces, 6th Edition","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mxcFAPzxI0UC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Mysteries","description":"From the New York Times bestselling author of Mary Coin, a masterful, intimate story of two young girls, joined in an unlikely friendship, whose lives are shattered in a single, unthinkable moment.

Wells s firsthand account of World War II based on a journal he kept during the war, letters he sent home, and personal records, as well as recollections of people and events. In June 1941, the twenty-one-year-old Wells was drafted into the army. He was commissioned second lieutenant after he attended O.C.S. and was later promoted to first lieutenant with the First Armored Division. He saw action in North Africa, Italy, and Germany and was awarded the Combat Infantry Badge, the Purple Heart, and the Bronze Star. Wells offers the reader information that has never before been provided. He tells exactly what happened to 2/7 Queens on the night of February 21, 1944, when the troops came up to  the caves  at Anzio. He also depicts what happened during the last offensive in Italy and what armored infantry troops experienced on the perimeter of the attack. This book, however, is not just a story of battle actions. It is a personal story about the  old Army  and how young soldiers were transformed by it during one of the greatest upheavals in world history. Wells s goal in writing this book was to leave behind  an account of a simpler time and of the funny, sad, terrorizing, and tender moments of a war which, with the death of each man or woman who lived through it, recedes just a little bit further into the nation s past.

It presents pre-revolutionary Russia as an empire of great internal contradictions. A colossus that extended over one-sixth the earth's landmass, it was ever vulnerable to foreign invasion. It possessed one of the world's largest populations, the majority of whom lived in poverty and discontent. It commanded the world's richest natural resources, yet its productive forces were constricted by the remnants of feudalism. It strove to cement its multiethnic population by systematic Russification, which only stimulated nationalist movements. It glorified in being a people's autocracy at a time when the regime was increasingly detached from its people. The empire of the tsars become ever more vulnerable until it was shattered by the turmoil of war and revolution. Using the most recent Russian and Western research, the book provides the reader with a good historical basis on which to judge Russia's Soviet experience and her current turbulent transition to democracy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dH3I83Gm9NwC&dq=Fragile+Empire:+A+History+of+Imperial+Russia&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Church That Will Be Left Behind","description":"Israel was not prepared for the first appearance of the Messiah. Yet Israel had esteemed religious leaders, the Pharisees, Sadducees, and an awesome Temple. Likely they felt they were ready to welcome the Messiah.Today members of the church sound like they are ready for the next appearance of Christ, when He comes to rapture the church. But it would be prudent to consider that we could also be making a tragic mistake.Jesus said \\"Therefore keep watch, because you do not know on what day your Lord will come. But understand this: If the owner of the house had known at what time of night the thief was coming, he would have kept watch and would not have let his house be broken into. (Matthew 24:42-43 NIV)Jesus said that if we are not ready when the rapture occurs, there will be consequences. We will feel robbed - as if struck by a thief who comes in the night.? The last time Christ appeared - His people were not prepared, and Christ suffered.? When Christ comes to rapture the church - many of His people will not be prepared.? But this time - it will be the unprepared believer who will suffer.? Christ will be coming with power and great glory.Jesus warned us to keep watch - you need to understand why!","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=D2f5zQEACAAJ&dq=The+Church+That+Will+Be+Left+Behind&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Methodism and the Shaping of American Culture","description":"Collected works on the history of Methodism in America.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vn_ZAAAAMAAJ&dq=Methodism+and+the+Shaping+of+American+Culture&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Horse Family","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BDuzAAAAIAAJ&dq=The+Horse+Family&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Appaloosa: The Spotted Horse in Art and History","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0-BtzQEACAAJ&dq=Appaloosa:+The+Spotted+Horse+in+Art+and+History&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Car and Locomotive Cyclopedia of American Practices, 1997","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4QnfPQAACAAJ&dq=Car+and+Locomotive+Cyclopedia+of+American+Practices,+1997&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A wonder book, (The dandelion classics for children, selected and illustrated by Lucy F.

The aviation and aerospace industry, specifically, is a field that has seen the successful implementation of early stages of automation in daily flight operations through flight management systems and autopilot. However, the effectiveness of aviation systems and the provision of flight safety still depend primarily upon the reliability of aviation specialists and human decision making. The Handbook of Research on Artificial Intelligence Applications in the Aviation and Aerospace Industries is a pivotal reference source that explores best practices for AI implementation in aviation to enhance security and the ability to learn, improve, and predict. While highlighting topics such as computer-aided design, automated systems, and human factors, this publication explores the enhancement of global aviation security as well as the methods of modern information systems in the aeronautics industry. This book is ideally designed for pilots, scientists, engineers, aviation operators, air crash investigators, teachers, academicians, researchers, and students seeking current research on the application of AI in the field of aviation.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jEHADwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Roseborough","description":"Recently widowed and struggling to find her fourteen-year-old runaway daughter, ice cream clerk Mary Lou signs up for a single-parenting class and soon finds the entire group enmeshed in her search.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EuQDmONpw9gC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How Large Is God: The Voices of Scientists and Theologians","description":"As we try to understand ourselves and the world we live in, all too often we look first to science and then, if gaps remain in our understanding, we try to fill the gaps with reference to God and our faith.

In Clara Barton, Professional Angel, Elizabeth Brown Pryor presents a biography of Barton that strips away the heroic exterior and reveals a complex and often trying woman. Based on the papers Clara Barton carefully saved over her lifetime, this biography is the first one to draw on these recorded thoughts. Besides her own voluminous correspondence, it reflects the letters and reminiscences of lovers, a grandniece who probed her aunt's venerable facade, and doctors who treated her nervous disorders. She emerges as a vividly human figure. Continually struggling to cope with her insecure family background and a society that offered much less than she had to give, she chose achievement as the vehicle for gaining the love and recognition that frequently eluded her during her long life. Not always altruistic, her accomplishments were nonetheless extraordinary. On the battlefields of the Civil War, in securing American participation in the International Red Cross, in promoting peacetime disaster relief, and in fighting for women's rights, Clara Barton made an unparalleled contribution to American social progress. Yet the true measure of her life must be made from this perspective: she dared to offend a society whose acceptance she treasured, and she put all of her energy into patching up the lives of those around her when her own was rent and frayed.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gmaFUNcR4zkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Lord Has Saved Me","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Aeneid for boys and girls: Told from Virgil in simple language","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AvlWAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"3 Ways of Asian Wisdom","description":"A lucid exposition of the three major Oriental religions and their related art forms, defining clearly the relationship of Eastern culture and thought to the Western world","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ET9QAQAAIAAJ&dq=3+Ways+of+Asian+Wisdom&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dangerous Journeys 1: Anubis Murders","description":"Someone is murdering the worlds most powerful sorcerers, and the trail of blood leads straight to the god Anubis.

Recommended... - Library Journal...a terrifically contextualized debunking that is sure to generate debate among the faithful. - Publishers Weekly...a fascinating book on the psychology of modern Western culture. - Science & Spirit MagazineThis fascinating discussion of modern demonology focuses on our ability to differentiate the physical world, with its mechanical laws, from the inherently less predictable psychological realm of thoughts and beliefs. McGrath points out that this ability was a hard-won historical development, and today must be learned in childhood through education. Because of this historical background and our rich fantasy life in childhood, each of us unconsciously suspects, or fears, that supernatural forces may break through the borders of our everyday commonsense order at any time. Indeed, at times of personal stress or societal crisis, the modern boundaries between fantasy and reality begin to slip, and then a magical world of demons and other phantasms can come flooding back into our disenchanted reality.Through this innovative thesis McGrath goes a long way toward explaining both our fascination with fantasy entertainment, such as horror stories and films, and bizarre crazes such as witch-hunts, Satanism scares, and even claims of alien abduction. Despite our demystified culture the lure of childhood's magic kingdom with its monstrous shadow realm remains strong.Malcolm McGrath (Toronto, Ontario, Canada) is a doctoral candidate in political philosophy at Oxford University.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aPfpi5nuwRMC&dq=Demons+of+the+Modern+World&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"If You're Thinking of Living in ...All About 115 Great Neighborhoods in and Around New York","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Ohio;: Geography, history [and] government","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hWWrngEACAAJ&dq=Ohio%3B:+Geography,+history+%5Band%5D+government&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock's Coffin Corner","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=b7btOwAACAAJ&dq=Alfred+Hitchcock%27s+Coffin+Corner&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Building Sweet Dream : An Ultralight Solo Canoe for Single and Double Paddle","description":"A complete how-to manual covering all phases of building and finishing six versions of a 12-, 13- or 14-foot arc-bottom canoe.

Berlin, 1945. Jake Geismar, former Berlin correspondent for CBS, has managed to wangle one of the coveted press slots for the Potsdam Conference. His assignment: a series of articles on the American occupation of postwar Berlin. His personal agenda: to find Lena, the German mistress he left behind at the outbreak of the war. When he stumbles on a murder--an American soldier washed up on the shore of the conference grounds--he thinks he has found the key that will unlock his Berlin story. What he finds instead is a larger story of corruption and intrigue reaching deep into the heart of the occupation and a city not only physically but morally devastatated, where children scavenge for food in the rubble, sex can be had for a cigarette, and the black market is the only means of survival. Berlin at zero hour is like nowhere else--a tragedy, and a feverish party after the end of the world. And nothing is simple--not the murder of a soldier and not any of the lives, American and German, that Jake encounters as he tries to solve it. More unsolvable still is the larger crime that hangs over everything in 1945, a crime so huge it seems beyond punishment. At once a murder mystery, a love story, and a riveting portrait of a unique time and place, Jason Kanon's The Good German is a historical thriller of the first rank.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tmfvPJVODe4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"WALKERS","description":"A dark and horrifying tale of Druidism, madness and murder.

Fresh out of rehab, Mallory Quinn takes a job as a babysitter for Ted and Caroline Maxwell. She is to look after their five-year-old son, Teddy. Mallory immediately loves it. She has her own living space, goes out for nightly runs, and has the stability she craves. And she sincerely bonds with Teddy, a sweet, shy boy who is never without his sketchbook and pencil. His drawings are the usual fare: trees, rabbits, balloons. But one day, he draws something different: a man in a forest, dragging a woman s lifeless body. Then, Teddy s artwork becomes increasingly sinister, and his stick figures quickly evolve into lifelike sketches well beyond the ability of any five-year-old. Mallory begins to wonder if these are glimpses of a long-unsolved murder, perhaps relayed by a supernatural force. Knowing just how crazy it all sounds, Mallory nevertheless sets out to decipher the images and save Teddy before it s too late.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lQ1GEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Predatory States: Operation Condor and Covert War in Latin America","description":"This powerful study makes a compelling case about the key U.S. role in state terrorism in Latin America during the Cold War. Long hidden from public view, Operation Condor was a military network created in the 1970s to eliminate political opponents of Latin American regimes. Its key members were the anticommunist dictatorships of Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Bolivia, Paraguay, and Brazil, later joined by Peru and Ecuador, with covert support from the U.S. government. Drawing on a wealth of testimonies, declassified files, and Latin American primary sources, J. Patrice McSherry examines Operation Condor from numerous vantage points: its secret structures, intelligence networks, covert operations against dissidents, political assassinations worldwide, commanders and operatives, links to the Pentagon and the CIA, and extension to Central America in the 1980s. The author convincingly shows how, using extralegal and terrorist methods, Operation Condor hunted down, seized, and executed political opponents across borders. McSherry argues that Condor functioned within, or parallel to, the structures of the larger inter-American military system led by the United States, and that declassified U.S. documents make clear that U.S. security officers saw Condor as a legitimate and useful 'counterterror' organization. Revealing new details of Condor operations and fresh evidence of links to the U.S. security establishment, this controversial work offers an original analysis of the use of secret, parallel armies in Western counterinsurgency strategies. It will be a clarion call to all readers to consider the long-term consequences of clandestine operations in the name of 'democracy.'","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tSDg6xa4z2YC&dq=Predatory+States:+Operation+Condor+and+Covert+War+in+Latin+America&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Land Breakers","description":"Set deep in the Appalachian wilderness between the years of 1779 and 1784, The Land Breakers is a saga like the Norse sagas or the book of Genesis, a story of first and last things, of the violence of birth and death, of inescapable sacrifice and the faltering emergence of community. Mooney and Imy Wright, twenty-one, former indentured servants, long habituated to backbreaking work but not long married, are traveling west. They arrive in a no-account settlement in North Carolina and, on impulse, part with all their savings to acquire a patch of land high in the mountains. With a little livestock and a handful of crude tools, they enter the mountain world one of transcendent beauty and cruel necessity and begin to make a world of their own. Mooney and Imy are the first to confront an unsettled country that is sometimes paradise and sometimes hell. They will soon be followed by others. John Ehle is a master of the American language. He has an ear for dialogue and an eye for nature and a grasp of character that have established The Land Breakers as one of the great fictional reckonings with the making of America.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WcBvDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Land+Breakers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Algebra and Tiling: Homomorphisms in the Service of Geometry (Carus Mathematical Monographs)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sHrISAAACAAJ&dq=Algebra+and+Tiling:+Homomorphisms+in+the+Service+of+Geometry+(Carus+Mathematical+Monographs)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Drugs in America: The Case for Victory : A Citizen's Call to Action","description":"Discusses drug traffic in America, and examines the effectiveness of the government's drug policy","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qVYrAAAAYAAJ&dq=Drugs+in+America:+The+Case+for+Victory+:+A+Citizen%27s+Call+to+Action&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Strategic Management (The Fast-Track Mba)","description":"If you want to accelerate your career development and transform your skillset, but without the price tag and two-year commitment of the MBA, this is the book for you.

This helps to explain the recent attention paid to cultural and genetic explanations of persistent poverty, including claims that economic inequality is a function of intellectual ability, as well as more subtle depictions of the United States as a meritocracy where barriers to achievement are personal--either voluntary or inherited--rather than systemic. This volume of original essays by luminaries in the economic, social, and biological sciences, however, confirms mounting evidence that the connection between intelligence and inequality is surprisingly weak and demonstrates that targeted educational and economic reforms can reduce the income gap and improve the country's aggregate productivity and economic well-being. It also offers a novel agenda of equal access to valuable associations. Amartya Sen, John Roemer, Robert M. Hauser, Glenn Loury, Orley Ashenfelter, and others sift and analyze the latest arguments and quantitative findings on equality in order to explain how merit is and should be defined, how economic rewards are distributed, and how patterns of economic success persist across generations. Moving well beyond exploration, they draw specific conclusions that are bold yet empirically grounded, finding that schooling improves occupational success in ways unrelated to cognitive ability, that IQ is not a strong independent predictor of economic success, and that people's associations--their neighborhoods, working groups, and other social ties--significantly explain many of the poverty traps we observe. The optimistic message of this beautifully edited book is that important violations of equality of opportunity do exist but can be attenuated by policies that will serve the general economy. Policy makers will read with interest concrete suggestions for crafting economically beneficial anti-discrimination measures, enhancing educational and associational opportunity, and centering economic reforms in community-based institutions.

His work is not easy, and he challenges our usual thinking every step of the way. The insights are radical, in the original meaning of that word: they go to the roots. We are forced more and more to realize that only through such thinking can actions arise that are truly healing and constructive.\\" --Henry Barnes (from the introduction) Few people today recognize Rudolf Steiner's name, yet those who are aware of him know that his presence pervades every forward-looking aspect of contemporary life. Nearly all fields of life have been fructified by his insights--not abstractly or theoretically, but in a concrete way that changes lives. No wonder, then, that Steiner has been called \\"the best kept secret of the twentieth century.\\" Born in 1861 in Kraljvec, Austria, Steiner showed evidence early on of the most varied gifts--a precise and probing scientific mind combined with a natural clairvoyant ability to see into the spiritual world, a determined need to think things through for himself, and a profound reverence for the divine. He first made his mark as a philosopher and the editor of Goethe's scientific writings. He also recognized the revolutionary spirit in Nietzsche. But Steiner's destiny led him in a different direction. Profound cognitive experiences determined that his task would lie in service to the spirit. While recognizing the integrity of modern science's phenomenological empiricism, he also knew that the time had come to extend the field of science to include investigation of the supersensible. Working at first within the Theosophical Society, but always speaking and writing out of his own experience, Steiner developed the foundations for a thoroughly modern spiritual-scientific discipline that would transform spiritual and cultural life. Until his death in 1925, in countless lectures and books, Steiner created the body of knowledge and practice known as \\"anthroposophy,\\" which not only challenged and extended the underlying methods of modern knowledge, but stimulated many practical cultural initiatives such as: Waldorf education, biodynamic agriculture, the art of eurythmy, the movement for a threefold social order, and anthroposophical medicine. Henry Barnes--the author of Into the Heart's Land: A Century of Rudolf Steiner's Work in North America--recounts the dynamic life of this remarkable man. He does so by placing Steiner in the crosscurrents of history and showing him not as a spectator or ivory-tower philosopher, but as a leading actor in the drama, one whose entire being was given in service to humanity and to the spirit.

This book gathers some of the presentations and teaching at this conference.

You will learn to reproduce and study interesting curves and surfaces - many more than are included in typical texts - using computer methods. By plotting geometric objects and studying the printed result, teachers and students can understand concepts geometrically and see the effect of changes in parameters. Modern Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces with Mathematica explains how to define and compute standard geometric functions, for example the curvature of curves, and presents a dialect of Mathematica for constructing new curves and surfaces from old. The book also explores how to apply techniques from analysis. Although the book makes extensive use of Mathematica, readers without access to that program can perform the calculations in the text by hand. While single- and multi-variable calculus, some linear algebra, and a few concepts of point set topology are needed to understand the theory, no computer or Mathematica skills are required to understand the concepts presented in the text. In fact, it serves as an excellent introduction to Mathematica, and includes fully documented programs written for use with Mathematica. Ideal for both classroom use and self-study, Modern Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces with Mathematica has been tested extensively in the classroom and used in professional short courses throughout the world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-LRumtTimYgC&dq=Modern+Differential+Geometry+of+Curves+and+Surfaces+with+Mathematica,+Second+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Free Advice","description":"Three single women who dispense free advice on the streets of New York City discuss writing and deciphering a personal ad, staging a seduction, and the best ways to escape from a nightmare date","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Xm8DAAAACAAJ&dq=Free+Advice&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Human Dimension of Depression: A Practical Guide to Diagnosis, Understanding, and Treatment","description":"This book describes the depressive in his or her natural habitat, studies the everyday problems that cause one's depression, and develops treatment approaches directed to the depressive's real-world plight. It explores the borderland between the sacred and the profane, the academic and the popular, the scientific but impractical, and the practical but unscientific. It relies as much on common sense, anecdote, and individual insight as it does on case histories and psychological test protocol. The book is divided into four sections: description, cause, prevention, and treatment. The descriptive section presents the mental-status abnormalities in depression, includes a differential diagnosis of classic depressive symptoms, indicates when so-called classic symptoms of another disorder are in fact depressive, lists the physical complaints that are the product of depression, discusses normal depression, and touches briefly on hypomania. The section on cause recognizes that real troubles are common and chemical troubles rare. It suggests that people do not get depressed because they are under stress or they have suffered loss, but, in simple language, because their boss has threatened to fire them, their wife has threatened to leave, the cat has died, and other similar real-life difficulties. It faces the problems that therapists and patients alike find unpalatable, shameful, and threatening--the things that cause patients to close their eyes or speak in remote euphemisms. The sections on prevention and therapy are not attached to any one school of thought. They are formulated and expressed simply and humanistically, and offer common-sense solutions to the depressives's everyday problems with themselves and their world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=K-4YfBmUWd0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Section 504 Vs.

A provocative look at what happens next at the frontiers of human knowledge. The history of humanity is the history of big ideas that expand our frontiers from the wheel to space flight, cave painting to the massively multiplayer game, monotheistic religion to quantum theory. And yet for the past few decades, apart from a rush of new gadgets and the explosion of digital technology, world-changing ideas have been harder to come by. Since the 1970s, big ideas have happened incrementally recycled, focused in narrow bands of innovation. In this provocative book, Michael Bhaskar looks at why the flow of big, world-changing ideas has slowed, and what this means for the future. Bhaskar argues that the challenge at the frontiers of knowledge has arisen not because we are unimaginative and bad at realizing big ideas but because we have already pushed so far. If we compare the world of our great-great-great-grandparents to ours today, we can see how a series of transformative ideas revolutionized almost everything in just a century and a half. But recently, because of short-termism, risk aversion, and fractious decision making, we have built a cautious, unimaginative world. Bhaskar shows how we can start to expand the frontier again by thinking big embarking on the next Universal Declaration of Human Rights or Apollo mission and embracing change.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vxhgEAAAQBAJ&dq=Frontiers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Whistling Season, a Novel","description":"Hired as a housekeeper to work on the early 1900s Montana homestead of widower Oliver Milliron, the irreverent Rose and her brother, Morris, endeavor to educate the widower's sons while witnessing local efforts on a massive irrigation project.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LGUgQwAACAAJ&dq=Whistling+Season,+a+Novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Makeshift Rocket / Un-Man and Other Novellas (Ace Double F-139)","description":"Includes Part 1, Number 1: Books and Pamphlets, Including Serials and Contributions to Periodicals (January - June)","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XiYhAQAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Intangibles: Management, Measurement, and Reporting","description":"This book is the first comprehensive, scientifically based study of the nature and impact of intangibles.

Later the study was expanded to include an exploration of characteristics of women who were convicted of similar property offenses, such as fraud, forgery, and grand theft. A study of a sample of inmates at the California Institute for Women identified four different systems of behavior among 'honest' women (i.e. those who did not intend to steal) who embezzled: (1) the obsessive protectors, (2) romantic dreamers, (3) greedy opportunists, and (4) victims of pressure or persuasion. Women who intended to steal or defraud were categorized as vindictive self-servers, asocial entrepreneurs, and reluctant offenders. Findings appear to indicate that typologies developed by Cressey and others based on male samples are not wholly applicable to women. There are similarities and differences in the problems faced by men and women who violate financial trust and in their rationalizations to justify their criminal behavior. More extensive research is needed to determine whether these findings can be considered valid for a larger group of women.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1oAEAQAAIAAJ&dq=Women+Who+Embezzle+or+Defraud:+A+Study+of+Convicted+Felons+(Praeger+Special+Studies+in+Social+Welfare)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"J2EE 1.4: The Big Picture","description":"A thorough introduction to the complexities of J2EE that explains the big picture without getting bogged down in the details or hype.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=o8dQAAAAMAAJ&dq=J2EE+1.4:+The+Big+Picture&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Greenwillow","description":"Nostalgic story of a village which the author does not locate in time or place, but which is a typical small town.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5D5KAAAAMAAJ&dq=Greenwillow&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Investing in Silver","description":"Diversify your portfolio with gold and silver Investing and trading in gold and silver is always a sound idea and that goes double in a time of unusual market fluctuation.

His philosophy emerges from the aesthetic avant-garde of the 1920s and 30s, when he was associated with the surrealist movement, and has since been explored by the major figures of poststructuralism and postmodernism. His classic works include The Story of the Eye and The Accursed Share. On Nietzsche takes up Nietzschean thought where Nietzsche left off - with the Death of God. Written against the backdrop of Germany under the Third Reich, the book explores the possibility of a spiritual life outside religion. In so doing it weaves an astonishing tapestry of confession, theology, philosophy, myth and eroticism - all shot through with the images of war.

Most people think seduction is sex, but it is not. Seduction is the waiting period between the time you start trying to achieve what you actually want until you achieve the outcome. It doesn't have to be related to romance. You can seduce a job to hire you, enjoy the seduction of religious experience, or even be seductive when trying to woo a nanny to come to take care of your family. It can be applied to every walk of life. For the purposes of this book, we will focus on seduction in the romantic sense, especially the dating world. In the dating world, where there are no set rules, seduction helps to level the playing field. It is difficult to take the body of someone else by force, but if you seduce them properly, they will happily give in to you, whether they be man or woman. Voltaire had it right. The art of seduction is not about conquering someone else; it is about letting the other person feel like they are giving you a gift when they give in to you. Seduction is not even about sex. Often, at the end of a dating tango, sex is the result, but the seduction is the waiting part until the sex. If you can make the waiting part interesting and fun, it only intensifies the bond of sex. To get to the point of seduction, you have to take a few steps.This book is all about helping you get to the end goal of what you want in a romantic relationship. The following chapters will discuss how you can get to that end goal, whether it be lots of hot sex, a committed relationship, or even marriage. The following chapters will help you learn about seduction and how to do it. In Chapter 1, the best places to meet people to be seduced is going to be discussed. In Chapter 2, you will learn how to initiate the first date and the subsequent dates and will even address how to initiate the first awkward kiss. The twelve amazing tips that work in seduction will be given in Chapter 3, which can be used by men or women, and they are very helpful in getting what you want. In Chapter 4, you will learn some ways to keep your partner interested in you by being seductive continuously. The last chapter ends with all the great positions men and women can use when engaging in sexual activity. This chapter gives pointers and tips on how to blow your lover's mind away. By the time you finish reading the book, you will not have to conquer anyone. People will willingly give you their undies. But, take note: use your seduction powers for good and not bad, unless your partner wants you to.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nJroyAEACAAJ&dq=SEDUCTION+FOR+LOVE&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Bridesmaid Guide","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Exploring Galatians and Ephesians (Devotional Commentaries)","description":"This user-friendly devotional commentary divides the text of Galatians and Ephesians into bite-sized passages using a new translation by the author.

In this book, one of America's leading ethnobotanists warns about our loss of natural vegetation and plant diversity while providing insights into traditional Native agricultural practices in the Americas. Gary Paul Nabhan here reveals the rich diversity of plants found in tropical forests and their contribution to modern crops, then tells how this diversity is being lost to agriculture and lumbering. He then relates \\"local parables\\" of Native American agriculture from wild rice in the Great Lakes region to wild gourds in Florida that convey the urgency of this situation and demonstrate the need for saving the seeds of endangered plants. Nabhan stresses the need for maintaining a wide gene pool, not only for the survival of these species but also for the preservation of genetic strains that can help scientists breed more resilient varieties of other plants. Enduring Seeds is a book that no one concerned with our environment can afford to ignore. It clearly shows us that, as agribusiness increasingly limits the food on our table, a richer harvest can be had by preserving ancient ways.

The distant preverbal past is however still present in live speech. Phonetic, syntactic and semantic rule transgressions, far from being products of a deficient output, are governed by a universal iconic apparatus, a sort of 'anti-grammar' or 'proto-grammar' which enables the speaker and the poet to express preconscious and subconscious mental contents that could not be conveyed by means of the grammar of any language. Secondary messages, generated by the proto-grammar are integrated into the primary grammatical message. The two messages whose structural and semantic divergence represents a chronological distance of hundreds of thousands of years, constitute a dialectic unity which characterize natural languages. The evolutive approach offers a different, perhaps better understanding of questions related to dynamic synchrony, vocal and verbal style, poetic language, language change.Chapters on: Diversity of the lexicon; Dual encoding: vocal style; Syntactic gesturing; Syntactic regressions; Prosodic expression of emotions; Poetry and vocal art; Situation and meaning; A hidden presence: verbal magic; Playing with language: joke and metaphor; Metaphor: a research instrument; Dynamics of poetic language; Semantic structure of possessive constructions; Semantic structure of punctuation marks; Why gestures?; Between acts and words; Language within language: dynamics, change and evolution.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_U0hQar95GEC&dq=Language+Within+Language:&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dixie Betrayed: How the South Really Lost the Civil War","description":"David Eicher reveals the story of the political conspiracy, discord and dysfunction in Richmond that cost the South the Civil War.

Yet, for Djebar, they cannot be silenced. They continue to tell stories, smile, and endure through her defiant pen.

A steamy, liberating tale of self-exploration and self-love that encourages readers to  revel in your sexuality    Kirkus Reviews Leslie Morgan, bestselling author of Crazy Love and Mommy Wars, was a mom turning fifty, reeling from divorce and determined to reclaim her life. In a radical break with convention, she dedicated a year to searching for five new lovers, seeking the rapture absent in a life of minivans and mom jeans and finding a profound new sense of self-worth. When Leslie Morgan divorced after a twenty-year marriage, both her self-esteem and romantic optimism were shattered. She was determined to avoid the clich  of the  lonely, middle-aged divorc e  lamenting her stretch marks and begging her kids to craft her online dating profile. Instead, Leslie celebrated her independence with an audacious plan: she would devote a year to seeking out five lovers in hopes of unearthing the erotic adventures and authentic connections long missing from her life. Clumsy and clueless at first, she overcame mortifying early missteps, buoyed by friends and blind faith. And so she found men at yoga class, the airport, and high school reunions all without the torture of dating websites. Along the way she uncovered new truths about sex, aging, men, self-confidence, and what it means to be an older woman today. Packed with fearless, evocative details, The Naked Truth is a rare, unexpected, and wildly entertaining memoir about a soccer mom who rediscovers the magic of sexual and emotional connection, and the lasting gifts of reveling in your femininity at every age.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0S2BDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Korea","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Arabian Sands","description":"Arabian Sands is Wilfred Thesiger's record of his extraordinary journey through the parched \\"Empty Quarter\\" of Arabia.

Following routes along the North African coast, Muslim and Jewish merchants carried eastern goods to Muslim Spain, returning eastwards with Andalusi exports. Situated at the edge of the Islamic west, Andalusi markets were also emporia for the transfer of commodities between the Islamic world and Christian Europe. After the thirteenth century the Iberian peninsula became part of the European economic sphere, its commercial realignment aided by the opening of the Straits of Gibraltar to Christian trade, and by the contemporary demise of the Muslim trading network in the Mediterranean.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=M-CVlhPb21MC&dq=TRADE+AND+TRADERS+IN+MUSLIM+SPAIN:+THE+COMMERCIAL+REALIGNMENT+OF+THE+IBERIAN+PENINSULA,+900-1500.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"America's Trail of Tears: A Story of Love and Betrayal","description":"This book offers the stories of intermarriage, assassination, and missionary arrests that threatened Andrew Jackson with a civil war thirty years before Lincoln.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Un8IAQAAMAAJ&dq=America%27s+Trail+of+Tears:+A+Story+of+Love+and+Betrayal&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Reason and Revolution: Hegel and the Rise of Social Theory.","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RZDZAAAAMAAJ&dq=Reason+and+Revolution:+Hegel+and+the+Rise+of+Social+Theory.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jaguar XJS: A Collector's Guide","description":"A renowned Jaguar expert offers a comprehensive historical review of the highly collectable XJS series of coupes, cabriolets and convertibles with particular emphasis on quality evaluation, maintenance and upgrades.

For Campanella, every bewildering street grid and linguistic quirk has a story to tell about the landscape of Louisiana and the geography of its bestknown city. Cityscapes of New Orleans starts with an examination of neighborhoods, from the origins of faubourgs and wards to the impact of the slave trade on patterns of residence. Campanella explains how fragments of New Orleans streets continue to elude Google Maps and why humble Creole cottages sit alongside massive Greek Revival mansions. He considers the roles of modern urban planning, environmentalism, and preservation, all of which continue to influence the layout of the city and its suburbs. In the book s final section, Campanella explores the impact of natural disasters as well-known as Hurricane Katrina and as unfamiliar as  Sauv  s Crevasse,  an 1849 levee break that flooded over two hundred city blocks.

On March 18, 1998, the CIA s Inspector General, Fred Hitz, told astounded US Reps that the CIA had maintained relationships with companies and individuals that the Agency knew to be involved in the drug business. More shocking was the revelation that the CIA had received from Reagan s Justice Department clearance not to report any knowledge it might have of drug-dealing by CIA assets. Many years  worth of CIA denials, much of it under oath to Congress, were sunk. Hitz s admissions made fools of some of the most prominent names in US journalism and vindicated others that had been ruined. Particularly resonant was the case of the San Jose Mercury News, which published a sensational series on CIA involvement in the smuggling of cocaine into black urban neighborhoods, and then under pressure conspired in the destruction of its own reporter, Gary Webb. In Whiteout, Alexander Cockburn and Jeffrey St. Clair finally put the whole story together, from the earliest days, when the CIA s institutional ancestors cut a deal with America s premier gangster and drug trafficker, Lucky Luciano. This is a thrilling history that stretches from Sicily in 1944 to the killing fields of Laos and Vietnam, to CIA safe houses in Greenwich Village and San Francisco where CIA men watched Agency-paid prostitutes feed LSD to unsuspecting clients. We meet Oliver North, as he plotted with Manuel Noriega and Central American gangsters. We travel to little-known airports in Costa Rica and Arkansas. We hear from drug pilots and accountants from the Cali Cartel. We learn of DEA agents whose careers were ruined because they tried to tell the truth. Cockburn and St. Clair show how the CIA s complicity with drug-dealing criminal gangs was part and parcel of its attacks on labor organizers, whether on the docks of New York, Marseilles, or Shanghai. They trace how the Cold War and counter-insurgency led to an alliance between the Agency and the vilest of war criminals like Klaus Barbie, or fanatic opium traders like the mujahedin in Afghanistan. Cockburn and St. Clair horrifyingly affirm charges of outraged black communities that the CIA had undertaken enduring programs of experiments on minorities. They show that the CIA imported Nazi scientists straight from their labs at Dachau and Buchenwald and set to work, developing chemical and biological agents, tested on blacks, some of them in mental hospitals. Cockburn and St. Clair dissect the shameful way American journalists have not only turned a blind eye to the Agency s misdeeds, but also helped plunge the knife into those who tried to tell the truth. Fact-packed and fast-paced, Whiteout is a richly detailed excavation of the CIA s dirtiest secrets. For anyone who wants to know the real truth about the Agency, this is the book to start with.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MYaZBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stars Over Stars","description":"Heyoka Blackeagle, a hrinn raised as a human, his human partner Mitsu, and their small team of hrinn and human Rangers are left behind on a remote planet threatened by the imminent arrival of alien flek hordes.

Instead, it authorized the State of Texas to raise its own troops. Many kinds of men drifted into the Texas Mounted Rifles. Some thought it might be safer than fighting in far off Virginia. Many were merely young men a-thirst for adventure. Some were settlers who saw this as the best way to protect their families and homes against the murderous thrusts of the Comanche. And some were men who still loved the Union, who had lived too long under that gallant flag to turn their guns against it now.

This lively and engaging book will be a help to seekers as well as a comfort to believers who may find themselves questioning some of the assumptions they grew up with. With an accessible, storytelling style that's grounded in solid biblical scholarship, Thielen shows how Christians don't need to believe that sinners will be \\"left behind\\" to burn in hell or that it's heresy to believe in evolution. And while we must always take the Bible seriously, we don't always have to take it literally. At the same time, Christians do need to believe in Jesus--his life, his teachings, his death and resurrection, and his vision for the world. A great benefit of those beliefs is that they provide promising answers to life's most profound questions, including: Where is God? What matters most? What brings fulfillment? What about suffering? Is there hope? Thielen articulates centrist, mainline Christianity in a way that's fresh and easy to understand, and offers authentic Christian insights that speak to our deepest needs. This new edition includes a leader's guide, previously only available online, and a new introduction from the author that reflects on the book's reception. The leader's guide features unique and easily implemented aids for carrying out a seven-week, congregation-wide initiative that will help local churches reach out to their communities.

The aim was to participate in the 100th anniversary of the Edinburgh conference through a study process and reflect on the challenges for mission in the twenty-first century. We decided not to invite renowned experts, but to have an open invitation through a call for papers, so that practicing mission experts not yet well known would have an opportunity to share their expertise. We decided not to predetermine a theme or motto for the consultation but to allow various themes on mission to emerge from the papers themselves and thus to allow wide-ranging discussions. Indeed the papers were varied; each drew strong reactions, lively and even controversial debates. We were able to discover common concerns transcending very different contexts. The collection of papers in this book has been taken from the papers delivered at the Wuppertal consultation. In some cases, short responses by one or two of the consultation participants were added to highlight the discussions that followed. The very varied voices collected in this anthology nevertheless have much in common: Even where they are most theoretical it is obvious that all contributors come from missionary practice and bring in their contextual experiences.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=osFMAwAAQBAJ&dq=Computer-Konkordanz+Zum+Novum+Testamentum+Graece+Von+Nestle-Aland,+26.+Auflage+Und+Zum+Greek+New+Testament,+3d+Ed+(1963p)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Personality Psychology: Science of Individuality","description":"This book presents personality from the perspective of existing research. It provides an overview of personality research and demonstrates the relationship between research and real individuals. Readers are encouraged to explore the relationship between the research and their own personalities. It also introduces primary source literature in personality psychology by covering the content, methods, and issues in the journals with minimal jargon. Personality Psychology: The Science of Individuality presents content on its own merits rather than forcing it to fit existing theories. Readers avoid the sometimes inaccurate connections to historical theories found in other books on personality. The book also includes discussions often neglected in other books, such as entire separate chapters on intelligence and cognitive style, the unconscious, and evolutionary personality psychology. Readers will learn important areas in enough depth to appreciate the issues and complexities. The book always attempts to make clear why a particular study is important. This may facilitate the readers' ability to study the subject further. Chapter Two includes a short personality questionnaire designed to measure the Big 5 factors. Since discussions of methodology refer back to the Big 5 factors throughout the book, readers benefit by having a personal involvement through their scores on the questionnaire. It may also help to make some of the material personally relevant. A valuable book for any reader interested in understanding the existing research into personality, or who wishes to understand more about his or her own personality.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NBVHAAAAMAAJ&dq=Personality+Psychology:+Science+of+Individuality&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nature in Needlepoint - A unique tribute to wildlife","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DjhVAAAAYAAJ&dq=Nature+in+Needlepoint+-+A+unique+tribute+to+wildlife&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Got Milk?

Noramary closed her eyes, bringing back the scene that had just taken place.

Ten years in the making, The Wheel of Change Tarot is a unique and brilliant creation. Although it follows the ancient tradition of the Tarot, it has many new features. This collection of 78 original watercolor paintings contains scientific, natural, historical and modern images. Based in a Pagan-oriented worldview, the underlying wheel of the year, and its cycles and seasons, form a backdrop for the varied layers of symbolism. The beautiful watercolors are full of detail and are painted in rich saturated colors, making the images vivid and exciting. The Wheel of Change Tarot is based in the broad scope of human experience and is multicultural. In each of the four minor suits the \\"face\\" cards - Queen, Knight, Princess and Prince - are each of a different race. Symbolically this represents the fact that all people are made up of the various traits of the four suits. The multiculturalism in the Wheel of Change cards appears both in the Major Arcana and in the Minors, where images from all over the planet are included. With these extensive and varied images The Wheel of Change Tarot is inclusive; it therefore brings in both the individual experience of a broad range of people and the ancient histories of these people. Another new feature of these cards is the broad historical period which they cover. The Ten of Cups shows an archaeological dig in Europe while the Four of Swords shows the ancient burial practices of the Egyptians. Many other images of the ancient historical and pre-historical period can also be seen in the cards. Also included are images that are exclusively from the present a such as the Two of Swords, showing a common pair of scissors symbolizing the simple magic involved in such a tool. Alexandra believes that the common idea that only symbols from our past are legitimate needs to be examined carefully, as we must begin to accept the trappings of our society and to understand our complex relationship with them. The Wheel of Change deck is a conscious attempt to unite the world of nature and the world of our minds and to bridge the gap that ultimately divides us from our selves. Our understanding of modern science is included in many of the images. The Two of Disks expresses the complex relationship between the sun and the earth and the concept of time shown in the analemma (the infinity symbol seen on globes), while the Ace of Swords pictures the full spectrum including the infrared and the ultra violet, showing our scientific understanding of electromagnetic radiation. Also included in these cards is a powerful message of environmentalism. The strongest of these is the reinterpretation of the Justice card, which is usually interpreted as balance and is associated with the sign Libra, the scales. In Alexandra's new version she has painted a representative balance of all the species on earth: the fish in the sea and the creatures of the earth and the air. Included in the print version of the book are descriptions of the symbolism and reading interpretations for each of the 78 cards, as well as black and white images of each one. There are also many new spreads for doing both simple and sophisticated readings, a solitaire game designed to help beginners familiarize themselves with the Tarot, and guides to astrology and symbolism that will help readers develop their own philosophical system. Also included in the book is a new and completely original underlying pattern for the cards of the major arcana. Titled \\"The Tarot Tree\\", it helps people learn and understand the archetypes more easily and completely, and establishes several profound interrelated groupings, which lead to a new understanding of the structure of the major arcana. In addition, there is a philosophical commentary by Stanley V. McDaniel, professor emeritus, Sonoma State University, with whom Alexandra studied in the 1970s.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pkhfawEACAAJ&dq=The+Wheel+of+Change+Tarot&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Germans in Wisconsin","description":"Between 1820 and 1910, nearly five and a half million German-speaking immigrants came to the United States in search of new homes, new opportunities, and freedom from European tyrannies. Most settled in the Midwest, and many came to Wisconsin, whose rich farmlands and rising cities attracted three major waves of immigrants. By 1900, German farmers, merchants, manufacturers, editors, and educators to say nothing of German churches (both Catholic and Lutheran), cultural institutions, food, and folkways had all set their mark upon Wisconsin. In the most recent census (1990), more than 53 percent of the state's residents considered themselves \\"German\\" the highest of any state in the Union. In this best-selling book, now with updated text and additional historical photographs, Richard H. Zeitlin describes the values and ideas the Germans brought with them from the Old Country; highlights their achievements on the farm, in the workplace, and in the academy over the course of 150 years; and explains why their impact has been so profound and pervasive.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uoRMZP_a_BIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Conspiracy Page","description":"Drawn into a world of where nothing is as it seems, four young teenagers are have only their wits to deal with conspiracies that threaten their lives.

Although scholars over the last twenty years have turned their attention to fiber arts, redefining the conditions, practices, and products as art, there is still much work to be done to deconstruct the stubborn patriarchal art/craft binary. With essays on a range of fiber art practices, including embroidery, knitting, crocheting, machine stitching, rug making, weaving, and quilting, this collection contributes to the ongoing scholarly redefinition of women's relationship to creative activity. Focusing on women as producers of cultural products and creators of social value, the contributors treat women as active subjects and problematize their material practices and artifacts in the complex world of textiles. Each essay also examines the ways in which needlework both performs gender and, in turn, constructs gender. Moreover, in concentrating on and theorizing material practices of textiles, these essays reorient the study of fiber arts towards a focus on process?the making of the object, including the conditions under which it was made, by whom, and for what purpose?as a way to rethink the fiber arts as social praxis.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dTMrDwAAQBAJ&dq=I+Sing+for+I+Cannot+Be+Silent:+The+Feminization+of+American+Hymnody,+1870-1920+(Pitt+Comp+Literacy+Culture)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Great Pretenders: My Strange Love Affair with '50s Pop Music","description":"February 1964: The Beatles step onto the tarmac at JFK International Airport and turn the country on its head.

While her parents might enjoy the new music, the cultural upheaval passes them by, and they cling to the promises made by the music they loved as teenagers, the sweet, innocent 1950s pop of Patti Page, Frankie Laine, and the like. But having courted and wed against a backdrop of ideals peddled by this music -- finding true love, living happily ever after -- Schoemer's parents, like so many people, are crushed by disappointment when love doesn't deliver what the songs promised. Fifties pop falls quickly off the charts; their marriage eventually falls apart. In Great Pretenders, a lively, provocative blend of memoir and music criticism, former Newsweek pop music critic Karen Schoemer tries to figure out what went so wrong, way back in the hazy past, for her parents' marriage and for the music of their youth. To find the answers, she embarks on a strange, lonely journey in search of some of the brightest stars of the 1950s. Schoemer's search started when, twenty years after her parents' divorce, the new Connie Francis box set appeared on her desk at Newsweek. Now a successful rock critic dispensing post-punk opinions to the hipoisie, she was about to toss aside this relic when she was struck by the cover image of Francis, which bore an uncanny resemblance to her own mother; on a whim, she played one of the CDs. For all their cloying, simplistic sentimentality, songs like \\"Where the Boys Are\\" had an undeniable power -- \\"the sound of every teenage girl in every bedroom on every lonely Saturday going back a thousand years.\\" It was the music of her parents' long-lost adolescence, and much to her surprise, it moved her. Thus Schoemer, arbiter of Gen X cool, found herself falling into the saccharine thrall of 1950s pop music, that pariah of the rock establishment. Even as her colleagues tried to steer her away from the terminally uncool genre, she tracked down seven former pop idols of the late 1950s and early 1960s: Connie Francis, Fabian, Pat Boone, Patti Page, Tommy Sands, Georgia Gibbs, and Frankie Laine. As she became privy to their inner lives and immersed herself in their music, Schoemer revised her own notions about the fifties at the same time that she explored her family's vexed dynamic. The result is a wonderful romp through an unappreciated chapter in music history and, more important, through her own past. Full of humor, insight, and unflinching honesty, Great Pretenders bucks the received wisdom, explores the intersections of our private lives and pop culture, and broadens our understanding of a crucial moment in our history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pomDOgfF18oC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Curse of Carranca","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=w8wztAEACAAJ&dq=Curse+of+Carranca&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Redgauntlet","description":"Arguably Scott's finest novel, and the last of his major Scottish novels, Redgauntlet centers around a third, fictitious, Jacobite rebellion set in the summer of 1765. The novel's hero, young Darsie Latimer, is kidnapped by Edward Hugh Redgauntlet, a fanatical supporter of the Stewart cause, and finds himself caught up in the plot to install the exiled Bonnie Prince Charlie on the British throne. First published in 1824, this is perhaps Scott's most complex statement about the relation between history and fiction. This new edition features the Magnum text of 1832, the last to be corrected by Scott, and it includes Scott's own notes. This reissue is the only available critical edition and it includes a fine introduction by Kathryn Sutherland, who examines the historical context, the novel's structure and style, and the story itself. The book also includes an up-to-date bibliography, a timeline of Scottish history in the period relating to the novel, a chronology of Scott's life and work, full explanatory notes, and a glossary of Scots words. About the Series: For over 100 years Oxford World's Classics has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

A sensualist who composed erotic and playful love poetry in his youth, he was raised a Catholic but later became one of the most admired Protestant preachers of his time. The Selected Poems reflects this wide diversity, and includes his youthful Songs and Sonnets, epigrams, elegies, letters, satires, and the profoundly moving Divine Poems composed towards the end of his life. From joyful poems such as 'The Flea', which transforms the image of a louse into something marvellous, to the intimate and intense Holy Sonnets, Donne breathed new vigour into poetry by drawing lucid and often startling metaphors from the world in which he lived. His poems remain among the most passionate, profound and spiritual in the English language.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NoNpm6MYtUEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Goats (True Books: Animals)","description":"Photo-packed series explores the stories and science behind animal sanctuaries.

Wise old goat Lucia knows everything about the farm sanctuary and its residents -- from the weeping willow tree with the best leaves to nibble on, to which goats are snugglers and which like their space, to the differences between goats and sheep (note: there are many! Start with the eyes!). Lucia is a member of what the farm staff calls the Underfoot Family. It's a group of more than fifty animals - goat, sheep, chickens, ducks, and even a pig - who have free reign of the farm. While the staff works hard to rescue, recover, rehabilitate and release all of the farm animals who come to the sanctuary, not every animal will leave -- Lucia is one who will spend the rest of her days in the comfort of the sanctuary, watching babies be born, new friends come and go, and welcoming a new group of campers every summer with a warm heart and a gentle head butt.

Because few plants grow there, it's easy to get the impression that Texas beaches consist mostly of barren sand while just the opposite is true. Beyond the dunes grow an amazing variety and abundance of native plants. Many of them, like Indian Blanket, Goldenrod, and Seaside Gerardia, produce great splashes of flowering color. Others display more modest flowers or are interesting for their growing habits. In all, over seven hundred species of flowering plants grow on Texas beaches and islands. This handy field guide will aid you in identifying some 275 common and/or noteworthy flowering plants of the Texas beaches and islands from the Rio Grande to the Louisiana border. Each plant is illustrated by a color photograph, accompanied by a description of its appearance, habitat, and blooming time. The plants are grouped by families, which in turn are arranged according to relationships and similarities for easy reference. An introduction to beach habitats and plant life, references for further reading, and a glossary of terms make this book fully useful for everyone who wants a good, general understanding of beach plant life and wildflowers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pYldAQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Baltimore's Own Little Italy Artist: the Artwork of Tony DeSales","description":"This is an inspirational story of a man who expressed his artistic talents and who put relationships before all other pursuits.

Unlike before, this flowering has the distinct character of African agency, energy and engagement. Philanthropy is no longer about narratives of passive, poor and miserable Africans receiving help from rich, fortunate and often Western outsiders. The emerging narratives about philanthropy in Africa are about an increasingly confident and knowledgeable assertion of African capacities to give not only to help but also to transform and seek to address the root causes of injustice, want, ignorance and disease. The narratives are also about the increasing questioning of the role and place of Africans in the world s philanthropic traditions and what constitutes African specificities but also African differences and varieties. This book is about African philanthropic experiences, their varieties, challenges and opportunities. It is about documenting, investigating, describing, questioning and reflecting on philanthropy in Africa. Because Africa is not a monolithic entity with one single history, cultural, political and economic experience, this ground-breaking book rightly tackles the varied modes, forms, vehicles and means in which the philanthropic experiences are expressed in Africa. It is a pioneering and ambitious effort in a field and community of practice that is new both in terms of scholarship and in professional practice. Many of the chapters boldly engage the burden of reflections, questions, ambivalences and ambiguities that one often finds in an emerging field, innovatively positing the outlines, concepts, frameworks and theories of scholarship and practice for a field critical to development on the continent.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=U3QTEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fort Ancient Cultural Dynamics in the Middle Ohio Valley (Monographs in World Archaeology)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UCDjAAAAMAAJ&dq=Fort+Ancient+Cultural+Dynamics+in+the+Middle+Ohio+Valley+(Monographs+in+World+Archaeology)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Liability For Negligence And Judicial Discretion -","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CJA6AQAAIAAJ&dq=Liability+For+Negligence+And+Judicial+Discretion+-&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Life of the Mind: Volume One, Thinking","description":"Discusses the nature of thought and volition, examines past philosophical theories, and clarifies the relation between will and freedom","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ukaFNFR9fGIC&dq=The+Life+of+the+Mind:+Volume+One,+Thinking&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Vegetarian Mother's Cookbook: Whole Foods To Nourish Pregnant And Breastfeeding Women - And Their Families","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Sold for a Farthing","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WZUJPQAACAAJ&dq=Sold+for+a+Farthing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Letters to God and Other Poems That Touch the Heart","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dg_7PAAACAAJ&dq=Letters+to+God+and+Other+Poems+That+Touch+the+Heart&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Story Of England","description":"The village of Kibworth in Leicestershire lies at the very centre of England.

Merchants from predominantly Hamburg and Bremen established direct trade relations with these islands in the late 15th century, and managed to control the international trade with Iceland, the Faroes and Shetland for much of the 16th century. However, the Hanseatic commercial infrastructure was absent in the North Atlantic, which forced these merchants to develop new trade strategies. Besides a critical re-evaluation of the economic and political conditions, this volume offers a comprehensive study of the organisation of the trade and the methods used to establish and maintain networks between islanders and German merchants. Moreover, it analyses the role and socio-economic position of the communities of merchants with the North Atlantic in their home towns. The book shows that the North Atlantic trade was anything but insignificant. It was a dynamic and integral part of the trade network of the northern German cities, and its study is highly relevant for the economic history of Northern Europe.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xrH8DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Goal to Go: The Spiritual Lessons of Football","description":"A discussion of the Christian faith which draws on the imagery and metaphors of football.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YRoMAAAACAAJ&dq=Goal+to+Go:+The+Spiritual+Lessons+of+Football&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The short life of Sophie Scholl","description":"The biography of the twenty-one year-old German student who was put to death for her anti-Nazi activities with the underground group called the White Rose.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LGV5QgAACAAJ&dq=The+short+life+of+Sophie+Scholl&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gentleman's Agreement","description":"When a reporter pretends to be Jewish, he experiences anti-Semitism firsthand in the New York Times bestseller and basis for the Academy Awardwinning film.

Combining specially-commissioned photographs of models with historical and contemporary works of art and her own dynamic life drawing, she leads us inside the human body to map its skeleton, muscle groups, and body systems. Detailed line drawings superimposed over photographs reveal the links between what the body looks like and its internal construction. Six drawing classes show how to observe different parts of the body - from top to toe - and give expert guidance on how to draw them. Inspirational master classes on famous works, ranging from a Michelangelo study to a Degas painting, show how artists have depicted the human body over the centuries. Each master class includes a photograph of a model holding the same pose as in the painting, to highlight details of anatomy and show how the artist has interpreted them. Understanding anatomy is the key to drawing the human body successfully. As well as being the perfect reference, Anatomy for the Artist will inspire you to find a model, reach for your pencil, and start drawing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9QrxxwEACAAJ&dq=Art+anatomy,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Roads to Geometry (3rd Edition)","description":"Now available from Waveland Press, the Third Edition of Roads to Geometry is appropriate for several kinds of students. Pre-service teachers of geometry are provided with a thorough yet accessible treatment of plane geometry in a historical context.

By using the SMSG postulate set as a basis for the development of plane geometry, the authors avoid the pitfalls of many  foundations of geometry  texts that encumber the reader with such a detailed development of preliminary results that many other substantive and elegant results are inaccessible in a one-semester course. At the end of each section is an ample collection of exercises of varying difficulty that provides problems that both extend and clarify results of that section, as well as problems that apply those results. At the end of chapters 37, a summary list of the new definitions and theorems of each chapter is included.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7kTsCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"From Brains to Consciousness?

Naipaul gives us an eloquent, candid, wide-ranging narrative that delves into the sometimes inadvertent process of creative and intellectual assimilation. Born in Trinidad of Indian descent, a resident of England for his entire adult life, and a prodigious traveller, Nobel Laureate V. S. Naipaul has always faced the challenges of  fitting one civilisation to another.  In A Writer s People, he discusses the writers to whom he was exposed early on, Derek Walcott, Flaubert and his own father among them; how Anthony Powell and Francis Wyndham influenced his first encounters with literary culture; what we have retainedand forgottenof the world portrayed in Caesar s The Gallic War and Virgil s Aeneid; how the writings of Gandhi, Nehru and other Indian writers both reveal and conceal the authors and their nation. And he brings the same scrutiny to bear on his own life: his years in Trinidad; the gaps in his family history; the  private India  kept alive through story, ritual, religion and culture; his ever-evolving reaction to the more complicated and demanding true India he would encounter for the first time when he was thirty. Part meditation, part remembrance, as elegant as it is revelatory, A Writer s People allows us privileged insightfull of incident, humour and feelinginto the mind of one of our greatest writers.  He brings to non-fiction an extraordinary capacity for making art out of lucid thought. . . . I can no longer imagine the world without Naipaul s writing.

The House of Islam could very well be his magnum opus.  -Reza Aslan, #1 New York Times bestselling author of Zealot  This should be compulsory reading.  -Peter Frankopan, author of the international bestseller The Silk Roads Today, Islam is to many in the West an alien force, with Muslims held in suspicion. Failure to grasp the inner workings of religion and geopolitics has haunted American foreign policy for decades and has been decisive in the new administration's controversial orders. The intricacies and shadings must be understood by the West not only to build a stronger, more harmonious relationship between the two cultures, but also for greater accuracy in predictions as to how current crises, such as the growth of ISIS, will develop and from where the next might emerge. The House of Islam addresses key questions and points of disconnection. What are the roots of the conflict between Sunni and Shi'a Muslims that is engulfing Pakistan and the Middle East? Does the Koran encourage the killing of infidels? The book thoughtfully explores the events and issues that have come from and contributed to the broadening gulf between Islam and the West, from the United States' overthrow of Iran's first democratically elected leader to the emergence of ISIS, from the declaration of a fatwa on Salman Rushdie to the attack on the offices of Charlie Hebdo. Authoritative and engaging, Ed Husain leads us clearly and carefully through the nuances of Islam and its people, taking us back to basics to contend that the Muslim world need not be a stranger to the West, nor our enemy, but our peaceable allies.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-KVPDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I'm Becoming My Mother","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=U8paAAAAMAAJ&dq=I%27m+Becoming+My+Mother&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Land to Call Home (Red River of the North #3)","description":"First the Land, Then Fire Nearly Destroys Them.

Their writings reflect the surprisingly diverse experiences of blacks on both sides of the Atlantic-America, Britain, the West Indies, and Africa-between 1760 and 1798. Letters, poems, captivity narratives, petitions, criminal autobiographies, economic treatises, travel accounts, and antislavery arguments were produced during a time of various and changing political and religious loyalties. Although the theme of liberation from physical or spiritual captivity runs throughout the collection, freedom also clearly led to hardship and disappointment for a number of these authors. Briton Hammon, James Albert Ukawsaw Gronniosaw, John Marrant, Ignatius Sancho, Ottobah Cugoano, and Olaudah Equiano told their stories as Afro-Britons who recognized the sovereignty of George III; Johnson Green, Belinda, Benjamin Banneker, and Venture Smith spoke and wrote as African Americans n the United States; Phillis Wheatley, initially an Afro-British poet, later chose an African American identity; Francis Williams and George Liele wrote in Jamaica; David George and Boston King, having served with the British forces in the American Revolution and later lived in Canada, composed their narratives as British subjects in the newly established settlement in Sierra Leone, Africa. In his introduction, Carretta reconstructs the historical and cultural context of the works, emphasizing the constraints of the eighteenth-century genres under which these authors wrote. The texts and annotations are based on extensive research in both published and manuscript holdings of archives in the United States and the United Kingdom. Appropriate for undergraduates as well as for scholars, Unchained Voices gives a clear sense of the major literary and cultural issues at the heart of African literature written in English.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=55l3l8aHwJAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Men of Extreme Action","description":"Big egos.

Gullickson analyzes the representations of women who were part of the insurrection known as the Paris Commune. The uprising and its bloody suppression by the French army is still one of the most hotly debated episodes in modern history. Especially controversial was the role played by women, whose prominent place among the Communards shocked many commentators and spawned the legend of the p troleuses, women who were accused of burning the city during the battle that ended the Commune. In the midst of the turmoil that shook Paris, the media distinguished women for their cruelty and rage. The Paris-Journal, for example, raved: \\"Madness seems to possess them; one sees them, their hair down like furies, throwing boiling oil, furniture, paving stones, on the soldiers.\\" Gullickson explores the significance of the images created by journalists, memoirists, and political commentators, and elaborated by latter-day historians and political thinkers. The p troleuse is the most notorious figure to emerge from the Commune, but the literature depicts the Communardes in other guises, too: the innocent victim, the scandalous orator, the Amazon warrior, and the ministering angel, among others. Gullickson argues that these caricatures played an important role in conveying and evoking moral condemnation of the Commune. More important, they reveal the gender conceptualizations that structured, limited, and assigned meaning to women as political actors for the balance of the nineteenth and well into the twentieth century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UlhuDwAAQBAJ&dq=Unruly+Women+of+Paris:+Images+of+the+Commune&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Caesar: Invasion of Britain","description":"In this landmark study, an amateur historian tackles the unanswered questions surrounding Julius Caesar s time in Britain. Two thousand years ago, Julius Caesar came, saw, and conquered southern Britain, but exactly where he landed and the precise routes his army marched through the south of the country have never been firmly established. Numerous sites have been suggested for the Roman landings of 55 B.C. and 54 B.C., yet remarkably, the exact locations of the first major events in recorded British history remain undiscovered until now. After years of careful analysis, Roger Nolan has painstakingly traced not only the places where the Romans landed, but he has also discovered four temporary marching camps Caesar s army built as it drove up from the south coast in pursuit of the British tribal leader, Cassivellaunus. This advance took Caesar across the Thames to Cassivellaunus s stronghold at Wheathampstead in present-day Hertfordshire. These marching camps are placed almost equidistant from each other and, most importantly, are in a straight line between the coast and Wheathampstead. Roger Nolan s research has also enabled him to identify the place mentioned in Caesar s Commentaries, where the Roman legions were ambushed by the British while foraging and where a large battle then ensued the first known land battle in Britain. Without doubt, this groundbreaking study is certain to prompt much discussion and reappraisal of this fascinating subject.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gk8IEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"BRM: The Saga of British Racing Motors: Volume 3: Monocoque V8 Cars 1963-1969","description":"The extraordinary Saga of the BRM Formula 1 racing team has previously been related in exhaustive detail in the first two Volumes of the author s remarkable history of this legendary marque.

The entire drama is related in painstaking and enormously revealing detail - warts and all - supported by contemporary internal reports, private correspondence and often hilarious first-person recollections and anecdotes from team members, including numerous team mechanics and engineers, in addition to Tony Rudd, Graham Hill and Sir Jackie Stewart.

David would have had it no other way.\\"--Ta-Nehisi Coates, bestselling author of Between the World and Me NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY GLAMOUR AND MARIE CLAIRE Dad: What will set you apart is not talent but will and a certain kind of humility. A willingness to let the world show you things that you play back as you grow as an artist. Talent is cheap. Me: OK I will ponder these things. I am a Carr. Dad: That should matter quite a bit, actually not the name but the guts of what that name means. A celebrated journalist, bestselling author (The Night of the Gun), and recovering addict, David Carr was in the prime of his career when he suffered a fatal collapse in the newsroom of The New York Times in 2015. Shattered by his death, his daughter Erin Lee Carr, at age twenty-seven an up-and-coming documentary filmmaker, began combing through the entirety of their shared correspondence--1,936 items in total--in search of comfort and support. What started as an exercise in grief quickly grew into an active investigation: Did her father's writings contain the answers to the question of how to move forward in life and work without her biggest champion by her side? How could she fill the space left behind by a man who had come to embody journalistic integrity, rigor, and hard reporting, whose mentorship meant everything not just to her but to the many who served alongside him? All That You Leave Behind is a poignant coming-of-age story that offers a raw and honest glimpse into the multilayered relationship between a daughter and a father. Through this lens, Erin comes to understand her own workplace missteps, existential crises, and relationship fails. While daughter and father bond over their mutual addictions and challenges with sobriety, it is their powerful sense of work and family that comes to ultimately define them. This unique combination of Erin Lee Carr's earnest prose and her father's meaningful words offers a compelling read that shows us what it means to be vulnerable and lost, supported and found. It is a window into love, with all of its fierceness and frustrations. \\"Thank you, Erin, for this beautiful book.

This section explores the vast variety of pathology such as TBI, PTSD, suicide, affective disorder, addiction, spiritual distress, and forensic aspects of combat trauma.

Based on extensive archival research and unpublished materials, The ArchitectureofPaul Rudolph is the first in-depth study of the architect, neglected since his postwar zenith. Author Timothy M. Rohan unearths the ideas that informed Rudolph s architecture, from his Florida beach houses of the 1940s to his concrete buildings of the 1960s to his lesser-known East Asian skyscrapers of the 1990s. Situating Rudolph within the architectural discourse of his day, Rohan shows how Rudolph countered the perceived monotony of mid-century modernism with a dramatically expressive architecture for postwar America, exemplified by his Yale Art and Architecture Building of 1963, famously clad in corrugated concrete. The fascinating story of Rudolph s spectacular rise and fall considerably deepens longstanding conceptions about postwar architecture: Rudolph emerges as a pivotal figure who anticipated new directions for architecture, ranging from postmodernism to sustainability.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MkmPAwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Architecture+of+Paul+Rudolph&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Morning and evening thoughts","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=g9YVAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mallet Control for the Xylophone (Marimba, Vibraphone, Vibraharp)","description":"This new and re-engraved edition of George Lawrence Stone's Mallet Control applies Stone's famous Stick Control techniques to all varieties of mallet instruments.

To Christians it is the Holy Land where Jesus Christ -- the messiah or anointed one -- was born, preached, and offered himself as the ultimate sacrifice. Under the Greeks and Romans, it was the province of Judea, a name which hearkened back to the biblical kingdom of Judah. After the Bar-Kokhba revolt ended in 135 C.E., Hadrian renamed the province Syria-Palestina, reviving the memory of the long-vanished kingdom of Philistia. Under early Islamic rule the military district (jund) of Filastin was part of the province of Greater Syria (Arabic Bilad al-Sham).

More than a Catholic paternalist, Harmel created a model 'earthly paradise' for his workers, drawing on principles of utopian socialism to give labor control over the factory environment. Harmel's effort to lay the groundwork for class conciliation drew praise even from leading Socialists, and his legacy continues in the contemporary world. Coffey's extraordinary synthesis of scholarly works on social, gender, and labor history is as impressive as her original archival research, making this book an important resource for any historian of France or of social issues.

But he chose darkness and immortality when his wife betrayed him with his king. He killed them both, and fled the realms of Men and now cares nothing for their fates. A thousand years passed. His only allegiance is to his master, the dark god Satoris, who gave the gift of Life to the race of Men. Satoris, who rebelled against his elder brother God Haomane who had demanded that gift be taken away. Their fight cracked the very world in two; the name of Satoris became the word for evil throughout all the races, while the legend of Tanaros is the seminal tale of treachery. And yet not all tales told are true. A final prophecy has begun to unfold, and the races are uniting in their quest to rid the world of Satoris. The elder gods and goddesses, stranded on the other side of the world, send dreams to spur all to destroy Satoris and Tanaros, but those loyal to their god know a different side of the story and try to defend their citadel of Darkhaven, where Satoris sits in sorrow, controlling his own dominion, seeking neither victory nor vengeance. Satoris's followers capture the beautiful Elvish princess Cerelinde, and without her the Allies cannot fulfill the prophecy. All who support Satoris clamor for her death-but Satoris refuses to act like the monster that he is made out to be, for he recognizes in Cerelinde a spark of the love that he once bore for his fellow gods. She is a great danger to Satoris--and a greater danger for Tanaros and all that he holds dear. For she reminds him that not all women need be false... and that though he may be immune to death, his heart is still very much mortal. Strong storytelling with evocative, compelling, and unforgettable characters, Godslayer is the thrilling conclusion to the events begun in Banewreaker, a haunting tale of love and loss that ultimately asks the question: If all that is considered good considers you evil, are you?

Parents are fearful of letting their children play in their own yards and elderly people are afraid to leave their homes. The bogeyman in this rampant panic about crime is the young black male, who, in the media and public image, is a ?superpredator? lurking on every street corner ready to attack any prey that is vulnerable. But is crime in America really as bad as the public has been made to believe?Power, Politics, and Crime argues that the current panic over crime has been manufactured by the media, law enforcement bureaucracies, and the private prison industry. It shows how the definition of criminal behavior systematically singles out the inner-city African American. But urban minorities aren't the only victims. Although crime rates have been declining for 25 years, vast amounts of money pour into the criminal justice-industrial complex, diverting scarce resources from other social services such as education, social welfare, and health care. While in recent years downsizing has affected almost every segment of the public sector, the criminal justice bureaucracies have seen an unprecedented expansion.Through ethnographic observations, analysis of census data, and historical research, William Chambliss describes what is happening, why it has come about, and what can be done about it. He explores the genesis of crime as a political issue, and the effect that crime policies have had on different segments of the population. The book is more than a statement about the politics of crime and punishment?it's a powerful indictment of contemporary law enforcement practices in the United States.In addition to updating the data the author has added a discussion of the \\"declining crime rate.\\" Contrary to presentations in the media and by law enforcement agencies, the rate has been declining for over 25 years and therefore cannot be attributed to any \\"get tough on crime\\" policies so dear to the hearts of prosecutors and politicians. Chapter Seven, \\"Crime Myths and Smokescreens\\" has been completely revised and updated. Updates include a discussion of the recent scandal in the Los Angeles Police Department which has resulted in criminal charges against police officers and the release of numerous convicted felons because of falsified evidence and testimony on the part of police officers. The attack on Louima in the police station in New York as well as the shooting of Diallo are discussed in some detail as well as other recent exposures of police brutality and corruption. The sections on white collar, corporate, and state crimes have been updated and recent examples added to the text.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=x75aDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pap's place: A two-act play about family and change (A Lillenas drama resource)","description":"Decades of research have demonstrated that the parent-child dyad and the environment of the familya\\"which includes all primary caregiversa\\"are at the foundation of children's well- being and healthy development. From birth, children are learning and rely on parents and the other caregivers in their lives to protect and care for them. The impact of parents may never be greater than during the earliest years of life, when a child's brain is rapidly developing and when nearly all of her or his experiences are created and shaped by parents and the family environment. Parents help children build and refine their knowledge and skills, charting a trajectory for their health and well-being during childhood and beyond. The experience of parenting also impacts parents themselves. For instance, parenting can enrich and give focus to parents' lives; generate stress or calm; and create any number of emotions, including feelings of happiness, sadness, fulfillment, and anger. Parenting of young children today takes place in the context of significant ongoing developments. These include: a rapidly growing body of science on early childhood, increases in funding for programs and services for families, changing demographics of the U.S. population, and greater diversity of family structure. Additionally, parenting is increasingly being shaped by technology and increased access to information about parenting. Parenting Matters identifies parenting knowledge, attitudes, and practices associated with positive developmental outcomes in children ages 0-8; universal/preventive and targeted strategies used in a variety of settings that have been effective with parents of young children and that support the identified knowledge, attitudes, and practices; and barriers to and facilitators for parents' use of practices that lead to healthy child outcomes as well as their participation in effective programs and services. This report makes recommendations directed at an array of stakeholders, for promoting the wide-scale adoption of effective programs and services for parents and on areas that warrant further research to inform policy and practice. It is meant to serve as a roadmap for the future of parenting policy, research, and practice in the United States.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FA8MDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Ideology of Conduct: Essays on Literature and the History of Sexuality (Essays in Literature and Society)","description":"In The Ideology of Conduct, first published in 1987, scholars from various fields, from the medieval period to the present day, discuss literature in which the sole purpose is to instruct women in how to make themselves desirable. This collection investigates how middle-class writers who had long emulated the behaviour of the aristocracy began to criticise that behaviour by formulating an alternative object of desire. They did so without appearing to breed political controversy because it seemed to concern only the female. But writing for and about women in fact became a powerful instrument of hegemony as it introduced a whole new vocabulary for social relations, induced certain forms of economic behaviour as desirable in men and women respectively, and insured the reproduction of the nuclear family. It is argued, therefore, that the literature of conduct not only recorded but also assisted the production of our contemporary gender-based culture.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=h1PXAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Living Like Indians: A Treasury of North American Indian Crafts, Games and Activities (Native American)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Case of the Sulky Girl (Pocket Book)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bEyytwEACAAJ&dq=The+Case+of+the+Sulky+Girl+(Pocket+Book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Revenge of the Manitou","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QzEnPwAACAAJ&dq=Revenge+of+the+Manitou&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Boys' First Book of Radio and Electronics","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=r7hSnwEACAAJ&dq=The+Boys%27+First+Book+of+Radio+and+Electronics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bathrooms (California Designs)","description":"A complete guide for renovating bathrooms, including decorating techhiques, color schemes, architecture, contracting, and tips on lighting, storage, and accessories","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Z05SSkzxtksC&dq=Bathrooms+(California+Designs)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Clueless in Marketing Communications","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RFcoAQAACAAJ&dq=Clueless+in+Marketing+Communications&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Laughing Gas","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_LfPAAAAMAAJ&dq=Laughing+Gas&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Am I Old Yet?: A True Story of a Timeless Friendship","description":"Am I Old Yet? is the true story of two women, fifty years apart, who find themselves in a place in their lives they never thought they'd be and in a friendship they never dreamed they'd know.

What begins for Leah as a reluctant agreement to spend one hour a week with Adele at the California Chateau evolves into hundreds of hours.

Classical historians will not entertain any connection between the two, because this infers that the Israelite leaders were actually pharaohs of Egypt. However, Ralph Ellis has taken this obvious comparison and demonstrated the royal Egyptian ancestry of the Judaic patriarchs and also of Jesus. Ralph has also uncovered evidence for the New Testament Saul (St Paul) in the historical record, a discovery that brings with it several new accounts of the life of Jesus. Saul, the inventor of Christianity, was actually Josephus Flavius, a well-known historian. Jesus was the governor of Tiberias and owned a castle there; and he may have died during the siege of Jerusalem in about AD70, rather than AD 33. This is the first book in this \\"Egyptian Testament\\" series. This book followed by: Egyptian Testament Series - 'Tempest & Exodus' or King Jesus Trilogy - 'Cleopatra to Christ'.

White  migr s contributed politically, financially, militarily, and ideologically to National Socialism. This work refutes the notion that Nazism developed as a peculiarly German phenomenon: it arose primarily from the cooperation between v?lkisch (nationalist/racist) Germans and vengeful White  migr s. From 19201923, Adolf Hitler collaborated with a conspiratorial far right German-White  migr  organization, Aufbau (Reconstruction). Aufbau allied with Nazis to overthrow the German government and Bolshevik rule through terrorism and military-paramilitary schemes. This organization's warnings of the monstrous 'Jewish Bolshevik' peril helped to inspire Hitler to launch an invasion of the Soviet Union and to initiate the mass murder of European Jews. This book uses extensive archival materials from Germany and Russia, including recently declassified documents, and will prove invaluable reading for anyone interested in the international roots of National Socialism.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GeOR5LbOQwsC&dq=The+Russian+Roots+of+Nazism:+White&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eskimo Medicine Man","description":"\\"Eskimo Medicine Man\\" is a record of primitive Alaskan life in the 1930's. It records the experiences in Alaska's remote areas of Dr. Otto George, the last \\"traveling physician\\" for the Department of Interior's Indian Service, when in all the territory (an area one-fifth that of the contiguous United States) there were fewer than sixty thousand persons. This book deals with the Eskimos of the Bering Sea, along the coast of the Artic Ocean, the areas of the Kuskokwim rivershed, and of the lower Yukon. The notes from Dr. George's eight diaries furnish the materials for this volume, documenting the time, the peoples and their ancient way of life. The photographs used to illustrate the book are those taken by Dr. George and developed by him, often with water from the silt-laden Kuskokwim River or melted snow. Some of the incidents Dr. George relates concern the difficulties of traveling to, from, or over Alaska; of finding groceries, even at great cost; and of dealing with the natives' superstitious acceptance of tuberculosis. Dr. George details his fight against that disease and includes his impressions and thoughts during a stay along the Bering Sea with villagers who were free of tuberculosis because they still practiced the ancient ways of building new winter homes each fall, letting spring floods wipe out dirt and germs.

Who can write it? asked John Adams in 1815. Renowned scholars Henry Steele Commager and Richard B.

The Spirit of 'Seventy-Six allows readers to experience events long-entombed in textbooks as they unfold for the first time for both Loyalists and Patriots: the Boston Tea Party, Bunker Hill, the Declaration of Independence, and more. In letters, journals, diaries, official documents, and personal recollections, the timeless figures of the Revolution emerge in all their human splendor and folly to stand beside the nameless soldiers. Profusely illustrated and enhanced by cogent commentary, this book examines every aspect of the war, including the Loyalist and British views; treason and prison escapes; songs and ballads; the home front and diplomacy abroad.

And Other Lies That Are True","description":"Expanding upon his solo comedy show-hailed by the San Francisco Bay Times as \\"a funny, incisive, one-man journey to enlightenment\\"- comedian Mike Dugan explores the obstacles to achieving romantic love and intimacy in our current culture of drive-by relationships and push-button porn. It's Man vs. his Sex Drive in a winner-take-all cage match The title of the book answers the question, \\"Why do women fake orgasm?\\" But Mike Dugan asks us to consider that perhaps foreplay is much more than what a man does in the moments before intercourse. What begins as a simple attempt to \\"figure women out\\" quickly shifts into a humorous and insightful tour of a man's psyche as he considers the influences that shape a man's character. In a book jammed with the kind of wry comic twists that have earned him an Emmy Award and appearances on the Tonight Show, Dugan takes an unflinching look at men's experiences with trust, responsibility, intimacy, commitment, masculinity, role models, shock jocks, cheating, street-corner sex education, and, especially, relationships with women. He reveals devastatingly accurate secrets about the male thought process that some men might be happier kept quiet-all punctuated with spot-on humor. It's also quite likely you'll be taken by surprise more than once. Ultimately what Dugan discovers in this wise, witty, and thought-provoking book is that, \\"I didn't have to figure out women in order to be happy. It was never about finding the right woman.

The first part of the text outlines the main concepts of NLP and explains how to identify a person s preferred channel. It also looks briefly at the significance of learning styles. Part II examines each representational channel in turn and relates it to the corresponding training methods and materials. The final chapter provides ways of combining the channels so as to maximize the transfer of learning. The text is enlivened throughout by anecdotes, examples and illustrations. For teachers, trainers, managers and indeed anyone faced with the need to communicate in a professional way, Sally Dimmick s guide will prove invaluable.

Indeed, he was to fly no fewer than 55 individual German aircraft types, ranging from such exotic creations as the push-and-pull Dornier Do 335 and the remarkable little Heinkel He 162 Volksjager to the highly innovative combat types that were entering the inventory of the Luftwaffe shortly before the demise of Germany's Third Reich. 'Winkle' Brown also interrogated many of the leading German wartime aviation personalities, such as Willy Messerschmitt, Ernst Heinkel, Kurt Tank, and Hanna Reitsch. From his unique knowledge of German aviation, 'Winkle' Brown has selected the most important and most promising aircraft employed by the Luftwaffe and those evolved for that air arm in Germany during World War II--the true wings of the Luftwaffe. He describes their background and characteristics, and together with more than 200 photographs, color profiles, and sectional drawings provides an in-depth assessment of the contribution made to the annals of military aviation in the late 1930s and early 1940s by an aircraft industry that proved itself truly second to none in ingenuity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IGJGSwAACAAJ&dq=German+Aircraft+of+WWII&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Soldier's Return: A Novel","description":"Right from the start, when the train carrying British soldier Sam Richardson home to Wigton after his service in the Burma campaign breaks down two miles from town and he and his army comrades have to walk home, it is clear we are in the hands of a compassionate, clear-sighted writer. Bragg's work has been compared to that of Hardy and D.H. Lawrence, not without some justice. His smalltown people are closely and warmly observed, but without a shred of sentimentality, and although this story is familiar a man home from a dehumanizing war finds it hard to readjust it has seldom been imbued with such rueful humanity. For Sam, England after WWII, and after the sufferings he and his men endured in the frightful jungle campaigns, is stuffy and limiting; soon he starts dreaming of wider horizons. His adored wife, Ellen, however, is happily rooted in the little northern town where she grew up; their small son, Joe, who has hardly known his father, is bewitched but also terrified of him. How the family works out its fate in the shabby postwar years is Braggs story, and he makes of it something at once endearing and heroic. So many scenes, the regimental reunion, Joe's efforts to win friends among the tough town kids, a final scene at a railway station as heartrending as the movie Brief Encounter, linger in the mind. The book is a small classic, deeply touching and true.

It was a battle in which at least 700,000 men fell, along a front of fifteen miles. Its aim was less to defeat the enemy than bleed him to death and a battleground whose once fertile terrain is even now a haunted wilderness. Alistair Horne's classic work, continuously in print for over fifty years, is a profoundly moving, sympathetic study of the battle and the men who fought there. It shows that Verdun is a key to understanding the First World War to the minds of those who waged it, the traditions that bound them and the world that gave them the opportunity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Hqde_Ay7hDkC&dq=The+Price+of+Glory+(Battletech,+No+8)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The crisis","description":"The Crisis, founded by W.E.B.

Each chapter is organized around familiar issues that characterize schools and classrooms with diverse student populations and explores these issues through new lenses that most teachers have not previously encountered. *Social Constructivist Perspective. Critical theory, discourse theory, and historical perspective are introduced in order to sensitize readers to the need to recognize negative, socially sustained patterns that hamper literacy achievement and replace them with positive patterns.

He discovers that neither place is the \\"land of milk and honey\\" he had dreamt of. His experiences and observations during his travels dampen his hope for the black race, which he views as not only failing to trust itself, but also reposing blind trust in the white race and in the Christian religion of meekness and forgiveness: misplaced trust that has enabled the aggressive and the \\"strong\\" to perpetually dominate the black race. Oheneba comes to the scathing determination that the white race is a ruthless, bloodthirsty race, quick to give charity but not justice, a race that is never satisfied, that relentlessly pursues positions of command, glory and wealth of every kind, even if it means colonizing and enslaving other races and declaring them personal property. Yet, Oheneba concedes that he has reached his current station in life partly due to the benevolence of the white race. As much as he tries to hate white people for their greedy and wanton destruction of his race, hate is a feeling very difficult for him to adopt. Oheneba cannot bring himself to apply the word \\"racist\\" to whites, partly because he has had worse experiences at the hands of his fellow blacks. In the end, Oheneba concludes that despite the many sins in white America's past and the flaws in its present, they share with him a common humanity that is evident just below the surface. Oheneba wonders, rather boldly, whether his own life story provides evidence that white America, for all its atrocious and evil deeds, may possess a paradoxical goodness. In order for black people to find their places in mainstream America, much depends upon the generosity of white Americans. And to the extent that many white Americans of past and present are decent, fighting for black people's equal rights and access to mainstream America, sometimes even helping black folks to get ahead of their fellow whites, this paradoxical goodness is evident. Ironically, it is the very attributes of the social systems that Oheneba was running away from that ultimately became his grace: e collective culture or the \\"it-takes-the-village-to-raise-a-child\\" approach to life. Oheneba loathed this culture because he felt it created comfort and security for the African and resulted in the suppression of individual responsibility and accountability.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EQkdDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Creole Mutiny: a Tale of Revolt aboard a Slave Ship.(Book Review): An article from: Journal of Southern History","description":"Tells the little-known story of the 1841 insurrection aboard the slave ship Creole as it transported slaves from Richmond, Virginia to New Orleans.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6D92AAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Creole+Mutiny:+a+Tale+of+Revolt+aboard+a+Slave+Ship.(Book+Review):+An+article+from:+Journal+of+Southern+History&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Quiet Talks on Prayer","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DAc3AAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Father (Signet)","description":"This book explores the role of wax as an important conceptual material used to work out the nature and limits of the early modern human.

But already people are asking: \\"what comes next?\\" Likewise almost every large organization is heavily involved in e-commerce and turning their organizations into e-businesses. At the moment most e-commerce is focused on selling traditional products and services through the new medium of the Internet. However, the more an organization evolves into an e-business, the more they can exploit knowledge flows between themselves and their marketplace. This book draws together the two strands of knowledge and e-business into the emerging field that this book has called k-business. A k-business is one that turns an organization's knowledge assets into knowledge products and services and uses the Internet to market and deliver them online. Despite its newness, the Delphi Group have forecast that within 5 years person-to-person information e-commerce (a major aspect of k-business) will be a $5 billion business leveraging $50 billion in sales of other products and services. Capitalizing on Knowledge aims to give professionals and managers early insights into how to develop successful k-businesses. It takes a critical and balanced view of the building blocks of a k-business including knowledge productizing, e-commerce enablers and Internet marketing. It draws on lessons from successes and failures in the dot.com landscape and of the early pioneers of knowledge markets. The writing style engenders interest and readability supported by diagrams, screen images, check lists and frameworks. There are 'points to ponder' to stimulate thinking and decision-making. Five case studies and over 50 illustrative examples provide insights into the application of the book's concepts. No other book brings all the elements of a k-business together in one place to provide a thought provoking yet practical companion for those who want to capitalize on their knowledge.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=l6IABAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Reason and Revolution: Hegel and the Rise of Social Theory","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RZDZAAAAMAAJ&dq=Reason+and+Revolution:+Hegel+and+the+Rise+of+Social+Theory&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chesapeake Rainbow","description":"Rhyming text identifies items of every color of the rainbow found in or near the Chesapeake Bay.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HjMIAAAACAAJ&dq=Chesapeake+Rainbow&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Instincts of the herd in peace and war","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4L4YAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Red Heart of Memories","description":"Two lonely people with extraordinary powers--Edmund Reynolds, a wandering witch who helps those in need, and Matilda Black, an empathic \\"witness\\" to the inner dreams of people--embark on a journey into the imagination together, exploring the darkest secrets of the past.

Our mission is to gather in one place, for the English-speaking public, all relevant information needed to make the Qur'an more understandable and easier to study. This book tries to do this by providing the following: 1. The Arabic Text for those who are able to read Arabic 2. Transliteration of the Arabic text for those who are unable to read the Arabic script. This will give them a sample of the sound of the Qur'an, which they could not otherwise comprehend from reading the English meaning. 3. The meaning of the qur'an (translated by Dr. Muhammad Taqi-ud-Din Al-Hilali, Ph.D. and Dr. Muhammad Muhsin Khan) 4. Background introductions by two famous Islamic scholars, Maududi and Ibn Kathir 5. Explanation (abridged Tafsir) by Ibn Kathir (translated by Safi-ur-Rahman al-Mubarakpuri) We hope that by doing this an ordinary English-speaker will be able to pick up a copy of this book and study and comprehend The Glorious Qur'an in a way that is acceptable to the understanding of the Rightly-guided Muslim Ummah (Community).","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=k8kH-dzOKFIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sastun: My Apprenticeship with a Maya Healer","description":"The compelling drama of American herbologist Rosita Arvigo's quest to preserve the knowledge of Don Elijio Panti, one of the last surviving and most respected traditional healers in the rainforest of Belize.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SiKVAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Fragrant Flower","description":"In the loveless household of General Sir Frederick and Lady Emily Osmund and their empty-headed twin daughters, begrudgingly adopted niece Azalea is little more than a wallflower.

Moltmann rejects the traditional approach, which focuses on the End, an apocalyptic finale, as a kind of Christian search for the \\"final solution.\\" He centers instead on hope and God's promise of new creation for all things. \\"Christian eschatology,\\" he says, \\"is the remembered hope of the raising of the crucified Christ, so it talks about beginning afresh in the deadly end.\\" Yet Moltmann's novel framework, deeply informed by Jewish and messianic thought, also fosters rich and creative insights into the perennially nettling questions of eschatology: Are there eternal life and personal identity after death? How is one to think of heaven, hell, and purgatory? What are the historical and cosmological dimensions of Christian hope? What are its social and political implications. In a heartbreakingly fragile and fragment world, Moltmann's comprehensive eschatology surveys the Christian vista, bravely envisioning our \\"horizons of expectation\\" for personal, social, even cosmic transformation in God.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OtyDgOLxfvIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nantucket Borders","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xMWbAAAACAAJ&dq=Nantucket+Borders&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Woman, Thou Art Loosed!

Out of a space that is at once southern and urban, violent and beautiful, racially-charged and working-class, she attempts to transcend her social and economic circumstances. Across the collection, Priest writes a horse that acts as a metaphysical engine of flight, showing us how to throw off the harness and sustain wildness. Unlike the traditional Bildungsroman, Priest presents a non-linear narrative in which the speaker lacks the freedom to come of age naively in the urban South, and must instead, from the beginning, possess the wisdom of  the horses & their restless minds.

Based upon surviving transcripts of her dreams and on the voluminous records of her trial before the Inquisition, Lucrecia's Dreams traces the complex personal and political ramifications of Lucrecia's prophetic career. This hitherto unexamined episode in Spanish history sheds new light on the history of women as well as on the history of dream interpretation. Charlatan or clairvoyant, sinner or saint, Lucrecia was transformed by her dreams into a cause cel bre, the rebellious counterpart to that other extraordinary woman of Golden Age Spain, St. Theresa of Jesus. Her supporters viewed her as a divinely inspired seer who exposed the personal and political shortcomings of Philip II of Spain. In examining the relation of dreams and prophecy to politics, Richard Kagan pays particular attention to the activities of the streetcorner prophets and female seers who formed the political underworld of sixteenth-century Spain.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FbcwDwAAQBAJ&dq=Lucrecia%27s+Dreams:+Politics+and+Prophecy+in+Sixteenth-Century+Spain&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"French Foreign Legion Operations 1990-2000 Europa Military Special #15","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=j8MPAQAAMAAJ&dq=French+Foreign+Legion+Operations+1990-2000+Europa+Military+Special&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beauty and the Beast","description":"Experience the world's most enchanting and timeless love story-retold with a dark and realistic twist.

To this day, it continues to shape the heart, soul, and minds of individuals, generations, and societies worldwide.

David H. Price reveals how dozens of activist anthropologists were publicly and privately persecuted during the Red Scares of the 1940s and 1950s. He shows that it was not Communist Party membership or Marxist beliefs that attracted the most intense scrutiny from the fbi and congressional committees but rather social activism, particularly for racial justice. Demonstrating that the fbi s focus on anthropologists lessened as activist work and Marxist analysis in the field tapered off, Price argues that the impact of McCarthyism on anthropology extended far beyond the lives of those who lost their jobs. Its messages of fear and censorship had a pervasive chilling effect on anthropological investigation. As critiques that might attract government attention were abandoned, scholarship was curtailed. Price draws on extensive archival research including correspondence, oral histories, published sources, court hearings, and more than 30,000 pages of fbi and government memorandums released to him under the Freedom of Information Act. He describes government monitoring of activism and leftist thought on college campuses, the surveillance of specific anthropologists, and the disturbing failure of the academic community including the American Anthropological Association to challenge the witch hunts. Today the  war on terror  is invoked to license the government s renewed monitoring of academic work, and it is increasingly difficult for researchers to access government documents, as Price reveals in the appendix describing his wrangling with Freedom of Information Act requests. A disquieting chronicle of censorship and its consequences in the past, Threatening Anthropology is an impassioned cautionary tale for the present.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SNJz07yln9YC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Columbus and the world around him","description":"Describes the voyages of Columbus, the terrible impact of the Spaniards on the Indians, and the ultimate cultural influence of the Native Americans on their white conquerors.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5UbhAAAAMAAJ&dq=Columbus+and+the+world+around+him&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Message from the Pleiades: The Contact Notes of Eduard Billy Meier, 1st Limited Edition","description":"The case of Eduard Billy Meier has gained worldwide attention for his claims of being in on-going contact with aliens from the star cluster known as the Pleiades. Purported to be the most documented UFO account of all time, Meier has taken 1,000 photographs and 12 motion picture films of the visiting spacecraft. Through thousands of pages of contact notes, Meier has passed on the wisdom and advanced technical knowledge from his conversations with these aliens, designed to help guide our evolution. In addition, it is claimed that 40 independent eyewitnesses have also seen the alien ships and observed Meier's contacts with them. The aliens also left numerous landing tracks in the ground, and gave Meier various rock, metal, mineral, and crystal samples as proof of their visitations.Korff conducted the most thorough examination ever into the case of Billy Meier and all its alleged evidence, and reveals here how a one-armed, handicapped Swiss farmer hatched and continues to maintain the most elaborate UFO hoax in history.The story is interesting, valuable and worth reading. -The American RationalistKorff's background information on Meier is fascinating . . . -Small Press. . .useful and definitive book. -Fate","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JDszAu42uOwC&dq=Message+from+the+Pleiades:+The+Contact+Notes+of+Eduard+Billy+Meier,+1st+Limited+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Very Special Valentine","description":"Join little Bunny Gray as he sets out to find the perfect gift for his special friend, Rosie.

Not only is it a religious ritual filled with blessings for the millions who make the journey annually, but it is also a social, political, and commercial experience that for centuries has set in motion a flood of travelers across the world's continents. Whatever its outcome--spiritual enrichment, cultural exchange, financial gain or ruin--the road to Mecca has long been an exhilarating human adventure. By collecting the firsthand accounts of these travelers and shaping their experiences into a richly detailed narrative, F. E. Peters here provides an unparalleled literary history of the central ritual of Islam from its remote pre-Islamic origins to the end of the Hashimite Kingdom of the Hijaz in 1926.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=p8QIEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Complete Illustrated Guide to Reflexology: Therapeutic Foot Massage for Health and Wellbeing (Complete Guide)","description":"\\"Along with natural remedies for common foot problems, author Stephanie Tourles explains foot physiology for the layperson and provides exercises for stretching and strengthening feet, massage techniques for foot relaxation and restoration, and reflexology\\"--","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=V0MqEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Complete+Illustrated+Guide+to+Reflexology:+Therapeutic+Foot+Massage+for+Health+and+Wellbeing+(Complete+Guide)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"SimProject Player's Manual and Access Code","description":"With the rapid rise of computers and advanced technology in the classroom have come new pedagogical approaches to teaching. One of the most powerful of these approaches is the use of computer simulations to demonstrate  real world  business practices, the inter-relatedness of various business functions, and the role of competitive decision-making in business. Computer simulations encourage team development, collaboration, global thinking, and a predilection to consider the ramifications of decisions and their effect on the bottom line in other words, many of the skills that are useful to project managers and team members in business.The purpose of this simulation is to tie together many of the salient challenges of project management in order to give students the deepest possible understanding of the complexities involved in undertaking a project. The goal of the simulation will be to have students manage a project from initiation to completion. Within this framework the student will need to employ and develop skills pertinent to personnel selection and training, motivation, conflict management, and stakeholder management. Students will be required to use planning and scheduling techniques, such as work breakdown structures, PERT/CPM, scope development, and risk analysis.The topical coverage will have approximate coincidence with the Project Management Institute s Body of Knowledge (PMBOK), insuring that the students gain exposure to those topics recognized by the key professional organization for project manager.Although perfectly useful as a stand-alone piece of software, this simulation can be bundled with either of any project management books, discounting both bundled items. An especially attractive option is to bundle it with the Second Edition of Project Management: The Managerial Process by Gray and Larson. Great pains were taken to coordinate the revision of this book with the development of Pinto and Parente s simulation. One of the four scenarios used in the simulation has been cast in the form of a continuing case used in the book, thus making a tie in between the book and the simulation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9xjUMgEACAAJ&dq=SimProject+Player%27s+Manual+and+Access+Code&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"TrainSmart: Perfect Trainings Every Time","description":"Facilitate highly successful staff development sessions with new brain-friendly strategies, 25 key concepts for training smarter, sample schedules and planning templates, and recommendations for incorporating current technology.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tvr94gm_gQkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Designing Identity: Graphic Design as a Business Strategy","description":"How to land, work with & retain large clients from a designer's perspective.

Counterfeit Money (v. 1)","description":"Is giving possible? Is it possible to give without immediately entering into a circle of exchange that turns the gift into a debt to be returned? This question leads Jacques Derrida to make out an irresolvable paradox at what seems the most fundamental level of the gift's meaning: for the gift to be received as a gift, it must not appear as such, since its mere appearance as gift puts it in the cycle of repayment and debt. Derrida reads the relation of time to gift through a number of texts: Heidegger's Time and Being, Mauss's The Gift, as well as essays by Benveniste and Levi-Strauss that assume Mauss's legacy. It is, however, a short tale by Baudelaire, \\"Counterfeit Money,\\" that guides Derrida's analyses throughout. At stake in his reading of the tale, to which the second half of this book is devoted, are the conditions of gift and forgiveness as essentially bound up with the movement of dissemination, a concept that Derrida has been working out for many years. For both readers of Baudelaire and students of literary theory, this work will prove indispensable.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2Y5KbWiM6l8C&dq=Given+Time:+I.+Counterfeit+Money+(v.+1)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sudden Spirit: A Book of Holy Moments","description":"Sudden Spirit traces the presence of holy moments in everyday life, giving voice to the small awakenings that are often overlooked in the hurried course of a day.

Immunology is a complex science, which requires a simplified approach in order to be taught and understood effectively. This book is based on the authors  long experience in teaching undergraduate, postgraduate students and interns both basic and clinical immunology. Reviewing a variety of important components related to the immune system, it is clearly and logically structured, and enriched by figures, tables and boxes with important immunology definitions.

Rood analyses the techniques through which Thucydides' narrative explains the origin and course of the Peloponnesian War and exposes harsh truths about how individuals and states behave. Rood concentrates on how the use of techniques, such as selectivity, interaction of speech and narrative, and manipulation of time and perspective, points at one level to general human constraints, at another to the self-destructiveness ofAthens' imperial power. The book explores some techniques that have received little attention and offers new ways of reading others; it gives new insight into Thucydides' sophistication and the way he relates to his predecessors. It is also important for its attempts to refute views that Thucydides' History is made up of different compositional strata or inspired by pro-Athenian bias. And it addresses directly the way modern historians use Thucydides, contributes to the contemporary debate over narrative history, and shows the value of applying some of the concepts of recent narrative theory to historical texts.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zjOqPwAACAAJ&dq=Thucydides:+Narrative+and+Explanation+(Oxford+Classical+Monographs)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sarah (Canaan Trilogy, Book 1)","description":"Born into a world of luxury in the ancient Sumerian city of Ur, Sarah flees the arranged marriage planned by her father, a decision that leads to an encounter with Abram, a member of a nomadic tribe of outsiders, with whom she is reunited many years later in her exalted position as high priestess of the goddess Ishtar.

At its center, James P. Duffy relates the story of the sinking of the British liner Laconia by the German U-boat U-156. On September 12, 1942, as Laconia sailed crowded with 1,800 Italian prisoners of war, 103 Polish soldiers, 286 mostly severely wounded British military personnel, 80 civilians, and 463 officers and crew, she was hit by two torpedoes fired by U-156. Laconia s captain ordered the vessel abandoned, and within an hour, she sank. Perhaps surprisingly, the German U-boat then surfaced and sent a signal that brought two other U-boats, an Italian submarine, and three Vichy French warships to assist with rescue operations. The rescue operation by German ships and the subsequent bombing raid by Allied aircraft are both compelling stories and events that had major repercussions for the conduct of the war. In the wake of the incident, German admiral Karl D?nitz issued instructions known as the Laconia Order demanding that all attempts to rescue survivors from Allied merchant ships be ended. The order provoked an international outcry against inhumane treatment of survivors stranded at sea. After the war, D?nitz was charged with and acquitted of war crimes in connection with this order.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=628pDwAAQBAJ&dq=Wolfpacks+At+War:+The+U-Boat+Experience+in+World+War+II&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fifty Famous People (Illustrated book of short stories)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ooluDwAAQBAJ&dq=Fifty+Famous+People+(Illustrated+book+of+short+stories)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Science of Correct Thinking: Logic","description":"First published in 1935, the author of this book has attempted to treat the most fundamental department of philosophy logic by combining the advantages of both textbooks and monographs, and by avoiding undue complication and technicality.

Douglass offers a detailed portrait of Pancake's short life, examining the varied circumstances and emotional forces that led to the writer's suicide and exploring Pancake's influence on contemporary fiction generally and Appalachian writing in particular.Drawing on notebooks, letters, and manuscripts left by Pancake as well as numerous conversations and interviews with family, friends, and others, Douglass has recreated the key events of the young artist's life: his West Virginia childhood, his romantic losses, his education as a writer at the University of Virginia, and the acceptance of his work by the East Coast literary establishment. Through analysis of the story fragments reproduced in this volume, including The Conqueror and Shouting Victory, Douglass illustrates the recurring themes -- such as fear of failure and the inability to escape disaster -- that Pancake expressed so eloquently in his work, and he shows their origins in the writer's own personal history.Douglass examines the degree to which Pancake drew on his memories of life in Appalachia and discusses Pancake's influence on other Appalachian writers such as Pinckney Benedict. Douglass argues that Pancake's posthumous collection, The Stories of Breece D'J Pancake, brought a renewed interest inregional writing to the national literary scene. A Room Forever brings to life the artistic sensibility and inner turmoil of a legendary figure in contemporary southern letters.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FNfcjTmXmm8C&dq=A+Room+Forever:+The+Life,+Work+and+Letters+of+Breece+D%27J+Pancake&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The history of violence in America: Historical and comparative perspectives,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XDliswEACAAJ&dq=The+history+of+violence+in+America:+Historical+and+comparative+perspectives,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Raising Cain ... and His Sisters (Halo Hattie's Boarding House)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Fractal Geometry and Stochastics (Progress in Probability)","description":"Over the last fifteen years fractal geometry has established itself as a substantial mathematical theory in its own right.

A courier for a network of radical groups committed to terrorist activity throughout Europe, he had defected to the enemy and in the hands of Mossad and the CIA had become the single most effective weapon in their counterterrorist operations. Then he disappeared. Cadging meals and sleeping in flophouses, Pascual has shed his past in the teeming portside alleys of Barcelona s Gothic Quarter. While he has begun to find something like peace of mind, the man who broke the covert world of international terrorism wide open cannot entirely escape his memories. Alcohol can help him forget, but it can t banish the shadow of Katixa, the one terrorist agent he did not betray and whom he has no hope of ever seeing again. Or so he thinks. Like a nova exploding in Pascual s cosmos, Katixa bursts back into his life. On the run from both the police and a terrorist band of Basque nationalists from whom she s appropriated a suitcase full of kidnapping cash, Katixa arrives with five million francs, a one-way ticket out of Spain, and a plan that includes Pascual. And when Katixa professes her love for him, Pascual s better judgment doesn t stand a chance. To save Katixa s life and perhaps redeem his own, Pascual dusts off his old professional skills in the perilous arts of subterfuge and deceit. Again, the lying has begun, with the crying and dying yet to come.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=H4zhAwAAQBAJ&dq=Lying+Crying+Dying&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Best-Loved Poems of the Lds People","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WucMAAAACAAJ&dq=Best-Loved+Poems+of+the+Lds+People&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Manitou","description":"Manitou Springs was founded in 1871 as a picturesque health resort nestled at the foot of Pikes Peak.

Slight and self-deprecating, balding and bearded, he wears a wool suit, not buckskins and chaps. He dons a bowler, not a Stetson. Faith and family, not firepower, are his best defense against the dangers of the frontier. With a gun molded from Hanukkah gelt, he foils a bullying bigot; trying to do a mitzvah on Rosh Hashanah, he rescues an innocent Indian from a lynch mob. And with a crock of chicken soup as his only weapon, he prevents a drunk from ventilating a Sephardic Jew from San Francisco, even thought he is lording it over Pliskin. As one fellow Jew notes of Secondhand Sol: \\"For such a small man, he sure sits tall in the saddle.\\" People of all beliefs can discover and enjoy universal themes in his adventures.

None of them were published by The Times--until now. UNSEEN uncovers these never-before published photographs and tells the stories behind them. It all started with Times photo editor Darcy Eveleigh discovering dozens of these photographs. She and three colleagues, Dana Canedy, Damien Cave and Rachel L. Swarns, began exploring the history behind them, and subsequently chronicling them in a series entitled Unpublished Black History, that ran in print and online editions of The Times in February 2016. It garnered 1.7 million views on The Times website and thousands of comments from readers. This book includes those photographs and many more, among them: a 27-year-old Jesse Jackson leading an anti-discrimination rally of in Chicago, Rosa Parks arriving at a Montgomery Courthouse in Alabama a candid behind-the-scenes shot of Aretha Franklin backstage at the Apollo Theater, Ralph Ellison on the streets of his Manhattan neighborhood, the firebombed home of Malcolm X, Myrlie Evans and her children at the funeral of her slain husband , Medgar, a wheelchair-bound Roy Campanella at the razing of Ebbets Field. Were the photos--or the people in them--not deemed newsworthy enough? Did the images not arrive in time for publication? Were they pushed aside by words at an institution long known as the Gray Lady? Eveleigh, Canedy, Cave, and Swarms explore all these questions and more in this one-of-a-kind book.

No Kansas, 1854-1861. Before there was Bull Run or Gettysburg, there was Black Jack and Osawatomie. Long before events at Fort Sumter ignited the War Between the States, men fought and died on the Prairies of Kansas over the incendiary issue of slavery.  War to the knife and knife to the hilt,  cried the Atchison Squatter Sovereign.   Let the watchword be  Extermination, total and complete.   In 1854 a shooting war developed between proslavery men in Missouri and free-staters in Kansas over control of the territory. The prize was whether it would be a slave or free state when admitted to the Union, a question that could decide the balance of power in Washington. Told in the unforgettable words of the men and women involved, War to the Knife is an absorbing account of a bloody episode soon spread east, events in  Bleeding Kansas  have largely been forgotten. But as historian Thomas Goodrich reveals in this compelling saga, what America s  first civil war  lacked in numbers it more than made up for in ferocity. War to the Knife is a riveting story of blood, fire, and death. It is also a story with an impressive cast of characters: Robert E Lee, William Tecumseh Sherman, Sara Robinson, Jeb Stuart, Abraham Lincoln, Horace Greeley, Julia Lovejoy, William F. Cody.

Teenage girls now have immense physical power--they can cause agonizing pain and even death. And, with this small twist of nature, the world drastically resets. From award-winning author Naomi Alderman, THE POWER is speculative fiction at its most ambitious and provocative, at once taking us on a thrilling journey to an alternate reality, and exposing our own world in bold and surprising ways.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xS_eDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Skye;: The island & its legends","description":"Features tales of monsters who dwell in lakes, of small people who trap humans in earthen mounds where time stands still; of dark, shape- shifting spirits whose cloak of human form is betrayed by the sand and shells which fall from their hair.

Santana J. Roja is just that madman. Set in the lush rain forest of Honduras and the storm revenged Caribbean Sea, Bravo TWO Sierra follows the lives of Roja and his band of cutthroat, Satan worshiping pirates, and the crew of the USS MASSASOIT (ATF-167) an old fleet tug whose counting down the hours before she's sent to the razor blade pile.The opening chapter is a flash back which sets the premise of the novel: absolute revenge destroys all. With the selling of Carmella Roja into a life of prostitution and drug abuse by her village priest, Santana Roja grows up a child of the alleys and whorehouses of Puerto Cortez. Shunned by the powerful Catholic church for his illegitimacy, Santana swears faith to the arcane teachings of Satanism. Soon he is in control of the port city's vibrant black market. Now he is in a position to exact revenge on the men responsible for his mother's death, and the man whom he blames for his station in life.Tension is sustained through the individual sailing and port calls of the American salvage crew and Roja's gang of black marketeers. Atmosphere is derived from the ocean and the weather they encounter. The final confrontation between father and son is as explosive as the hurricane that slams a Haitian gunrunner's ship aground in the Straits of Florida.Bravo TWO Sierra captures all the flavor of serving on a small command mixed with such a realistic scenario, that you'd think was yesterday's headline news.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cHortKwRAbEC&dq=Bravo+Two+Sierra&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Secret Gardens Notecards","description":"Tumble down the rabbit hole and find yourself in an inky black-and-white wonderland.

Just as Asian imports changed England's tastes and enriched the English language, Eastern themes, characters, and motifs helped shape the country's culture and contributed to its national identity. Questioning long-standing dichotomies between East and West and embracing a capacious understanding of translatio as geographic movement, linquistic transformation, and cultural grafting, the collection gives pride of place to convergence, approximation, and hybridity, thus underscoring the radical mobility of early modern culture. In so doing, England's Asian Renaissance also moves away from entrenched narratives of Western cultural sovereignty to think anew England's debts to Asia.

The answer hinges on the meaning of myth which is a special way of telling a story to show how God gets His point across to man. So myth is truth, but truth that is not dependent on facts to undergird it. Myths in the Bible tells the truth about God and man in the struggle of life. Myth is God's Hand reaching out to man. It is man trying to get a hold on God's Hand.

Few of them were to survive the five long years of bitter struggle.??A posting to the Eastern Front during the Second World War was rightly regarded with dread by the German soldiers. They were faced by the unremitting hostility of the climate, the people and even, at times, their own leadership. They saw epic battles such as Stalingrad and Kursk, and yet it was a daily war of attrition which ultimately proved fatal for Hitler's ambition and the German military machine. ??In this classic account leading military historian James Lucas examines different aspects of the fighting, from war in the trenches to a bicycle-mounted anti-tank unit fighting against the oncoming Russian hordes. Told through the experiences of the German soldiers who endured these nightmarish years of warfare, War on the Eastern Front is a unique record of this cataclysmic campaign.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lTB1CQAAQBAJ&dq=War+on+the+Eastern+Front+1941-1945.+the+German+Soldier+in+Russia&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The United States; Conquering a Continent, Volume I (Best Value Series) (Best Value, Volume I)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dTIH0GCgYrgC&dq=The+United+States%3B+Conquering+a+Continent,+Volume+I+(Best+Value+Series)+(Best+Value,+Volume+I)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Erebus","description":"Driven by a passion for travel and history and a love of ships and the sea, former Monty Python stalwart and beloved television globe-trotter Michael Palin explores the world of HMS Erebus, last seen on an ill-fated voyage to chart the Northwest Passage. Michael Palin brings the fascinating story of the Erebus and its occupants to life, from its construction as a bomb vessel in 1826 through the flagship years of James Clark Ross s Antarctic expedition and finally to Sir John Franklin s quest for the holy grail of navigation a route through the Northwest Passage, where the ship disappeared into the depths of the sea for more than 150 years. It was rediscovered under the arctic waters in 2014. Palin travels across the world from Tasmania to the Falkland Islands and the Canadian Arctic to offer a firsthand account of the terrain and conditions that would have confronted the Erebus and her doomed final crew. Delving into the research, he describes the intertwined careers of the two men who shared the ship s journeys: Ross, the organizational genius who mapped much of the Antarctic coastline and oversaw some of the earliest scientific experiments to be conducted there; and Franklin, who, at the age of sixty and after a checkered career, commanded the ship on its last disastrous venture. Expertly researched and illustrated with maps, photographs, paintings, and engravings, Erebus is an evocative account of two journeys: one successful and forgotten, the other tragic yet unforgettable.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gLByDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In the Keep of Time","description":"British children on holiday enter a ruined tower and are whisked back in time.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YX0BkAEACAAJ&dq=In+the+Keep+of+Time&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Second Moon (Keepers of the Maser)","description":"Tegneserie.

Taylor, Tile Heritage Foundation) Ernest Batchelder's ceramic tilemaking enterprise began as a modest backyard venture in rural Pasadena, California but quickly grew to national prominence. In 1908 this enterprising young man left a prestigious teaching position to start his own school and factory, with the goal of establishing a West Coast guild of craftspeople. By 1930 the Batchelder-Wilson Company had showrooms in Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, and San Francisco, as well as representation in virtually every major city in the United States. New York, Minneapolis, and Vancouver hosted major Batchelder architectural ceramic installations. Batchelder remained the preeminent leader of handmade tiles in the West until the Depression forced the closure of his operations in 1932. His clients ranged from restaurants to churches to high rise office buildings, although perhaps the most striking installations remain the many fireplaces gracing modest American bungalows throughout the country.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IltQAAAAMAAJ&dq=Batchelder+Tilemaker&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Field Instruction: A Guide for Social Work Students (5th Edition)","description":"This text bridges the gap by offering learning activities that can be worked in both settings.

Altsheler)","description":"Joseph Alexander Altsheler (April 29, 1862 - June 5, 1919) was an American newspaper reporter, editor and author of popular juvenile historical fiction. He was a prolific writer, and produced fifty-one novels and at least fifty-three short stories. Thirty-two of his novels were part of his seven series: The Civil War Series (8 volumes)The French and Indian War Series (6 volumes)The Gold Series (2 volumes)The Great West Series (2 volumes)The Texan Series (3 volumes)The World War Series (3 volumes)The Young Trailers Series (8 volumes)Although each of the thirty-two novels constitutes an independent story, Altsheler suggested a reading order for each series (i.e., he numbered the volumes). The remaining nineteen novels can be read in any order. [Note, however, that A Knight of Philadelphia was later expanded through the addition of nineteen chapters and some minor tweaks to become Mr. Altsheler's novel In Hostile Red.]The short stories, of course, can be read in any order. However, some readers might prefer to read them in the order in which they were published. The short story list below is displayed in chronological order with the publication dates shown alongside the titles.Early life and educationAltsheler was born in Three Springs, Hart County, Kentucky, to Joseph and Louise (n e Snoddy) Altsheler. He attended Liberty College in Glasgow, Kentucky, before entering Vanderbilt University.CareerIn 1885, he took a job at the Louisville Courier-Journal as a reporter and later worked as an editor. He started working for the New York World in 1892, first as the paper's Hawaiian correspondent and then as the editor of the World's tri-weekly magazine. Due to a lack of suitable stories, he began writing children's stories for the magazine.Personal lifeAltsheler married Sarah Boles on May 30, 1888; they had one son, Sidney.Altsheler and his family were in Germany in 1914 when World War I began, and they were forced to remain in Germany for a time. The hardships the Altshelers endured in returning to the U.S. damaged Altsheler's health and rendered him a semi-invalid until his death. Upon returning to the U.S., he wrote The World War Series of books based on his ordeal.DeathAltsheler died in New York City on June 5, 1919, aged 57; his obituary appeared in The Evening World, on June 6, 1919. His widow, Sarah, died 30 years later. Both are buried at the Cave Hill Cemetery in Louisville, Kentucky.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SUVcwQEACAAJ&dq=The+sun+of+Quebec:+A+story+of+a+great+crisis+(The+French+and+Indian+War+series+/+by+Joseph+A.+Altsheler)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Lady On My Left","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_pLjswEACAAJ&dq=The+Lady+On+My+Left&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Universal History of Computing: From the Abacus to the Quantum Computer","description":"Traces computing from the development of the abacus, through the invention of the binary system, the introduction of mechanical and electronic computers, and projections of quantum computers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tnhQAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Universal+History+of+Computing:+From+the+Abacus+to+the+Quantum+Computer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Romans","description":"Paul was the most influential figure in the early Christian church.

David would have had it no other way.\\"--Ta-Nehisi Coates, bestselling author of Between the World and Me NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY GLAMOUR AND MARIE CLAIRE Dad: What will set you apart is not talent but will and a certain kind of humility. A willingness to let the world show you things that you play back as you grow as an artist. Talent is cheap. Me: OK I will ponder these things. I am a Carr. Dad: That should matter quite a bit, actually not the name but the guts of what that name means. A celebrated journalist, bestselling author (The Night of the Gun), and recovering addict, David Carr was in the prime of his career when he suffered a fatal collapse in the newsroom of The New York Times in 2015. Shattered by his death, his daughter Erin Lee Carr, at age twenty-seven an up-and-coming documentary filmmaker, began combing through the entirety of their shared correspondence--1,936 items in total--in search of comfort and support. What started as an exercise in grief quickly grew into an active investigation: Did her father's writings contain the answers to the question of how to move forward in life and work without her biggest champion by her side? How could she fill the space left behind by a man who had come to embody journalistic integrity, rigor, and hard reporting, whose mentorship meant everything not just to her but to the many who served alongside him? All That You Leave Behind is a poignant coming-of-age story that offers a raw and honest glimpse into the multilayered relationship between a daughter and a father. Through this lens, Erin comes to understand her own workplace missteps, existential crises, and relationship fails. While daughter and father bond over their mutual addictions and challenges with sobriety, it is their powerful sense of work and family that comes to ultimately define them. This unique combination of Erin Lee Carr's earnest prose and her father's meaningful words offers a compelling read that shows us what it means to be vulnerable and lost, supported and found. It is a window into love, with all of its fierceness and frustrations. \\"Thank you, Erin, for this beautiful book.
