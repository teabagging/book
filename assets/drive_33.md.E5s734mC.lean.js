For many years, domestic humor was written primarily by females; significant contributions from male writers began as times and family structures changed. It remains timeless because of its basis on the relationships between husbands and wives, parents and children, houses and inhabitants, pets and their owners, chores and their doers, and neighbors. This work is a historical and literary survey of humorists who wrote about home. It begins with a chapter on the social context of and attitudes toward traditional domestic roles and housewives. The following chapters, beginning with the 1920s and continuing through today, cover the different time periods and the foremost American domestic humorists, and the humor written by surrogate parents, grown children about their childhood families, husbands, and Canadian and English writers. Also covered are the differences among various writers toward traditional domestic roles--some, like Erma Bombeck and Judith Viorst, embraced them, while others, like Caryl Kristenson and Marilyn Kentz, resisted them. Common themes, such as the isolation and competitiveness of housework, home as an idealized metaphysical goal and ongoing physical challenge, and the urban, suburban, and rural life, are also explored.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0uXHiJ3lkWIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Deutsch Direkt Beginning (45659)(Wkbk ed.)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UJsB0MDdrVoC&dq=Deutsch+Direkt+Beginning+(45659)(Wkbk+ed.)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cowboys Have Always Been My Heroes: The Definitive Oral History of America's Team","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BuylAAAACAAJ&dq=Cowboys+Have+Always+Been+My+Heroes:+The+Definitive+Oral+History+of+America%27s+Team&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The secret service of the Confederate States in Europe: Or, How the Confederate cruisers were equipped ([19th century Amer. lit. & hist.

Beyond this, the book presents the personal testimonies of twenty-nine people whose lives have been to some degree shaped by stuttering-stories of humor and heartbreak, acceptance and rejection, and the ability of an individual to define and achieve his or her own standard of success. These experiences powerfully illustrate that we humans are all very different from each other, and also very much the same. \\"Stuttering cannot be completely understood unless personal experiences are taken into account.

The Guardian Gleaned from Rainer Maria Rilke s voluminous, never-before-translated letters to bereaved friends and acquaintances, The Dark Interval is a profound vision of the mourning process and a meditation on death s place in our lives. Following the format of Letters to a Young Poet, this book arranges Rilke s letters into an uninterrupted sequence, showcasing the full range of the great author s thoughts on death and dying, as well as his sensitive and moving expressions of consolation and condolence.

O. Wilson Literary Science Writing Award The gripping story of the most important overlooked commodity in the world--sand--and the crucial role it plays in our lives. After water and air, sand is the natural resource that we consume more than any other--even more than oil. Every concrete building and paved road on Earth, every computer screen and silicon chip, is made from sand. From Egypt's pyramids to the Hubble telescope, from the world's tallest skyscraper to the sidewalk below it, from Chartres' stained-glass windows to your iPhone, sand shelters us, empowers us, engages us, and inspires us. It's the ingredient that makes possible our cities, our science, our lives--and our future. And, incredibly, we're running out of it. The World in a Grain is the compelling true story of the hugely important and diminishing natural resource that grows more essential every day, and of the people who mine it, sell it, build with it--and sometimes, even kill for it. It's also a provocative examination of the serious human and environmental costs incurred by our dependence on sand, which has received little public attention. Not all sand is created equal: Some of the easiest sand to get to is the least useful. Award-winning journalist Vince Beiser delves deep into this world, taking readers on a journey across the globe, from the United States to remote corners of India, China, and Dubai to explain why sand is so crucial to modern life. Along the way, readers encounter world-changing innovators, island-building entrepreneurs, desert fighters, and murderous sand pirates. The result is an entertaining and eye-opening work, one that is both unexpected and involving, rippling with fascinating detail and filled with surprising characters.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=opyhDwAAQBAJ&dq=To+See+a+World+in+a+Grain+of+Sand&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"biggles in the Orient","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UsWfuQAACAAJ&dq=biggles+in+the+Orient&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"ABAP/4: Programming the SAP(R) R/3(R) System","description":"Many of the introductory SAP books currently on the market provide only a brief overview of ABAP.

Two brothers, Arthur and Jake Dunn, are the sons of a farmer in the mid-1930s, when life is tough and another world war is looming. Arthur is reticent, solid, dutiful and set to inherit the farm and his father s character; Jake is younger, attractive, mercurial and dangerous to know  the family misfit. When a beautiful young woman comes into the community, the fragile balance of sibling rivalry tips over the edge. Then there is Ian, the family s next generation, and far too sure he knows the difference between right and wrong. By now it is the fifties, and the world has changed  a little, but not enough. These two generations in the small town of Struan, Ontario, are tragically interlocked, linked by fate and community but separated by a war which devours its young men  its unimaginable horror reaching right into the heart of this remote corner of an empire. With her astonishing ability to turn the ratchet of tension slowly and delicately, Lawson builds their story to a shocking climax. Taut with apprehension, surprising us with moments of tenderness and humour, The Other Side of the Bridge is a compelling, humane and vividly evoked novel with an irresistible emotional undertow. Arthur found himself staring down at the knife embedded in his foot. There was a surreal split second before the blood started to well up and then up it came, dark and thick as syrup. Arthur looked at Jake and saw that he was staring at the knife. His expression was one of surprise, and this was something that Arthur wondered about later too. Was Jake surprised because he had never considered the possibility that he might be a less than perfect shot? Did he have that much confidence in himself, that little self-doubt? Or was he merely surprised at how easy it was to give in to an impulse, and carry through the thought which lay in your mind? Simply to do whatever you wanted to do, and damn the consequences. from The Other Side of the Bridge","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=F5AltCsxFfEC&dq=The+Path+On+The+Other+Side+Of+The+Bridge&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Path To Discovery Book IV of The Collection Archangel Michael Speaks","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Marilyn Monroe as The Girl;: the candid picture-story of the making of \\"The seven year itch.\\" (Ballantine books)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oOiNHAAACAAJ&dq=Marilyn+Monroe+as+The+Girl%3B:+the+candid+picture-story+of+the+making+of+%22The+seven+year+itch.%22+(Ballantine+books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"On a Roll: A Conversation and Listening Text","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BYDusgEACAAJ&dq=On+a+Roll:+A+Conversation+and+Listening+Text&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Principles of Electronic Warfare","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cR3SAAAAMAAJ&dq=Principles+of+Electronic+Warfare&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Regional atmospheric transport code for Hanford emission tracking (RATCHET)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pis2PwAACAAJ&dq=Regional+atmospheric+transport+code+for+Hanford+emission+tracking+(RATCHET)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ellery Queen's Eyewitnesses (Curley Large Print Books)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=56j8OAAACAAJ&dq=Ellery+Queen%27s+Eyewitnesses+(Curley+Large+Print+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cruising Guide to Lake Champlain: The Waterway from New York City to Montreal","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aLgGAAAACAAJ&dq=Cruising+Guide+to+Lake+Champlain:+The+Waterway+from+New+York+City+to+Montreal&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Revelations","description":"The final book of the Bible, Revelation prophesies the ultimate judgement of mankind in a series of allegorical visions, grisly images and numerological predictions.

On 28 January 1547, the sickly and obese King Henry VIII died at Whitehall. Just hours before his passing, his last will and testament had been read, stamped, and sealed. The will confirmed the line of succession as Edward, Mary, and Elizabeth; and, following them, the Grey and Suffolk families. It also listed bequests to the king's most trusted councillors and servants. Henry's will is one of the most intriguing and contested documents in British history. Historians have disagreed over its intended meaning, its authenticity and validity, and the circumstances of its creation. As well as examining the background to the drafting of the will and describing Henry's last days, Suzannah Lipscomb offers her own illuminating interpretation of one of the most significant constitutional documents of the Tudor period. Illustrated with portraits of the key figures at Henry's court, The King is Dead is as boldly evocative as it is beautiful a work of Tudor history to cherish.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=m5P-CwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Complete Car Cost Guide 1999","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fMcCAAAACAAJ&dq=Complete+Car+Cost+Guide+1999&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Empire of Dreams and Miracles: The Phobos Science Fiction Anthology (v. 1)","description":"A shark swims through a kitchen.

For all its length--the fight lasted just two minutes--it remains one of the most memorable events in boxing history and, indeed, one of the most significant sporting events ever. In this superb account, Lewis A.Erenberg offers a vivid portrait of Joe Louis, Max Schmeling, their individual careers, and their two epic fights, shedding light on what these fighters represented to their nations, and why their second bout took on such international importance. Erenberg shows how after Schmeling's dramatic win in his first fight with Lewis he instantly became a German national hero and an unwilling symbol for white supremacists, leading the second fight to be viewed by many as a symbolic match between Nazism and American democracy. Erenberg discusseshow Louis' dramatic first-round victory was a devastating blow to Hitler, who turned on Schmeling and, during the war, had the boxer (then serving as a paratrooper) sent on a series of dangerous missions. Louis, meanwhile, went from being a hero of his race--\\"Our Joe\\"--to the first black championembraced by all Americans. Here then is a stirring and insightful account of one of the great moments in boxing history, a confrontation that provided global theater on an epic scale.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=M7Q1DwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Greatest+Fight+of+Our+Generation:+Louis+vs.+Schmeling&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Catch a Falling Spy","description":"U.S. and British agents scramble to help a mad Russian scientist defect, knowing he may have knowledge of U.S. military secrets.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-PxdJAAACAAJ&dq=Catch+a+Falling+Spy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Look at a Colt","description":"During the first week of his life a young quarter horse enjoys his freedom to run in the mountains while anticipating what the future has in store for him.

Sherkin Island pirates kidnap him for ransom, his boat is claimed as wreckage by the beachcombers of Connemara, and he receives an ecstatic welcome from Fungi, the Dingle Dolphin.

Published five years later, it opens unforgettably with Bronowski's description of Nagasaki in 1945: 'a bare waste of ashes', making him acutely aware of science's power both for good and for evil. After such knowledge, what forgiveness? With care and erudition Bronowski argues that scientific endeavour is an essentially creative act, part of a great shared human interest in ourselves and the world around us; and, routinely, a process of trial-and-error, the end of which is not - cannot be - preordained. 'Above all, Bronowski strove to make science and technology answerable to social progress, to 'human values.' He anticipated the deepening gap between the 'two cultures' and knew that the sciences must be restored to a place in political common sense.'

The new edition is the first ever thoroughly revised and expanded edition of this standard text. Among the new material, much of which is not available in any other optics text, is a section on the CAT scan (computerized axial tomography), which has revolutionized medical diagnostics. The book also includes a new chapter on scattering from inhomogeneous media which provides a comprehensive treatment of the theory of scattering of scalar as well as of electromagnetic waves, including the Born series and the Rytov series. The chapter also presents an account of the principles of diffraction tomography - a refinement of the CAT scan - to which Emil Wolf, one of the authors, has made a basic contribution by formulating in 1969 what is generally regarded to be the basic theorem in this field. The chapter also includes an account of scattering from periodic potentials and its connection to the classic subject of determining the structure of crystals from X-ray diffraction experiments, including accounts of von Laue equations, Bragg's law, the Ewald sphere of reflection and the Ewald limiting sphere, both generalized to continuous media. These topics, although originally introduced in connection with the theory of X-ray diffraction by crystals, have since become of considerable relevance to optics, for example in connection with deep holograms. Other new topics covered in this new edition include interference with broad-band light, which introduces the reader to an important phenomenon discovered relatively recently by Emil Wolf, namely the generation of shifts of spectral lines and other modifications of spectra of radiated fields due to the state of coherence of a source. There is also a section on the so-called Rayleigh-Sommerfield diffraction theory which, in recent times, has been finding increasing popularity among optical scientists. There are also several new appendices, including one on energy conservation in scalar wavefields, which is seldom discussed in books on optics. The new edition of this standard reference will continue to be invaluable to advanced undergraduates, graduate students and researchers working in most areas of optics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oV80AAAAIAAJ&dq=Principles+of+Optics:+Electromagnetic+Theory+of+Propagation,+Interference+and+Diffraction+of+Light&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The White Earth Tragedy: Ethnicity and Dispossession at a Minnesota Anishinaabe Reservation, 1889-1920","description":"This compelling interdisciplinary history of an Anishinaabe community at the White Earth Reservation in Minnesota offers a subtle and sophisticated look at changing social, economic, and political relations among the Anishinaabeg and reveals how cultural forces outside of the reservation profoundly affected their lives.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7oLAj7RRynMC&dq=The+White+Earth+Tragedy:+Ethnicity+and+Dispossession+at+a+Minnesota+Anishinaabe+Reservation,+1889-1920&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"OLD TESTAMENT MINIATURES: A Medieval Picture Book with 283 Paintings from The Creation to The Story of David.","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oH2ISwAACAAJ&dq=OLD+TESTAMENT+MINIATURES:+A+Medieval+Picture+Book+with+283+Paintings+from+The+Creation+to+The+Story+of+David.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Coping With Hearing Loss: A Guide for Adults and Their Families","description":"Examines the physical, psychological, and emotional effects of hearing loss","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OgwNAQAAMAAJ&dq=Coping+With+Hearing+Loss:+A+Guide+for+Adults+and+Their+Families&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Taken (Left Behind: The Young Trib Force)","description":"The Left Behind: The Kids series that has sold over 10 million copies in mass paperback editions is now available in value-priced hardcover collections for readers who want a longer read.

It was composed in French beginning in 1782, and then translated into English by Reverend Samuel Henley in which form it was first published in 1786 without Beckford's name as An Arabian Tale, From an Unpublished Manuscript, claiming to be translated directly from Arabic. The first French edition, titled simply as Vathek, was published in December 1786 (postdated 1787). In the twentieth century some editions include The Episodes of Vathek (Vathek et ses episodes), three related tales intended by Beckford to be so incorporated, but omitted from the original edition and published separately long after his death. William Beckford, born in 1759, the year before the accession of King George the Third, was the son of an Alderman who became twice Lord Mayor of London. His family, originally of Gloucestershire, had thriven by the plantations in Jamaica; and his father, sent to school in England, and forming a school friendship at Westminster with Lord Mansfield, began the world in this country as a merchant, with inheritance of an enormous West India fortune. William Beckford the elder became Magistrate, Member of Parliament, Alderman. Four years before the birth of William Beckford the younger he became one of the Sheriffs of London, and three years after his son's birth he was Lord Mayor. As Mayor he gave very sumptuous dinners that made epochs in the lives of feeding men. His son's famous \\"History of the Caliph Vathek\\" looks as if it had been planned for an Alderman's dream after a very heavy dinner at the Mansion House. There is devotion in it to the senses, emphasis on heavy dining. Vathek piqued himself on being the greatest eater alive; but when the Indian dined with him, though the tables were thirty times covered, there was still want of more food for the voracious guest. There is thirst: for at one part of the dream, when Vathek's mother, his wives, and some eunuchs \\"assiduously employed themselves in filling bowls of rock crystal, and emulously presented them to him, it frequently happened that his avidity exceeded their zeal, insomuch that he would prostrate himself upon the ground to lap up the water, of which he could never have enough.\\" And the nightmare incidents of the Arabian tale all culminate in a most terrible heartburn. Could the conception of Vathek have first come to the son after a City dinner?\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=G5NUMQAACAAJ&dq=Vathek:+An+Arabian+Tale&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wolves in Chic Clothing","description":"The authors of The Right Address skewer the upper crust young people of Manhattan's Park Avenue in the story of Julie, a hip, downtown salesgirl at Pelham's jewelry store, who finds herself adopted by wealthy Lell Pelham and her friends, who pass her off as an heiress as a joke.

Woodward, the #1 international bestselling author of Fear: Trump in the White House, has uncovered the precise moment the president was warned that the Covid-19 epidemic would be the biggest national security threat to his presidency. In dramatic detail, Woodward takes readers into the Oval Office as Trump s head pops up when he is told in January 2020 that the pandemic could reach the scale of the 1918 Spanish Flu that killed 675,000 Americans. In 17 on-the-record interviews with Woodward over seven volatile months an utterly vivid window into Trump s mind the president provides a self-portrait that is part denial and part combative interchange mixed with surprising moments of doubt as he glimpses the perils in the presidency and what he calls the  dynamite behind every door.  At key decision points, Rage shows how Trump s responses to the crises of 2020 were rooted in the instincts, habits and style he developed during his first three years as president. Revisiting the earliest days of the Trump presidency, Rage reveals how Secretary of Defense James Mattis, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats struggled to keep the country safe as the president dismantled any semblance of collegial national security decision making. Rage draws from hundreds of hours of interviews with firsthand witnesses as well as participants  notes, emails, diaries, calendars and confidential documents. Woodward obtained 25 never-seen personal letters exchanged between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who describes the bond between the two leaders as out of a  fantasy film.  Trump insists to Woodward he will triumph over Covid-19 and the economic calamity.  Don t worry about it, Bob. Okay?  Trump told the author in July.  Don t worry about it. We ll get to do another book. You ll find I was right.

She dreamed of a safe life and a brighter future for her children. She was born during the time when the people of Crete lived under the yoke of their Ottoman oppressors, deprived of churches and schools and struggling for day-to-day survival, yet there was hope in her heart of an existence beyond the narrow confines of her small, repressed world. Against all odds, she set her sights on a haven of freedom where opportunity abounded. It was a lofty ambition for a simple, uneducated woman with no real knowledge of what lay beyond the outskirts of her village, but she was undeterred. Responsibility became her companion early in life. The eldest of seven brothers and sisters, she became their substitute mother at the age of twelve when her own mother died in childbirth. For the next seven years, she honed the skills that would serve her well in the pursuit of her dream. She was nineteen when her father arranged her marriage to Manoli Drakakis, a man she had met only once, and her own family began. She gave birth to nine children but only four survived daughters, Erene, Maria and Catina; and a son, Leftheri. Erene died in Crete; the others accompanied Hrisanthi on her odyssey. Their journey began when they left the village under the cloak of darkness and made their way to Herakleion, where they boarded the ship that took them to safety in Piraeus, the port of Athens. There Hrisanthi, as a cook and housekeeper for a wealthy Greek family, and Manoli as a marble cutter, earned the money that took them to the next stop on their voyage Alexandria, Egypt. They knew neither the customs nor the language, yet they managed to survive. Settled in Alexandria, Hrisanthi began to look toward more distant horizons, and America became her ultimate goal. World War I raged in the north Atlantic, forcing the family to look toward a safer passage. Buenos Aires, where other Greeks had settled and work could be found, now became their destination. It was from there that they pointed themselves toward the United States, where liberty and opportunity beckoned on the distant horizon. Leftheri had preceded them and was a copper miner in Butte, Montana, where they would join him. Manoli and Maria left first, to be followed as money became available, by Hrisanthi and Catina. Arriving at Angel Island, the port of entry near San Francisco, they boarded the train for Butte. Instead of the fabled gold in the streets, the newcomers found a hardscrabble city with no airs or pretensions, where tough copper miners risked their lives as they descended into the bowels of the earth for the dollars that supported them and their families. Others, equally tough, worked on the railroads that filled the air on the Eastside where Leftheri lived with never-ending smoke and noise. She had looked upon America as paradise. Now Maria wrote to her mother and sister in Buenos Aires, \\"This isn't heaven. It's hell.\\" Her brother, Leftheri, known to his friends as Ellos, forced Maria into an arranged marriage to his best friend, Peter Pappas, a man she barely knew, who was fifteen years her senior. At first, Maria adamantly refused. She gave in when Leftheri threatened to leave and never return. Shortly after the wedding, he left. Maria, our mother, settled with her husband, Pete, in a little red brick house located in between three sets of railroad tracks and under the ominous shadow of the Belmont mine and its ore bin. It was a place of dirt roads, paths filled with ruts, humble homes, some with outhouses, and few amenities. There she gave birth to my sister, Julie; my brother, Dallas, and me, inheritors of the legacy our Greek grandmother, Hrisanthi, made possible for us. It was a starting point for an immigrant experience unknown to those who settle","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QWYla_VMUYsC&dq=HRISANTHI&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Louse","description":"A Los Angeles Times Best Book of the Year Herbert Horatio \\"Poppy\\" Blackwell was once a daring aviator, an illustrious movie producer, and a brilliant businessman.

With no chapters dividing the narrative, Luhan describes her simple life in Taos, New Mexico, this \\"new world\\" she called it, from season to season, following a thread that spools out from her consciousness as if she's recording her thoughts in a journal. \\"My pleasure is in being very still and sensing things,\\" she writes, sharing that pleasure with the reader by describing the joys of adobe rooms warmed in winter by aromatic cedar fires; fragrant in spring with flowers; and scented with homegrown fruits and vegetables being preserved and pickled in summer. Having wandered the world, Luhan found her home at last in Taos. \\"Winter in Taos\\" celebrates the spiritual connection she established with the \\"deep living earth\\" as well as the bonds she forged with Tony Luhan, her \\"mountain.\\" This moving tribute to a land and the people who eked a life from it reminds readers that in northern New Mexico, where the seasons can be harshly beautiful, one can bathe in the sunshine until \\"'untied are the knots in the heart,' for there is nothing like the sun for smoothing out all difficulties.\\" Born in 1879 to a wealthy Buffalo family, Mabel Dodge Luhan earned fame for her friendships with American and European artists, writers and intellectuals and for her influential salons held in her Italian villa and Greenwich Village apartments. In 1917, weary of society and wary of a world steeped in war, she set down roots in remote Taos, New Mexico, then publicized the tiny town's inspirational beauty to the world, drawing a steady stream of significant guests to her adobe estate, including artist Georgia O'Keeffe, poet Robinson Jeffers, and authors D.H. Lawrence and Willa Cather. Luhan could be difficult, complex and often cruel, yet she was also generous and supportive, establishing a solid reputation as a patron of the arts and as an author of widely read autobiographies. She died in Taos in 1962.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QYVmAQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nancy's Candy Cookbook: How to Make Candy at Home the Easy Way","description":"You'll be surprised how easy it is to make fantastic confections at home? at a fraction of the price you'd pay in a candy store.

Some of his friends thought collecting a few of these stories in a little volume and presenting them to him, and to his many friends and associates throughout the University community, on his 90th birthday would be an excellent way to celebrate the occasion. There are a lot of good ones here, some funny, some serious, all very human and all of them revealing different facets of a warm human being and a brilliant college president. The Enema Bandit The late Paul Klinge, long-time associate of Herman B Wells, told the story of a meeting involving campus security officials and other members of the administration back in the late 60s where the activities of one particular character were discussed. The Bloomington campus had been alerted by the Urbana-Champaign authorities who had been notified by the police at another midwestern university farther west to be on the lookout for a fellow who was making his way east from the plains states. His modus operandi was to force entry into a co-ed s room and, instead of violently assaulting her, he would (simply) give her an enema and leave. Much discussion resulted pertaining to some strategies the campus could use to prevent an incident here. HBW sat silent, until with that customary twinkle in his eye he slowly said, ..\\". I wish he would have caught me last Thursday \\" Richard E. Bishop The Wells Touch Late one hot summer afternoon I found myself crammed into a window seat at the back of a 727 jetliner at New York s LaGuardia Airport awaiting departure to Louisville. The last passenger in was Dr. Wells. He came down the long aisle and plopped down next to me. He said not a word and promptly went to sleep. An hour or so later he woke up with a snort, turned to me and said: \\"George, the older you get the more you look like your father.\\" This happened at least 15 years after my graduation from I.U. and I had not seen Dr. Wells in the interim. He had indeed been a friend of my father s, but hadn t seen him for many years. The nap?

Without scientific theory, these developments would not have been possible. In this exceptionally clear and engaging introduction to philosophy of science, James Ladyman explores the philosophical questions that arise when we reflect on the nature of the scientific method and the knowledge it produces. He discusses whether fundamental philosophical questions about knowledge and reality might be answered by science, and considers in detail the debate between realists and antirealists about the extent of scientific knowledge. Along the way, central topics in philosophy of science, such as the demarcation of science from non-science, induction, confirmation and falsification, the relationship between theory and observation and relativism are all addressed. Important and complex current debates over underdetermination, inference to the best explaination and the implications of radical theory change are clarified and clearly explained for those new to the subject.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2USt8izY69AC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Macromedia Dreamweaver 8 in 24 Hours","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VK86PgAACAAJ&dq=Sams+Teach+Yourself+Macromedia+Dreamweaver+8+in+24+Hours&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Incense, Oils and Brews","description":"The book explains how to make your own incenses, oils, ointments, inks, tinctures, herb baths, bath salts, brews, ritual soaps and powders.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sUgWYVvAGMgC&dq=The+Complete+Book+of+Incense,+Oils+and+Brews&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Agent of Chaos","description":"How did Fox Mulder become a believer?

Over the last year companies such as BP, Goldman Sachs, and Toyota have experienced serious blows to their images that could have had reduced impact if their leaders had implemented reputation management into their business strategy and culture. There is no one in either the corporate or academic sphere with greater expertise in the area of corporate reputation than Dr. Daniel Diermeier. An award-winning professor at the Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University, Dr. Diermeier has blazed a path in understanding the significance of reputation management and demonstrating how a company can create a program so powerful that it can help turn a potential public disgrace into a public image success story. Reputation Rules is a landmark work bringing to light Dr. Diermeier s groundbreaking insights in this critical area. He offers the frameworks, strategies, and processes for changing your company s focus as quickly as the world is changing around you. He touches on all of the reputational issues that need to be managed from a strategic level, describing how to: Overcome direct challenges from influential activist and political forces Manage corporate scandals, including executive compensation Use external, seemingly unrelated events to boost reputation Build a reputation management process into everyday operations In addition, Dr. Diermeier provides case studies of Shell s confrontation with Greenpeace, Mercedes s recovery from the Moose crisis, AIG s executive bonus fallout, Wal-Mart s reputation-building response to Hurricane Katrina, and numerous other scenarios illustrating what works and what doesn t when it comes to reputation management. Brimming with keen insights and lucid examples, Reputation Rules is a guidepost for your organization s future and a salve for crisis management.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wm1rAAAAMAAJ&dq=Manual+of+Nerve+Conduction+Velocity+and+Clinical+Neurophysiology+(Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jean and Johnny.","description":"Newbery Medal winner Beverly Cleary brings her classic warm humor to this funny and touching story about a girl who lacks self-confidence, and a boy who has too much.

It showed that Wellington's infantry had won by their mobility rather than their musketry, that the bayonet did not become obsolete in the nineteenth century as is often claimed, and that the tank never supplanted the infantryman in the twentieth. A decade later, the author has been able to fill out many parts of his analysis and has extended it into the near future. The Napoleonic section includes an analysis of firepower and fortification, notably at the Battle of New Orleans in 1815. Additional discussions of the tactics of the American Civil War have been included. The evolution of small-unit tactics in the First World War is next considered, then the problem of making an armored breakthrough in the Second World War. Following is a discussion of the limitations of both the helicopter and firepower in Vietnam. The author points to some of the lessons learned by the U.S. military and the doctrine which resulted from that experience. Concluding is a glimpse at the strangely empty battlefield landscape that might be expected in any future high technology conflict.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ubFqMAOm0CMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Horse Soldier","description":"Depicts the uniforms, insignia, decorations, horse equipment, and weaponry of cavalry regiments against the background of events in American military history","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iOIouQAACAAJ&dq=The+Horse+Soldier&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Codependent No More How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself","description":"The healing touchstone of millions, this modern classic by one of America's best-loved and most inspirational authors holds the key to understanding codependency and to unlocking its stultifying hold on your life.

No, not your purse, or a diaper bag, or your child's lunch box, but one created in your mind. And you didn't stuff it with books, band-aids, or baby food-you filled it with burdens. The kind of burdens moms carry. The suitcase of guilt. A sack of discontent. You drape a duffel bag of weariness on one shoulder and a hanging bag of worry on the other. No wonder you're so tired at the end of the day. Toting those kind of bags is exhausting. Why don't you try traveling light? Try it for the sake of those you love so dearly: your husband, your children, your parents. Have you ever considered the impact that excess baggage has on relationships? God wants to use you, you know. But how can he if you're exhausted? Using the comforting message of the twenty-third Psalm, Max Lucado reminds mothers to listen to God's tender voice urging us to release those burdens we were never meant to bear.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=J0bECwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Flush Times of Alabama and Mississippi: A Series of Sketches (American Century Series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JDXZswEACAAJ&dq=The+Flush+Times+of+Alabama+and+Mississippi:+A+Series+of+Sketches+(American+Century+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Commentary on the book of Psalms","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The king of the Golden River,","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=n7wNAQAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus","description":"From the bestselling author of How the Irish Saved Civilization and The Gifts of the Jews, his most compelling historical narrative yet. How did an obscure rabbi from a backwater of the Roman Empire come to be the central figure in Western Civilization? Did his influence in fact change the world? These are the questions Thomas Cahill addresses in his subtle and engaging investigation into the life and times of Jesus. Cahill shows us Jesus from his birth to his execution through the eyes of those who knew him and in the context of his time a time when the Jews were struggling to maintain their beliefs under overlords who imposed their worldview on their subjects. Here is Jesus the loving friend, itinerate preacher, and quiet revolutionary, whose words and actions inspired his followers to journey throughout the Roman world and speak the truth he instilled in the face of the greatest defeat: Jesus' crucifixion as a common criminal. Daring, provocative, and stunningly original, Cahill's interpretation will both delight and surprise.

No American sporting event can claim the history, tradition, or pageantry that the Kentucky Derby holds. For more than 130 years, spectators have been fascinated by the magnificent horses that run the Louisville track. Thoroughbreds such as Secretariat and Barbaro have earned instant international fame, along with jockeys such as Isaac Murphy, Ron Turcotte, and Calvin Borel. The Kentucky Derby: How the Run for the Roses Became America's Premier Sporting Event calls this great tradition to post and illuminates its history and culture. Rising from its humble beginnings as an American variation of England's Epsom Derby, the Kentucky Derby became a centerpiece of American sports and the racing industry, confirming Kentucky's status as the Horse Capital of the World. James C. Nicholson argues that the Derby, at its essence, is a celebration of a place, existing as a connection between Kentucky's mythic past and modern society. The Derby is more than just a horse race -- it is an experience enhanced by familiar traditions, icons, and images that help Derby fans to understand Kentucky and define themselves as Americans. Today the Kentucky Derby continues to attract international attention from royalty, celebrities, racing fans, and those who simply enjoy an icy mint julep, a fabulous hat, and a wager on who will make it to the winner's circle. Nicholson provides an intriguing and thorough history of the Kentucky Derby, examining the tradition, spectacle, culture, and evolution of the Kentucky Derby -- the brightest jewel of the Triple Crown.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fxbVoQEACAAJ&dq=Kentucky+Roses&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"CITIES ON A HILL","description":"\\"We must consider that we shall be A City Upon a Hill, the eyes of all people upon us,\\" John Winthrop told his Pilgrim community crossing the Atlantic to found the Massachusetts Bay Colony.

With characteristic wit and insight she examines four radically different communities -- a fundamentalist church, a guru-inspired commune, a Sunbelt retirement city, and a gay activist community -- all embodying this visionary drive to shake the past and build anew. Frances FitzGerald here gives eloquent voice and definition to a quintessentially American impulse.

William Faulkner was a master of the short story. Most of the pieces in this collection are drawn from the greatest period in his writing life, the fifteen or so years beginning in 1929, when he published The Sound and the Fury. They explore many of the themes found in the novels and feature characters of small-town Mississippi life that are uniquely Faulkner s. In  A Rose for Emily,  the first of his stories to appear in a national magazine, a straightforward, neighborly narrator relates a tale of love, betrayal, and murder. The vicious family of the Snopes trilogy turns up in  Barn Burning,  about a son s response to the activities of his arsonist father. And Jason and Caddy Compson, two other inhabitants of Faulkner s mythical Yoknapatawpha County, are witnesses to the terrorizing of a pregnant black laundress in  That Evening Sun.  These and the other stories gathered here attest to the fact that Faulkner is, as Ralph Ellison so aptly noted,  the greatest artist the South has produced.

Mary and her younger brother, Peter, set out on foot, lost in the vast, hot Australian outback. They are saved by a chance meeting with an unnamed Aboriginal boy on walkabout. He looks after the two strange white children and shows them how to find food and water in the wilderness, and yet, for all that, Mary is filled with distrust. On the surface Walkabout is an adventure story, but darker themes lie beneath. Peter s innocent friendship with the boy met in the desert throws into relief Mary s half-adult anxieties, and the book as a whole raises questions about what is lost and may be saved when different worlds meet. And in reading Marshall s extraordinary evocations of the beautiful yet forbidding landscape of the Australian desert, perhaps the most striking presence of all in this small, perfect book, we realize that this tale a deep yet disturbing story in the spirit of Adalbert Stifter s Rock Crystal and Richard Hughes s A High Wind in Jamaica is also a reckoning with the mysteriously regenerative powers of death.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sjHPpV7Bac4C&dq=Walkabout&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Working Class Hero: Memoirs of a Providence Fireman","description":"Working Class Hero: Memoirs of a Providence Fireman is one man's action-packed account of twenty-three years of life as a firefighter in busy metropolitan Providence-the third largest city in the Northeast.

The traditional form of the opening is 1 e4 d5 2 exd5 Qxd5 3 Nc3 Qa5, with a subsequent deployment of Black's Queen's bishop at f5 or g4, and indeed the current theoretical status of this line remains good. However, in recent years many alternative schemes have been tried. There has, for example, been a marked increase in the popularity of 3...Qd6!?, in conjunction with a swift ...a6 and ...b5, or ...Bg4, ...Nc6 and ...0-0-0, and sometimes even an early foray by the Black queen into the White kingside  all of which offers a radically different middlegame from the stonewalling so frequently associated with the older type of Scandinavian middlegames. Recent play also suggests that 3...Qe5, cheekily dubbed 'The Patzer Variation', might also not be so naive. Equally important are the latest lines arising from 1 e4 d5 2 exd5 Nf6, including the dangerous Icelandic Gambit and the aggressive Portuguese Variation which is currently at the cutting edge of chess theory.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tp-7wAEACAAJ&dq=Scandinavian+Defence&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Wireless Internet Explained (HP Technologies)","description":"The Wireless Internet Explained covers the full spectrum of wireless technologies from a wide range of vendors, including initiatives by Microsoft and Compaq.

Meditations on nature, love, longing, war, and being. PRAISE FOR JAMES THOMAS FLETCHER: A penetrating and provocative smorgasbord. His poems sing and inform in thoughtful, non-conforming, wonderful ways. Life's harmonies coupled with a realistic sprinkling of irony and brilliant dissonance. An existential celebration of life. From intimacies of love to an explanation of the universe, by way of a walk on the noir side ... Fletcher spotlights the quirks of human longing and the enigmas of memory. I have always favored the slow sipping of a refreshing libation mixed with a perfect blend of romance and magic ... adorned with the lemon-lime twist of macabre fantasy. The breadth of topics is impressive. [Fletcher's] depth of thought, humor, love for words, and poetic skill made the book a joy and a challenge to read. Humor, passion, reverence, irreverence; a connection to people, a reflection on life and self, an exploration of ideas. The tantalizing hints and allusions made me want to have the poet in the same room so that I could plumb for more. Highly personal, experiential.... free flowing exuberance of the visual. The intensity of feeling is superior.... Their complexity is almost painful.... I was moved, confused, astounded, curious, excited. A 'Fletcher' adds feathers to arrows to make them fly true. James Thomas Fletcher's poems ... fly straight to a reader's heart. Fun, intelligent, trenchant. Explore these shorter samples for a glimpse into Cairn.

Afterwards he spent a month hunting alone in the hostile Danakil desert of Abyssinia (now Ethiopia), a thrilling experience which led three years later to his successful exploration of the Awash River. Today he still regards this expedition as the most dangerous he ever undertook. Aged only 23, Thesiger became the first European to travel through the fabled Sultanate of Aussa, a forbidding land where two Italian expeditions and an Egyptian army had previously been wiped out by Danakil tribesmen. Thesiger's remarkable journey solved one of Africa's last remaining geographical mysteries, and established the reputation of a man now considered by many to be the century's greatest living explorer. A vivid, compelling narrative, 'The Danakil Diary' records how the young Thesiger surmounted overwhelming obstacles and survived the constant threat of death and mutilation by the Danakil, warriors whose tribal status depended on the number of men they had killed and castrated. He portrays the often beautiful, savage landscapes; their varied wildlife; and the strange, sometimes cruel customs of the Danakil, never before observed in such intimate detail. Interspersed with letters to his mother, Thesiger's diary is illustrated with original sketch-maps and drawings, and many of his previously unpublished photographs. Besides giving early proof of Thesiger's descriptive genius, 'The Danakil Diary' reveals youthful evidence of his fierce motivation and uncompromising will  familiar hallmarks of his sixty years of travel among primitive peoples in some of the harshest and remotest areas of the world. Wilfred Thesiger was born in 1910 at the British Legation in Addis Ababa, and spent his early years in Abyssinia. Educated at Eton and Oxford, where for four consecutive years he won his Blue for boxing, he joined the Sudan Political Service in 1935. During the next five years Thesiger visited little-known areas of the Sudan, Libya and the French Sahara. In the War, serving with the patriots under Orde Wingate in Abyssinia, he was awarded a DSO. He later served with the SOE (in Syria) and the SAS in the Western Desert. From 1930, always using traditional means of transport, Thesiger travelled through remote areas of Africa, the Middle East and Asia. For over twenty years, until 1994, he lived mostly among the pastoral Samburu at Maralal in northern Kenya. He now lives permanently in London. Thesiger's journeys have won him the Founder's Medal of the Royal Geographical Society, the Lawrence of Arabia Medal of the Royal Central Asian Society, the Livingstone Medal of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society and the Burton Memorial Medal of the Royal Asiatic Society. His writing has won him the Heinemann Award; Fellowship of the Royal Society of Literature; an Honorary D.Litt. from Leicester University and an Honorary D.Litt. from the University of Bath. In 1968 he was made a CBE. He is Honorary Fellow of the British Academy and Honorary Fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford. He was honoured with a KBE in 1995. Wilfred Thesiger's previous books include 'Arabian Sands, The Marsh Arabs, Desert, Marsh and Mountain, Visions of a Nomad, The Life of My Choice' and 'My Kenya Days.'","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=p8lyAAAAMAAJ&dq=Danakil+Diary&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jazz Masters of the 50's","description":"Here are the great jazz men of the 1950s, all of whom have come to prominence since the rise of the late Charlie Parker, all of whom are the leaders of the jazz world.

The book is of great value to historians, not only for its eye-witness accounts of battles, but also for its detailed description of the way of life of 19th-century Plains Indians.The book was dictated to Marquis by Wooden Leg in Indian Sign Language, their only common language. Marquis gathered the stories for the book from Wooden Leg and others while he was physician at the agency in Montana from 1922. They were reluctant to open up to him at first, but eventually Marquis gained their trust.Wooden Leg lived through some of the most turbulent times in Cheyenne history, but the book begins with his childhood and descriptions of Cheyenne customs. These include tribal organisation, the warrior societies, sport, religion and mythology, their friendship and cooperation with the Sioux, arrow recognition, warbonnet entitlement, and much more. Wooden Leg was introduced to warfare at a very young age via conflict with the Crow and joined the Elk warrior society at age 14.The book describes Wooden Leg's participation in the important battles of the war of 1876-1877, when the Cheyenne, Sioux, and other plains tribes fought the United States. These included not only the Little Big Horn, but the preceding Battle of the Rosebud and the succeeding Dull Knife Fight. Following the Cheyenne surrender, the tribe was deported to Oklahoma, but eventually Wooden Leg was allowed to return. At Fort Keogh he worked as a scout for the army and was later appointed a judge at the Tongue River Indian Reservation. Wooden Leg describes in detail how he befriended the old chief Little Wolf towards the end of the latter's life. Little Wolf had been a great war leader but was now ostracised for having killed another Cheyenne while drunk.Wooden Leg's description of the Battle of the Little Bighorn caused controversy when the book was first published, particularly his claim that many of the US soldiers committed suicide.

Since the posthumous discovery of her work, general readers and literary scholars alike have puzzled over this paradox of wanting to communicate widely and yet apparently refusing to publish. In this pathbreaking study, Martha Nell Smith unravels the paradox by boldly recasting two of the oldest and still most frequently asked questions about Emily Dickinson: Why didn't she publish more poems while she was alive? and Who was her most important contemporary audience? Regarding the question of publication, Smith urges a reconception of the act of publication itself. She argues that Dickinson did publish her work in letters and in forty manuscript books that circulated among a cultured network of correspondents, most important of whom was her sister-in-law, Susan Huntington Gilbert Dickinson. Rather than considering this material unpublished because unprinted, Smith views its alternative publication as a conscious strategy on the poet's part, a daring poetic experiment that also included Dickinson's unusual punctuation, line breaks, stanza divisions, calligraphic orthography, and bookmaking all the characteristics that later editors tried to standardize or eliminate in preparing the poems for printing. Dickinson's relationship with her most important reader, Sue Dickinson, has also been lost or distorted by multiple levels of censorship, Smith finds. Emphasizing the poet-sustaining aspects of the passionate bonds between the two women, Smith shows that their relationship was both textual and sexual. Based on study of the actual holograph poems, Smith reveals the extent of Sue Dickinson's collaboration in the production of poems, most notably \\"Safe in Their Alabaster Chambers.\\" This finding will surely challenge the popular conception of the isolated, withdrawn Emily Dickinson. Well-versed in poststructuralist, feminist, and new textual criticism, Rowing in Eden uncovers the process by which the conventional portrait of Emily Dickinson was drawn and offers readers a chance to go back to original letters and poems and look at the poet and her work through new eyes. It will be of great interest to a wide audience in literary and feminist studies.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xJehAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Television culture","description":"\\"With new introductory essay on Why Fiske Still Matters, by Henry Jenkins, and with a new discussion on the topic of John Fiske and \\"Television Culture,\\" between Ron Becker, Aniko Bodroghkozy, Steve Classen, Elana Levine, Jason Mittell, Greg Smith and Pamela Wilson.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UxJTSAAACAAJ&dq=Television+culture&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Biography - Pagis, Dan (1930-1986): An article from: Contemporary Authors","description":"This volume engages with memory of the Holocaust as expressed in literature, film, and other media.

It is the first book to describe and define the burgeoning regeneration movement spreading rapidly throughout the world. Regeneration describes how an inclusive movement can engage the majority of humanity to save the world from the threat of global warming, with climate solutions that directly serve our children, the poor, and the excluded. This means we must address current human needs, not future existential threats, real as they are, with initiatives that include but go well beyond solar, electric vehicles, and tree planting to include such solutions as the fifteen-minute city, bioregions, azolla fern, food localization, fire ecology, decommodification, forests as farms, and the number one solution for the world: electrifying everything. Paul Hawken and the nonprofit Regeneration Organization are launching a series of initiatives to accompany the book, including a streaming video series, curriculum, podcasts, teaching videos, and climate action software.

In Hawthorne's Shadow is the first critical study to describe precisely the formal shape of Hawthorne's psychological romance and to explore his themes and images in relation to such contemporary writers as John Cheever, Norman Mailer, Joan Didion, John Gardner, Joyce Carol Oates, William Styron, and John Updike. When viewed from this perspective, certain writers particularly Cheever, Mailer, Oates, and Gardner appear in a new and very different light, leading to a considerable reevaluation of their achievement and their place in American fiction. Mr. Coale's long interviews and conversations with John Cheever, John Gardner, William Styron, and others have provided insights and perspectives that make this book particularly valuable to students of contemporary American literature. Coale links contemporary writers to an on-going American romantic tradition, represented by such earlier authors as Melville, Harold Frederic, Faulkner, Flannery O'Connor, and Carson McCullers. He explores the distinctly Manichean matter of much American romance, linking it to America's Puritan past and to the almost schizophrenic dynamics of American culture in general. Finally, he reexamines the post-modernist writers in light of Hawthorne's \\"shadow\\" and shows that, however similar they may be in some ways, they differ remarkably from the previous American romantic tradition.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=P0coEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Electronics: A complete course","description":"\\" With many programs compressing their courses in order to devote more time to the electronics system applications, such as communication, computing, industrial, and consumer, a strong need arises for a single electronics fundamentals text.

Shot in the Middle East and produced during Margaret Thatcher s ascendant years, the film satirized among other matters authoritarianism and religious zealotry. Upon its release, Monty Python s Life of Brian was both a critical and commercial success, and has been since hailed as one of the greatest comedies of all time. But the film also faced backlash from religious groups for its blasphemy, perceived or otherwise. In A Book about the Film Monty Python's Life of Brian: All of the References from Assyrians to Zeffirelli, Darl Larsen identifies and examines the plethora of cultural, historical, and topical allusions in the film. In this resource, Larsen delineates virtually every allusion and reference that appears in the film from first-century Jerusalem through 1970s Great Britain. Organized chronologically by scene, the entries in this cultural history cover literary and metaphoric allusions, symbolisms, names, peoples, and places, as well as the many social, cultural, and historical elements that populate this film. By closely examining each scene, this book explores the Pythons  comparisons of the Roman and British Empires and of Pilate and Margaret Thatcher. In addition, Larsen helps to situate Life of Brian in the  Jesus  re-examination of the postwar period, while also taking a close look at the terror groups of first-century Judea and the modern world. A Book about the Film Monty Python's Life of Brian will appeal to scholars of history, film, British culture, and pop culture, as well as to the many fans of this iconic group.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fjxCDwAAQBAJ&dq=Monty+Pythons+Life+of+Brian&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Elizabeth and the Prince of Spain","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fHiItgEACAAJ&dq=Elizabeth+and+the+Prince+of+Spain&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Langenscheidt's New College Merriam-Webster: English Thesaurus","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tsqrGAAACAAJ&dq=Langenscheidt%27s+New+College+Merriam-Webster:+English+Thesaurus&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Pirates and the Mouse: Disney's War Against the Counterculture","description":"During a time of unprecedented political, social, and cultural upheaval in U.S. history, one of the fiercest battles was ignited by a comic book. In 1963, the San Francisco Chronicle made 21-year-old Dan O'Neill the youngest syndicated cartoonist in American newspaper history. As O'Neill delved deeper into the emerging counterculture, his strip, Odd Bodkins, became stranger and stranger and more and more provocative, until the papers in the syndicate dropped it and the Chronicle let him go. The lesson that O'Neill drew from this was that what America most needed was the destruction of Walt Disney. O'Neill assembled a band of rogue cartoonists called the Air Pirates (after a group of villains who had bedeviled Mickey Mouse in comic books and cartoons). They lived communally in a San Francisco warehouse owned by Francis Ford Coppola and put out a comic book, Air Pirates Funnies, that featured Disney characters participating in very un-Disneylike behavior, provoking a mammoth lawsuit for copyright and trademark infringements and hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages. Disney was represented by one of San Francisco's top corporate law firms and the Pirates by the cream of the counterculture bar. The lawsuit raged for 10 years, from the trial court to the US Supreme Court and back again.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UMB7DQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Five-Point Play: The Story of Duke's Amazing 2000-2001 Championship Season","description":"During the 2000-2001 college basketball year, Coach K guided a very young Duke University basketball team through a turbulent season with many unexpected ups and downs but, eventually won the national championship.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2CWAvwEACAAJ&dq=Five-Point+Play:+The+Story+of+Duke%27s+Amazing+2000-2001+Championship+Season&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Crimson Intrigue","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UvbfAAAACAAJ&dq=Crimson+Intrigue&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Boomer Goes to School","description":"In Boomer's Big Day, Boomer and his family moved to a new town.

They are supplemented here by a play, Potee's Gal, and some brief sketches of poor whites. What sets Adams's tales apart from other such collections is the willingness of his black informants to share with him not only their stories of rabbits and \\"hants\\" but also their feelings on such taboo subjects as lynchings, Jim Crow courts, and chain gangs. Adams retells these tales as if the blacks in them were talking only among themselves. Whites do not appear in these works, except as rare background figures and topics of conversation by Tad, Scip, and other black storytellers. As Tad says, \\"We talkin' to we.\\" That Adams was permitted to hear such tales at all is part of the mystery that Robert O'Meally explains in his introduction. The key to the mystery is Adams's ability -- in his life, as in his works -- to wear both black and white masks. He remained a well-placed member of white society at the same time that he was something of a maverick within it. His black informants therefore saw him not only as someone more likeable and trustworthy than most whites but also as someone who was in a position to help them in some way if he understood more about their lives. As a writer, O'Meally suggests, Adams was not simply an objective recorder of folklore. By donning a black mask, Adams was able to project attitudes and values that most whites of his place and time would have disavowed. As a result, his tales have a complexity and richness that make them an authentic witness to the black experience as well as a lasting contribution to American letters.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=trhMAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Maryland and Delaware Canoe Trails: A Paddler's Guide to Rivers of the Old Line and First States","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Z3vWAAAAMAAJ&dq=Maryland+and+Delaware+Canoe+Trails:+A+Paddler%27s+Guide+to+Rivers+of+the+Old+Line+and+First+States&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"David Wimble's 8th Edition The Indie Bible","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Dumb Architect's Guide to Glazing Selection","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VRaD0FLH278C&dq=The+Dumb+Architect%27s+Guide+to+Glazing+Selection&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The History of Herodotus","description":"Translated by Aubrey de S lincourt with an introduction and Notes by John M.

Seduction Townsfolk called him devil. For dark and enigmatic Julian, Earl of Ravenwood, was a man with a legendary temper and a first wife whose mysterious death would not be forgotten. Some said the beautiful Lady Ravenwood had drowned herself in the black, murky waters of Ravenwood Pond. Others whispered of foul play and the devil's wrath. Now country-bred Sophy Dorring is about to become Ravenwood's new bride. Drawn to his masculine strength and the glitter of desire that burned in his emerald eyes, the tawny-haired lass had her own reasons for agreeing to a marriage of convenience. One was vengeance, and in its pursuit she would entangle Julian in a blackmail plot, a duel at dawn, and a dangerous masquerade. The other reason was dearer to her heart, but just as wild a quest: Sophy Dorring intended to teach the devil to love again. Surrender From the dazzling ballrooms of glittering London society to magnificent, cursed estate in the distant wilds of Yorkshire, comes the deliciously wicked story of a thoroughly unconventional courtship -- and a thrilling midnight rendezvous that could only lead to love... At four and twenty Victoria Huntington thought herself quite adept at fending off fortune hunters... until she came under siege from Lucas Colebrook, the darkly disturbing new Earl of Stonevale. Amidst the brightly plumed birds of the town, Lucas was a hawk. And when he held out the lure of moonlit rides and wild, reckless midnight escapades, Victoria found herself powerless to resist. But becoming Stonevale's companion in adventure was far more dangerous undertaking than Victoria could ever imagine. For the attractive Earl would use her every weakness to woo her, to win her, and ultimately to wed her. And soon the amber-eyed lady would find herself ensconced in a crumbling mansion deep in the English countryside... where the real reason for her hasty marriage becomes all too apparent...and where the ghosts of her dark-stained past are waiting to rise up in a terrifying plot that will threaten her life, her honor, and the only man she could ever love.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=K95CQeFyfKoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Talk Spanish (Talk Short Lang Course Bk/Tape) (English and Spanish Edition)","description":"Detailed and timely information on accommodations, restaurants, and local attractions highlight these updated travel guides, which feature all-new covers, a two-color interior design, symbols to indicate budget options, must-see ratings, multi-day itineraries, Smart Travel Tips, helpful bulleted maps, tips on transportation, guidelines for shopping excursions, and other valuable features.

It is no longer sufficient to credit religion, economics, localism or constitutional concepts for the outcome without considering the role of effective military leadership. The study of human conflict illustrates a simple, immutable truth -the finest, most inspired or motivated, well-trained, disciplined or experienced force is quite like a modern cruise missile. Without effective guidance, it is no more than a collection of very expensive parts. For the general military history reader, the work provides a concise strategic and operational narrative of the British Civil Wars of 1642-51 in northern England and Scotland. For historians, it offers an additional causative explanation for ultimate parliamentary victory. As a study of effective military leadership, it proposes, through a case study analysis based on a framework of characteristics and behavior of specific commanders from the wildly successful to the abysmal failure, a model of effective military leadership for present and successive generations of military, naval and air officers at all levels of command.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=I0W6wuSgKFQC&dq=Military+Leadership+in+the+British+Civil+Wars,+1642-1651:+%27The+Genius+of+this+Age%27+(Cass+Military+Studies)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"James Joyce,: A critical introduction, (The Makers of modern literature)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0NZaAAAAMAAJ&dq=James+Joyce,:+A+critical+introduction,+(The+Makers+of+modern+literature)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Winter's Tales","description":"If one theme unifies the 11 tales collected here, it is that of longing.

And Jalisco is Michael Hogan's intellectual inspiration for this bird's eye view of Mexico and elsewhere. Hogan writes with deep affection for his adopted country, mixed with an insider's keen interest about things Mexican. The inexhaustible patience and forgiveness of the Mexican character is portrayed in many of his narratives, in which life is lived largely in the slow lane but with a degree of dignity and grace that might help explain why so many North Americans choose to call Mexico home. Come ride with us on the Bus From Hell to see Cuban dictator Fidel Castro; and laugh at the drunken Santa Claus whose sleigh is damaged at the high school Christmas party. Then feel the beat of the music as the Tigres del Norte give an all-night concert in Guadalajara's immense Ro Nilo stadium; squint through the eyepiece of a welder's helmet during a solar eclipse; and squirm with uneasiness during a depression-producing six-day, six-night rainstorm. Perhaps the strongest messages of this collection are those extolling the thoughts of Mexican diplomat and poet Octavio Paz, in helping understand ourselves; and those of environmentalist and writer Ed Abbey who tried to show all of us, of all nationalities, that if we want to save this world FOR ourselves, we first have to save it FROM ourselves. So follow Hogan as he examines his subjects-from the lowest crawling insects that influence life in Jalisco as it is today, to the two-legged creatures of power that would change it forever.

Traces the journey of the Grail from the Holy Land to Rome and eventually to a ruined chapel in Shropshire, England ? Uncovers new evidence identifying the historical King Arthur and his connection to the Holy Grail The popular Arthurian stories of the Middle Ages depict the Holy Grail as Christ s cup from the Last Supper, which was believed to have been endowed with miraculous healing powers and the ability to give eternal life to whoever drank from it. A much earlier tradition, however, claimed the Grail was the vessel used by Mary Magdalene to collect Christ s blood when he appeared to her after rising from the tomb. While many vessels were claimed to have been the true Grail, there was only one thought to have been the chalice used by Mary. From Jesus  empty tomb, where it remained for almost 400 years, this holy relic known as the Marian Chalice was taken to Rome by the mother of the first Christian emperor, Constantine the Great. It was then smuggled from Rome in 410 A.D., according to the fifth-century historian Olympiodorus, to save it from the barbarians who sacked the city. Well into the Middle Ages legend persisted that it had been taken to safety in Britain, the last outpost of Roman civilization in Western Europe. This journey to England, and what happened to the Chalice there, is the focus of this book. Graham Phillips s research uncovers the secret legacy of an ancient noble family over generations and a trail of clues hidden in the English countryside that lead to a mysterious grotto, a forgotten attic, and the lost chalice. In tracing the relic, Phillips offers the inside story behind an astonishing adventure that results in the identification of the historical King Arthur and the location of one of the most powerful symbols in Western tradition.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0VkoDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Century of African American Art: The Paul R.

Indeed, Lincoln's record on the Constitution and individual rights has fueled a century of debate, from charges that Democrats were singled out for harrassment to Gore Vidal's depiction of Lincoln as an \\"absolute dictator.\\" Now, in the Pulitzer Prize-winning The Fate of Liberty, one of America's leading authorities on Lincoln wades straight into this controversy, showing just who was jailed and why, even as he explores the whole range of Lincoln's constitutional policies. Mark Neely depicts Lincoln's suspension of habeas corpus as a well-intentioned attempt to deal with a floodtide of unforeseen events: the threat to Washington as Maryland flirted with secession, disintegrating public order in the border states, corruption among military contractors, the occupation of hostile Confederate territory, contraband trade with the South, and the outcry against the first draft in U.S. history. Drawing on letters from prisoners, records of military courts and federal prisons, memoirs, and federal archives, he paints a vivid picture of how Lincoln responded to these problems, how his policies were actually executed, and the virulent political debates that followed. Lincoln emerges from this account with this legendary statesmanship intact--mindful of political realities and prone to temper the sentences of military courts, concerned not with persecuting his opponents but with prosecuting the war efficiently. In addition, Neely explores the abuses of power under the regime of martial law: the routine torture of suspected deserters, widespread antisemitism among Union generals and officials, the common practice of seizing civilian hostages. He finds that though the system of military justice was flawed, it suffered less from merciless zeal, or political partisanship, than from inefficiency and the friction and complexities of modern war. Informed by a deep understanding of a unique period in American history, this incisive book takes a comprehensive look at the issues of civil liberties during Lincoln's administration, placing them firmly in the political context of the time. Written with keen insight and an intimate grasp of the original sources, The Fate of Liberty offers a vivid picture of the crises and chaos of a nation at war with itself, changing our understanding of this president and his most controversial policies.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ISrMbxmHL1QC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Astoria: Or Anecdotes of An Enterprise Beyond the Rocky Mountains","description":"In 1810 John Jacob Astor sent two expeditions to the mouth of the Columbia River to establish a far flung trade empire based on furs.

Before it, the creation of the United States of America was possible; after it, it was certain.    Michael Lewis, The History of the British Navy  On the afternoon of September 5, 1781, off the Capes of Virginia, two and a half hours of cannonading between warships of the British and French navies determined the outcome of the American Revolution. It was the one decisive engagement of the bitter six-year struggle of the thirteen colonies against England, and it could have gone either way. Not many Americans have ever heard of it... Almost no one, at the time, seems to have grasped its full significance. George III called it  a drawn battle ; Rear Admiral Thomas Graves,  a lively skirmish ; Rear Admiral Sir Samuel Hood,  a feeble action ; and George Washington,  a partial engagement.  As modern battles go it was a small affair. Probably less than ten thousand men came under fire on each side, and the total casualties did not exceed six hundred... One of the many paradoxes about the Chesapeake struggle is that one of the greatest naval victories of all time was decisive because it was indecisive. Not a single ship was taken or sunk during the battle itself, although the British were forced to burn one afterwards; and neither admiral was driven from the field. Yet the result was as crushing to the hopes of General Earl Cornwallis as if every British warship had been sent to the bottom. To save his army of seven thousand men, the British fleet had to win control of Chesapeake Bay. This it failed to do. England lost naval supremacy just long enough to insure the winning of American independence. Once the sea-approaches to the Chesapeake were sealed the siege of Yorktown and Cornwallis s surrender were foregone conclusions.    Harold A. Larrabee, Introduction to Decision at the Chesapeake  [An] excellent study of the naval battle fought off the Chesapeake on Sept. 5, 1781, between French and English fleets... The account of the battle itself takes up only a small portion of the book, the rest being devoted to the backgrounds of the war, brief biographies of politicians and officers on both sides... the reasons behind Cornwallis s fatal decision to fortify himself at Yorktown, and to puncturing long-accepted theories as to why France sent  foreign aid  to America. Carefully documented and highly readable, filled with fascinating details of 18th-century naval warfare, the book will appeal to naval buffs ashore and afloat and to all historians of America s first Civil War.    Kirkus Reviews  Harold A. Larrabee does [the story of the Yorktown campaign] full justice... his lucid and fast-moving account will interest any one who cares to know the role of sea power in achieving American independence... The author s treatment of the Yorktown campaign itself is excellent... In discussing the naval operations, Larrabee is at his best... The story is told in all its complexity, yet is never mystifying. It is so clear that the reader can follow it with ease, and so vivid that he feels like an eyewitness of a campaign that in its combination of brilliance and blunder is perennially fascinating.    William B. Willcox, The Journal of Modern History  Decision at the Chesapeake is a delight. It combines scholarly acumen, scholarly methodology, and a good style   not what is popularly labeled scholarly   with a sense of direction and purpose. The author endeavors to demonstrate, and to my mind does it very well, that the fate of Cornwallis was definitely determined not so much by his own actions but because the British lost control of the sea in early September 1781.    S. W. Jackman, The William and Mary Quarterly  For the student of sea power this is interesting reading, indeed. It has been written:  The Battle of Chesapeake Bay was one of the decisive battles of the world. Before it, the creation of the United States of America was possible; after it, it was certain.  The author sets out to explore this thesis, and brings together from many sources-some of them obscure-most of what is known about this battle of the American Revolution. War, certainly, can and must be viewed from many perspectives, and the author is not unmindful of this.    F. A. Baldwin, Naval War College Review  With a keen sense of the dramatic, a strict adherence to fact, and a facile pen, the author has created an outstanding contribution to the naval history of the American Revolution, and has presented another graphic illustration of the importance of sea power in warfare... Dr. Larrabee has written one of the most penetrating accounts of the events leading up to the battle and a vivid word picture of the battle itself. His device of creating a stage, whereon the various  Architects of Defeat  exhibit either their incompetence or their blunders, is a piece of graphic historical writing. There are profiles of George III, and the Lords North, Germain and Sandwich, which clearly expose their fatuous belief that the American Colonies could be conquered with ease; of the Admirals Graves, Hood and Rodney, and the Generals Clinton and Cornwallis, which place them in no favorable light as strategists or tacticians.

Whether it is a matter of giving to charity, or sticking to duty, or insisting on our rights, we can be confused, or be paralysed by the fear that our principles are groundless. Many are afraid that in a Godless world science has unmasked us as creatures fated by our genes to be selfish and tribalistic, or competitive and aggressive. Simon Blackburn, author of the best-selling Think, structures this short introduction around these and other threats to ethics. Confronting seven different objections to our self-image as moral, well-behaved creatures, he charts a course through the philosophical quicksands that often engulf us. Then, turning to problems of life and death, he shows how we should think about the meaning of life, and how we should mistrust the sound-bite sized absolutes that often dominate moral debates. Finally he offers a critical tour of the ways the philosophical tradition has tried to provide foundations for ethics, from Plato and Aristotle through to contemporary debates.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eQR1BgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bush At War","description":"With his unmatched investigative skill, Bob Woodward tells the behind-the-scenes story of how President George W.

Warm, funny, thought provoking, Johnson questions universally-held assumptions about love & sex, asking: Why do relationships cause such anguish? Are couple relationships ever what we think they will be? Do relationships ever work? Is true intimacy possible without sex? Is it possible with sex? Is sex even natural to women, & if not, in our unconditioned state, how would we be intimate? Johnson, a nationally known author & lecturer, has written three previous books in which she dares to challenge the status quo & urges us to rethink our conditioned way of being. This was precipitated by her excommunication from the Mormon church for her support of the Equal Rights Amendment, & her decision to run for the presidency of the United States in 1982. Johnson inspires arousal with her thought-provoking way of writing.

And in a new chapter on the post-9/11 wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, Knightley details even greater degrees of government manipulation and media complicity, as evidenced by the \\"embedding\\" of reporters in military units and the uncritical, openly patriotic coverage of these conflicts. \\"The age of the war correspondent as hero,\\" he concludes, \\"appears to be over.\\" Fully updated, The First Casualty remains required reading for anyone concerned about freedom of the press, journalistic responsibility, and the nature of modern warfare.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DXu6XL4g4agC&dq=The+Crimean+War+(The+War+Correspondents)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Terrorist or Patriot","description":"A fast-moving thriller based on facts about an ordinary man who learns to deal with death and destruction and with the help of a few new friends, brings down a military government.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sc9qJnEurbEC&dq=A+Terrorist+or+Patriot&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Microsoft ASP.NET Programming with Microsoft Visual C#(TM) .NET Deluxe Learning Edition (Pro-Developer)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DH3bjwEACAAJ&dq=Microsoft+ASP.NET+Programming+with+Microsoft+Visual+C&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Best","description":"Follows a young boy as he helps to care for the new baby in his family.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MU6pAAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Best&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Warriors","description":"The basis for the cult-classic film The Warriors chronicles one New York City gang's nocturnal journey through the seedy, dangerous subways and city streets of the 1960s.

Only a decade ago, the promise of optimising urban services through the widespread application of information and communication technologies was largely a techno-utopian fantasy. Today, smart urbanisation is occurring via urban projects, policies and visions in hundreds of cities around the globe. Inside Smart Cities provides real-world evidence on how local authorities, small and medium enterprises, corporations, utility providers and civil society groups are creating smart cities at the neighbourhood, city and regional scales. Twenty three empirically detailed case studies from the Global North and South  ranging from Cape Town, Stockholm and Abu Dhabi to Philadelphia, Hong Kong and Santiago  illustrate the multiple and diverse incarnations of smart urbanism. The contributors draw on ideas from urban studies, geography, urban planning, science and technology studies and innovation studies to go beyond the rhetoric of technological innovation and reveal the political, social and physical implications of digitalising the built environment. Collectively, the practices of smart urbanism raise fundamental questions about the sustainability, liveability and resilience of cities in the future. The findings are relevant to academics, students, practitioners and urban stakeholders who are questioning how urban innovation relates to politics and place.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2wlrDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Flights of Fantasy: Programming 3d Video Games in C++/Book and Disk","description":"The first and only book to reveal the secrets of writing 3-D game applications for C++ programmers.

In a supportive conversational style, Danna Korn shows that it's possible for kids with celiac disease and their families to lead happy and healthy lives. Parents find advice on how to deal with the diagnosis, cope with the emotional turmoil, and help their child develop a positive and constructive attitude. Especially important is the guidance on menu planning, grocery shopping, strategies for proper food preparation, and deciding whether or not the entire family should be gluten-free.

Parents find tips on conditioning behavior and how and when to give kids some control over what they eat. Also covered is the challenge of controlling meals outside of the home -- at birthday parties, restaurants, camp, and on vacation. There's also information about how federal regulations and tax laws apply to children with celiac disease.

It is a book about the  inside feel  of these students and what they think and say history is for, based on research in the United States with reflections on the United Kingdom. It gives history teachers a better understanding of why culturally relevant pedagogy, inclusion and issues surrounding diversity are of crucial importance if we are to reach these students. We live in a world where many multicultural students think they have little connection with the histories, traditions and values in which they have grown up, some look toward groups who promise them a sense of belonging and ownership of created histories which clash with and threaten democratic societies. This book begins with the belief that it is important to understand how a subject, history, makes non-White students think and feel about themselves. At its center are assertions made by students of color who think learning history that is rich in aspects they can connect with culturally and personally, is important and necessary in gaining and holding their attention. Then I make suggestions of how we best communicate and set high expectations for these students, how as history teachers we use strategies to better engage these students, and redirect the unengaged. We need to make sure history educators provide necessary and appropriate scaffolding for students of colour to better process what they learn in history lessons, making sure they are engaged in higher-order thinking in an equitable safe environment where they see and know that their diversities are respected and valued.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9di_DwAAQBAJ&dq=Successful+Beginnings+for+College+Teaching+(Teaching+Techniques/Strategies+Series,+V.+2)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mina Loy: Woman and Poet (Man/Woman and Poet Series) (Modern Poet Series)","description":"Loy (1882-1966) made a career of friendship.

The scale, speed and success of this offensive have provided historians with fertile ground for interpretation and debate. How did the British Expeditionary Force, having endured the bitter disappointments and heavy losses at Aubers Ridge, Loos, the Somme, Passchendaele, Cambrai and during the German spring offensives of 1918 turn the tide of the war and comprehensively defeat the enemy in the field? This is the fascinating question that Michael Senior tackles in this lucid and thought-provoking study. He considers the reasons for the stunning British victories and examines the factors that underpinned the eventual success of the BEF. In particular he shows how tactical and technical developments evolved during the course of the war and merged in a way that gave the British a decisive advantage during the final months of the fighting. Innovations in guns and gunnery, in shells, aircraft and tanks, and a massive increase in industrial output, played key parts, as did the continuous process of adaptation, experimentation and invention that went on throughout the war years. The result was an army that could take advantage of the unprecedented opportunity presented by the failure of the German spring offensive of 1918. Michael Senior provides a challenging and controversial analysis of the underlying reasons for the success of the BEF. It is essential reading for anyone who is keen to learn about the extraordinary development of the British army throughout the war ? and to understand why, and how, the Germans were beaten.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=K1auDQAAQBAJ&dq=Cassell+Military+Classics:+To+Win+A+War:+1918+The+Year+Of+Victory&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"COLOR ATLAS OF COSMETIC OCULOFACIAL SURGERY","description":"Color Atlas of Cosmetic Oculofacial Surgery, 2nd Edition by Drs.

Today, it is expected that a corporation will be transparent in its operations; that it will reflect ethical values that are broadly shared by others in society; and that companies will enable society to achieve environmental sustainability as well as a high standard of living. As we enter the second decade of the twenty-first century, the social, political and economic landscape is once again shifting: the need for an informed public conversation about what is expected of the modern corporation has never been greater.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ptV7BwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dinosaur Roar","description":"\\"Dinosaur sweet, dinosaur grumpy.

Rooted in experiences of prison reality, the book sets forth an original theory about the theological roots of our current punitive ethos and offers a creative antidote informed by a commitment to restorative justice. Snyder shows that the spirit of punishment in our culture is rooted in and reinforced by popular Christian misunderstandings of human nature and God's grace. These misunderstandings include two consequential errors: the absence of any notion of \\"creation grace\\" and an understanding of \\"redemption grace\\" couched exclusively in individualistic, internalized, and nonhistorical terms. In both cases the social-historical dimensions of grace necessary for holistic redemption are ignored. These theological distortions, coupled with a prevailing cultural context that divides people between \\"them\\" and \\"us\\"-the most virulent form of which is racism-make a spirit of punishment inevitable. Snyder finds clues for a different understanding of humanity and God in responses to crime categorized as \\"restorative justice\\". These alternative perspectives seek redemption not only for the perpetrator but also for the victims of crime and the larger community. They also recognize all persons as \\"graced,\\" no matter what their actions may have been. Drawing on these clues, Snyder initiates fresh ways of thinking about the traditional theological concepts of covenant, incarnation, and trinity as foundations for a restorative approach to justice. He also challenges religious communities to understand God's good news in ways that offer hope for a transformed world. The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Punishment is an eye-opening work with profound implications for contemporary social life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=O42kY3tGqMEC&dq=The+Protestant+Ethic+and+the+Spirit+of+Punishment&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Complete Candlemaker Book & Kit","description":"Norma Coney presents a guide to making some 40 different kinds of candles.

Existing forms of short-term psychotherapy tend to be vague and uncertain, lacking as they do a clearly formulated rationale and methodology. The bold and challenging technique for brief psychotherapy designed around the factor of time itself, which Dr. Mann introduces here, is a method he hopes will revolutionize current practice. The significance of time in human life is examined in terms of the development of time sense as well as its unconscious meaning and the ways these are experienced in both the categorical and existential senses. The author shows how the interplay between the regressive pressures of the child's sense of infinite time and the adult reality of categorical time determine the patient's unconscious expectations of psychotherapy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BmAmDfQtOGgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Same Jesus...Same Church?","description":"If you have ever wondered why we have so many Christian denominations, there is a simple answer.

In the first edition of Worship Old and New, Robert E. Webber introduced an approach to worship that blended historical and traditional practices with contemporary elements. Since then, the spreading fires of worship renewal have provided opportunity for fresh consideration. This significantly revised edition is the result of Webber s interaction with current worship trends. It is intended to be used both in the classroom and by those who want to improve worship in the local church.Reformatted for an easier, logical approach to worship theology, this revised edition of Worship Old and New is divided into four major sections, addressing the biblical foundation of worship, its theology, its history, and its practice. New information has been incorporated into each section to give the reader a better grasp of the biblical themes of worship, a deeper understanding of Old Testament customs, and a solid grounding in modern-day renewal movements.Especially significant is a reexamination of the actual practice of worship that goes beyond the merely academic to provide a practical perspective through the eyes of the worship leader and worshipers.Well-versed in the best of both past and present, Worship Old and New is a scholarly, up-to-date, and thought-provoking resource for those serious about exploring worship.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qWrKQWmnWEAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Shipping News: A Screenplay by Robert Nelson Jacobs","description":"Based on E.

Little has been written, however, of the air support that guaranteed the drive s success. Paving the way for the rush to Baghdad was  the hammer from above in the form of attack helicopters, jet fighters, transport, and other support aircraft. Now a former Marine fighter pilot shares the gripping never-before-told stories of the Marines who helped bring to an end the regime of Saddam Hussein. As Jay Stout reveals, the air war had actually been in the planning stages ever since the victory of Operation Desert Storm, twelve years earlier. But when Operation Iraqi Freedom officially commenced on March 20, 2003, the Marine Corps entered the fight with an aviation arm at its smallest since before World War II. Still, with the motto  Speed Equals Success,  the separate air and ground units acted as a team to get the job done. Drawing on exclusive interviews with the men and women who flew the harrowing missions, Hammer from Above reveals how pilots and their machines were tested to the limits of endurance, venturing well beyond what they were trained and designed to do. Stout takes us into the cockpits, revealing what it was like to fly these intense combat operations for up to eighteen hours at a time and to face incredible volumes of fire that literally shredded aircraft in midair during battles like that over An Nasiriyah . With its dynamic descriptions of perilous flights and bombing runs, Hammer from Above is a worthy tribute to the men and women who flew and maintained the aircraft that so inspired their brothers in arms and terrified the enemy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3-Snm0CZWD4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Hitler/Hess Deception","description":"This text aims to shed light on discoveries which claim to reveal the truth about Rudolph Hess' solo flight to Britain in May 1941 and explain the British government's 60-year-long silence as to what the Hess mission was all about.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=looiAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+Hitler/Hess+Deception&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Quit Your Day Job!: How to Sleep Late, Do What You Enjoy, and Make a Ton of Money as a Writer","description":"A candid, no-nonsense appraisal of the daily grind to the writer's life.

If the experience of most black Americans says otherwise, an explanation has been sorely lacking or obscured by the passions the issue provokes. At long last offering a cool, clear, and informed perspective on the subject, this book brings together a team of highly respected sociologists, political scientists, economists, criminologists, and legal scholars to scrutinize the logic and evidence behind the widely held belief in a color-blind society and to provide an alternative explanation for continued racial inequality in the United States. While not denying the economic advances of black Americans since the 1960s, Whitewashing Race draws on new and compelling research to demonstrate the persistence of racism and the effects of organized racial advantage across many institutions in American society including the labor market, the welfare state, the criminal justice system, and schools and universities. Looking beyond the stalled debate over current antidiscrimination policies, the authors also put forth a fresh vision for achieving genuine racial equality of opportunity in a post-affirmative action world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_EwuLgYWeYMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Peter, Paul & Mary Deluxe Anthology (Voice/Piano/Guitar)","description":"This carefully crafted and collectible volume tells the intimate story of Peter, Paul, and Mary and their music, in their words and with iconic images that follow their passionate, fifty-year journey to the center of America s heart. Photographs, many rare and never before published, taken over five decades by some of the world s top photographers, follow them from their earliest performances in the 1960s, when Mary was the most desired, beautiful, and charismatic performer and a new role model for women. Follow the trio as they lead America to discover the passionate soul of folk music. Join the struggle for racial equality, social justice, and freedom in this memorable journey, from the historic 1963 March on Washington with Martin Luther King, Jr., to the trio s appearance before a half million people in 1969 to end the Vietnam War, to their singing at the Hollywood Bowl for Survival Sunday in 1978, helping to launch the anti-nuke movement, the world s first international environmental movement. Through these images, readers will feel and almost hear the trio s songs calling for a more caring, better world as they performed with a courage and conviction that became for so many the embodiment and soundtrack of their generation s awakening to conscience, to activism, and to a new dream for all of humankind. Peter, Paul, and Mary s songs of defiant hope and a certain unmasked innocence are still a powerful part of our American consciousness, and this book reenacts the history of how the trio marked many lives with their indelible stamp of honesty of the sort we all yearn to recapture and recreate today for ourselves, our children, and the generations to come.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Eco8BQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE WORLD OF ODYSSEUS","description":"The World of Odysseus is a concise and penetrating account of the society that gave birth to the Iliad and the Odyssey--a book that provides a vivid picture of the Greek Dark Ages, its men and women, works and days, morals and values.

But few seem to know much about his remarkable life. The son of a knight in the court of Portugal's king, he renounced his heritage of wealth and power to become a Franciscan priest. In the years to come, he earned international fame as a preacher, reformer, miracle worker, champion of the poor, and Doctor of the Church. A generation ago, the American Catholic novelist John Edward Beahn presented Anthony's life and legends in a biographical novel, A Rich Young Man: A Novel Based on the Life of St. Anthony of Padua, published in 1953. This imaginative re-telling of the saint s story, based on historical records and traditions, now comes to life again in the TAN Legend series of biographical fiction. The tale unfolds in the epic setting of medieval Europe of the thirteenth century. Monarchs, courtiers, churchmen, knights, nobles and serfs maneuver like chess pieces in an elaborate game of alliances and conflicts between Church and state, Christian and Muslim, Catholic and heretic. Anthony's story takes us from North Africa where divine providence saved the young friar from his mistaken zeal for martyrdom to Italy and France, where his extraordinary gifts and heroic passion for God blazed a path to the rescue and conversion of countless souls. This TAN Legend edition of A Rich Young Man: A Novel Based on the Life of St. Anthony of Padua paints a rich, fascinating portrait of an astonishing saint who turned the medieval Christian world upside down.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_gQrnwEACAAJ&dq=A+Rich+Young+Man,+Saint+Anthony+of+Padua&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fourth Mansions","description":"Seven very special people blending to create a higher form of humanity...

Harry Pfanz, a former historian at Gettysburg National Military Park, has written a definitive account of the second day's brutal combat. He begins by introducing the men and units that were to do battle, analyzing the strategic intentions of Lee and Meade as commanders of the opposing armies, and describing the concentration of forces in the area around Gettysburg. He then examines the development of tactical plans and the deployment of troops for the approaching battle. But the emphasis is on the fighting itself. Pfanz provides a thorough account of the Confederates' smashing assaults -- at Devil's Den and Litle Round Top, through the Wheatfield and the Peach Orchard, and against the Union center at Cemetery Ridge. He also details the Union defense that eventually succeeded in beating back these assaults, depriving Lee's gallant army of victory. Pfanz analyzes decisions and events that have sparked debate for more than a century. In particular he discusses factors underlying the Meade-Sickles controversy and the questions about Longstreet's delay in attacking the Union left. The narrative is also enhanced by thirteen superb maps, more than eighty illustrations, brief portraits of the leading commanders, and observations on artillery, weapons, and tactics that will be of help even to knowledgeable readers. Gettysburg--The Second Day is certain to become a Civil War classic. What makes the work so authoritative is Pfanz' mastery of the Gettysburg literature and his unparalleled knowledge of the ground on which the fighting occurred. His sources include the Official Records, regimental histories and personal reminiscences from soldiers North and South, personal papers and diaries, newspaper files, and last -- but assuredly not least -- the Gettysburg battlefield. Pfanz's career in the National Park Service included a ten-year assignment as a park historian at Gettysburg. Without doubt, he knows the terrain of the battle as well as he knows the battle itself.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tZSsAY9LBIgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Quadrille;: A romantic comedy in three acts","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=duvvzAEACAAJ&dq=Quadrille%3B:+A+romantic+comedy+in+three+acts&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Imagery of Lynching: Black Men, White Women, and the Mob","description":"An analysis of over one hundred artistic representations of lynching addresses issues of race and racial violence throughout American history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=O3ZldmMty7UC&dq=Imagery+of+Lynching:+Black+Men,+White+Women,+and+the+Mob&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Severed At The Cord","description":"The African American male loses his mind at birth most will never adapt to society.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=B-kHAAAACAAJ&dq=Severed+At+The+Cord&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"RARE SPACE: POEMS.","description":"Poets have long been stargazers, moved by the strange infinities of the universe to translate them into metaphor and song.

It is suggested that these three theorists, associated with poststructuralism and postmodernism, respond to Weber's account of the rise, nature and trajectory of modern culture by pursuing highly imaginative and coherent strategies of affirmation and re-enchantment.; Examining the work of these three key thinkers in this way casts new light on Weber's sociology of rationalization and his theory of the crisis of modernity. It also specifies the nature of transgressive critiques of modern culture and their strengths and weaknesses.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=u0uGzQEACAAJ&dq=Max+Weber+and+Postmodern+Theory:+Rationalization+Versus+Re-enchantment&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The bears' vacation,","description":"Illus. in full color.

Those who have endeavoured to read Chinese texts apart from the apprehension of a Sanskrit background have generally made a fallacious interpretation, for the Buddhist canon is basically translation, or analogous to translation. In consequence, a large number of terms existing are employed approximately to connote imported ideas, as the various Chinese translators understood those ideas. Various translators invented different terms; and, even when the same term was finally adopted, its connotation varied, sometimes widely, from the Chinese term of phrase as normally used by the Chinese. For instance, kl sa undoubtedly has a meaning in Sanskrit similar to that of, i.e. affliction, distress, trouble. In Buddhism affliction (or, as it may be understood from Chinese, the afflicters, distressers, troublers) means passions and illusions; and consequently fan-nao in Buddhist phraseology has acquired this technical connotation of the passions and illusions. Many terms of a similar character are noted in the body of this work. Consequent partly on this use of ordinary terms, even a well-educated Chinese without a knowledge of the technical equivalents finds himself unable to understand their implications.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TMOSDE1RIuAC&dq=A+Dictionary+of+Chinese+Buddhist+Terms:+With+Sanskrit+and+English+Equivalents+and+a+Sanskrit-Pali+Index&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The History and Origins of Druidism","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ocsoAAAAYAAJ&dq=The+History+and+Origins+of+Druidism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Sayings of J.

The leader made two charges: 1) David Cuchat operated an evil business, a dance pavilion, that threatened the morals of 100 percent Americans; 2) David Cuchat was a Catholic and thus was loyal to the Pope at Rome, not to the government of the United States. Told to leave with his family in one week or suffer the consequences, Dave declared to the klan his right as a U.S. citizen to operate a legal business and to attend a church of choice. To demonstrate how he would protect his family and his business, he blasted a series of clay pigeons out of the air with deadly accuracy. The klan left quickly. During the anxiety-filled summer, in which Dave's alcoholism added to the tension, his friends strove to help him short-circuit klan activities. In September, however, the family's constant fears were realized and they were plunged into numbing despair - a despair, though, that quickly turned to hope when their neighbors offered the Cuchat family a chance to build a new and larger place to dance and possibly other attractions on the shores of Lake Buffalo.

Huck runs away, and meets Jim, a slave, who is also running away. So, here we have from the very beginning of the novel, two heavy topics: child abuse and slavery. Although Mark Twain has been criticized for his stereotypical presentation Jim, he  a white author  imbues Jim with much humanity in an era in which slaves were considered sub-human. Had any other writer dare do such a thing? Dis anyone else besides Jane Austen write about the slave trade? It took courage to deal with such themes.

Should the individual suffer to preserve society?Hence the universal importance of the book.To do honor to the original version, my editorial corrections are minimal.

By the last quarter of the century increasing numbers of babies were being delivered by men - a dramatic shift from the women-only ritual that had been standard throughout Western history. This authoritative and challenging work explains this transformation in medical practice and remarkable shift in gender relations. By tracing the actual development and transmission of the new midwifery skills through the period, the book addresses both technological and feminist arguments of the period. The study is distinctive in treating childbirth as both a bodily and a social event and in explaining how the two were intimately connected. Practical obstetrics is shown to have been shaped by the social relations surrounding deliveries, and specific techniques were associated with distinctive places and political allegiances. The books studies how increasing numbers emergent male-midwives had overtaken women in the skill of delivering children and how as such expectant mothers chose to use these male-midwives, thus heralding the growth of male-midwives in the period.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Q_fDygEACAAJ&dq=The+Making+of+Man-Midwifery:+Childbirth+in+England,+1660-1770&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Dictionary of Costume","description":"Fascinating, fact-filled compendium defines over 10,000 words associated with wearing apparel and fashion.

It tells the story of Barnabas Barty, the son of John Barty, the former boxing champion of England and landlord of a pub in Kent. At the start of the tale, Barnabas comes fortuitously into the possession of a vast fortune - ?700,000, an astronomical amount by Regency standards - and determines to use this fortune to become a gentleman. His father objects to this plan and they quarrel. They settle their differences in a round of fisticuffs, which Barnabas wins, beating his father fair and square. Barnabas sets off for London to further his ambitions and, on the way there, contrives to make a number of influential friends and enemies.[1]Farnol exploits the na?vety of the youth for comic effect.

Integrating and interoperating at high transmission levels with telephone and cable broadcast infrastructure to allow for faster, clearer transmission of data-intensive Web pages, DSLs and cable modems are competing for attention in this massive emerging market. For network managers, LAN administrators, and corporate planners charged with purchasing, installing, and troubleshooting last-mile technology for their organizations, Gilbert Held details what you'll need to know to make informed choices for the future. Offering simple explanations and in-depth comparisons, this book considers the whole range of strategic, technical, and investment concerns, from cost analysis and bandwidth limitations to suitability for various business and residential applications. Held discusses why a new generation of modems is needed and why those modems require a different infrastructure from those that transmit data over the PSTN. The fundamentals of DSLs are presented along with a look at how cable modems operate. And a comprehensive comparison of DSL and cable modem technology is provided that covers their advantages and disadvantages as well as their potential use for business and residential subscribers. This book contains everything you'll need to know about next- generation modems including: * Information on how infrastructure and content variables map to Web wait time * Transmission fundamentals for current modem operations * Discussions on how different types of DSLs overcome bandwidth limitations * A survey of the DSL family * A tutorial in the cable TV infrastructure * Coverage of the cable modem standard * Comparative analysis of costs, throughput, and suitability for various applications","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ym5TAAAAMAAJ&dq=Next-Generation+Modems:+A+Professional+Guide+to+DSL+and+Cable+Modems&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Illuminated Initials in Full Color : 548 Designs","description":"Among the glories of extant medieval manuscripts are the splendid illuminated initials in which geometric, curvilinear, animal, religious and other motifs intertwine to form extraordinarily beautiful and decorative letters.

Dennis Gerard Embo, eldest of six adopted children, dreamed of serving as a Catholic missionary priest in central Africa. Not long after entering the seminary in 1970, Embo abandoned Catholicism and became an ardent disciple of an eccentric, West Coast advertising-genius-turned-televangelist by the name of Herbert W. Armstrong. The eventful journey includes Embo's sometimes-bizarre experiences after pledging unquestioning allegiance to Armstrong's secretive, heretical sect-the Worldwide Church of God. Only years after the death of Herbert Armstrong did Embo and tens of thousands of other sect members awaken, as if out of a spiritual stupor, to acknowledge the extent of their departure from the historic Christian faith. Thus begins Embo's pilgrimage with his wife back to the Catholic faith. Embo's poignant reunion with his birthmother in 1977 is a critical part of his story. His experiences as an adoptee later brought him to a profound appreciation of Catholicism's 2,000 year-old proclamation of the Gospel of Life. The God That Prevailed is a thrilling and inspiring spiritual journey.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0qM6mQEACAAJ&dq=The+God+That+Prevailed:+One+Man%27s+Search+for+Spiritual+Truth+from+Catholic+Seminary+to+Herbert+Armstrong%27s+Cult,+and+His+Amazing+Return+to+His+Faith&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An Embedded Software Primer","description":"Simon introduces the broad range of applications for embedded software and then reviews each major issue facing developers, offering practical solutions, techniques, and good habits that apply no matter which processor, real-time operating systems, methodology, or application is used.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xG2ZD55_BJAC&dq=An+Embedded+Software+Primer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chatterton Square","description":"A study of contrasting characters, the scene of which is a town on the west coast of England in 1938 and 1939.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5ZVAAAAAIAAJ&dq=Chatterton+Square&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My spiritual aeroplane","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Iao_AAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Life in the Oceans (Life in the...)","description":"Sylvia Earle first lost her heart to the ocean as a young girl when she discovered the wonders of the Gulf of Mexico in her backyard.

The war changed forever the face of the nation, the nature of American politics, the status of African-Americans, and the daily lives of millions of people. Yet few of us understand how the war transformed gender roles and attitudes toward sexuality among American citizens. Divided Houses is the first book to address this sorely neglected topic, showing how the themes of gender, class, race, and sexuality interacted to forge the beginnings of a new society. In this unique volume, historians Catherine Clinton and Nina Silber bring together a wide spectrum of critical viewpoints--all written by eminent scholars--to show how gender became a prism through which the political tensions of antebellum America were filtered and focused. For example, Divided Houses demonstrates that the abolitionist movement was strongly allied with nineteenth-century feminism, and shows how the ensuing debates over sectionalism and, eventually, secession, were often couched in terms of gender. Northerners and Southerners alike frequently ridiculed each other as \\"effeminate\\": slaveowners were characterized by Yankees as idle and useless aristocrats, enfeebled by their \\"peculiar institution\\"; northerners were belittled as money-grubbers who lacked the masculine courage of their southern counterparts. Through the course of the book, many fascinating subjects are explored, such as the new \\"manly\\" responsibilities both black and white men had thrust upon them as soldiers; the effect of the war on Southern women's daily actions on the homefront; the essential part Northern women played as nurses and spies; the war's impact on marriage and divorce; women's roles in the guerilla fighting; even the wartime dialogue on interracial sex. There is also a rare look at how gender affected the experience of freedom for African-American children, a discussion of how Harriet Beecher Stowe attempted to distract both her readers and herself from the ravages of war through the writing of romantic fiction, and a consideration of the changing relations between black men and a white society which, during the war, at last forced to confront their manhood. In addition, an incisive introduction by Pulitzer Prize-winning historian James McPherson helps place these various subjects in an overall historical context. Nowhere else are such topics considered in a single, accessible volume. Divided Houses sheds new light on the entire Civil War experience--from its causes to its legacy--and shows how gender shaped both the actions and attitudes of those who participated in this watershed event in the history of America.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wrZc6xmH_KgC&dq=Divided+Houses:+Gender+and+the+Civil+War&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Porridge Poetry","description":"Hugh Lofting, best known for creating Doctor Dolittle, also wrote and illustrated other children's books of which \\"Porridge Poetry\\" is one of the most engaging.

Learn the art from designer Lauren Harpster in this new publication made specifically for beginners who've never touched beads or wire, but is also an excellent resource for experienced French Beading artists. This title is a hard copy of my Learn French Beading: Beginner Course video series on YouTube. Instructions for accessing the videos are included inside the book (Videos will be available after Feb 29th). *Part 1 is the \\"Getting Started\\" guide. Before making French Beaded Flowers it is very important to understand the materials needed to make them. This section explores tools, beads, wire, and other supplies in detail, though not all of them will be necessary for this course. *Part 2 is the \\"Technique Guide\\", which contains six lessons that teach the techniques included in this course - Continuous Loops, Continuous Crossover Loops, Continuous Wraparound Loops, Fringe, Basic Frame, and Lacing. These lessons are important for learning French Beading terms and abbreviations, and how to read French Beading patterns. I like to teach techniques separately from flower patterns because there's so much more I can teach you about an individual technique than what I can cover in a single flower pattern. There are also some variations of the techniques that are not used in the practice patterns, but are included for education and reference. This section is also intended to be a one-stop technique reference so you can quickly look up specific techniques while working with other flower patterns. Each lesson has a video demonstration so you can see the techniques in action, but they also contain picture and written instructions for the techniques. *Part 3 contains four wildflower patterns that I've developed specifically for helping you practice the base techniques learned in Part 2 - Lavender, Dame's Rocket, Blue Virgin's Bower, and Black-Eyed Susan. The patterns have been written with beginners in mind and contain a high level of detail, so they're a great way to dip your toes into the art. This section is important for seeing practical application of the techniques, reinforcing the ability to read patterns, and learning how to assemble and shape a variety of flowers. I have also made video demonstrations of each of the flowers. While I demonstrate flower parts fully in the videos, I only show techniques as they are used in that particular flower. So you can start with Part 3 if you use the videos, but I do recommend that you go back through the lessons in Part 2. *Part 4 will demonstrate how to arrange the flowers from Part 3 to make a wildflower arrangement. I am not a professional florist, but I'd like to share what I've learned about arranging beaded flowers.

In psychological experiments, people are unable to estimate \\"fair\\" prices accurately and are strongly influenced by the unconscious, irrational, and politically incorrect. It hasn't taken long for marketers to apply these findings. \\"Price consultants\\" advise retailers on how to convince consumers to pay more for less, and negotiation coaches offer similar advice for businesspeople cutting deals. The new psychology of price dictates the design of price tags, menus, rebates, \\"sale\\" ads, cell phone plans, supermarket aisles, real estate offers, wage packages, tort demands, and corporate buyouts. Prices are the most pervasive hidden persuaders of all. Rooted in the emerging field of behavioral decision theory, Priceless should prove indispensable to anyone who negotiates.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=N7nhwAEACAAJ&dq=Priceless&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Star Raiders Graphic Novel #1","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6XmWZwEACAAJ&dq=Star+Raiders+Graphic+Novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Burden of Dreams: History and Identity in Post-Soviet Ukraine (Post-Communist Cultural Studies)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=k44rN1V8W90C&dq=Burden+of+Dreams:+History+and+Identity+in+Post-Soviet+Ukraine+(Post-Communist+Cultural+Studies)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ruins of Angkor Cambodia in 1909","description":"This volume is a facsimile reprint of the extremely rare 1909 edition of P.

Within the next few years, global production will peak. Thereafter, even if industrial societies begin to switch to alternative energy sources, they will have less net energy each year to do all the work essential to the survival of complex societies. We are entering a new era, as different from the industrial era as the latter was from medieval times. In The Party s Over, Richard Heinberg places this momentous transition in historical context, showing how industrialism arose from the harnessing of fossil fuels, how competition to control access to oil shaped the geopolitics of the twentieth century and how contention for dwindling energy resources in the twenty-first century will lead to resource wars in the Middle East, Central Asia and South America. He describes the likely impacts of oil depletion and all of the energy alternatives. Predicting chaos unless the United States the world s foremost oil consumer is willing to join with other countries to implement a global program of resource conservation and sharing, he also recommends a  managed collapse  that might make way for a slower-paced, low-energy, sustainable society in the future. More readable than other accounts of this issue, with fuller discussion of the context, social implications and recommendations for personal, community, national and global action, Heinberg s updated book is a riveting wake-up call for human-kind as the oil era winds down, and a critical tool for understanding and influencing current US foreign policy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XIsfb8CN6qkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Writing CopyFor Dummies (For Dummies (Career/Education))","description":"Tips on writing to consumers and business-to-business Create captivating, results-oriented, sales-generating copy Need to produce winning copy for your business?

As photochromism bridges molecular, supramolecular and solid state chemistry, as well as organic, inorganic and physical chemistry, such a treatment requires a multidisciplinary approach and a broad presentation. The first edition (1990) provided an enormous amount of new concepts and data, such as the presentation of main families based on the pericyclic reaction mechanism, the review of new families, some bimolecular photocycloadditions and some promising systems. This new edition provides an efficient entry into this flourishing field, with the core content retained from the original work to provide a basic introduction into the different subjects. *Second edition of a work first published in 1990, now revised due to constant development of research. *Including updated lists of references (1989-2001), offering immediate access to recent developments. *Providing great basic interest and high application potential bringing scientists together from chemistry, physics and engineering.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=i-m3tFfXAngC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The foot book, (A Bright & early book)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9Vkgc2GrH-YC&dq=The+foot+book,+(A+Bright&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder: Assessment, Differential Diagnosis and Forensic Evaluation","description":"An excellent resource for psychologists, psychiatrists, and lawyers involved in litigation concerning post-traumatic stress disorder.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9iMpAAAAYAAJ&dq=Post-Traumatic+Stress+Disorder:+Assessment,+Differential+Diagnosis+and+Forensic+Evaluation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"City Smart: Tampa/St. Petersburg","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aFs8PQAACAAJ&dq=City+Smart:+Tampa/St.+Petersburg&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Dynamic of Faith","description":"One of the greatest books ever written on the subject, Dynamics of Faithis a primer in the philosophy of religion.

The paint removal process typically involves the use of toxic chemicals such as methylene chloride which are soon to be banned as a result of impending environmental regulations and increased costs associated with handling and disposing of such material. The Air Force must choose an alternative to methylene chloride chemical stripping which complies with environmental regulations and reduces costs. This thesis compares the life cycle costs and environmental impacts of two alternatives to chemical aircraft stripping. Plastic Media Blasting (PMB) and Modified Medium Pressure Water (MPW) are compared based on stripping a C-l30 aircraft by the PMB process at the Lockheed Aircraft Service Center in Ontario, CA and the MPW process by Warner-Robins AFB, GA.

We need an effective way to cross the bridge ... or a new bridge. Ronald Farmer suggests that a \\"process hermeneutic\\" holds promise of moving biblical interpretation beyond the current impasse. This is the first comprehensive introduction to a process hermeneutic. It is not, however, merely theoretical discussion, but moves from the side of biblical scholarship to develop a solid methodology for bridging the gap between text and life.

In this incisive and accessible account, distinguished Catholic historian Jay P. Dolan explores the way American Catholicism has taken its distinctive shape and follows how Catholics have met the challenges they have faced as New World followers of an Old World religion. Dolan argues that the ideals of democracy, and American culture in general, have deeply shaped Catholicism in the United States as far back as 1789, when the nation's first bishop was elected by the clergy (and the pope accepted their choice). Dolan looks at the tension between democratic values and Catholic doctrine from the conservative reaction after the fall of Napoleon to the impact of the Second Vatican Council. Furthermore, he explores grassroots devotional life, the struggle against nativism, the impact and collision of different immigrant groups, and the disputed issue of gender. Today Dolan writes, the tensions remain, as we see signs of a resurgent traditionalism in the church in response to the liberalizing trend launched by John XXIII, and also a resistance to the conservatism of John Paul II. In this lucid account, the unfinished story of Catholicism in America emerges clearly and compellingly, illuminating the inner life of the church and of the nation.

For the first time in European history, there emerged three genders: men, women, and a third gender of adult effeminate sodomites, or homosexuals. This third gender had radical consequences for the sexual lives of most men and women since it promoted an opposing ideal of exclusive heterosexuality. In Sex and the Gender Revolution, Randolph Trumbach reconstructs the worlds of eighteenth-century prostitution, illegitimacy, sexual violence, and adultery. In those worlds the majority of men became heterosexuals by avoiding sodomy and sodomite behavior. As men defined themselves more and more as heterosexuals, women generally experienced the new male heterosexuality as its victims. But women as prostitutes, seduced servants, remarrying widows, and adulterous wives  also pursued passion. The seamy sexual underworld of extramarital behavior was central not only to the sexual lives of men and women, but to the very existence of marriage, the family, domesticity, and romantic love. London emerges as not only a geographical site but as an actor in its own right, mapping out domains where patriarchy, heterosexuality, domesticity, and female resistance take vivid form in our imaginations and senses. As comprehensive and authoritative as it is eloquent and provocative, this book will become an indispensable study for social and cultural historians and delightful reading for anyone interested in taking a close look at sex and gender in eighteenth-century London.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=v_y4BEZUmOIC&dq=Sex+and+the+Gender+Revolution,+Volume+1:+Heterosexuality+and+the+Third+Gender+in+Enlightenment+London+(The+Chicago+Series+on+Sexuality,+History,+and+Society)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stung (Left Behind: The Young Trib Force #5)","description":"Four teens battle the forces of evil when they are left behind after the Rapture.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cY7Lj3U6vb8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The C4 Corvette Sourcebook","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8FSUkQEACAAJ&dq=The+C4+Corvette+Sourcebook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hunter the Reckoning Survival Guide (HtR RPG)","description":"For centuries, supernatural powers have reigned, warring among themselves, culling the human herds and lashing out from the shadows.

In the summers of 1990 and 1992 I have organized and taught summer schools in computer algebra at the Universitat Linz. Gradually a set of course notes has emerged from these activities. People have asked me for copies of the course notes, and different versions of them have been circulating for a few years. Finally I decided that I should really take the time to write the material up in a coherent way and make a book out of it. Here, now, is the result of this work. Over the years many students have been helpful in improving the quality of the notes, and also several colleagues at Linz and elsewhere have contributed to it. I want to thank them all for their effort, in particular I want to thank B. Buchberger, who taught me the theory of Grabner bases nearly two decades ago, B. F. Caviness and B. D. Saunders, who first stimulated my interest in various problems in computer algebra, G. E. Collins, who showed me how to compute in algebraic domains, and J. R. Sendra, with whom I started to apply computer algebra methods to problems in algebraic geometry. Several colleagues have suggested improvements in earlier versions of this book. However, I want to make it clear that I am responsible for all remaining mistakes.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yoqrCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Literature: An Introduction to Fiction, Poetry, and Drama, Compact Edition (4th Edition)","description":"Representing the largest expansion between editions, this updated volume of Ottemiller's Index to Plays in Collections is the standard location tool for full-length plays published in collections and anthologies in England and the United States throughout the 20th century and beyond.

Barton Payne has compiled the one complete guide to Biblical prophecy. From the prediction of Adam's death in Genesis 2: 17 to the prophecy of mankind's perpetual worship of God in the new heaven and earth (Psalm 72:5), the ENCYCLOPEDIA OF BIBLICAL PROPHECY discusses every verse of prophetic matter in Scripture. It identifies every probable point of fulfillment whether in the past, present, or still in the future. The first 144 pages of the ENCYCLOPEDIA OF BIBLICAL PROPHECY set forth a systematic approach to the subject of Biblical prophecy and the legitimate place for prediction in it. The ENCYCLOPEDIA is arranged according to the 66 books of the Bible. In each book, all the verses on one prophetic theme are treated in one combined discussion. For example: The 12 verses of Genesis that foretell God's granting of the land of Canaan to the descendants of Abraham are discussed together. It is then shown how the promise was fulfilled in the days of Joshua. One of the ENCYCLOPEDIA'S concluding summaries lists all the 737 major subjects that appear in Biblical prediction, with the books and paragraphs in which each is found. This way, each prophecy can be traced from its first appearance in the Bible to its last. Among the many features is a complete list of all the Scriptural prophecies pertaining to Christ. No other book has ever examined Biblical prophecy so thoroughly or presented it in such a balanced perspective as the ENCYCLOPEDIA OF BIBLICAL PROPHECY. ?1,817 entries covering all the Biblical predictions in both the Old and New Testaments ?A complete discussion of all 8,352 predictive verses in the Bible ?14 tables, including three on the Book of Revelation ?Bibliography ?4 summaries ?4 statistical appendixes ?5 complete indexes An indispensable tool for students of the Bible, for students in theological seminaries and Bible colleges, for pastors as a reference guide, and for concerned lay people.

The British poets Michael Hofmann and James Lasdun have invited more than forty leading English-language poets to create their own idiomatic contemporary versions of some of the most famous and notorious stories from the Metamorphoses. Apollo and Daphne, Pyramus and Thisbe, Proserpina, Marsyas, Medea, Baucis and Philemon, Orpheus and Eurydice - these and many other deathless myths are brought to startling, fresh life in exciting new versions. The contributors - among them Fleur Adcock, Amy Clampitt, Thom Gunn, Seamus Heaney, Ted Hughes, Lawrence Joseph, Kenneth Koch, Michael Longley, Paul Muldoon, Les Murray, Robert Pinsky, Frederick Seidel, Charles Simic, and C. K. Williams - constitute an impressive roster of major makers of poetry in our language. After Ovid is thus both a powerful reenvisioning of a fundamental work of literature and a remarkable sounding of the state of poetry in English now.\\"--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

They would be married, have children . . . be fisherfolk as had generations before them. But before they could wed, he was called back to the land of his birth, a land beyond the shore of Superior, beyond Earth, a magical land where he was more than a fisherman. He had to go.

Cox refines our conception of 'second generation' Romanticism by placing it within the circle of writers around Leigh Hunt that came to be known as the 'Cockney School'. Offering a theory of the group as a key site for cultural production, Cox challenges the traditional image of the Romantic poet as an isolated figure by recreating the social nature of the work of Shelley, Keats, Hunt, Hazlitt, Byron, and others, as they engaged in literary contests, wrote poems celebrating one another, and worked collaboratively on journals and other projects. Cox also recovers the work of neglected writers such as John Hamilton Reynolds, Horace Smith, and Cornelius Webb as part of the rich social and cultural context of Hunt's circle. This book not only demonstrates convincingly that a 'Cockney School' existed, but shows that it was committed to putting literature in the service of social, cultural, and political reform.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lPhHFJavH8sC&dq=Poetry+and+Politics+in+the+Cockney+School:+Keats,+Shelley,+Hunt+and+their+Circle+(Cambridge+Studies+in+Romanticism)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Artful Dodger","description":"The British author and illustrator reflects on his childhood and art school days as the influence behind his abstract paintings and illustrations, and highlights the creation of his Griffin & Sabine trilogy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GDPwBhpEtAIC&dq=The+Artful+Dodger&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Relativity and common sense,: A new approach to Einstein (Science study series)","description":"This radically reoriented and popular presentation of Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity derives its concepts from Newtonian ideas rather than by opposing them.

Even more shocking was his daring escape from Japan, packed into a box and put on a private jet to Lebanon after months spent in a Japanese detention center, subsisting on rice gruel. This is the saga of what led to the Ghosn Shock and what was left in its wake. Ghosn spent two decades building a colossal partnership between Nissan and Renault that looked like a new model for a global business, but the alliance's shiny image fronted an unsteady, tense operation. Culture clashes, infighting among executives and engineers, dueling corporate traditions, and government maneuvering constantly threatened the venture. Journalists Hans Greimel and William Sposato have followed the story up close, with access to key players, including Ghosn himself. Veteran Tokyo-based reporters, they have witnessed the end of Japan's bubble economy and attempts at opening Japan Inc. to the world. They've seen the fraying of keiretsu, Japan's traditional skein of business relationships, and covered numerous corporate scandals, of which the Ghosn Shock and Ghosn's subsequent escape stand above all. Expertly reported, Collision Course explores the complex suspicions around what and who was really responsible for Ghosn's ouster and why one of the top executives in the world would risk everything to escape the country. It explains how economics, history, national interests, cultural politics, and hubris collided, crumpling the legacy of arguably the most important foreign businessman ever to set foot in Japan. This gripping, unforgettable narrative, full of fascinating characters, serves as part cautionary tale, part object lesson, and part forewarning of the increasing complexity of doing global business in a nationalistic world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SSIAEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cooking for Heart and Soul: 100 Delicious Low-Fat Recipes from San Francisco's Top ChefsA Cookbook to Benefit the San Francisco Food Bank","description":"Offers healthy recipes for soups, salads, pastas, entrees, side dishes, and desserts","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uCj9Eh2rOvkC&dq=Cooking+for+Heart+and+Soul:+100+Delicious+Low-Fat+Recipes+from+San+Francisco%27s+Top+ChefsA+Cookbook+to+Benefit+the+San+Francisco+Food+Bank&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mad As a Wet Hen: And Other Funny Idioms","description":"Illustrates and explains over 100 common English idioms, in categories including animals, body parts, and colors.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gnjKw_QcuwYC&dq=Mad+As+a+Wet+Hen:+And+Other+Funny+Idioms&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Mystic Test Book or the Magic of the Cards","description":"The publication of this work was, we might say, forced upon us by the demand, before even a page of manuscript was prepared for the press.

These brothers and sisters naturally wished to perfect themselves in emblem reading as rapidly as possible, and they could not so perfect themselves, without a full and complete set of tables that they could study and refer to at will. The next trouble that arose was the question of expense, as, aside from the printing, engraving, binding, electrotyping and matters of that kind, the author's time was, and is now so valuable that the item far overbalances those mentioned.

In the early 1980s, doctors began to experiment with thorough sweating as a way of purging the body of harmful chemicals. The use of a sauna was found surprisingly effective for treatment of a variety of illnesses. Information on sauna detoxification therapy is therefore presented here in full so that MCS sufferers can make informed choices. The causes and symptoms of MCS are discussed, along with current medical information. Real life experiences of those who have chosen sauna treatment are provided with a look at such options as health clubs, detox centers and home sauna units.

In the years following the Civil War, first-generation Irish-American Zachary O'Hara, son of a legendary Marine and a force of a man in his own right, finds himself playing a critical role in the very future of the Marines. If he can persuade the Secretary of the Navy that the Marines are more crucial than ever to America's safety and security -- all the while hefting a heavier secret weight in his heart -- he'll save the corps and make his career. But there's an obstacle in his path that this warrior had not planned on. Amanda Blanton Kerr, the daughter of a ruthless industrialist, is a woman on a mission of her own; passionate, obstinate, and whip-smart, she's an heiress poised to blaze a trail for her sex. O'Hara's Choice is the story of the inevitable collision of these two handsome, fighting spirits. Getting their souls' desire could jeopardize everything they -- and their parents before them -- scraped and struggled to achieve. Duty to country, love of family, and a tormented passion intertwine in this latest epic by Leon Uris, international bestselling author of such classics as Exodus, Trinity, and Battle Cry. A riveting, sweeping tale in inimitable Uris style, O'Hara's Choice is this master of the historical novel at his most brilliant.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JJN9iBzj2EoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tichborne Impostor","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=30BHAQAAIAAJ&dq=Tichborne+Impostor&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"History of the Jews: From the Beginning to Early Christianity","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8M6xtQEACAAJ&dq=History+of+the+Jews:+From+the+Beginning+to+Early+Christianity&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Coloring Outside The Lines: A Memoir","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=59MRLUu9YMIC&dq=Coloring+Outside+The+Lines:+A+Memoir&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Network Analysis and Troubleshooting","description":"This complete, expert guide offers authoritative, real-world information to analyzing and troubleshooting networks.

For Simon Chapman, however, the jungle is the only place to be, and the denser and more remote the better. Which is why Chapman, along with two eccentric companions, took an all-too-collapsible canoe into the swamps and rainforests of Bolivia to find the mythical monster of the Madidi.

This book helps parents to work with their child's strengths to improve social skills. Following the suggestions and exercises in this book, parents can teach children to: pretend-play, use toys appropriately, know when to use conventional responses like -- excuse me -- tell jokes, recognise that others' feelings and thoughts are different from their own, and initiate social interaction with peers. Included are tips for using games, modelling, rewards, role play, videos, activity schedules, and social stories to teach social skills and make the learning experience fun for parents and children.

Although she desperately misses Avery and Mel, who are waitresses at a restaurant back home, she quickly falls head over heels for eco-warrior Steve, who has grown up in a commune on the West Coastso different from Nina's secure middle-class experience.

NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER Yuval Noah Harari, author of the critically-acclaimed New York Times bestseller and international phenomenon Sapiens, returns with an equally original, compelling, and provocative book, turning his focus toward humanity s future, and our quest to upgrade humans into gods. Over the past century humankind has managed to do the impossible and rein in famine, plague, and war. This may seem hard to accept, but, as Harari explains in his trademark style thorough, yet riveting famine, plague and war have been transformed from incomprehensible and uncontrollable forces of nature into manageable challenges. For the first time ever, more people die from eating too much than from eating too little; more people die from old age than from infectious diseases; and more people commit suicide than are killed by soldiers, terrorists and criminals put together. The average American is a thousand times more likely to die from binging at McDonalds than from being blown up by Al Qaeda. What then will replace famine, plague, and war at the top of the human agenda? As the self-made gods of planet earth, what destinies will we set ourselves, and which quests will we undertake? Homo Deus explores the projects, dreams and nightmares that will shape the twenty-first century from overcoming death to creating artificial life. It asks the fundamental questions: Where do we go from here? And how will we protect this fragile world from our own destructive powers? This is the next stage of evolution. This is Homo Deus. With the same insight and clarity that made Sapiens an international hit and a New York Times bestseller, Harari maps out our future.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=H2t_CwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Capes: Design Ideas for Renovating, Remodeling and Building New","description":"The second installment of Taunton's \\"Updating Classic America\\" series re-introduces readers to the classic Cape Cod home, featuring more than twenty case studies of updated houses.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Fkzxetk5ukMC&dq=Capes:+Design+Ideas+for+Renovating,+Remodeling+and+Building+New&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Handbook of Fourier Theorems","description":"A collection of the most important theorems in Fourier analysis includes applications and is presented without proof in a format that is accessible to the nonspecialist reader.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IkQoC1ava5sC&dq=A+Handbook+of+Fourier+Theorems&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Greenhouse construction and heating, (U.S. Dept. of Agriculture.

New York Review Books is reissuing two of the finest novels of this singular modern genius works that look forward to the blacky comic inventions of Muriel Spark as much as they do back to the drawing rooms of Jane Austen. A House and Its Head is Ivy Compton-Burnett's subversive look at the politics of family life, and perhaps the most unsparing of her novels. No sooner has Duncan Edgeworth's wife died than he takes a new, much younger bride whose willful ways provoke a series of transgressions that begins with adultery and ends, much to everyone's relief, in murder.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=z6DCFJf4wmEC&dq=House+and+Its+Head&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Our Time Is Now","description":"From New York Times bestselling author of Lead From The Outside and political leader Stacey Abrams, a blueprint to end voter suppression, empower our citizens, and take back our country. \\"With each page, she inspires and empowers us to create systems that reflect a world in which all voices are heard and all people believe and feel that they matter.\\"  Kerry Washington A recognized expert on fair voting and civic engagement, Abrams chronicles a chilling account of how the right to vote and the principle of democracy have been and continue to be under attack. Abrams would have been the first African American woman governor, but experienced these effects firsthand, despite running the most innovative race in modern politics as the Democratic nominee in Georgia. Abrams didn t win, but she has not conceded. The book compellingly argues for the importance of robust voter protections, an elevation of identity politics, engagement in the census, and a return to moral international leadership. Our Time Is Now draws on extensive research from national organizations and renowned scholars, as well as anecdotes from her life and others  who have fought throughout our country s history for the power to be heard. The stakes could not be higher. Here are concrete solutions and inspiration to stand up for who we are?now. \\"This is a narrative that describes the urgency that compels me and millions more to push for a different American story than the one being told today.

And many did, creating a counterculture built on drugs, rock music, sexual liberation, and communal living. The hippies preached free love, promoted flower power, and cautioned against trusting anyone over thirty. Eschewing money, materialism, and politics, they repudiated the mainstream values of the times. Along the way, these counterculturists created a lasting legacy and inspired long-lasting social changes. The Hippies and American Values uses an innovative approach to exploring the tenets of the counterculture movement. Rather than relying on interviews conducted years after the fact, Timothy Miller uses  underground  newspapers published at the time to provide a full and in-depth exploration. This reliance on primary sources brings an immediacy and vibrancy rarely seen in other studies of the period. Miller focuses primarily on the cultural revolutionaries rather than on the political radicals of the New Left. It examines the hippies  ethics of dope, sex, rock, community, and cultural opposition and surveys their effects on current American values. Filled with illustrations from alternative publications, along with posters, cartoons, and photographs, The Hippies and American Values provides a graphic look at America in the 1960s. This second edition features a new introduction and a thoroughly updated, well-documented text. Highly readable and engaging, this volume brings deep insight to the counterculture movement and the ways it changed America. The first edition became a widely used course-adoption favorite, and scholars and students of the 1960s will welcome the second edition of this thought-provoking book.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ahRFJLvt7gYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Forbidden Adventures: The History of the American Comics Group (Contributions to the Study of Popular Culture)","description":"A comprehensive history of a small, but important, comic book publisher.

A must-read tactical primer for today s warrior.  John C.  Doc  Bahnsen, Brigadier General, USA (Ret.) At the turn of the century a small, humorous book on tactics was published. The Defense of Duffer s Drift quickly became a bestseller and today is still widely read. The Defense of Hill 781 is a modem version of this classic a tactical primer with ample funpoking, but with serious lessons to be learned. Lt. Col. A. Tack Always Finds himself in the California high desert, alone, disheveled, confused. A guide soon appears to inform him of his situation: He has died and is now in Purgatory (his humility in the Army was somewhat lacking) where he must atone for past sins. Purgatory is, aptly, the U.S. Army s National Training Center (NTC), and Lt. Col. Always may earn his way out by completing a successful mission. Through a series of six missions, the reader plans and fights with Lt. Col. Always, making the split-second decisions that determine victory or defeat, life or death. Through successive difficulties, some important lessons are burned into the commander s brain lessons about tactics, about people, about what it takes to fight a winning battle. Like Duffer s Drift this book is a valuable resource for all military tacticians. For the armchair general, it is a fascinating look at how the members of a military unit work together in combat.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zGDZ43PhWEIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Leon's Story","description":"The son of a North Carolina sharecropper recalls the hard times faced by his family and other African Americans in the first half of the twentieth century and the changes that the civil rights movement helped bring about.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tlqHT3rmxRgC&dq=Leon%27s+Story&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Rexall Story: A History of Genius and Neglect","description":"Foreword (William L.

A woman who longs to avoid risk at all cost learns that men who love danger are the most exciting in this moving novel from New York Times bestselling author Danielle Steel. After a carefree childhood, Mary Margaret Kelly came of age in the shadow of grief. Her father, a dashing daredevil Air Force pilot, died when she was nine. Maggie saw her mother struggle to put their lives back together. As the family moved from one city to the next, her mother warned her to beware of daredevil men and avoid risk at all cost. Following her mother s advice, and forgoing the magic of first love with a high school boyfriend who was too wild to feel safe, Maggie instead sought out all the things her mother had lost a predictable partner, a stable home, and a regular paycheck. She chose to marry a dependable, kind man who was a reliable husband and successful accountant. Together they had a son and found happiness in a conventional suburban life. Until tragedy struck again. Now on her own, feeling a sense of adventure for the first time, Maggie decides to face her fears, setting off on a whirlwind trip from San Francisco to Rome, Paris, and Monaco. But when her travels reconnect her with the very same irresistible, thrill-seeking man she s spent thirty years trying to forget, Maggie becomes terrified that rushing into love and sharing his life may very well end in disaster.

They are looking for something: love, self-fulfillment, inspiration, or even just peace of mind. However, as the roads get windier and the jungle thicker, this na?ve pair realizes that all of the trappings of society-greed, drugs, violence and jealousy-exist even in the remotest of places. Even tiny Esmeralda has a secret agenda . . . While her prose remains hearfelt and spare, Nicholson, in The Road to Esmeralda, also reveals a political edge. In exploring the prejudices of a small Mexican town, she weaves a harrowing and tragic story of love, devastation, and what it means to be a young, intelligent American in a very angry world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Fd8KAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Alcoholics Anonymous","description":"The basic text for Alcoholics Anonymous.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iAs5onNf9xoC&dq=Alcoholics+Anonymous&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blackjack for Winners","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JMXsX2MpD5MC&dq=Blackjack+for+Winners&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Couples","description":" Trapped in their cozy catacombs, the couples have made sex by turns their toy, their glue, their trauma, their therapy, their hope, their frustration, their revenge, their narcotic, their main line of communication and their sole and pitiable shield against the awareness of death.

You see them bowing and falling down prostrate (in prayer), seeking bounty from Allah and (His) Good Pleasure. The mark of them (i.e. of their Faith) is on their faces (fore heads) from the traces of prostration (during prayers). This is their description in the Taurdt (Torah).

Some of which was fertile soil that absorbed rain-water and brought forth vegetation and grass in abundance. (And) another portion of it was hard and held the rain-water and Allah benefited the people with it and they utilized it for drinking, (making their animals drink from it) and to irrigate the land for cultivation. (And) a portion of it was barren which could neither hold the water nor bring forth vegetation (then that land gave no benefits). The first is the example of the person who comprehends Allah's Religion (Islam) and gets benefit (from the knowledge) which Allah (Azawajal) has revealed through me (the Prophet ) and learns and then teaches it to others.

But his greatest devastation is yet to be unleashed as he plans a monumental strike at the heart of America. On the trail of the Emir, Jack Ryan Jr. will find himself following in his legendary father s footsteps on a manhunt that will take him and his allies across the globe, into the shadowy arenas of political gamesmanship, and back onto U.S. soil in a race to prevent the possible fall of the West....","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=d1JYu9NVdKoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Standard of Excellence: Tenor Saxophone Book 1 (W21XB)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1anOtAEACAAJ&dq=Standard+of+Excellence:+Tenor+Saxophone+Book+1+(W21XB)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"All Eve's Hallows: A City Knights Novel","description":"The year's finest tales of terror Here is the latest edition of the world's premier annual showcase of horror and dark fantasy fiction.

One is the Swimmers, who have adapted to living in zero-gravity, and regard themselves as the next step in evolution, and those who prefer to live on the surface of a planet as little better than apes. The latter group, the Walkers, are not about to say farewell to the planets they grew up on, and think the Swimmers are not so much advanced as deranged. Crowell, born a Swimmer but now a Walker by choice, is caught in the middle as the two sides seem headed for war. Then he discovers the true cause of the altercation: a hidden alien race moving behind the scenes to provoke a war so that they can pick up the pieces after the two sides have obliterated each other. And if Crowell cannot head off the war and convince both sides of the existence of the real enemy, both branches of the human race may be headed for untimely extinction.

He found in Bushido, the Way of the Warrior, the sources of the virtues most admired by his people: rectitude, courage, benevolence, politeness, sincerity, honor, loyalty and self-control. His approach to his task was eclectic and far-reaching. On the one hand, he delved into the indigenous traditions, into Buddhism, Shintoism, Confucianism and the moral guidelines handed down over hundreds of years by Japan's samurai and sages. On the other hand, he sought similarities and contrasts by citing not only Western philosophers and statesmen, but also the shapers of European and American thought and civilization going back to the Romans, the Greeks and Biblical times. This book is a classic to which generations of scholars and laymen alike have long referred for insights into the character of the Japanese people.

Obviously some students are more apt to learn and show improvement than others. But the challenge facing educators comes from teaching those that do not readily show improvement, and then identifying what is causing their problems. Research indicates that the developing brains of youngsters often learn in different ways u struggling students are not necessarily poor learners, just unable to process the information as it was presented. By understanding the different ways in which studentse brains learn, and maintaining carefully recorded data of efforts, teachers can effectively teach students in the way most befitting their personal needs, which will result in demonstrated improvement and higher test scores. Smart Teaching: Using Brain Research and Data to Continuously Improve Learning can help any educator grow and expand a system that will make teaching more effective and more fun. Of course, that system should be pursued on a school-wide and district-wide basis as well as in individual classrooms. That is the positive requirement that is the foundation of the national No Child Left Behind program. More important, every student and every family has a right to expect such pursuit of quality in every classroom. the very simple system components of this book are derived from many resources - neuroscience, cognitive research projects, and observation of practice and results in K-12 and adult classrooms. This user-friendly guidebook contains many charts and diagrams to effectively convey the information in an easy-to-use format. the result is a tested and successful teaching system presented in a convenient yet powerful guide that will lead educators to bring about improvement.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4Ab_s4xdYzUC&dq=Smart+Teaching:+Using+Brain+Research+and+Data+to+Continuously+Improve+Learning&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Oxford Reader's Companion to Dickens","description":"A guide to everything Dickens collects the latest scholarship on the author and offers an overview of all his works, characters, illustrators, printers, and associates","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=v6gmAQAAMAAJ&dq=Oxford+Reader%27s+Companion+to+Dickens&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pleasure: a creative approach to life","description":"In Pleasure: A Creative Approach to Life, Alexander Lowen shows how the experience of pleasure or pain determines our emotions, thinking, and behavior.

In a healthy body, movement, feeling, and thinking are integrated in grace and harmony. This book includes body-psychotherapy techniques and exercises aimed at alleviating muscular tension and restoring the body's natural grace. This spiritual grace involves a sense of connectedness to a higher order.

This beautiful book chronicles this complex century of maturation through a selection of paintings from the extraordinary collection of the Addison Gallery of American Art. Coming of Age begins with Albert Bierstadt, Frederic Church, and the Hudson River School landscapes that embody the new nationalism of mid-nineteenth-century America. Their successors, Luminists like Jasper Cropsey and Fitz H. Lane, infused their immediate surroundings with glowing light and crystalline clarity, while contemporary Barbizon-influenced tonalists, such as George Inness, sought to capture the American ethos through an emotional, atmospheric landscape language. In the later 19th century, Winslow Homer, Thomas Eakins, and Eastman Johnson depicted native subjects through the lens of realism. Childe Hassam and Maurice Prendergast brought Impressionist aesthetics to America, while expatriates including John Singer Sargent and James McNeil Whistler established themselves in European art capitals. In New York, turn-of-the-century Ashcan school painters captured the gritty cityscape that would later host champions of modernism Alfred Stieglitz, Man Ray, and Marsden Hartley. In the 1930s, European-trained artist Josef Albers introduced a generation of American painters to new theories of color and space from which emerged the breakthrough Abstract Expressionists. By the 1950s, American art had come of age, as Americans securely held the vanguard position in the international art world.\\"--Publisher's website.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tZxgQgAACAAJ&dq=Coming+of+Age:+American+Art,+1850S+To+1950S&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Concise Scots Dictionary","description":"First published in 1985, the Concise Scots Dictionary offers a comprehensive single-volume reference.

Thinkers have been fascinated by paradox since long before Aristotle grappled with Zeno's. In this volume in The MIT Press Essential Knowledge series, Margaret Cuonzo explores paradoxes and the strategies used to solve them. She finds that paradoxes are more than mere puzzles but can prompt new ways of thinking. A paradox can be defined as a set of mutually inconsistent claims, each of which seems true. Paradoxes emerge not just in salons and ivory towers but in everyday life. (An Internet search for  paradox  brings forth a picture of an ashtray with a  no smoking  symbol inscribed on it.) Proposing solutions, Cuonzo writes, is a natural response to paradoxes. She invites us to rethink paradoxes by focusing on strategies for solving them, arguing that there is much to be learned from this, regardless of whether any of the more powerful paradoxes is even capable of solution. Cuonzo offers a catalog of paradox-solving strategies including the Preemptive-Strike (questioning the paradox itself), the Odd-Guy-Out (calling one of the assumptions into question), and the You-Can't-Get-There-from-Here (denying the validity of the reasoning). She argues that certain types of solutions work better in some contexts than others, and that as paradoxicality increases, the success of certain strategies grows more unlikely. Cuonzo shows that the processes of paradox generation and solution proposal are interesting and important ones. Discovering a paradox leads to advances in knowledge: new science often stems from attempts to solve paradoxes, and the concepts used in the new sciences lead to new paradoxes. As Niels Bohr wrote,  How wonderful that we have met with a paradox. Now we have some hope of making progress.

They are approximately ages 0 through 5, although some members of the first wave of Crystal Children are as old as 7. These children are like Indigos highly psychic and sensitive but without the dark edge and the anger energy. The term Crystal Children is already taking hold worldwide, and people everywhere are talking about these special kids. Since Doreen is the only researcher who is publicly giving speeches on the subject, her audiences have been asking her for a book on the topic. It s a natural sequel to her book The Care and Feeding of Indigo Children. As babies, Crystal Children may take longer than normal to begin talking. They are highly telepathic, and their tuned-in mothers communicate with them nonverbally. Because they re so sensitive, the Crystal Children babies may fuss and cry a lot in crowded places. They re also very fond of nature. Doreen once watched one Crystal Child walk from tree to tree, giving each one a big hug. Crystal Children are beautiful inside and out, like magnificent little high-priests and priestesses. One look in their eyes, and you ll recognize Divine love and wisdom. Their auras are bright, radiant, and opalescent they seem to glow from the inside! They talk about past lives, distant galaxies, and profound insights concerning peace and love.

Her most compelling work, Fall River, last published in 1833, recreates a notorious incident in the ill-fated town of Fall River, Massachusetts: the trial of a Methodist minister for the murder of a pregnant mill worker whom it was suspected he had seduced. Williams's investigative report offers a vivid contemporary view of the lives of poor \\"factory girls\\" and of clerical corruption in the industrial towns of early New England. While based in fact, the book raises themes of sexual and religious hypocrisy and exploitation that may be compared with those of novels like The Coquette, Uncle Tom's Cabin, and The Scarlet Letter.

It offers a broad range of new, historicist approaches, touching upon key topics in current Shakespearean studies, such as kinship relations, manliness, magic, medico-politics, nationalism, rhetoric, schism, sexuality and staging conventions. The plays are explored both individually and within generic, thematic and chronological groups. Each author combines new research with their experience of teaching the plays, offering innovative approaches to some well-known works, as well as encouraging readers to explore less familiar dramas such as Pericles, Cymbeline, All is True and The Two Noble Kinsmen. The volume is unusual in its coverage of the lost 'late' play Cardenio, and considers its significance for our conception of the 'lateness' of these plays. This book will fill a large gap in the market for a broad-ranging critical introduction to this important and increasingly popular area in Shakespeare's work, and is suitable as a textbook for undergraduate, graduate and more general readers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kZ8xEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Basic Russian Book 1, Student Edition (Bk. 1)","description":"Basic Russian: Book One (Fayer) provides beginning students with the basic tools for constructing a solid foundation of the Russian language.

Scott Jurek is one of the world's best known and most beloved ultrarunners. Renowned for his remarkable endurance and speed, accomplished on a vegan diet, he's finished first in nearly all of ultrarunning's elite events over the course of his career. But after two decades of racing, training, speaking, and touring, Jurek felt an urgent need to discover something new about himself. He embarked on a wholly unique challenge, one that would force him to grow as a person and as an athlete: breaking the speed record for the Appalachian Trail. North is the story of the 2,189-mile journey that nearly shattered him. When he set out in the spring of 2015, Jurek anticipated punishing terrain, forbidding weather, and inevitable injuries. He would have to run nearly 50 miles a day, every day, for almost seven weeks. He knew he would be pushing himself to the limit, that comfort and rest would be in short supply -- but he couldn't have imagined the physical and emotional toll the trip would exact, nor the rewards it would offer. With his wife, Jenny, friends, and the kindness of strangers supporting him, Jurek ran, hiked, and stumbled his way north, one white blaze at a time. A stunning narrative of perseverance and personal transformation, North is a portrait of a man stripped bare on the most demanding and transcendent effort of his life. It will inspire runners and non-runners alike to keep striving for their personal best.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WVoRDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Herschels and modern astronomy, (The century science series)","description":"Trieste Publishing has a massive catalogue of classic book titles.

Until the nineteen-fifties, telescopes, spectrometers, and photographic plates consti tuted a relatively simple set of tools which had been refined to a high degree of perfection by the joint efforts of physicists and astronomers. Indeed these tools helped at the birth of modern astrophysics: the discovery of the expan sion of the Universe. Then came radioastronomy and the advent of electronics; the last thirty years have seen the application to astrophysics of a wealth of new experimental techniques, based on the most advanced fields of physics, and a constant interchange of ideas between physicists and astronomers. Last, but not least, modern computers have sharply reduced the burden of dealing with the information painfully extracted from the skies, whether from ever scarce photons, or from the gigantic data flows provided by satellites and large telescopes. The aim of this book is not to give an extensive overview of all the tech niques currently in use in astronomy, nor to provide detailed instructions for preparing or carrying out an astronomical project. Its purpose is methodologi cal: photons are still the main carriers of information between celestial sources and the observer. How we are to collect, sample, measure, and store this infor mation is the unifying theme of the book. Rather than the diversity of tech niques appropriate for each wavelength range, we emphasize the physical and mathematical bases which are common to all wavelength regimes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=F1vxCAAAQBAJ&dq=Observational+Astrophysics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Blue Sense: Psychic Detectives and Crime","description":"Discusses the assistance of psychics in the police investigations of murders, kidnappings, and missing persons, citing case histories of successful psychics","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=25VDGwAACAAJ&dq=The+Blue+Sense:+Psychic+Detectives+and+Crime&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"QUEST FOR THE WELL OF SOULS","description":"Mavra Chang had been a master criminal, notorious throughout the galaxy, but for years she has been trapped in a no-longer human body on the Well World - the Master Control planet for the universe.

During the third week of February 1944, the combined Allied air forces based in Britain and Italy launched their first round-the-clock bomber offensive against Germany. Their goal: to smash the main factories and production centers of the Luftwaffe while also drawing German planes into an aerial battle of attrition to neutralize the Luftwaffe as a fighting force prior to the cross-channel invasion, planned for a few months later. Officially called Operation Argument, this aerial offensive quickly became known as  Big Week,  and it was one of the turning-point engagements of World War II. In Big Week, acclaimed World War II historian James Holland chronicles the massive air battle through the experiences of those who lived and died during it. Prior to Big Week, the air forces on both sides were in crisis. Allied raids into Germany were being decimated, but German resources fuel and pilots were strained to the breaking point. Ultimately new Allied aircraft especially the American long-range P-51 Mustang and superior tactics won out during Big Week. Through interviews, oral histories, diaries, and official records, Holland follows the fortunes of pilots, crew, and civilians on both sides, taking readers from command headquarters to fighter cockpits to anti-aircraft positions and civilian chaos on the ground, vividly recreating the campaign as it was conceived and unfolded. In the end, the six days of intense air battles largely cleared the skies of enemy aircraft when the invasion took place on June 6, 1944 D-Day. Big Week is both an original contribution to WWII literature and a brilliant piece of narrative history, recapturing a largely forgotten campaign that was one of the most critically important periods of the entire war. Praise for Big Week An Amazon Best Book of the Year  With the aid of diaries, memoirs and his own interviews, Mr. Holland gives a detailed, crewman s-eye view of combat from inside the British, American and German aircraft during the months leading up to Big Week and during the week itself. For those hoping for war-movie stuff, rest assured that the enemy fighters do come in at 6 o clock, the guns do hammer, the sun does glint and the  chutes do blossom in the sky. Still it s a serious and important story as well as a dramatic one, and Mr. Holland tells it with verve and authority.   David A. Price, Wall Street Journal  Highly detailed. . . . The interplay of personal stories with the broader strategic picture makes this book especially illuminating. . . . A fascinating must-read for World War II aficionados.

Son of Sam recounts the incredible,  can t miss  (Kirkus Reviews) story of how a single man killed six innocent people, wounded several others, and sent millions of New Yorkers into a panic from July 1976 through August 1977. It is also the story of the greatest manhunt in the history of the New York Police Department the intimate narrative of the men assigned to tracking down a lone killer who prowled supposedly safe neighborhoods and randomly shot pretty young women with his .44-caliber revolver. The police task force investigated more than 3,000 suspects while politicians watched a city fall into panic. Yet the interest didn t fade after an arrest was made, and the criminal justice system showed itself incapable of coping with the man who committed such horrendous crimes. Now, based on more than three hundred recorded conversations between David Berkowitz and psychiatrists, police, district attorneys, and his defense counsel, along with his own handwritten notes and diaries, as well as the accounts of the survivors and the families of victims, this chilling book thoroughly explores the full horror of Son of Sam.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5rUmDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"September 11: A Case for the Higher Purpose","description":"Compelling evidence suggests that a deeper meaning underlies the terrorist attacks of September 11; that humanity received a 9-1-1 emergency wake-up call on that infamous day.

It is dominated by \\"Mr. Sam,\\" the single greatest figure in the history of the liquor business, the man who made drinking whiskey respectable in the United States and who in the 1950s and 1960s built Seagram into the first worldwide empire in wine and spirits. After Sam's death in 1971, his oldest son, Edgar, maintained the business, though he was distracted by his matrimonial problems. Nevertheless, in the 1980s he masterminded a major coup when he translated a small investment in oil made by his father into a 25 percent stake in the mighty DuPont company. But in the 1990s, Edgar allowed his second son, Edgar Jr., to indulge his ambition to become a media tycoon. The stake in DuPont was sold, and the money reinvested in Universal, the film and theme-park empire. Edgar Jr. then paid more than $10 billion to buy Polygram Records and thus fulfill his fancy to be king of the world's music business. But at the same time, he remained in charge of the liquor business, which started to stagnate indeed, to fall apart. Then came the final disaster when the increasingly divided family sold out to Jean-Marie Messier, overreaching empire builder of Vivendi, the French conglomerate. But the story of this amazing family over the past century is about more than booze and business. The Bronfmans is a spectacular account that details the larger-than-life personalities and bitter rivalries that have made the family so famous and, sometimes, so infamous.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CMqaBiLPmQYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"White flags of Apacheland","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0ijxAAAAMAAJ&dq=White+flags+of+Apacheland&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The meaning of history","description":"Modern man sees with one eye of faith and one eye of reason.

Settlement life was unbearable with its chains and padlocks, barred windows, hard cold beds, and horrible food. Solitary confinement was doled out as regular punishment. The girls were not even allowed to speak their language. Of all the journeys made since white people set foot on Australian soil, the journey made by these girls born of Aboriginal mothers and white fathers speaks something to everyone.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zg2_fPK4MsAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A dictionary of the Targumim, the Talmud Babli and Yerushalmi, and the Midrashic literature","description":"New, larger edition!

Suzuki. Told in a nonlinear style, In My Own Way wonderfully combines Watts  own brand of unconventional philosophy and often hilarious accounts of gurus, celebrities, psychedelic drug experiences, and wry observations of Western culture. A charming foreword written by Watts  father sets the tone of this warm, funny, and beautifully written story of a compelling figure who encouraged readers to  follow your own weird    something he always did himself, as his remarkable account of his life shows.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cY16AAAAQBAJ&dq=In+My+Own+Way+an+Autobiography&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Angels in the Gloom (World War One Novels)","description":"With this latest entry in a bestselling series that evokes all the passion and heroism of history s most heartbreaking conflictthe war that was meant to end all warsAnne Perry adds new luster to her worldwide reputation. Angels in the Gloom is an intense saga of love, hate, obsession, and murder that features an honorable English familybrothers Joseph and Matthew Reavley and their sisters, Judith and Hannah. In March 1916, Joseph, a chaplain at the front, and Judith, an ambulance driver, are fighting not only the Germans but the bitter cold and the appalling casualties at Ypres. Scarcely less at risk, Matthew, an officer in England s Secret Intelligence Service, fights the war covertly from London. Only Hannah, living with her children in the family home in tranquil Cambridgeshire, seems safe. Appearances, however, are deceiving. By the time Joseph returns home to Cambridgeshire, rumors of spies and traitors are rampant. And when the savagely brutalized body of a weapons scientist is discovered in a village byway, the fear that haunts the battlefields settles over the townalong with the shadow of the obsessed ideologue who murdered the Reavleys  parents on the eve of the war. Once again, this icy, anonymous powerbroker, the Peacemaker, is plotting to kill.

In the ten years since the first edition a massive amount of work has been carried out in the field, and ceria has gained a prominent position in catalysis as one of the most valuable material for several applications. This second edition covers fundamental and applied aspects of the latest advances in ceria-based materials with a special focus on structural, redox and catalytic features. Special emphasis is given to nano-engineered and nano-shaped systems which are a key factor in the predictive and rational design of ceria with novel properties. In addition, the book presents recent advances in emerging and traditional large-scale applications of ceria in catalysis, such as the treatment of emissions from mobile sources (including diesel and gasoline engines). The primary readership includes catalysis and material science researchers from academy and industry and postdoctorate and graduate students in chemistry, chemical engineering and physics.

They are a time for study, yes, but also a time for making independent decisions over what to do beyond formal education. This book is based on a nine-year study of collegiate a cappella - a socio-musical practice that has exploded on college campuses since the 1990s. A defining feature of collegiate a cappella is that it is a student-run leisure activity undertaken by undergraduate students at institutions both large and small, prestigious and lower-status. With rare exceptions, participants are not music majors yet many participants interviewed had previous musical experience both in and out of school settings. Motivations for staying musically involved varied considerably - from those who felt they could not imagine life without a musical outlet to those who joined on a whim. Collegiate a cappella is about much more than singing cover songs. It sustains multiple forms of inequality through its audition practices and its performative enactment of gender and heteronormativity. This book sheds light on how undergraduates conceptualize vocation and avocation within the context of formal education, holding implications for educators at all levels.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tasEEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"DISCOURSE ANALYSIS AND OTHER TOPICS IN BIBLICAL GREEK","description":"This collection brings together into one volume papers first delivered in the Section on Biblical Greek Language and Linguistics at the Society of Biblical Literature annual meetings in 1992 and 1993.

Four decades later, Alfred Kazin's comment still holds true: \\"Malamud has done something which now that he has done it! looks as if we have been waiting for it all our lives.

It is a book by and about a sportswriter who grew up near Ebbets Field, and who had the good fortune in the 1950s to cover the Dodgers for the Herald Tribune. This is a book about what happened to Jackie, Carl Erskine, Pee Wee Reese, and the others when their glory days were behind them. In short, it is a book fathers and sons and about the making of modern America. 'At a point in life when one is through with boyhood, but has not yet discovered how to be a man, it was my fortune to travel with the most marvelously appealing of teams.' Sentimental because it holds such promise, and bittersweet because that promise is past, the first sentence of this masterpiece of sporting literature, first published in the early '70s, sets its tone. The team is the mid-20th-century Brooklyn Dodgers, the team of Robinson and Snyder and Hodges and Reese, a team of great triumph and historical import composed of men whose fragile lives were filled with dignity and pathos. Roger Kahn, who covered that team for the New York Herald Tribune, makes understandable humans of his heroes as he chronicles the dreams and exploits of their young lives, beautifully intertwining them with his own, then recounts how so many of those sweet dreams curdled as the body of these once shining stars grew rusty with age and battered by experience.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jTrLAgAAQBAJ&dq=Beyond+the+Boys+of+Summer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"George Platt Lynes Photographs 1931-1955","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2CpOjgEACAAJ&dq=George+Platt+Lynes+Photographs+1931-1955&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Applied Interval Analysis: with Examples in Parameter and State Estimation, Robust Control and Robotics","description":"At the core of many engineering problems is the solution of sets of equa tions and inequalities, and the optimization of cost functions. Unfortunately, except in special cases, such as when a set of equations is linear in its un knowns or when a convex cost function has to be minimized under convex constraints, the results obtained by conventional numerical methods are only local and cannot be guaranteed. This means, for example, that the actual global minimum of a cost function may not be reached, or that some global minimizers of this cost function may escape detection. By contrast, interval analysis makes it possible to obtain guaranteed approximations of the set of all the actual solutions of the problem being considered. This, together with the lack of books presenting interval techniques in such a way that they could become part of any engineering numerical tool kit, motivated the writing of this book. The adventure started in 1991 with the preparation by Luc Jaulin of his PhD thesis, under Eric Walter's supervision. It continued with their joint supervision of Olivier Didrit's and Michel Kieffer's PhD theses. More than two years ago, when we presented our book project to Springer, we naively thought that redaction would be a simple matter, given what had already been achieved . . .","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PYXbBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Gentle Season","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TziSGwAACAAJ&dq=The+Gentle+Season&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Celestial Lancets: A History and Rationale of Acupuncture and Moxa (Needham Research Institute Series)","description":"Using modern knowledge to shed light on ancient techniques, this text examines two of the earliest therapeutic techniques of Chinese medicine: acupuncture and moxibustion. Acupuncture is the implantation of very thin needles into subcutaneous connective tissue and muscle at a great number of different points on the body's surface; moxibustion is the burning of Artemisia tinder (moxa) either directly on the skin or just above it. For 2500 years the Chinese have used both techniques to relieve pain and to heal a wide variety of illnesses and malfunctions. Providing a full historical account of acupuncture and moxibustion in the theoretical structure of Chinese medicine, Doctors Lu and Needham combine it with a rationale of the two techniques in the light of modern scientific knowledge.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WOcLBtm0NHcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"To Jerusalem and Back: A Personal Account","description":"Nobel laureate Saul Bellow s revealing interviews and meditations, steeped in history and literature, on the unique spirit and challenges of Israel A Penguin Classic A powerful, stimulating testament, To Jerusalem and Back is a rigorous attempt to come to grips with Israel s history and future.

During the period of Hitler's ascendancy, most attempts at explaining this unprecedented phenomenon were framed in \\"economic,\\" often Marxist, sociological terms and concepts. Peter Viereck's Metapolitics, initially published in 1941, broke with this convention by indicting Hitler in terms of the Judaic-Christian ethical tradition and locating certain elements of the Nazi worldview in German romantic poetry, music, and social thought. Newly expanded, Metapolitics remains a key work in the cultural interpretation of Nazism and totalitarianism and in the psychological interpretation of Hitler as a Wagnerite and failed artist. The term \\"metapolitics,\\" a coinage from Richard Wagner's nationalist circle, signifies an ideology resulting from five distinct strands: romanticism (embodied chiefly in the Wagnerian ethos), the pseudo-science of race, Fuehrer worship, vague economic socialism, and the alleged supernatural and unconscious force of the Volk collectivity. Together, those elements engendered an emphasis on irrationalism and hysteria and belief in a special German mission to direct the course of the world's history. Viereck analyzes nineteenth-century German thought's conflicting attitudes toward political procedures and social arrangements rooted in classical, rational, legalistic, and Christian traditions. This edition includes an appreciation by Thomas Mann and an exchange with Jacques Barzun debating Viereck's criticism of German romanticism. Viereck's essays on the case of Albert Speer, on Claus von Stauffenberg (the German officer who led the army conspiracy to assassinate Hitler), and on the poets Stefan George and Georg Heym appear here for the first time in book form.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0x0uDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cybernation (Tom Clancy's Net Force, No. 6)","description":"When Net Force explorer Andy Moore helps to program the virtual animals of the Cservanka Brothers Circus, he discovers a black market of high-tech weapons software and hardware.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=geRk00Hq_c0C&dq=Cybernation+(Tom+Clancy%27s+Net+Force,+No.+6)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What To Do When Your're Backed Against The Wall","description":"Life's problems have you up against the wall.

However, this paper lays claim to be one of the early few that take a more rational approach to the subject by analyzing the realistic profit potential of online business models. Furthermore, future success factors for finance portals will be discussed and their respective value proposition thoroughly examined. Since the fast moving Internet hype has had to give way to an almost equally swift consolidation of the market, this will prove to be crucial information for any company of the finance industry. Additionally, when taking into account that the oncoming second wave of customers is to be divided amongst the remaining online players, the findings of this thesis will be of eminent relevance for any provider of a financial website. Towards the end of my internship with AOL I was asked to research the required success factors for finance portals as a basis for AOL s finance channel content strategy. Inexperienced Internet-users such as those of the Second Wave are likely to utilize the user-friendly and convenient service of AOL as an ISP. Therefore, it will be of vital importance for AOL to incorporate the above mentioned success factors within their service in order to increase the usage of its finance channel. At this point I would like to thank AOL, not only for the financial, but especially for the professional support, which both have simplified my task to a substantial degree as well as all others who have been kind enough to let me benefit from their knowledge in the field.

We make that purpose.\\" -- Marshall Stewart Ball Marshall Ball believes the key to happiness lies in opening our hearts to good God. This simple but profound message comes from a singularly extraordinary messenger: Fourteen-year-old Marshall has spent his life confined to a wheelchair. He cannot speak, write, or walk, and he does not have the strength to use a computer without assistance. Yet he has transcended the limits of his body by communicating through a painstaking transcription process -- a process that since childhood has been his means of sharing his amazingly sophisticated and perceptive expressions on the topics of God, love, kindness, and freedom. These powerful writings have not only astonished and moved those closest to Marshall, but touched millions in his bestseller, Kiss of God. In this powerful new collection of his poems, letters, and affirmations, Marshall also includes answers to questions people have asked him. With startling beauty and disarming simplicity, he teaches us to appreciate our roles in life, no matter how difficult they may be, and to love and respect knowledge, others, and God. Marshall's message of hope -- that true joy comes from accepting God's love -- is a gift to savor and share with our loved ones time and time again.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6MZxBsTKI-0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ships of the World: An Historical Encyclopedia","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The birds of Minnesota,","description":"Lists identifying information on 111 species of Minnesota birds using an easy-to-use color guide; includes range maps, full-color photos, and interesting \\"gee-whiz\\" facts.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zL63a-v97CcC&dq=The+birds+of+Minnesota,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The New World of Math","description":"A compendium of standard and advanced mathematical terms and ideas, each defined by example and expository discussion","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pm7W34cLZzMC&dq=The+New+World+of+Math&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"DIS-MOI!

An outcast even among her fellow Africans, she is on the cusp of womanhood--where greater pain awaits. And so when Caesar, a slave who has recently arrived from Virginia, urges her to join him on the Underground Railroad, she seizes the opportunity and escapes with him. In Colson Whitehead's ingenious conception, the Underground Railroad is no mere metaphor: engineers and conductors operate a secret network of actual tracks and tunnels beneath the Southern soil. Cora embarks on a harrowing flight from one state to the next, encountering, like Gulliver, strange yet familiar iterations of her own world at each stop. As Whitehead brilliantly re-creates the terrors of the antebellum era, he weaves in the saga of our nation, from the brutal abduction of Africans to the unfulfilled promises of the present day. The Underground Railroad is both the gripping tale of one woman's will to escape the horrors of bondage--and a powerful meditation on the history we all share.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xYtIDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+New+Underground+Railroad&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Roman Britain and the English settlements (The Oxford history of England)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=I_buxgEACAAJ&dq=Roman+Britain+and+the+English+settlements+(The+Oxford+history+of+England)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The nature of science: An A-Z guide to the laws and principles governing our universe","description":"An alphabetically arranged handbook contains essays on two hundred key principles, from Kepler's laws of planetary motion and Mendel's laws of genetics, to lesser-known laws that explain everything from black holes to sunflower patterns.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JVj9SylSuB4C&dq=The+nature+of+science:+An+A-Z+guide+to+the+laws+and+principles+governing+our+universe&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Captain Fit's Guide To Good Health","description":"'Captain Fit Is It. . .'

Even as quantum physicists close in on a scientific description of how it works, Bryan asks: \\"Is psychic healing a miracle of God or a trickery of fake blood and cotton balls perpetrated by charlatans?\\" She goes on to explore how it might well be both. This is an open, honest, in-depth look at the multiple, often contradictory realities of faith healing and the ripples it casts into the realms of physics, metaphysics, spirituality, and higher consciousness. Into this heartfelt first person account of a life-changing journey from patient to student to sometimes teacher, Bryan weaves a parallel narrative full of historical detail and cultural perspective on telekinesis, the magnetic force of cells, trance mediums, miracles, the placebo effect, and the power of expectation, as well as minor and major deities on the order of John of God, Franz Mesmer, Emanuel Swedenborg, Albert Einstein, and Shirley MacLaine.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gBPRwAEACAAJ&dq=Psychic+Surgery&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The American Directory of Writer's Guidelines: A Compilation for Freelancers from More Than 1,300 Magazine Editors & Book Publishers","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=94MYAAAAIAAJ&dq=The+American+Directory+of+Writer%27s+Guidelines:+A+Compilation+for+Freelancers+from+More+Than+1,300+Magazine+Editors&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Art of Wedding Photography: Professional Techniques with Style","description":"From assignment to finished project--how did they get that shot?

Faced with a master of ingenious alibis and innate resistance to interrogation, all his gendarmerie opponent could count on was instinct. This psychological hunt for a killer has echoes of Dostoevsky. \\"Heaulme never spoke murders. He referred to pepins - bothersome details, before noting days when pepins coincided with killings he had supposedly witnessed. He gave the impression he was an accidental observer of events in which women were beaten to death or children repeatedly stabbed. He had no criminal record and was scrupulous in living in the law. While he is thought to have been involved at least 50 murders, Heaulme once said that 'every time I visited somewhere there was a pepin.' So far 400 towns and villages have been identified where Heaulme stayed.\\" Paul Webster in the Observer, reviewing the French edition This is the best, clearest, most decisive account of the work of a detective possible. It shows how deadly criminals can only be caught by a combination of luck, patience - and most important of all skill and determination.

(The Work of Missions is Prayer, Daily Devotionals)","description":"Ready-to-Go Devotions for Mission and Service is a toolkit of daily devotionals for youth mission trips. The devotions in this book address every aspect of the mission experience, from leaving home and sleeping on the floor to dealing with language barriers and grumpy teammates. Each devotion includes a relevant Bible story, a commentary that connects that story to the mission experience, and a section that challenges the reader to take specific actions on the trip, back home, or both. The book includes devotions in preparation for, during, and after the mission trip or service project. The ready-to-go format allows the youth worker to quickly assemble a customized devotional journal for participants, matching each day s selection to what s likely to happen that day. The devotions could also be used in a group setting, which would allow the youth worker to pick devotions based on what has happened during the trip or event. Either way, the devotions point to the larger biblical and personal significance of mission trip or service project happenings . What if you held a mission trip and nobody changed? It s a haunting, daunting question, one that youth workers and researchers across America are beginning to ask. Short-term mission trips (STM) have exploded in popularity since the mid-1990s, thanks in part to the Internet, which makes connecting with mission agencies and mission recipients easier than ever. Sociologist Kurt Ver Beek estimates that the number of North American short-term missionaries grew from 125,000 in 1989 to as many as four million in 2003. Many of those short-termers are teenagers. According to Christianity Today, more than two million American teens enter the mission field every year. Pollster George Barna reports that 15 percent of U.S. Christian teens have done a short-term mission trip, while the National Study of Youth and Religion found that 29 percent of all teens had participated in a short-term mission trip or religious service project. Unfortunately, the impact of short-term mission trips may be short-term as well, both for those who go on mission trips and for those who receive mission teams. Ver Beek recently surveyed North Americans who worked in Honduras after a 1998 hurricane, as well as those who were served by them. He found that the North American work teams had  little or no lasting impact  on the communities they served and that missionaries reported only  a small, positive, lasting change  in their own lives. The situation isn t hopeless, however, according to Robert Priest, associate professor of mission and intercultural studies at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School.  In research with Ph.D. students at Trinity,  he wrote in Christianity Today,  I ve been impressed that while STM may not always or automatically produce desired results, the right sorts of STM, carried out in the right sorts of ways, and accompanied by the right sorts of reflections, have potential for good.  Unfortunately, youth workers don t always build  the right sorts of reflections  into their mission trips. At best, they allot time in the daily schedule for reflection or debriefing. At worst, they just hope and pray that their students will somehow be transformed by the mission experience. The existing literature isn t much help. Books on mission-trip planning offer plenty of advice on selecting a mission agency, raising money, coordinating transportation, handling emergencies, entering closed countries, and re-entering the  normal  world, but they offer precious little advice on using the mission experience to impact the participants  lives. The handful of available mission-focused devotional guides offer some assistance, but they typically take a one-size-fits-all approach. Usually presented as mission journals, these guides assume trips will be a certain length or include certain elements, such as dealing with non-English speakers. Ready-to-Go Devotions for Mission and Service fills the void, offering targeted, topical devotionals that can help turn short-term missions into life-changing experiences.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bWDn9ckvNXMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE SPIRIT OF THE BORDER.","description":"Two novels by legendary writer Zane Grey The Spirit of the Border He was known as Deathwind to the Ohio Valley Indians, and now Lewis Wetzel must single-handedly save Fort Henry.

The fictional territory of Carrying the Torch , is in short, Brock Clarke's, one in which the surreal and the hilarious share a neighborhood with the painfully real and the sweetly ironic. Here readers will encounter characters dislocated by work and love, by huge losses and life's small dramas, men and women who have migrated South in search of redemption--or at least in the hope of leaving the worst behind.In these tales about what people try to leave and find they can't, about the lies we tell the people we love and the myths we create to make life livable, Marly Swick cites an \\"exceptional originality\\" as well as an \\"amazing emotional resonance, a haunting quality.\\" \\"Notable for their balance of sentiment and restraint, the music of their language, and the haunting human longing that coexists with the irony and the humor,\\" as Lee Martin remarks, these remarkable stories carry forward a tradition reaching from Flannery O'Connor to John Cheever and Donald Barthelme--and arrive at a brilliance all their own.Brock Clarke is an assistant professor of English at the University of Cincinnati. He is the author of the novel The Ordinary White Boy and of What We Won't Do , a short story collection that won the 2002 Mary McCarthy Prize for Short Fiction.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VCFVIcxZjFUC&dq=Carrying+the+Torch:+Stories+(Prairie+Schooner+Book+Prize+in+Fiction)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Moving Mountains: Lessons in Leadership and Logistics from the Gulf War","description":"A United States general describes his command of the deployment of U.S. troops and supplies to the Persian Gulf in the war with Iraq and recommends his methods of leadership and resource management for use in the business world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aprrwAEACAAJ&dq=Moving+Mountains:+Lessons+in+Leadership+and+Logistics+from+the+Gulf+War&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Catalog","description":"From the archives of the Library of Congress:  An irresistible treasury for book and library lovers.

Edison: Research to Development at Menlo Park, January 1879-March 1881 (Volume 5)","description":"The fifth volume of The Papers of Thomas A. Edison covers Edison's invention and development of the first commercial incandescent electric light and power system. In the process he turned his famed Menlo Park laboratory into the first true research and development facility. This also enabled him to develop a new telephone for the British market in the midst of his herculean efforts on electric lighting. In the face of daunting technical challenges and skepticism from leading scientists and engineers, Edison and his team of experimenters and machinists found the solution to the decades-old problem of creating a practical incandescent lamp. By focusing on the characteristics of the entire system Edison reconceptualized the requirements of a successful lamp design. While rivals worked primarily on lamps, Edison developed other parts of a complete system as well. This approach was most notable in his revolutionary work on generator technology, one of the highlights of this volume. Successful exhibitions of the system in December 1879 drew crowds to Menlo Park to witness the softly glowing lamps. These spectacles gratified his financial backers but Edison realized the importance of following experimental demonstrations with the hard work of commercial development. He needed to make each component work effectively in daily use and to improve the designs so that they were easy to use and inexpensive to manufacture. To create a daytime market for electricity he also developed electric motors for a variety of uses, including electric railways, for which he built a small demonstration line at Menlo Park. To accomplish all this Edison greatly enlarged his staff to as many as sixty experimenters, machinists, carpenters, and office workers. He began manufacturing lamps at a factory in Menlo Park. At the end of 1880, Edison was ready to move his system into commercial production and made plans to produce other components in New York. He also invited New York officials to a demonstration in order to win their approval for running underground lines in lower Manhattan where he planned to put his first commercial central station. In March 1881, he moved to the Edison Electric Light Company's headquarters on Fifth Avenue and began the hard work of introducing the new electric light and power technology.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8XA9AQAAIAAJ&dq=The+Papers+of+Thomas+A.+Edison:+Research+to+Development+at+Menlo+Park,+January+1879-March+1881+(Volume+5)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cider With Rosie - Third Impression","description":"The essential Laurie Lee, a collection of occasional writings full of his unique vision and irresistible charm All of the wit and wisdom and poetry that made Laurie Lee one of the most celebrated English writers of the twentieth century can be found in this compilation of  first loves and obsessions.

From \\"the great storyteller of modern Russian historians,\\" (Financial Times) the definitive account of the forgotten war that shaped the modern age The Charge of the Light Brigade, Florence Nightingale these are the enduring icons of the Crimean War. Less well-known is that this savage war (1853-1856) killed almost a million soldiers and countless civilians; that it enmeshed four great empires the British, French, Turkish, and Russian in a battle over religion as well as territory; that it fixed the fault lines between Russia and the West; that it set in motion the conflicts that would dominate the century to come. In this masterly history, Orlando Figes reconstructs the first full conflagration of modernity, a global industrialized struggle fought with unusual ferocity and incompetence. Drawing on untapped Russian and Ottoman as well as European sources, Figes vividly depicts the world at war, from the palaces of St. Petersburg to the holy sites of Jerusalem; from the young Tolstoy reporting in Sevastopol to Tsar Nicolas, haunted by dreams of religious salvation; from the ordinary soldiers and nurses on the battlefields to the women and children in towns under siege.. Original, magisterial, alive with voices of the time, The Crimean War is a historical tour de force whose depiction of ethnic cleansing and the West's relations with the Muslim world resonates with contemporary overtones.

Equipped with over thirty-five years of seafaring experience, including as a sailor, captain, and as a Surveyor to Lloyd's Register, Paasch sets out, chapter by chapter, an exhaustive explanation of all the principal parts of a ship's structure and equipment. He describes the main types of steam and sailing vessels; wooden and iron hulls; propulsion machinery; anchors and related equipment; masts and spars; standing and running rigging, as well as sails, tackle, blocks and ropes. He concludes with knots, bends, hitches, and splices and finally provides a listing of standard measurements.Paasch's stated intention to describe a ship literally ?From Keel to Truck  has been widely applauded as has his inclusion of the equivalent terms in French and German alongside the English. Each section is accompanied by dozens of high-quality line engravings to accompany the text and illustrate the terminology and concept described. First published in 1885, and an invaluable resource ever since, Captain Paasch s dictionary is both a full encyclopedia and an unequaled introduction for anyone interested in steam and sailing ships, life aboard a ship, engineering, or simply understanding the language.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eT6CDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Battle of angels: A play (Pharos)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mPsaYAAACAAJ&dq=Battle+of+angels:+A+play+(Pharos)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tales of the Elders of Ireland (Oxford World's Classics)","description":"Tales of the Elders of Irelandis the first complete translation of the late Middle-IrishAcallam na Sen rach, the largest literary text surviving from twelfth-century Ireland.

Ridd's rivalry with the villainous Carver Doone reaches a dramatic climax that will determine Lorna's future happiness. First published in 1869, Lorna Doone was praised by R. L. Stevenson and Thomas Hardy and has remained constantly in print. The novel has many aspects: it is a romance; a historical novel set at the time of the Monmouth Rebellion in the seventeenth century; and a new development in the pastoral tradition. Underneath an ostensibly idyllic evocation of rural bliss and tale of love and high adventure lies a solid defence of Victorian social values, and a hero whose self-doubt prompts him constantly to prove himself.

Should we concentrate on evangelism and reaching the unregenerate souls? Or should we try to reform every institution to conform to God's standard? What John Barber's book does is show us that it is not an \\"either/or\\" situation. The two elements work together. Reforming culture helps us to evangelize. And evangelizing helps us to reform culture. Interwoven in both endeavors is God's sovereignty and the fact that God is working all things to His glory. Earth Restored is not another book on why America is great because the godly Founding Fathers wanted it that way, so we should strive to bring the country back to its former state. This book is about what the Bible says we as Christians should do in, for, and through the culture around us.

Just awful musty things, but each one with a kind of terrible dark halo around it. She picked up that piece of old lace. She saw that stain -- pale, brownish in color. She knew it was blood. Somebody's blood. There was violence in that trunk, and dark secrets, and she did not want to know them. Curious about the old homestead where she now lives, Jerry finds an ancient trunk in the basement that contains, among other things, an old piece of bloodstained lace, some letters, and a battered doll. The objects in the trunk have stories to tell -- stories about the Spanish Inquisition spanning nearly five hundred years and stories of secrets locked deep in the bloodlines of Jerry's ancestors. Kathryn Lasky's powerhouse novel is a dramatic historical saga that brings the reader face-to-face with some of the worst atrocities ever committed against humankind in the name of God.

This book contains key introductory material to this contemporary occult society, along with a history of the Order after Crowley's death. The format of this edition matches that of the first Equinox series published with Crowley as editor and includes magical instruction, communications to OTO members (all the dirt on court cases the OTO has been involved in), and original works of fiction and poetry. As part of this latter category, this book features an illustrated study of the works of underground filmmaker Kenneth Anger with a complete filmography. It could be argued that Aleister Crowley (1875-1947) anticipated the entire New Age phenomenon with his methods of teaching, codified in the tenets of the OTO. A rich melange of ritual magic, traditional spiritual practice, drug use, and sex, borrowing from many different cultures and traditions, informed the development of this lasting magical system. Although he's been popularized (and demonized) as The Beast, 666, his teachings have shown lasting value.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JMXOBCtNMvkC&dq=The+Equinox:+The+Review+of+Scientific+Illuminism,+Vol.+3,+No.+10&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fourteen British & American poets","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TPlCvK1d76MC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Photoshop 6.0 A to Z","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oZPLtwEACAAJ&dq=Photoshop+6.0+A+to+Z&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tennis for Humans: A Simple Blueprint for Winning","description":"Dick Myers' Tennis for Humans will make you a smarter, more effective tennis player whether you play five times a year or five times a week.

Miraculously preserved on clay tablets dating back as much as four thousand years, the poem of Gilgamesh, king of Uruk, is the world's oldest epic, predating Homer by many centuries. The story tells of Gilgamesh's adventures with the wild man Enkidu, and of his arduous journey to the ends of the earth in quest of the Babylonian Noah and the secret of immortality. Alongside its themes of family, friendship and the duties of kings, The Epic of Gilgamesh is, above all, about mankind's eternal struggle with the fear of death. The Babylonian version has been known for over a century, but linguists are still deciphering new fragments in Akkadian and Sumerian. Andrew George's gripping translation brilliantly combines these into a fluid narrative and will long rank as the definitive English Gilgamesh.

Is there any truth in the idea of character informed by birth order, or the loneliness of only children? What is the reality of sibling rivalry? What might a parent to one, or two, come to regret? Lynn Berger is here to fill that gap with the curious, reflective Second Thoughts. Grounded in autobiography and full of considered allusion, careful investigation and generous candor, it s an exploration specifically dedicated to second children and their particular, too often forgotten lot. Warm and wise, intimate and universal at once, it s a must read for parents-to-be and want-to-be, parents of one, parents of two or more, and second children themselves.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=e6DmDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Do Try to Speak as We Do: The Diary of an American Au Pair","description":"It seems like the perfect job: an upper middle class English family desperately needs a nanny. The father is an aspiring novelist, the children are well-heeled, and the mother's accent radiates with charm over the transatlantic phone. So young Melissa jumps at the chance to travel overseas and live an aristocratic life of tea and crumpets. But her romantic notions are shattered when she becomes an unwitting target of the family's genteel snobbery, icy wrath, and ridiculous misunderstandings. Melissa's letters home cast a sharp eye and quick wit on the family's bizarre cast of friends and relatives, but she eventually learns that a little bit of understanding and tolerance can go a long way - and can even teach her more about herself - in Do Try to Speak as We Do by Marjorie Leet Ford.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_f9kAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Opening a Mountain: K=oans of the Zen Masters","description":"With the growing popularity of Zen Buddhism in the West, virtually everyone knows, or thinks they know, what a koan is: a brief and baffling question or statement that cannot be solved by the logical mind and which, after sustained concentration, can lead to sudden enlightenment. But the truth about koans is both simpler--and more complicated--than this. In Opening a Mountain, Steven Heine shows that koans, and the questions we associate with them--such as \\"What is the sound of one hand clapping?\\"--are embedded in larger narratives and belong to an ancient Buddhist tradition of \\"encounter dialogues.\\" These dialogues feature dramatic and often inscrutable contests between masters and disciples, or between masters and an array of natural and supernatural forces: rouge priests, \\"wild foxes,\\" hermits, wizards, shapeshifters, magical animals, and dangerous women. To establish a new monastery, \\"to open a mountain,\\" the Zen master had to tame these wild forces in regions most remote from civilization. In these extraordinary encounters, fingers and arms are cut off, pitchers are kicked over, masters appear in and interpret each other's dreams, and seemingly absurd statements are shown to reveal the deepest insights. Heine restores these koans to their original traditions, allowing readers to see both the complex elements of Chinese culture and religion that they reflect and the role they played in Zen's transformation of local superstitions into its own teachings. Offering a fresh approach to one of the most crucial elements of Zen Buddhism, Opening a Mountain is essential reading for anyone seeking to understand the full story behind koans and the mysterious worlds they come from.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eg7iBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE MAGNETIC MAN - The Avengers (8) Eight","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_1ohAQAAMAAJ&dq=THE+MAGNETIC+MAN+-+The+Avengers+(8)+Eight&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Porch Swing Stories","description":"Porch Swing Stories is a history of both a family and a community.

There is widespread scholarly consensus that the ensuing dispersion in Genesis 10.1-32 and 11.1-9 is the means by which the creation blessing is fulfilled. Kaminski argues that the primeval blessing is not fulfilled in the Table of Nations and that Yahweh's scattering Noah's descendants in the Babel story does not contribute positively to the creation theme. Rather, the creation blessing is being taken up in the primary line of Shem (Genesis 11.10-26), which leads directly to Abraham. She further suggests that divine grace is not absent after the Babel judgment, as is commonly assumed, but is at work in the Shemite genealogy. She argues that the primeval blessing, which is unfulfilled in the primaeval history, is taken up by Abraham and his descendants by means of a divine promise. While the blessing is in the process of being realised in the patriarchal narratives, it is not fulfilled. The multiplication theme is resumed, however, in Exodus 1.7, which describes Israel's proliferation in Egypt. This is the first indication that the creation blessing is fulfilled. Realisation of the primaeval blessing progresses after the flood, therefore, from Noah to Israel. Yet God's blessing on Israel is not for their sake alone - it is the means through which the divine intention for creation will be restored to the world.

The satisfaction of these natural desires constitutes a universal standard for judging social practice as either fulfilling or frustrating human nature, although prudence is required in judging what is best for particular circumstances. The author studies the familial bonding of parents and children and the conjugal bonding of men and women as illustrating social behavior that conforms to Darwinian natural right. He also studies slavery and psychopathy as illustrating social behavior that contradicts Darwinian natural right. He argues as well that the natural moral sense does not require religious belief, although such belief can sometimes reinforce the dictates of nature.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TfKxGmEZuPcC&dq=Darwinian+Natural+Right:+The+Biological+Ethics+of+Human+Nature+(S+U+N+Y+Series+in+Philosophy+and+Biology)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Guide for Using Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day in the Classroom","description":"Teaching literature unit based on the popular children's story, Alexander and the terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ficUAQAAMAAJ&dq=A+Guide+for+Using+Alexander+and+the+Terrible,+Horrible,+No+Good,+Very+Bad+Day+in+the+Classroom&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Become The Exception","description":"For a long time, Annie Meehan felt she was worthless.

Bringing together the work of animal behaviorists, zoo biologists, and psychologists, Second Nature explores a range of innovative strategies for environmental enrichment in laboratories and marine parks, as well as in zoos. From artificial fleeing-prey devices for leopards to irregular feeding schedules for whales, the practices discussed have resulted in healthier, more relaxed animals that can breed more easily and can exert some control over their environments. Moving beyond the usual studies of primates to consider the requirements of animals as diverse as reptiles, amphibians, marine mammals, small cats, hooved grazers, and bears, contributors argue that whether an animal forages in the wild or plays computer games in captivity, the satisfaction its activity provides rather than the activity itself determines the animal's level of physical and psychological well-being. Second Nature also discusses the ways in which environmental enrichment can help zoo-bred animals develop the stamina and adaptability for survival in the wild, and how it can produce healthier lab animals that yield more valid test results. Providing a theoretical framework for the science of environmental enrichment in a variety of settings, the book renews and extends a humane approach to the keeping and conservation of animals.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mZ5fBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Round Up the Stories of Ring W Lardner","description":"Ring Lardner is one of America's favourite short story authors.

As the founder of the Down Syndrome Center for Excellence at Loyola University in Maryland, she draws on her vast experience to show parents how they can support and encourage their child's speech and language development from birth to age 6 (or when a child can form 2- to 3- word sentences). Parents and teachers learn how to work through characteristic challenges, including hearing loss, intelligibility issues, apraxia (difficulty planning oral-motor movements), or a slower pace of development. Families soon see that many children with Down syndrome are natural and willing communicators. In a warm and conversational style, the author shares her professional expertise in parent-friendly terms. She uses specific examples of difficulties and successes to illustrate the concepts behind speech and language development, and includes the latest research supporting current early intervention and preschool approaches that can be used at home and in schools. This third edition of EARLY COMMUNICATION SKILLS features expanded information on the needs of children with apraxia, dual diagnosis of autism and Down syndrome, and updated terminology and information on special education law. A new chapter explains how technology and augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) ? smartphones, iPods, iPads, and apps ? can help with speech and language, foster communication, and provide inexpensive transitional language systems. Dozens of forms are now included on a CD-ROM to be used for assessment, developing treatment plans, and keeping detailed records of progress.
