This time, a shady group of people are killing archaeologists who find out about the existence of an advanced ancient civilization. Throw in death comets, neo-Nazis, cloning, and impossible shipbuilding for good measure. A fun read if taken with a pinch of salt."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Atlantis Found is thoroughly enjoyable and completely ridiculous! At the final show down I laughed myself silly for a good five minutes (which my husband can attest to). There are Nazis, a lost civilization, missing relics, and a pending world destruction that will either be from the heavens or man made."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I liked this a lot. This was my first Cussler and I love the fact that he is a real explorer. Enjoyable."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"dirk rules! i don't care if my hubby gives me a hard time about loving dirk pitt--and this new story is great. i didn't think i would find another pitt novel as exciting as my favorite (inca gold), but this one was it. i think you have to suspend reality and just sit back and enjoy the ride that dirk, numa and the gang take--this isn't rocket science, its a novel. mr cussler, if you read these reviews, your books are wonderful and i hope you are working on a new pitt novel!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Clive Cussler does a great job in this book. All my freinds love it too. Clive Cussler really keeps the reader focused in the high action parts of the book!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"As an avid Cussler fan, I eagerly awaited the next Cussler adventure. When it arrived under the tree Christmas morning, I quickly lost myself in the story. Typical of Cussler, the book was full of adventure and believable historical fiction. Only Clive could pull together a pre-historical civilization and the Fourth Reich into one plausible adventure.The Only problem was Atlantis did not seem as tight as previous offerings. Small inconsistencies kept me looking back, rather than simply moving forward in the plot. For example, in the early mine rescue, Dirk is wearing a drysuit. When he returns to the mine later, Cussler states Dirk is wearing a drysuit instead of the wetsuit he had on earlier. I felt like this book received no serious proof-reading.Small quirks aside, any Cussler fan will enjoy this book. And for all of Al's fans out there, he finally gets the woman! I look forward to the next Pitt novel, and hope for another Autin adventure."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Forget the negative reviews on this page...this story was absolutely captivating! If you like adventure, getting lost in the past and the future then this is the book for you. I have never read any of authors previous works but I will definitely hunt them down now. People who left reviews and said the story was just too way out there to make it believeable...WAKE UP! A story is supposed to be just that. This book made me want to be there in the story. It took past history and embellished to make it all the more interesting. I highly recommend this book for all the adventurists out there who want to go on the roller coaster ride this book takes you on!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I am an avid reader of Clive Cussler ever since I sumbled upon Raise the Titanic while doing reasearch on the Titanic. Ever since then I have read all of his book and I am always excited when A new one comes out. They all keep getting better and better. Once I start reading one of his books I can't stop till i reach the end. His latest book is no exception to this. He mixed facts with theory and it really makes you think. I really don't know how to prise this book without runing it for anyojne else. Anyone who likes James Bond will love this book. I have to say it passes up Bond on my list and I can't wait till his next book."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt novels are always fun. The rapport between Pitt and Al Giordano is magic. And when they're front and center, this novel crackles. A Fourth Reich is being planned. The earth will be destroyed. The action is set in the South Pole. All the ingredients for a wonderful novel. Most of Mr. Cussler's novel is exciting. Unfortunately, he brings in a slew of Special Forces guys near the end of the book. They interrupted the flow. I skipped over these characters and raced to the pages with Dirk and Al, or Admiral Sandecker, their stalwart, harried boss. Tom Clancy often brings in new characters in the fighting scenes; perhaps that style works for him, but Mr. Cussler lost me at that point. ATLANTIS FOUND is good, but if you want wonderful Cussler, read SAHARA and INCA GOLD."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I've been a Clive Cussler fan for as long as he has been writing. I have each of his books in both hardback and paperback and reread each of them at least once per year.The latest book was a bit of a disappointment. It starts out well but then fades. It's almost as if Clive didn't write it. I was anxiously awaiting this book and read it in two sittings. However, it's not going to be a favorite of mine. It may get reread on occasion.There's not enough of Dirk and Al working together for me. They're often separate which means their witty reparte is missing. All of the main characters are in it, but it seems to not fire on all cylinders. The last two Dirk novels have not entertained me nearly as much as his earlier works. It's hard to put my finger on it but it's just not as riveting as others. A lack of the sense of urgency and danger is part of it.Better luck next time Mr. Cussler. I'll continue to read your books as long as you continue to write them."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"It isn't great literature, but it's a lot of fun! I'm a big Cussler fan and enjoyed this very much. Not his best, but Dirk &amp; Al still manage to save the world and have a blast doing so."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Cussler just can't be reviewed like most writers. He's a storyteller who has created some outrageous characters, a hero who shrugs off pain, friends that are undyingly loyal, and villains of pure evil. This adventure is typically outlandish and incredible. It is also fantastic fun! Cussler and Dirk and Al and the Admiral are old friends and I'm always thrilled by the ride they take me on. No pretense, no sophisticated act, just an amazingly good time. It's easy to make fun of these stories and criticize the writing, but I can't help myself - I love it!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"After forcing myself to finish this book I was intrigued to see what others had made of it. How can it be that 5 star reviews are the majority? Good grief I need to help rectify this. I can only assume anyone who gave it 5 stars has never read any well-written books, or is employed by the publishing house.Firstly, the dialogue is AWFUL. Amateurish, inane, corny and totally insulting to the intelligence. Example: Character 1 to Character 2, in plane: \\"So - it must be about 45 minutes since we took off from so-and-so airfield, just outside of Santa Cruz\\" - who would say that?Characters: Ridiculous and cliche'd. A super race of blonde, blue-eyed Nazis plotting to take over the earth? Please. And Clive do you really think it funny or acceptable for a smirking Dirk Pitt to flush Adolf Hitler's ashes down the toilet in the White House, rather than handing them over to the president waiting in the next room? Jeez.Plot holes: if even I can spot the gaping inconsistencies in the plot, god knows what others have found. So hundreds of thousands of people are in on this world domination plot are they Clive - without ANY intelligence agency having a clue? So the Nazi's have an insider working at NUMA do they Clive? You seem to have forgotten about that because the person was never identified or even mentioned again! There are so many others but it would take up too much space.Clive Cussler writing himself into the story is just painful.And given all the unnecessary and annoying mentions of specific brands and models of equipment, I cannot believe there is not some kind of product placement deal going on here as well. Way to insult and alienate your fans Clive!Readers: try Alistair Maclean or Lee Child, both of whom can do this sort of thing properly. This was my first Cussler book (thank god it was only borrowed and not bought) - it will almost certainly be my last."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Okay, I can suspend my disbelief at will, and I can buy in to all the fanciful aspects of this book. It's got a bit of everything: Comet strikes, armageddon, nazis, ancient civilizations, cool doodads, etc. etc.What I can't stand is bad writing. The book would go from Holding my interest and being a genuine page-turner to making me gag at the appalling grammar and writing style that I had to put it down for a few days.I won't be reading any more Cussler books, but I enjoyed this fluff anyway. Too many groans, too many cliches, and Why oh why did Clive Cussler make himself a character in his own book? Geez!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I ordered a new book and got an old stained book. It's never been read, but looks like it got wet."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Clive Cussler has done it again! Another suspenseful masterpiece which I couldn't put down. Dirk Pitt is beginning to show his age in this one. I can't wait for the next generation of heroes to sprout from Clive Cussler's mind."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"awesome...riviting...the best of the bes"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I will admit that I am not shy about blowing my own horn, especially when it comes to finding new authors. I am not ashamed to let people know that I was reading Thomas Pynchon and Cormac McCarthy before anyone else knew about them, or more recently, Craig Holden and Mo Hayder. But fair is fair. There are authors who get by me all the time, and when I find one that I wish I had started reading 10 years ago or more, it's time to 'fess up. So gather round, children, here comes my confession.Clive Cussler has been at it for quite a while, now. I was peripherally aware of his books, such a CYCLOPS and INCA GOLD, but had never read one. I have no excuse. I just never got as far as picking one up and cracking the binding. Well, I celebrated the new year by reading his latest, ATLANTIS FOUND and now I've got some catching up to do --- like about 14 books worth.ATLANTIS FOUND begins in 7120 BC, when a comet smacks into our planet with aftereffects that we are still feeling. This, by the way, is where you're going to get hooked on Clive Cussler, if you are not already. He only dwells on ancient history for a little over six pages, but after reading his description of the comet and its aftermath, you will be lying awake at night listening for the cosmic whistle of one of these bad boys as it approaches...and wondering if we haven't been told about it so that we will all go quietly, instead of in a state of mass panic.Cussler, after scaring your dinner out of you with that description, jumps forward to 1858, where an icebound ship is discovered with mysterious artifacts of an ancient, heretofore unknown civilization on board. However, the ship and its cargo are soon lost again to the Antarctic elements.Cussler then brings us to the very near future --- 2001 --- when a cavern full of strange inscriptions is discovered in a Colorado mine. As a team of anthropologists examines the inscriptions, an explosion seals them deep beneath the earth.It is then, rising like a deus ex machina from the dust, that Dirk Pitt arrives. Part James Bond, part Tom Swift and part Clive Cussler, Pitt is the notable --- and possibly the only --- exception to the rule that one of the three biggest lies in the world is &quot;I'm from the government and I'm here to help you.&quot; Pitt is an &quot;employee&quot; of NUMA --- the National Underwater and Marine Agency --- though at times he appears to function more as a free agent. Only the most blockheaded, shortsighted bureaucrat would ever try to reign him in, for Pitt is the quintessential soldier, friend, lover, scientist, explorer and adventurer rolled into one, with the advantage of being smarter and faster than anyone else.Pitt finds himself on a research ship being attacked by a Nazi U-boat that has not been seen in 56 years, attempts a daring rescue off of the coast of Argentina, and is part of a two-man attack upon a facility that is attempting to launch a cataclysm the likes of which have not been seen in almost 9000 years. And all of it is linked to that comet. But Pitt does not have long to dwell on such matters. He has only ten minutes to save the world.Is Pitt lucky? Sure. Is he too good to be true? Maybe. But who cares? Cussler is extremely sure-footed, keeping just the right balance of class, romance and action to keep his readers enthralled. Whoever said that picture is worth a thousand words has never read Cussler. ATLANTIS FOUND makes any special-effects laden film seem stodgy by comparison. Besides, if a film as good and as exciting as this book were made, the viewers would never see the final scene --- they would be down at the local hospital, lying on a gurney, sipping oxygen in a drafty hallway. As far as I'm concerned, I won't have time for any movies. I have a Clive Cussler backlist to catch up on. And if the other Dirk Pitt books are even half as good as ATLANTIS FOUND, it will be time well-spent.--- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub for Bookreporter.com"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"The second worst book I have ever read. Dialogue is utterly atrocious and the plot just gets more ludicrous as you go.The first few pages seemed promising and having never read a Cussler novel before I was optimistic. After the first few eye rolling sections of dialogue I was starting to worry a bit, but we then progressed to Dirk Pitt's ridiculous stuntman abilities and I abandoned all hope.It reads like an Austin Powers movie plot line with a 80's Schwarzenegger movie dialogue.I like escapism as much as the next person but I just could not get past the awful writing. I had my wife laughing out loud when I would read out a paragraph. If you can read the \\"Hitler's Sperm\\" references without groaning then you might enjoy this action packed mess, otherwise try something else."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Easily the worst the of the seven Pitt novels I have read. I mean, all of the negative reviews pretty much sum up my thoughts. I read books hand over fist but this one took me weeks to plod through. A jumbled mess in dire need of editing. Still, of the many fans I know of these books, this is one of their favourites, so whatever man. This is one of the least likely Pitt adventures, having virutally nothing to do with his career and almost everything to do with being a secret agent / commando. As crappy as a book it makes, it would be an outstanding movie. Cool villans and villanous plot, but in the end, not much comes of it but a gun fight. A little hollywood tweaking here and there and you've have a very fun and forgetable film for all your kids to waste your money on."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This was a major dissapointment to me. I have read every Cussler / Dirk Pitt adventure and relish the release of a new one.For lack of a better word, this book was &quot;tired.&quot; Every book as a lot of the same things and this just seemed like a retread of a retread. I think due to a comment one of the characters makes later in the story that Cussler realizes this himself and may put the series to rest.If this is the best he can do, than I think that's a good idea.If you are a first timer or have only read one or two other books - skip this one. If you are a die hard fan and must read, than do so -I hope you enjoy it more than I did."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Hey, if you don't like thrillers, hit the road. Go read Toni Morrison. Duh. I read for escape and fun and this book fit the bill. I recommend others like it where the author doesn't pretend to be the next coming of Shaksespeare-- Greg Donegan's ATLANTIS is cool-- found it through looking this book up"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"The ultimate guilty pleasure. With 10 clich&eacute;s per page he would have failed my freshman English class. We all know Cussler can't write his way out of a rice paper bag, but who cares? He writes a great story and you just gotta love Dirk Pitt."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Cussler's story about a new generation of Nazis based in Argentina is largely built upon Graham Hancock's book Fingerprints of the Gods (a lost maritime civilization, earth-crust displacement, ancient maps, etc.). Cussler tries to create an action/suspense novel using this as a backdrop, and even if his writing weren't so poor - AWFUL dialog, weak characters, unrealistic action sequences - it would still have been challenging to weave a credible storyline out of these elements. Thus, it is hardly surprising that the author fails so miserably in his attempt to do so. At times he came across as an extremely lowbudget version of Tom Clancy, without the depth of knowledge and feel for dialog that Mr. Clancy has, thereby making a bad situation even worse. Atlantis Found is by far one of the worst books I have ever read, and I would highly recommend NOT buying it, and picking up Fingerprints of the Gods instead (and a couple of Elmore Leonard books as well!)."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"All around it was a good book, but to be honest I skipped the ending and decided to put it down. It started out real good but towards the end I just gave up. Dirk Pitt seems to be a superman Indiana Jones. I understand he is supposed to be in league with NUMA, which deals with oceanography. When I moved from NC to OK, I missed the ocean so much that I flirted with the idea of giving up anthropology for Oceanography. From what I learned about Oceanography is that often not much worth any excitment happens. The Dirk Pitt novels seem a little far-fetched for me. Plus, they have Pitt to be out to be this super human character which I don't like at all. They also have his girlfriend out to be this similar super human, in fact, most of the characters all have the same persona. Of course Dirk, being the hero, is far more superior than the rest. As far as the archeology emphasis on the theories of Atlanitis I could say that is believable. However, adding the whole Hilter theme just caused me to loose interest. I understand there are rumors of Hilter resorting to genetics at the time of his reign and that adds an interesting twist, despite the fact that it all still revolves around the Nazi aspect of things. After finding out the plan, knowing Pitts character I decided to stop reading it knowing that Dirk of course would save the day. A reader needs a surprise ending, something to capture our interests, and let us looking forward to the next of a writer's books. With this book of course it would end with Dirk saving the day"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"It's unfathomable to me how after writing this book Clive Cussler expects anyone to continue buying his books. I used to be a Dirk Pitt fan, but Cussler clearly couldn't care less about his fans any longer, either that or he has a very low opinion of their intelligence. A few of his earlier Dirk Pitt novels were amusing reads but this one just plain stinks. The writing is terrible, the characters are beyond shallow, the plot is full of holes and the dialogue is worse than an old Gilligan's Island rerun. To say I was disappointed is a huge understatement. Clive's lost me as a customer... Try Patrick O'Brian's novels about the sea instead."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"You would be hard-pressed to find a bigger Cussler fan than me, and I've been there since I first picked up 'Raise The Titanic' in the late 70's and since then Dirk has become somewhat of a personal friend to me (or so I would like to think) and I have really got to know him well over the years--and the same goes for Al, Rudy and Admiral Sandecker...I ALWAYS look forward to something written by Cussler, whether it be his new series with Kurt Austin (which I feel are actually pretty good books so far) or his non-fiction stories behind Dirk or Clive's own heroic adventures, if it has Clive Cussler on the cover, I am GOING to BUY it.Cussler simply does not write a bad story. Some are better and more thrilling than others, but 'Atlantis Found' is easily one of the better Dirk Pitt adventures. I find it funny how people attack Clive's research into his novels, as if they could believe certain parts of his stories, but other parts were just impossible to fathom...it reminds me of a friend of mine who complained about certain portions of Star Wars saying, 'That could never happen!' As if the rest was entirely 100% accurate! C'mon! Clive is THE KING of ALL Action in print, and 'Atlantis Found' is a perfect example of exactly why. This is a complex story that spans 10 Millennia--LITERALLY. Could it be that the lost continent of Atlantis actually existed? What does the Nazi's have to do with Antarctica? Is it possible that a comet will actually decimate the earth as predicted by an ancient civilization more advanced than any in modern history...? All of these questions are raised in 'Atlantis Found' and all are answered with an amazing dose of thrilling edge-of-your-seat adventure piled on top of conspiracy on top of more action. Simply put, if you read Cussler for sheer thrill, pace and excitement, you know just why us die-hard readers lap up his books like an addictive drug, we crave something FUN and Clive serves it up hot and fresh each and every time. I have NEVER been disappointed in one of his novels yet, mostly because I don't look for something that isn't there. I KNOW what to expect when I begin one of these novels, and that is exactly what I get. It's like seeing a James Bond movie--you KNOW pretty much what to expect--and THAT is the reason why you keep coming back for more. I have said it before, and I'll say it again: 'Long Live Clive'. 'Atlantis Found' is by NO MEANS a literary masterpiece, but it IS a fun ride. Climb aboard and enjoy the cruise."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I've read every book of Cussler's and have enjoyed them immensely! They are farfetched and Al and Dirk have just too many lives (more than cats!), but the stories are always entertaining.What I can't abide is the number of typos that are showing up with increasing frequency in all the books I read! Granted, only two that I found showed up in Atlantis Found, but with the price of books these days, you would expect a better job of editing and proofreading.There is nothing worse than being &quot;in&quot; a story, and getting thrown out by typos! What's happening to the editors and proofreaders at the publishing houses? Trying to cut back on costs?The two in this book contained the word &quot;form&quot; instead of &quot;from&quot; and passengers possessive without the apostrophe. I know, I know, what's the big deal? But as a proofreader, I make my money ensuring quality and can't stand when things aren't &quot;perfect.&quot;"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I have found the last two Cussler &quot;Dirk Pitt&quot; novels lacking in their usual excitement and knowledegable entertainment. There seems to be more violence and sexual innuendos than precious books. I feel as if Cussler gave his characters to someone else to write with. Having read every Pitt novel its easy to sense the subtle changes in his tales. The best novels are &quot;Sahara&quot; and &quot;Raise the Titanic&quot;."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I've been ordering these books for my son, who is in a correctional institution - he really enjoys Dirk Pitt, and I've ordered them in the order they were written by Clive Cussler. Great reading for him."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I think for me, one of the allures of the Dirk Pitt series is the nomadic nature of the characters. We start in this book in Colorado and end up someplace quite cold. In between we visit a board room or two and an airplane hangar except there are no planes here. There is a core group that does um research for NUMA. Inevitably Dirk is right in the middle of whatever is going down. Sharp, experience-honed instincts has kept him alive on countless occasions. The group may split up and have two story lines followed until they collide again. The mystery is intriguing and trying to figure it out is half the fun. There is no graphic sex for the sake of it...although Dirk is one lucky son-of-a-gun. The various locales make this another great read from Cussler. One of the most anxious moments is a boat race including small and not-so-small arms fire. Dirk distracts you with one scene only to bring in an element long forgotten from another scene that saves the day...I hope that didn't ruin the ending, but let's face it, if you've looked around, DDD(Dirk Doesn't Die)."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I LOVED THIS BOOK!!! It was full of action packed adventure and great one liners...I recommend it to everyone!!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"A 6000 foot (over a mile long) passenger liner that is 32 stories tall?Need I say more?"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This was my first foray into the Dirk Pitt series - the result of a well-intentioned gift from a peer - and it will likely be my last. The best thing I can say is the book goes pretty quickly. The plot is mildly compelling in that B-movie/Saturday-serial sort of way, but Cussler appears to have an eigth-grader's grasp of plot development, dialogue, and the English language. The writing was so laughably bad in parts that I found myself reading entire passages aloud to friends and family, compelled to press on to the end for the certainty that there was worse (and therefore more entertaining) writing just ahead. How much worse could it get?! Plenty.Character development for Dirk Pitt largely consists of his recitation of print ads from Robb Report to prove he's an agent of dicriminating taste. There's enough product placement that I expected an order form in the back and a NASCAR-style book cover patched over with ads. Throughout the novel, Cussler's over-simplified and cliched characterizations are enough to make a WWF writer blush. Having read this book, Michael Crichton now seems like a genius.Needless to say, Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay must be chomping at the bit to make this clunker their next trashy summer blockbuster for the masses."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Never been moved to write a review in many years of reading, but this story is thrown together so carelessly, I found it hard to keep an eye on the plot because of all the sloppy contradictions."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I don't care what the other people have said about this book. Dirk Pitt is one of the most amazing heroes in any book today. Giordino is also one of the best. Clive Cussler hooks up with a great plot and endless suspense. A must for Clive Cussler fans. I not only recomend it, I support it 100%!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Dirk Pitt books are all fun airplane reading - lots of excitement, by the end of which Dirk and Al have saved the world. Same here. Somehow, though, while I can suspend disbelief pretty well for almost any science fiction and for James Bond, Cussler's work always seems to bring me to the brink of disappointing disbelief. And it always takes an effort to get past that. That is true for this book, in spades."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Let me make it easy for everyone. If you like Cussler you'll like this. If you've never read Cussler and your the guy who complains about the realism in an action movie you won't like it. It's suppossed to be fun, and that's all. Please don't take the english teacher's red pen to it."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I have been a Cussler fan for years, which is hard to believe since I'm not that old myself. I think if you're looking for a great read and a grand adventure, this is a WONDERFUL book to pick up, especially if you're a Cussler fan. Like any good action movie or book, you need to read this to enjoy it - if you try and find errors and discrepencies throughout the storyline and plot, you won't enjoy yourself very much, will you? As far-fetched as a lot of Pitt's adventures seem to be (and this one goes right up there!), it's still grand and exciting. And these are characters you come to LOVE. As for me, I'm still cheering Dirk and Al on."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Atlantis Found is without a doubt the best Dirk Pitt adventure yet. This time Pitt is back with Al Giordino, Adm. Sandecker, and a host of others as they try to uncover the mystery behind a sealed chamber within a Colorado mountain. Filled with adventure and excitement, Atlantis Found is must-read for Pitt fans. Even if you've never read Cussler's stuff before, read this book! Great stuff."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I feel compelled to warn people that Atlantis Found is probably one of the worst books I've ever read. I've enjoyed other books by Cussler, and appreciated them for what they were. However, this is so poorly written I almost felt embarrassed for the guy. I would under no circumstances recommend this to anyone."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This is the first Clive Cussler novel I have read, and found it a quick and entertaining read. I had to put aside a great deal of my own scientific background to suspend disbelief - there is, for instance, NO geologic evidence of a mass extinction on the scale described, 10,000 years ago. There was indeed a mass extinction that coincided with the end of the last Ice Age, but not like the devastation that wiped out the Dinosaurs. In the K/T event, nothing over 20 pounds survived. If the comet impact as described in this book was of a similar scale, and we are led from the text to believe it was, then again nothing over 20 pounds would have survived - which includes early humans, no matter how high up in the mountains they were living. Rapid crustal displacement is also a highly questionable theory, and is not needed to explain flash-frozen mammoths with fresh food still in their stomachs (the author's own description of weather in Antarctica would have had the same effect, with storms coming out of nowhere in an eyeblink). But that aside, I could \\"make believe\\" and get on with reading the story.The author would have done well with a sharp-eyed editor or a good writer's group, to catch all the odd wordings, missing details, and clunky sentence structure that peppers the novel, but that too is ignorable and doesn't get too much in my way of enjoying the book. The characters are shallow, but like in a good action film, they don't need to be deep. It's meant to be escapism. I did think that the doomsday scenario was averted rather too early and anticlimatically, a few chapters from the end of the book - the rest of which felt like an almost irrelevant tying up of loose ends. I must say I also didn't care so much for how *every* loose end was tied up - perhaps because I'm more accustomed to fiction in which the main \\"villain\\" lives to rise another day, or some other lingering threat still remains unresolved. However, some of the *big* questions remained completely unaddressed: the significance of the obsidian skulls, the warnings of the Amedes.All in all, though it was a satisfying large-scale story, I hoped the plot would focus more on \\"Atlantis Found\\" as promised in the title - but we only got a passing glimpse of the lost city. I did think it was clever how the author inserted himself into the story in a brief cameo, and had a couple of inside-joke exchanges with his main characters. That was probably the most memorable part of the book to me."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This is easily my favorite novel of all time.Now, that tends to be a hefty statement, so let me explain:This was the very first Clive Cussler novel I'd ever read. In fact, it was the first 'adult' novel I'd ever read. I'd dabbled with the classics like Tom Sawyer and 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea, but this was my gateway into contemporary. And after the prologue I was hooked.Not only was this book the gateway drug that's lead to me reading every single novel Cussler ever put into print (as well as branching off into everything written by Jack DuBrul and Craig Dirgo, who sometimes co-authored with Cussler) but it got me hooked on the need to read every book I could get my hands on.Even though Harry Potter is the primary cause of inspiring reading in most people my age, I didn't start that series until AFTER this book lit a fire under my ass. And I doubt there's any other reason I would have slugged through The Lord of the Rings in its entirety.As to the story itself: I found it to be solid and well-written, one of the last great pieces Mr. Cussler gave us before so many of his latest novels found themselves on the receiving end of unfavorable reviews.But in all honesty, there's little else I can say while trying to explain my love of this novel. Someone may call it the worst piece of trash ever written, but it will always and forever hold the title of my all-time favorite book.Despite some of Clive's recent faults and hit-or-misses, I can personally attest to his having changed at least ONE life by converting what is sure to be a lifelong reader.I'd like to think of that as something for an author to be proud of."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"&quot;Atlantis Found&quot; is Clive Cussler's best work since the terrific &quot;Sahara&quot; came out in 1992. The plot is one of his best, the action is non-stop and there are also several pleasant surprises in the book that will make you smile when you're not rooting for the dynamic duo of Dirk Pitt and Al Giordino.I had enjoyed his most recent novels (&quot;Flood Tide&quot;, &quot;Shock Wave&quot; and &quot;Inca Gold&quot;) but they didn't grab me like his previous novels. But &quot;Atlantis Found&quot; leaves no doubt that the &quot;Grandmaster of Adventure&quot; hasn't lost his touch at the keyboard. A rip-roaring read!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Mr. Cussler's books are great escapist fiction. His newest, \\"Atlantis Found\\", I believe is one of the better tales he has told. The other enjoyment that comes with a Cussler novel is watching the professional critics try to trash his work. They don't get it, but as these novels routinely make the best-seller lists, we the readers do. The critics do get it, but they prefer books that get the literary equivalent of an Academy Award, while Mr. Cussler takes home The People's Choice Award.\\"Atlantis Found\\" is way over the top, fantastic in what is spread on its' 534 pages, and most importantly fun, and a great read. Dirk Pitt and Al Giordino are a combination of, Indiana Jones, James Bond, The Saint, the members of the old and new Mission Impossible teams, and a dash of The Duke John Wayne leading the cavalry. Sure the book has its clich&eacute;'s, but does not every Bond film as well? Mr. Cussler gives his readers what they enjoy, and what may be one person's clich&eacute;, is another's cue that he or she is about to embark on an adventure with old friends. If you read Mr. Cussler you have probably read well into this latest work, and if you are not yet amongst his readers, \\"Atlantis Found\\", is a good place to start."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I'm sorry to say but I am disappointed in Atlantis Found. Cussler is known for his brilliant plot twists and his ability to weave unrelated ideas into a suspenseful journey through a modern day treasure hunt. Inca Gold for example is one of Cussler's finest works of literature. He combines the death of two unrelated heroes and the idea that the Earth will be destroyed by a deadly microbe. The final outcome is both suspenseful and energetic. You would expect his strengths to only get stronger, but Cussler seems to have lost some of his creative genius. Atlantis found has virtually no plot twists or in-depth characters. We see none of see none of Pitt's legendary ability to pick up any woman he wants. Each character is only summarily described with no emphasis placed on their strengths or ability's. I recommend you read this book, but a library is a much better place to get it. This is one of the few Cussler books that when you put it down at the end, you may never want to pick up again."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Clive Cussler does it once again - he has written yet another Dirk Pitt adventure worthy of a place in classic popular literature! This time Dirk Pitt, Al Girodino and assorted colleagues discover the artifacts from an ancient civilisation which was wiped out by a comet hitting the Earth in 7120 BC. This part forms a fantastic prologue. Then we move to 1858 AD, where a British galleon is found in the Antarctic ice filled with treasures from a distant age . . . then in 2001, Dirk is back! What is the significance of a mysterious German billionaire and his family holding Nazi treasures? When he learns that such family, the Wolfs, are responsible for trapping them in a Colorado mine and covering up the evidence to stop others seeing the artifacts, Dirk once again uncovers more than expected - a villian more diabolical than any other he has encountered! When I read what the bad guy's ultimate aim was, it was pure James Bond material, of course, but it didn't stop my enjoyment of the book. Clive Cussler is the master of escapism. The prose is simple to follow without too much in the way of technobabble, the pacing is fast and consistent and the story is surprisingly believeable at times. And the ending was both a surprise in itself and very amusing! We also meet a certain character called Clive Cussler during the second half. 'His name sounds vaguely familiar,' says Dirk Pitt in the narrative. I don't know why people dislike Clive writing himself into the story, I think it's great fun myself. But this book ranks as one of Cussler's finest moments, along with SAHARA, DRAGON, NIGHT PROBE and TREASURE. Don't miss this one!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"The geological descriptions, mirroring those of the catastrophic meteor impact at Chicxulub off the North coast of Yucatan implicated in the extinction of the dinosaurs, caught my attention with the first page of Atlantis Found and kept me reading to the end. Although I really don't care for the Dirk Pitt persona-he seems too much of a comic book character-I did enjoy the pace and shear adventure of the tale. It is certainly very imaginative.Like the Bond series, every woman is a beauty of one type or another, every bad guy (or gal) is totally reprehensible, their demise justly deserved, and every \\"good guy\\" from 8 to 80 exhibits intelligence, fortitude, cavalier indifference in the face of physical danger, and the comic repertoire of a Bill Cosby. Each one is a hero at whichever of the different stages of the male life cycle he may be. If middle aged fathers have fantasies, they are undoubtedly of exploits similar to the Dirk Pitt series: their hair \\"maturely\\" greying at the temples, their muscles aching but undaunted by their travails, and just their very life experience able to outwit even the most brilliant of the bad guys. (Too bad, though, that we don't give the guys in our lives the credit they are very much due for reading us to sleep as children, helping us with math problems as adolescents, and forgiving us our arrogance as young adults, and for the very much braver task of being there day after day when they might possibly have realized more of their own dreams instead!)I was glad for once to find the oft repeated Atlantis story told in a more light hearted vein. I've studied ancient history, including early Greek history, and have come across the persistent modern belief in Atlantis often enough to cringe when I meet it again. The author's treatment certainly made it much more fun to contemplate. Like some of those mainstream geologists mentioned by Cussler in the book, whose stodgy concepts of earth science forbade them to believe in a continent that sank beneath the sea, I too am skeptical. But then I've studied geology extensively, too. Continents are really too light to sink. They float. Not on water, but on the much denser but more plastic magma that lies beneath them. Cussler's concept of a transgressing sea is almost the only way that Atlantis might be considered remotely possible. (Though I too believe that the Greek island of Santorini, ancient Thera, is a more likely candidate.)Although a little pedantic, the information that the scientists in the book provide Pitt about history, geology, astronomy, and anthropology is, for the most part, quite accurate. The reader gets to learn a little bit about these subjects along with the adventure (and just might develop a new interest, following up on one of them). Cussler's own background in underwater archaeology (he participated in the search for the CSS Hunley, the world's first successful submarine lost during the Civil War) and in deep sea diving make the oceanographic descriptions and the underwater exploits of his characters seem more real. Certainly his widely traveled life has given him a talent for describing the details of the world's different cities, landscapes and cultures. The pacing of the story is superb. One hardly has a chance to get in sync with any one adventure before the heros are off chasing the bad guys again in some other part of the world. I particularly enjoyed the descriptions and adventures in the gold mines of Colorado, and the description of the Opera House in Buenos Aires.Enjoyable too is the fact that the book does not take itself seriously enough to try to place itself in any \\"real\\" time. The President is a fictional character. Technology that for us is just beyond the horizon and therefore familiar only as buzz words (nanotechnology) is in the present tense for Pitt and his peers. That leaves the door wide open for the author to let ancient Atlantis and its artifacts survive the end of the story. Unlike similar stories where all traces of the discovery must be \\"lost\\" to keep the story \\"true\\" to our times, Cussler lets the reader glory in the relicts of the ancient city preserved beneath the ice. We get to imagine the treasures as existing for our enjoyment, not forever lost. Much more satisfying.The book presents itself as good fantasy fiction of a particularly masculine variety."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Okay, I'm admitting it up front-- I am addicted to Clive Cussler and have been since I was ten. I've read every Dirk Pitt book and, for awhile, I wanted to grow up to be just like him (at least I think I've given that up).I know going in that Cussler has developed a formula for his books that he doesn't deviate from. (Give Clive some credit, however-- it's got to be hard to come up with an original way to destroy the world every two years!) There will be a car chase in a classic automobile. There will be some megarich arch villian who wants to kill many people for personal profit. There will be a situation in which there is no way the woman will survive, yet Dirk manages to save her anyway. (You just knew that there'd be a cave-in and Dirk would come to the rescue, didn't you?) You will get the exact same descriptions of all the reoccurring characters that were in the previous books. I accept this because, like I said, I am addicted and Dirk and Al are fun, which is ultimately what brings me back (not to give anything away, but Dirk's actions at the end of the book are classic). After all, fiction is supposed to be entertaining.While &quot;Atlantis Found&quot; is better than the stuff Clive put out in the late 1980's (sorry, but &quot;Sahara&quot; was terrible), it still falls short of his early works. Remember when the historic event of the prelogue was somewhat of a mystery and actually became an important part of the plot? Not in this book.But if you're a Cussler veteran, you've come to expect this and will enjoy the book nonetheless. And if your new to Cussler's books, you won't care about any of this. Just make sure you also pick up a copy of &quot;Raise the Titanic,&quot; &quot;Night Probe!&quot; or &quot;Vixon 03&quot; to make sure you really get a sense of this author's mastery.One last thing-- Clive, STOP WRITING YOURSELF INTO THE BOOK! It's unbecoming."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I am only disappointed when they end. I read so quickly through them that I then regret reading them so fast. This one had a suspenseful plot and different kind of adventures for several members of NUMA not just Dirk. Great read, do not do like I did though, don't read it too fast, because it makes the wait for the next one even longer!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Mr. Cussler, I am a big fan and have read all your Dirk Pitt books. They are great entertainment. Even when Dirk and Al make escapes more improbable than James Bond or Rambo, they do it in such style that avid readers like me let it slide -- and even enjoy it.However, a theme developed in your newest book posits an improbability that I can't quite get past...In your book, Atlantis Found, your character, Dr. Friend, describes the Ross ice shelf as the largest body of floating ice in the world. The premise of the book is that movement of this ice would cause an imbalance or increased wobble in the rotation of the Earth, triggering a cataclysmic polar shift.Here's what's bugging me... My dad, an old sea-dog told me as a very young boy that a floating object displaces its exact weight in whatever medium w/in which it is floating -- in this case, water. So, if the Ross Ice shelf were to move, the water displaced in its new location would weigh the same as the Ross Ice shelf, and the water that rushed in to fill the position formerly occupied by the ice shelf would weigh just the same as the ice shelf.The only reason floating ice is larger in volume than the water it displaces is that the ice is crystalline and has a lower density.In short, no net weight shift would take place at all. Things would be different if the ice fell from land into the sea.So, either my dad was wrong, or you are. Or perhaps your point is that Nazis are just stupid people..."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Cussler fans rejoice! Atlantis Found is Awesome! Clive Cussler's latest thriller will not disappoint the legion of fans worldwide who have been waiting two long years for a Dirk Pitt novel. Along with the classic Dirk entrances, fans will be surprised and pleased that Dirk's long time leading lady,Loren Smith, takes an active roll in the plot. Many suprises are in store for our heros as they battle the odds to save the world from a destruction beyond comprehension. Be prepared to spend a few sleepless nights reading Atlantis Found. You will have a hard time finding that &quot;stopping place&quot;. Yes, Virgina, there is a Santa Claus. He delivered a classic Dirk Pitt novel just in time for Christmas."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"The few reviews I've read of this are all WAY OFF! Obviously the so-called 'professional' reviewers have little idea of what constitutes a 'good' book written by the 'Grand Master of Adventure'. If you are a fan of Clive Cussler, GET THIS BOOK. Is it a dramatic departure from the writing style he has done in the past? Nope. In fact his style seems exactly the same, but like a fine Bond movie, we keep coming back for more to see what kinds of adventures Dirk and Company can get into next--and still escape from-- while managing to save the world at the same time. My hats off to Clive for a great tale told in fine form. If you fancy yourself a pure Pitt fan, don't deny your addiction...give IN and BUY THIS BOOK. By the end you will have staved off the nights of obsession just trying to wait until the paperback edition, and whetted your appetite for more, and you just might re- read some older Pitt adventures, just for fun. Reading the stories of Dirk Pitt is like re-joining a dream you awoke from that you didn't want to. Enjoy and thank me later."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I hadn't read any Cussler, let alone any Dirk Pitt novels before. This one caught my attention because the Atlantis theme coincides with my interest in humankind's prehistory.Fairly early on though I decided I would need to set my disbelief to one side and just go with the flow if I wanted to derive any enjoyment from this book. Anthropologists will surely hurl this pot boiler across the room and issue indignant snorts at the notion that almost the entire human race was wiped out in 7,000 B.C. Furthermore, during the denouement, the tactics employed to thwart the villains are somewhat farcical when a simpler solution is staring us in the face!But Cussler never intended to give us an accurate history lesson, and let's get onto the plot! This is a rollicking adventure where our rugged and handsome hero knocks the preverbial out of sinister foreigners with funny accents and discovers the lost continent of Atlantis, almost without breaking sweat. Dirk Pitt is definitely up there with Indiana Jones and James Bond and probably hasn't got far to go to give Superman a run for his money. He's the kind of mega-tough guy who, if his lungs start to hurt, he spits them out and gets on with saving civilisation as we know it. He always has a witty line in repartee on his tongue too, and don't the ladies just lap it up! In real life he would probably come over as Leisure Suit Larry's more dangerous brother and would be regarded as rather corny by any streetwise modern woman. The womem in Dirk Pitt's world however are invariably beautiful and frequently in need of rescue by our invincible square-jawed hero, which, of course, he invariably accomplishes in the nick of time.But enough irony and nitpicking! The action (and boy, is there plenty of that!) is very competently described and I defy anyone not to devour this hefty tome (500+ pages) in a flurry of undemanding but enjoyable page turning. I swear you will shiver as Cussler depicts the numbing effects of wind-chill on our hero!So, classic literature this ain't, but I enjoyed it all the same and have no regrets about buying my first ticket into the rather simplistic but pretty damn entertaining world of Dirk Pitt."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Dirk Pitt you are very annoying. I love James Bond, and i love Indiana Jones even more. But Dirk Pitt, you are neither. Your toys, interests and looks are overly cliched. I'm afraid you just bother me. This novel offered an interesting insight to this lost city, but it is hard to figure out what is fact and what is fiction. The story is quite outlandish. One thing i did appreciate about this novel was the answer to &quot;why good guys' bullets hit, and bad guys' miss?&quot; The answer...good guys aim."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Clive Cussler writes bestsellers. I'm not sure how!The storyline in Atlantis Found is far-fetched. Great - no problem there. The writer's job is to get the reader to suspend belief and, so far as ANY storyline is concerned, I can suspend belief when the writing allows me to (I love the Harry Potter books, for example). Unfortunately, Cussler's writing often falls well below standard, dropping at times into the abysmal. This is why I can't understand why his books are bestsellers.Throughout Atlantis Found, my enjoyment was spoilt by badly phrased sentences, poor grammar and, even worse, large chunks of explanation passed off as dialogue. If you read through some of the dialogues and try to imagine two people actually speaking, you'll see what I mean. And, as far as clich&eacute; goes, what about the old guy on the ice towards the end? &quot;Hello, my name's Clive Cussler.&quot; That's a surefire way to draw the reader's attention away from the plot.It seems to me that Cussler has the ability to dream up good plots, but not the ability to write them down. Maybe he should employ a ghost writer."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I normally like Cussler, but this just seemed to be a similiar theme from an author that was tired of his characters - I got the feeling right from the start that it would be the last one in the series. It was a shame because it could have been so much better - there were plenty of noticeable inconsistences - not something I had seen before in his previous books. Never mind - maybe Cussler should invent some new characters, and move away from the global disaster theme! Lets face it - if it wasn't for the fact that the Bond stories are films (special effects, bond girls, corny lines, etc) then we wouldn't be interested in story number 12 (or whatever!). I suppose my point is is that it is time to leave Al and Dirk to their homemaking and scuba diving, and find another HERO!!!See yA!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This book got off on a strong beginning, lots of details in the middle, and then a weak and disappointing ending."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I LOVED this book.

Dirk, Al, Rudy, Admiral Sandecker and the others work together to solve this latest mystery of ships frozen in time, black skulls carved out of obsidian scattered all over the world and the fiends out to cause mass destruction. In his usual way of having you on the edge of your chair and gulping a deep breath because you didn't know that you were holding it, Mr. Cussler brings everything together in a clear, educational, entertaining manner. The word play between the main characters makes you laugh out loud as you have come to know the characters from previous books and know the continuing harassment covers true friendships. Mr. Cussler's books always have you wondering when he is going to pop up as one of the characters himself. This book will not disappoint a true Clive Cussler fan.

In Atlantis Found Dirk takes us to the South Pole and the reign of the New Dynasty.

From there Atlantis Found takes you on a rollercoaster ride from the depths of a mine in Colorado to the cold depths of the South Pole. Clive Cussler even has a cameo in his own book. Not to give anything away, but readers look for a character referred to as \\"Dad\\"!! With Dirk and Al Giordino's quick wit the book is fabulous. The best yet!!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I was introduced to Dirk Pitt by reading Inca Gold and have enjoyed that one more than his earlier work. Atlantis Found has a great prologue and a plot that is rapid during the first half of the book and still quite stimulating during the second half. But even with a long book, Cussler has kept the &quot;fun&quot; in Pitt. At a time in life that many adventure authors slow down, I feel (i.e. Clancy's The Bear and The Dragon), Cussler has written his best novel yet!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"As a mystery writer with my first novel in its initial release, I am a great admirer of Clive Cussler's success. When critics comment that my protagonist is almost too good to be true, I think of Cussler's Dirk Pitt. Pitt is a globe-trotting, brilliant, daring, courageous adventurer who annually manages to save the world. In this most recent Dirk Pitt--the sixteenth, I believe--he is taking on an amoral outfit that calls itself The Fourth Empire. Pitt enlists a beautiful expert in ancient languages to assist him in his battle with evil, and the action never stops to catch its breath. ATLANTIS FOUND is exactly what Cussler's fans have grown to expect from his books. Cussler does what he does better than anyone else, and I recommend ATLANTIS FOUND highly."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This book starts off slow. It soon escalates into a super thriller. Dirk Pitt is an adventurous fellow."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Since 1979, I have eagerly awaited every new Clive Cussler book... I give credit to Cussler and to Pitt for instilling in me the desire to be a researcher and academic, to search out the answers to everyday mysteries....I read Atlantis Found over a 24-hour period last summer after I finished my Master's thesis.... Dirk Pitt. Okay, so he's getting up there in age. The character is in his late 40's (I checked some sources, birthdate is 1952) but Cussler never fails to give us the one-two-three punch. I read the excerpt of Atlantis in Dirk Pitt Revealed and couldn't wait. Cussler masterful prose at creating the scene of the birth and death of the mythical island is spellbinding. Putting scenes and action aside, I feel that this is the best character development novel for Cussler and Pitt to-date. He has set the stage for his next novel. I cried at the end of this novel because I could see it coming. I lanquish at reading the next for fear of what it might contain and yet, I'm itching to tell my parents to bring me a copy of it with them when they visit in September. For me Dirk Pitt is ageless and thank heavens he is a character on a piece of paper I can go back to time and time again.If anything, if this is your first visit to Clive Cussler's world, read this to tempt you back to his other books.

If you religiously read all of Cussler's novels, then nothing anybody says will stop you from reading this one, and you'll most likely be satisfied. I have been read all his novels from Raise the Titanic! onward, but in my opinion they have been getting consistently worse over the last decade. Of course you expect a fantastic James-Bondish plot; that's a given when you buy a Cussler novel. But it seems to me his actual writing, the prose itself, has been deteriorating rapidly. After reading Serpent I really hoped all his future works would be collaborations. I don't consider myself an english language expert, but I still wince while reading Cussler's recent books. Everyone talks like Data on Star Trek, with precise elaborate grammar and no contractions! I also had trouble getting past some of the total scientific improbablility in this work; one thing I loved about his earlier books was the though-provoking &quot;hey...that could've happened&quot; historical basis to the plots.

Man, that plot device is tired out!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Next to &quot;Sahara&quot; this is by far Cussler's best.

My Uncle is deceased now but going through the house after his death I accidently found a stack of unpublished manuscripts that would headed for the dumpster as no one knew about them. I salveged them and working on getting them in print as they are wonderful cival war historical novels. The first one is named Cry Liberty as is centered around Lychburg and Col Lynch and the war.

The blended letters of Susan and Charles Blackford, two erudite, observant members of the Virginian gentry, tell the story of one family's Civil War struggle in the frontlines and on the homefront beautifully. Susan describes the loss of children, the battle to feed family, and the \\"impression\\" she made in front of her husband's unit plunging headfirst into a mudpile. Charles observes the war from the vantages of both the line and the staff, and supplies some incredible character studies ranging from Jeff Davis to Lee and Jackson, down to the private soldier (with the impudence of a town cow). A collection of letters from someone who wrote on a warmed frying pan to keep his hand from freezing probably deserves reading regardless! My third reading..."},{"Title":"James Madison, (American statesman)","review":"Decent amount of detail of Madison's congressional career.

His family life, early education, and childhood are all examined, as well as his work drafting the Constitution, and his many correspondences with Thomas Jefferson.

I'm sure there are better books about him that this."},{"Title":"Secret Mission to the Philippines: The Story of \\"Spyron\\" & the American-Filipino Guerrillas of World War II","review":"This is an easy read based on actual historical events.

Although it is written to an eighth grade reading level it is still interesting and close enough to the truth for adults."},{"Title":"Secret Mission to the Philippines: The Story of \\"Spyron\\" & the American-Filipino Guerrillas of World War II","review":"On a road trip I picked up a used copy of the 1968 Secret Mission to the Philippines by William Wise. It is a very interesting book in many ways. First, it is a great history about guerilla operations in the Philippines during World War II. Chick Parsons arrived in the Philippines in 1921 as an 18-year old. By the time of the outbreak of the war in the Pacific in 1941, he had had a career and raised a family. He had also served in the US Navy reserve too.That reserve service put him to work after the Philippines were attacked. Ultimately, he avoided imprisonment as a POW and as an enemy alien because of some doubtful credentials as a diplomat. Nevertheless, the account abounds with accounts of POW and internment camps. He and his family are traded for Japanese nationals held in South American and he makes it back to the US. From there he joins MacArthur's staff in Australia and then goes back to the Philippines to organize the resistance groups that had developed. He was quite successful in doing this and was awarded Philippine Medal of Valor (other American recipients: Douglas MacArthur, Chester Nimitz, and Jonathan Wainwright--heady company).I enjoyed the book. I read it all on the day that I bought it. Partially, that was because of the compelling story, but also because it read so easily. It reads as easily as a child's book. Possibly, it reads so easily because it is a bit shallow with complex issues greatly reduced.I enjoyed and recommend the book."},{"Title":"DELIGHTES FOR LADIES. WRITTEN ORIGINALLY BY HUGH PLAT.

Collated and Edited by Violet and Hal Trovillion.","review":"Published in the early part of the seventeenth century (1602) this lovely little book is really a short and nice work on very basic 'huswifery'. There are only a few receits in here it is a smallish book - and they cover a broad range - how to make sugar paste, how to preserve fruit, and then there are the beauty recipes at the end.It has a good broad range. From drying Rose leaves to \\"Diverse sorts of sweet handwaters made suddenly or extempore, with extracted oyles of spices\\" and \\"To boile a Flounder or Pickrell of the French fashion\\"For those who are keen on historical cooking. The recipes are still highly reliant on Dates, raisins, currants, almonds and spices to flavour them and are still quite reminiscent of Northern African cooking or Spanish cooking."},{"Title":"Lion","review":"History wears two faces. One is built of facts and timelines, names and places. But the other face, whose marks are far more indelible, less vulnerable to manipulation, is the image its impresses on those who lived it. This book is about the second: the image of one man that has marked his nation, his people forever. Who turned a valley inside out by breaking the unrelenting bounds of tribe and village. Which is not to say that the author has not been true to the first face in this historical fiction; just that she has gone for the truer, the deeper. That is what makes the books so forth the reading: we meet the man who changed a nation, and in his own way has marked the world. Don't miss it; this is our history, too. We are confronted in a post-September 11 world with the struggles he knew for more than two decades. She keeps it tense with multi-layered suspense, which is a great compliment for a first book. Highly recommended, both for those who want to know the facts, and those who want a face reflects what the facts are all about."},{"Title":"Lion","review":"I have read Lion from start to finish more than once. I knew nothing about Commander Massoud before reading this book, and had he been discussed in yet another nonfiction book, I might never have gotten to know him at all. Because Lion places a fictional Massoud in more-or-less fictional surroundings but is still anchored in historic events and facts, becoming introduced to this amazing Afghan leader was a truly pleasurable experience. The author's respect and admiration for Commander Massoud is evident in every page, and her fictional, fast-paced story about the last eight months of his heroic life will breathe life into him for others who, like me, might otherwise never have known him."},{"Title":"Lion","review":"The most striking thing about this ingenious novel is how a woman in South Carolina who had never been to Afghanistan came to write it and how she could understand a distant figure such as Massoud, the beloved leader in Afghanistan. I don't mean to suggest that this novel is just a will o' the wisp. Ms. Beverly obviously put in a good deal of diligent homework to understand Massoud and his world. That she succeeded is demonstrated by this novel. It also demonstrates the power of using imagination for the cause of peace and understanding, for in the wake of September 11, Ms. Beverly reached back to understand its connection with Massoud's death, the event of a few days before and in doing so conveys respect, affection, and grief for Massoud, a fascinating warrior, scholar, and poet whose life made a difference for his people and for us. With this book, Ms. Beverly says, \\"Pay attention.\\"I think Ms. Beverly reflects the journalist she portrays; her prose contains the tone of the journalist, the facts only please. But it is \\"just the facts\\" resonating in warmth. The first part of the novel manages to convey the situation of Afghanistan, Massoud's and his people's dreams and goals, danger, the beauty of the country, and humor all at the same time. But the moving part, for me, was the last part, when it is Massoud who grieves, and the reader grieves both with and for him, as much as enjoys his company.I remember reading when Massoud was shot, it was something vague and distant. A few days later, there was a hole in my skyline and tremendous grief. How we respond to this event where thousands died tells us something about ourselves. Do we respond with fear or vengeance? Or do we search for the truth of the situation? Massoud grieves in the novel, and then we, who have come to know him in this thoughtful and well researched book, grieve for him and for his dreams - and our own. Ms. Beverly has given us much to ponder."},{"Title":"Lion","review":"Ms. Beverly has captured the heart and essence of the man the world knows as Lion. She has done her research well and presents a good assessment of the times and life Massoud. Her book flows well, and even the most up-to-date history buff, who knows the 'ending' will want to keep reading-possibly hoping for a miracle.

Again, I wish I could give this book more than five stars - it was THAT good...there were times the book was so intense, though, that I had to stop reading for a while...The heiress is Allison Sayre. She's your regular all-American girl. She has a Mom, a Dad, a sister, and a brother. They all love each other and get along. Allison is just beginning to get over the loss of her fiance who broke up with her two or three years before...Then something happens - something happens that serves as a wedge between Allison and her mother; and it effects the entire family...Allison becomes rich after her rich husband leaves her his entire estate, his business, and a legacy...Then we have Benton Lockhart. Benton has been running the book printing company for the last year since Allison's uncle took sick. He is named in the will, and Allison is hopeful he is the nice, young Christian speaker she heard from the Crusade she attended in Indiana. He is, but he isn't. Benton is a different person. He is angry, has rejected God, and has a lot of mystery surrounding him. He begins falling for Allison and is physically attracted to her - they become physical - but he won't release his heart to her...The concepts of God, prayer, and forgiveness are absolutely one hundred percent WONDERFUL in this! I think a preacher could even use the concepts in a sermon and turn many lives around. The revelations revealed near the end touched my heart. The secrets surrounding the reason Allison received the inheritence and the reason Benton is so closed up are heart wrenching!!!I LOVED this book! Anyone who is struggling with the unfairness of life and what seems to be unanswered prayers should read this book! This is a true romance. Both Allison and Benton had to come to terms with their faithlessness and make sacrifices - become humble - before they could indeed come together...This is a must read for EVERYONE!!!Oh, and the romance wasn't have-bad either :-)"},{"Title":"Mark Twain's Autobiography, in Two Volumes (Volume II)","review":"I collect Mark Twain books and love his writing style...

I am sure he will not disappoint.Anita Shari PetersonTalented Tenth Reviewer"},{"Title":"The Looking Heart","review":"Poetry is perhaps one of the most difficult literary art forms to master because the poet must convey a multitude of ideals and emotions in a succinct format. Poetry evokes all the human emotions from humor to heartache. In THE LOOKING HEART: A COLLECTION OF POETRY AND EXPRESSIONS FROM THE HEART, author Marc Lacy focuses on love specifically. He tackles all that love entails: the good, the bad, and the ugly. He discusses love in all its forms, from that of a child to a mother, to that of one lover to the other. Lacy impressively expresses his homage to love in nearly every poetic format by using traditional prose, free verse and odes to display his thoughts.Standout chapters in this book of verse are those entitled \\"Odes From The Heart\\" and \\"Love And Feelings As Seen By The Heart\\". The odes pay homage to various famous and infamous individuals from history who inpired and awed us. I was particularly impressed by the odes to Zora N. Hurston, Princess Diana and Tupac. The chapter \\"Love And Feelings As Seen By The Heart\\" is an eclectic collection that expresses from different viewpoints how love brings both pain and happiness to one's life.THE LOOKING HEART: A COLLECTION OF POETRY AND EXPRESSIONS FROM THE HEART was an interesting although somewhat daunting read with more than one hundred poems to experience. As with any collection, there are hits and misses within this volume. Some of the chapters could have been scaled down and others seemed awkwardly out of place like the chapter dedicated to the weather. Perhaps with a bit more editing and more discerning selections of poems this could have been a great book of prose instead of just a good one. (3.5 Rating)Reviewed by L.

I thumbed through it and decided to check it out solely for the photos, the majority of which are really dated and super kitschy. The book is copyrighted 1986, though I suspect many of these photos are older than that. Sadly, that's about all I can recommend about this book. The information here is largely outdated and not particularly useful. It is also not well written and contains typos. Folks who do poodle rescue will cringe at the author's enthusiasm for breeding. From the chapter on breeding: \\"To the real dog-lover, there is no happier sight than that of a healthy and contented mother with an attractive litter of Poodle puppies. Your joy is even greater when you know these are the offspring of your own beloved pet. Your participation in the daily life and growth of a happy litter of Poodle puppies will be sure to fascinate you.\\" Considering this book is aimed at \\"beginners\\" it hardly seems appropriate to encourage inexperienced owners to breed. In fact, many of the poodle's health problems today are a result of over breeding by people who don't know what they are doing. If you are just thinking about getting a poodle as a family pet, do as much research as you can to make sure this kind of dog is right for you. Then spay or neuter your pet. Leave breeding to professionals. There are already so many homeless animals in need of homes, including poodles. Don't rule out poodle rescue, either. Older dogs can bring just as much joy and dedicated companionship as puppies. In fact, they're often less work."},{"Title":"Online Kids: A Young Surfer's Guide to Cyberspace","review":"I'm a parent and a grandmother, and this book helped me show my 7 year old granddaughter some really fun and interesting sites on the World Wide Web. The other thing it did was to explain a few things I didn't know, like the difference between the Internet and online services, and some basic information for the totally clueless on how to get started on setting up a computer at home. We found the site where you can look at the earth in crescent from a satellite, zoom in on any place in the world (that's not in the dark) and be amazed. She loved looking in Antarctica, and at the Nile...and then finding games to play, and the fact that she could type in the letters herself and get around. Non readers need help on what each site means, but this book is one more tool to let a child see the VALUE of reading (what site do I want?), find places to learn, and get proficient with typing and using the Internet.It's okay to not know! Just give this book to someone who WANTS to know how to break into Cyberspace, and watch them soar, like my granddaughter has! PS If you don't want to invest in a computer until you know what it's all about, go to a public library and look up some of these sites for yourself with or without your child, and see for yourself what it's all about.

He shows deep understanding of people - without any pretension or intent to impress the reader.I found his work in the area of psychiatry especially fascinating.

The cover alone was enough to sell me, and the glowing reviews didn't hurt either. And the author is, in fact, a quite talented writer and storyteller, and obviously a person of great sensitivity and depth. HOWEVER, this book is simply NOT, \\"The Story of San Michele\\". I'm 148 pages in and so far, we've spent only a very tiny portion of those in Italy, (and even then primarily dealing with a horrifying cholera epidemic in Naples, described in all its gory and mortifying detail). Put simply, this book, page for page, is about disease and death. There's one, (count it), very early chapter devoted to the author's discovery of the little paradise he calls San Michele in what I believe is Anacapri. And that's it so far. Then we're off to Paris where he practices medicine primarily for the wealthy, (though we're also treated there to a particularly grisly account of his treatment of some Russian hunters who contract hydrophobia-- or rabies-- from wolves, and how, after watching them descend into madness, Munthe is basically forced to euthanize them). Then we finally head to Naples, (for cholera), and Lapland and Sweden and back to Paris, sharing tragic and often gruesome stories all the way. Again, interesting stuff-- esp. for those who are fans of the morbid and medical-- but hardly some sun-drenched vicarious escape to the glories and pleasures of an idyll in southern Italy. While I find his writing compelling, (sort of in the way a car crash is compelling, but far more witty and poetic), I feel a bit like a bait and switch victim, and simply can't recommend this book to those seeking what it purports to offer."},{"Title":"The Story of San Michele","review":"I read this wonderful book as a young man back in the sixties and I have just ordered a new version to recapture its wonderful momentsBut I also saw the film version many years ago.No I would be wery exited if anyone could lead me to a DVD or VHS version of the film"},{"Title":"The Story of San Michele","review":"An insightful and compassionate view of the human condition.

Somehow it opened up a whole world for me. I was not an unread child, and the Victorian age and places that Munthe describes were not unknown to me. Yet the world he created was so awesome and magical and unique in my experience that it became one of the books I've kept closest at hand for the last 25 years, and re-read every few years. I still get wrapped up in it immediately, and, as with other great books, experience it on different levels and in different ways each time I read it. I'm not as enamored of certain aspects of his writing style as I used to be, but the book is still brilliant, and it's a window into the Victorian era unlike any other I've seen.The book is a series of detailed, lengthy vignettes about Munthe's experiences as a fashionable doctor in Europe in the late 19th century. He claimed that he was not much of a doctor, yet he had a so-called gift of healing -- i.e., inspiring such trust and confidence in patients that they could make themselves better -- for which he received what he felt was undeserved credit. He seemed to find animals more lovable than people, yet he routinely spent his money and risked his life to help impoverished and sickened people in slums. He recognized that the practice of medicine in his era was more a sham than a science, but it was his ticket to earning the money he needed to purchase the beautiful island retreat of San Michele. His descriptions of funny or poignant characters and incidents, of the experiments of Charcot, of the 1884 cholera epidemic in Naples, of the practice of medicine and of \\"fashionable\\" illnesses, of the sunny beauty of Capri, and of his encounters with goblins (the \\"little people\\" of Sweden), make this an unforgettable book."},{"Title":"The Story of San Michele","review":"There are books one puts down after a few pages.

Outside all genres, all categories.I just want to share with you some of the quotes that do not give away much of the story, but are characteristic of the general ambiance of the book:\\"I do not write down here these words with conceit, I write them with wonder. Where did these words come from? Surely they came from far, they came as an echo from a long-forgotten golden age when Pan was still alive, when the trees in the forest could speak and the waves of the sea could sing and man could listen and understand\\"\\"\\"I have come back a different man. I seem to be looking out on the world with my one remaining eye from another angle of vision than I did before. I can no more see what is ugly and sordid, I can only see what is beautiful and sweet and clean. Even the men and women around me seem different from what they used to be. By a curious optical illusion I can see them no more as they are but as they were meant to be, as they would have liked to be if they had had a chance. I can still see with my blind eye a lot of fools strutting about, but they do not seem to get on my nerves as they used to do, I do not mind their chatter, let them have their say.\\"\\"\`But I am not a child, I shall be twenty-seven next month.' \`Of course you are a big child or you could not have seen me, only children can see us goblins.'\\"\\"You are always trying to explain to your patients what you cannot even explain to yourself. You forget that it is all a question of faith not of knowledge, like the faith in God. [...] But I knew something they evidently did not know: that there is no drug as powerful as hope, that the slightest sign of pessimism in the face or words of a doctor can cost his patient his life.\\"\\"Do put some of your savings in the Little Sisters' moneybox, even a penny will do, believe me you never made a safer investment. Remember what I have written on another page of this book - what you keep to yourself you lose, what you give away you keep for ever. Besides you have no right to keep this money to yourself, it does not belong to you, money belongs to nobody up here. All money belongs to the Devil who sits at his counter night and day behind his sacks of gold trading with human souls. Do not hold on too long to the dirty coin he puts in your hand, get rid of it as soon as you can or the cursed metal will soon burn your fingers, penetrate your blood, blind your eyes, infect your thoughts and harden your heart. Put it into the moneybox of the Little Sisters, or throw the damned stuff into the nearest gutter\\"\\"He had risen from his couch roused in his sleep by a haunting dream. His face was dark as the sky overhead, fear shone in his eye. He summoned his astronomers and his wise men from the East and bid them to tell him the meaning of his dream, but before they could read the golden writing on the sky, one by one the stars flickered and went out. Whom had he to fear, he the ruler of the world! What mattered the life of one single man to him, the arbiter of the lives of millions of men! Who could bring him to account for the putting to death that night of an innocent man by one of his procurators in the name of the Emperor of Rome? And his procurator whose execrated name is still on our lips, was he more responsible than his Imperial Master for signing the death-warrant of an innocent man? To him, the stern upholder of Roman law and tradition in an unruly province, was it even an innocent man he was putting to death? And the cursed Jew who still wanders round the world in search of forgiveness, did he know what he was doing? Or he, the greatest evildoer of all time, when he betrayed his Master with his kiss of love? Could he have done otherwise? Did he do it of his own free will? It had to be done, he had to do it, obeying a will stronger than his. Was there not in that night on Golgotha more than one man who was made to suffer for a sin which was not his? I bent over the sleeping child for a while and went away on tip-toe.\\""},{"Title":"The Story of San Michele","review":"This man lived a charmed life.

Marvelous read, with a moral for those of us so caught up with &quot;making it&quot;."},{"Title":"The Story of San Michele","review":"I was 16 years old and very fond of English. The best teacher I ever had saw my enthusiasm and gave me this book. I was enthralled and found writing here more powerful and clever than I had encountered. It \\"switched me on\\"...The beginning is whimsical, setting the style of things to come. An old man is writing memoirs of his early life and an arrogant youth appears in the room, cocky and self-important. You find that it is the old man, seeing himself through the tunnel of years.He speaks of life in the early years of the 20th centuray on Capri, one of the most beautiful places on earth. He brings to life in joyful colour the ways of its simple people: religious, superstitious, given to loud music and carnival. Then, by counterpoint, he describes the people of letters who visited him over the years, the musical evenings by world-famous singers and musicians, the poetry.He describes how he renovated ruins - formerly a mansion of the Roman Emperor, Tiberius - into the delightful villa he called San Michele. Here he entertained the intelligentia of the time and crowned heads of state. (He was almost certainly the lover of the Queen of Sweden).Throughout the book he departs artfully into totally unexpected, uncharted, waters of an earlier life. - A sleigh-ride through the night with an eskimo girl; treating the dying in cholera-infected Naples: kissing a nursing assistant there, a nun, carries a poignant message.But there is another dimension to the book. It must not be read as factual: it is written lyrically and embellished not only to add pleasure but also insight - much as a raconteur such as Peter Ustinov might do. It gives a view of San Michele and Capri that is larger-than-life, yet in doing so, adds a vibrancy that better reflects the spirit of the place. There is much humour - an example: Munthe is a great lover of animals, especially birds; he upraids an Irish Wolfhound for hunting and killing ducks. The dog speaks sorrowfully to him explaining that, \\"I knows it's wrong - but they taste so...\\"Munthe achieved eminence early in his life as a doctor - the youngest MD France ever created - and he had many ideas on medical science that put him years ahead of his time: notably dietery. In addition his reputation as an intellectual brought him international respect and towards the end of his days, he lived permamntly within the Royal Palace in Sweden.He cast a long shadow and this book shows a great mind - a \\"Florentine\\" - the sort of person with wide scientific, artistic, literary, musical and philosphical interests that we don't have today.Last year, 50 years after being given the book, whilst on holiday in the Bay of Naples, I went on a pilgimmage to see San Michele. It is owned and maintained by the Swedish State and musical concerts are held there as in Munthe's time. The house is beautifully furnished with a lovely collection of art, exactly as Munthe left it. And the gardens he enthuses about are there in all their glory. And the view? - He thought it the best in the world, as did Tiberius. Maybe they were right - and maybe this is the best book too."},{"Title":"The Story of San Michele","review":"Eighty or ninety years ago, Axel Munthe was a famous doctor.He left behind a few modest and charming reminiscences, of which &quot;The story of the San Michele&quot; is, in my opinion, the most interesting.The writer deliberately leaves outsides large zones of his existence; he only highlights those pertaining to his work.The unity of this book in which memories mingle according to his fancy, is achieved through the presence of two underlying motifs: his love for the nature of the south and the battle against death.A cholera epedemic in Naples, an earthquake in Messina, anywhere a doctor is needed, Munthe is present.Even in his passion for archeology, gathering ancient statues and coins, building in Capri a new home from the fragments of an illustrious past - with the architecture inspired by dreams rather than mathematics - his spirit finds a new way of celebrating the beauty of life.The book is filled with vivid and unforgettable portraits (don Antonio the priest; Maria Porta-Lettere the messenger; Rozalia, the caretaker; Mamsell Agata, the housekeeper with the putrid smile of Lazarus; Norstrom, his friend; Madame Requin, the delinquent midwife; Arcangelo Fusco, the sweeper; the Countess and the Viscount Maurice; John, the child who never laughed - and a lot many others.But the most interesting character is the doctor himself - because of the special quality of his humanity."},{"Title":"The Story of San Michele","review":"I came to this strange and wonderful book without the slightest inkling of what it was about -- simply because it was in the recommended reading for many guidebooks about Italy. First and foremost, it is an autobiography of a great physician and animal lover who just happened to spend some years of his life on Capri.Autobiographies can make for strange reading, especially when there are obvious omissions. Although Axel Munthe frequently accuses himself of being a ladies' man, there is no mention of any love interest by name or even generic description. (That reminds me of film director Josef von Sternberg's FUN IN A CHINESE LAUNDRY, where we learn in passing that the author was married because of a cryptic mention in a subordinate clause 300 pages into the book.) Also missing is any mention of Munthe's childhood, although I understand there is at least one other autobiography written by him (MEMORIES AND VAGARIES), which I have not read.There is, however, one section that does not appear in any autobiography that I have ever seen: An anticipation of Munthe's Last Judgment in Heaven following his death, with St. Peter, Moses, Athanasius, and St. Francis joining in the discussion.STORY OF SAN MICHELE ranges from Paris to Lapland, Rome, Naples, Calabria, and Capri. We see duels, medical cases of wealthy women with imaginary diseases, demonic housekeepers, quacks, midwives, prostitutes, victims of cholera and earthquakes, brigands, shamans, and even an alcoholic ape. Munthe is a magnificent raconteur, and his book is a joy to read and reread."},{"Title":"The Story of San Michele","review":"How gratifying to read the other reviews, and to learn that others have also experienced and loved this book at different times in their lives. The remarkable thing about it is how Dr. Munthe speaks to us in different ways at different ages. As a teenager, I was impressed by the passions, even though a lot of the details were above my head. In my late twenties, the way he tried to balance career and his love for San Michele was very meaningful. As a 44-year-old, I was impressed (and saddened) with the loneliness of Dr. Munthe's struggle, with really only his animals for company. While he speaks of friends, he shares little about them. And nothing about a lasting romantic involvement.We all have our San Micheles. They may not be homes, but they are ideals toward which we strive. But for me, it exists only in my mind. Dr. Munthe was in some ways very lucky, yet also cursed, to be able to bring it to life.The only frustrating aspect of \\"San Michele\\" is that it is, as its author notes, a fragment. I am interested to learn more of this fascinating man. Does anyone know if any biographies are in print, or in English? Thank you."},{"Title":"The Story of San Michele","review":"One of my favorite books, I re-read it almost once a year. It is not for everyone, it is for those who love to dream, who can be whisked away to a fantasy world by a skilled storyteller . . . for those who can be enchanted by goblins who give good advice, raven's blood in a child's milk, owls who prevent adultery, and housemaids who resemble vampires. It is for those who love animals and have their doubts about humans.Munthe apologizes in one of his prefaces for his egotism, and certainly I can see why he would be embarrassed: he has put his dreams into print, and rarely does he himself come off badly. But only a sourpuss would object to his distortions, for his imagination has formed a work of tremendous beauty.Munthe himself was a fascinating man, youngest doctor in the history of France, society doctor to European royalty, creator of one of the world's most beautiful houses, one of the 5 men who opened King Tut's tomb.I love his stories about Guy de Maupassant and the opera singer who died for love of him; I love his dogs who can anticipate death; I love his dream of the dispute between the saints over his salvation (&quot;He was a doctor&quot; -- &quot;Heaven is full of his patients, and hell too&quot; -- &quot;He loved children&quot; -- &quot;He loved their mothers too&quot;), and the appearance of St Francis to save him can still make me cry.But enough!

Needing to read something in English the Italian shopkeepers wisely had a few copies in stock. I took it as a sign that the book must be bought and read. I cannot recount how many times I had tears well up in my eyes with this simple yet profound story. I fell in love with Axel Munthe and all his colourful characters both human and animal alike. Read this book and keep it close to your heart!"},{"Title":"The Story of San Michele","review":"After many years I hauled out an old copy (with photo's) of Axel Munthe's classic &quot;The Story of San Michele&quot;. What a wonderful read and if you consider what this man went through, and went on to achieve its a more remarkable story than any fiction book I have ever read.His compassion for animals as well as those humans he encountered in the tragedies of war, disease and natural disasters must have been immense.His clarity of vision to be able to see into the human soul should be an inspiration to us all.2 years ago I travelled to Positano in Italy and went by bus to Sorrento to make my long awaited visit to the Isle of Capri and to see the house and the artefacts within.The weather was too rough for a crossing and my one chance of seeing Munthe's home was dashed as I had to head back to Australia the next day.I can easily read this book in parts just for inspiration. It is a true classic of mans endeavours and what a true human being can achieve.Munthe went blind in his latter years but it did little to deter him and his work."},{"Title":"The Story of San Michele","review":"It is hard to believe that a book written in 1929 would not seem dated (other than horse and buggies) but the ethics, morals, human emotions and feelings, social responsibility, etc. still hold true tody in 2001. This book, written by a great story-teller, made me laugh and cry. I know I have truly enjoyed a book when its characters stay with me. Dr. Munthe is such a charachter. Compassion, wisdom, common sense and one of the best endings I have ever read.A story of a doctor, an animal-lover, in the late nineteenth and early 20th century. He lives through a cholera epidemic in Naples, WWI, he battles for animal rights, deals with life and death, spends time in jail, collects precious antiques and of course appreciates good food and champagne.You will not be disappointed. You might even learn something."},{"Title":"The Story of San Michele","review":"How can one write a review of The Story of San Michele that comes close to doing justice to the book? There are many humorous episodes, such as The Giant and Mamsell Agata, touches of the macabre in the description of the cholera epidemic in Naples, misadventures, like the journey to Sweden accompanying a young man (then his corpse). There are also angry moments, as when his dog Tom is brutally kicked by the slimy Vicomte Maurice. Who could not be moved by the story of the boy John, who was rescued by Munthe but never lived long enough to find a loving home. It is a book that includes many memorable events in a life that was very full indeed. Many of the chapters in this book could be made into marvelous films, given the right adaptation.The Story of San Michele is very well written, to say the least, and the many people, events and personal feelings of the author combine to make this a special adventure. Perhaps most special of all is Axel Munthe's relationship to animals that allowed him to get close, even to \\"wild\\" animals and have a special relationship with them. He was a man who held nature and all life in special regard but was pragmatic in the face of illness and death.I have had a copy since 1988 and I have given Axel Munthe's book as a gift and been thanked for the introduction. I could not recommend this book highly enough."},{"Title":"The Story of San Michele","review":"My father had mentioned this book to me as a teenager. I read portions of it then, but have always wanted to read it in full. Finally, I found a paperback edition and found an absorbing and thought stimulating book. Dr. Munthe's care of the sick, his love of animals and the characters he describes, all will stay in my memory. This is not a book that you read once. I plan to read it again and again. Hopefully I will be able to visit Villa St. Michele some day and see the beauty of the place that he saw. I hope to find a bound edition with the photographs."},{"Title":"The Story of San Michele","review":"I was introduced to this charming book by my mother over 30 years ago, and have in turn introduced it to my wife and daughter.

As a child, I (like many, I suspect) dreaded the dry, bare-bones, sketches of American history. Boy, do I wish I had had this book years ago! It brings vibrant life to the wonders of our country's past. This particular volume blooms with exciting stories such as those little-known facts of real life sports heros of the day - including an introduction to Babe Didrickson, a female dynamo that history has virtually ignored ... until now! Art, music, presidents, controversy, WWII, they're all here in juicy detail!"},{"Title":"The Fugitive Poets: Modern Southern Poetry (Southern Classics Series)","review":"The Fugitive was a magazine published between 1922 and 1928 in Nashville, Tennessee. The collaborators centered in and around Vanderbilt University and included such luminaries as John Crowe Ransom, Robert Penn Warren, Allen Tate, and Laura Riding. The magazine served as a refiner's crucible for these and other intellectuals who would later influence the Southern Agrarian movement. The themes of the Southern Agrarians appear in poetic form in many of the works included in this fine collection. A reluctance to concede to the spiritual demands of modernity, a distrust of the machine-age, and a wistful remembrance of an almost forgotten Southern sensibility strike the reader with the force of a blow. These poets, while attempting at times to render a specific regional voice, more often than not delve deeper into the &quot;mannishness of man.&quot; Their poems are realistic, conscious of the fallenness of the South and those who live in it. Particularly powerful are the poems of Ransom. &quot;The Equilibrists&quot; is perhaps the finest poem written in America about the regrets of lust, sin, and stoically held honor. Ransom's poems about death, and there are many of them included here, evoke the sense of family, loss, and the cycles of the living as surely as do his portraits of decrepit mansions and overgrown gardens. These poets also self-consciously upbraid themselves and each other for the arrogance of youthful intellectual and artistic promise and the vanity of a life whose hopes are pinned on words. The Fugitives were reactionary in their use of the classical tradition. The reader may have to refresh a working knowledge of Ovid and Virgil in order to fully enjoy what is a remarkable collection of poetry."},{"Title":"The Fugitive Poets: Modern Southern Poetry (Southern Classics Series)","review":"William Pratt does a remarkable job in collecting the leading poems from the Fugitive Poets, the collection of intellectuals and writers who were based around Vanderbilt University in the 1920s. The leading poems of Allen Tate, Robert Penn Warren, Donald Davidson, John Crowe Ransom and others are here. Some of the poems can be found in other collections of course but Pratt's book offers a comprehensive look at these poets who greatly shaped American and Southern literature in the 20th century. Pratt offers a very solid introduction in which he reminds readers to think of the poets as different than the Agrarian circle that published \\"I'll Take My Stand\\" a few years after the Fugitive magazine went under. This is one of the finest anthologies of 20th century American poetry that I have come across. This review covers the third edition of \\"The Fugitive Poets\\" which was released in 1991."},{"Title":"The Killer Genesis (Mercenary Ser. 1)","review":"I read these in the 80's don't know how well they hold up today as the technology and equipment has changed quite a bit so a younger crowd may miss some of the relevance. Fairly long running series and very enjoyable at the time. May re-read one to see if they are as good today as they were then."},{"Title":"The encyclopedia of witchcraft and demonology","review":"Rossell Hope Robbins massive 1959 work \\"Encyclopedia of Witchcraft and Demonology\\" has been reprinted many times but is currently out-of-print. It is indeed a fascinatingly horrible compenidum of information regarding witches, demons, devils, demonologists, inquisitors, judges, hysterias, torture, and murder. It has served for the past 40 odd years as one of the most read and referenced work on the history of witchcraft and demonology, especially by many popular witchcraft authors and historians who continue to use and cite the work today.The trouble is that much of the scholarship contatined in this work is sadly outdated and lacks information on much of the recent work done in the field of witchcraft studies in the past 20 years. Also, Robbins' work suffers from the same problem that afflicted many other similar early witchcraft histories: bad translations and historical forgeries. It has been shown that many of the early translations of a number of Latin works on witchcraft (particularly those translated by the Rev. Montague Summers) are suspect. Also, several 19th century histories of the witchcraze and the Inquisition that have been used as source material by countless authors, including Robbins, have been proven to be forgeries, particularly the works relating the early 14th century Inquisitorial witch executions in France. Robbins' work has also been criticized by scholars for its lack of objectivity in its history. But this work still remains popular today and understandably so, as it contains many lurid and engaging articles on just about every aspect of the witch hunts from the 15th to the 18th century in Europe and North America. Despite many of its flaws, it is still a useful reference and for that reason it still gets 3 stars, plus I must admit, it maintains some of the mysterious aura surrounding the history of witches and demons that much recent scholarship has tried to dispel, and that makes it fascinating reading, if for the wrong reasons."},{"Title":"The encyclopedia of witchcraft and demonology","review":"This book is perhaps the most important reference work in its field. If you have interest in the occult, witchcraft or details not much mentioned in standard history books, I urge you to buy this one. Although its author relies a bit too heavily on documents of the time, the information given in this book is valuable. Also, there is a passage about witchcraft in specific countries, so you might also find out something about your home country that no one bothered to tell you. Read this book, and I can almost guarantee that you'll see the last four centuries in quite a new light."},{"Title":"The encyclopedia of witchcraft and demonology","review":"A long time ago I (by accident) saw this book carried by Terry Gilliam in the 'Spanish Inquisition' sketch by Monty Python. You can spot it under his arm as he gets up from his seat in the bus at the end. Realizing that this has very little do to with the actual review of this book, it nonetheless will tell you that I recognized the cover of the book when walking around in an old bookstore in Boston, grabbed it, and within 2 minutes of reading and skimming I decided that it was worth the $18.00 it cost. It was probably one of the best bargains I ever found, and opened my eyes tremendously.As the title implies we're talking about an encyclopedia, not a detailed and chronological book, but this did not hamper the book's ability to get inside my head, and touch it in a way that redefined the medieval picture I carried around with me. After spending a few hours going through the book, and picking out specific passages, I realized that I knew nothing about how people were treated not THAT long ago, when someone else accused them of witchcraft, and how hard (impossible) it was to prove ones innocence. A story in the encyclopedia tells of how a woman, owning a black cat was hanged, accused of witchcraft, for 'making' her neighbour's tea taste bad.If you wish to have just some idea of how impossible it was to prove your innocence, once you were thought a witch, Luc Besson's 'Messenger: Joan of Arc', and the Blackadder episode 'Witchsmeller Pursouivant' will give you an idea of the hopelessness some of the accused must've felt.The most horrible aspect of the book is the descriptions of how people were tortured back in those days. The only thing we can do is learn from books such as these to insure that such stupidity and ignorance won't be allowed to occur again. The book also has information on specific European and other countries, so you can locate your own country to see just how bad things were in Europe several hundred years ago. That these things are still happening in many other parts of the world, is something we should do something more about, since many of the uneducated countries still practice torture and inhuman deaths. Not that any death, ordered by other sentient beings, is human, in my opinion.The people who refuse to open books such as these, because they, among many other things, tell of the instruction manuals inquisitors could consult when dealing with witches (the Malleus Maleficarum is one), must ask themselves if they are doing so, because they find such information irrelevant and frightening. Of course it's frightening, but hardly irrelevant. It's when you turn your back on these things, that they have a chance of happening. So educate yourself about how not to behave, when someone sitting close to you is stroking a bad cat and your tea suddenly tastes bad.I'm not saying that we have to be paranoid at all, but a good portion of common sense, spiced with decency and awareness, will no doubt yield a mix that will prevent such terrible events from happening again.And if you can't find this book at amazon.com, try older bookstores. Where I found mine in Boston, another copy was also present!"},{"Title":"The encyclopedia of witchcraft and demonology","review":"I first stumbled onto this book when I needed reference material for a paper on witchcraft. I've gone back to re-reference this book too many times to count! It has information on almost every aspect of witchcraft and demonology; terrific for the beginner interested in this subject.

Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The encyclopedia of witchcraft and demonology","review":"I actually found this book at a garage sale when I was in high school in the early 80's.

Lots of aspects explained."},{"Title":"Plato, the man and his work","review":"In order to read Plato with some facility it is almost imperative to read a commentary a long with the Dialogues. A.E. Taylor is a true guide to what Plato actually says and provides useful classical context that will keep out the most egregious error. This is an essential volume in any philosopher's library.One of the greatest thinkers of the ancient world, Plato instigated groundbreaking inquiries into morality, ethics, and the quest for happiness that continue to inform and influence philosophical discussion today. In this outstanding work of scholarship, a renowned expert on Plato presents a scrupulously accurate historical view of the great philosopher's life and works. Distinguished by its dispassionate scholarly analysis, Professor Taylor's discourse is refreshingly free of the biases that have frequently tainted other studies.A brief introductory chapter acquaints readers with the known events of Plato's life. The author then proceeds to an illuminating examination of the philosopher's voluminous writings, including the minor Socratic dialogues, as well as such major works as Phaedo, Symposium, Protagoras, Republic, Phaedrus, Timaeus, Laws, and other influential dialogues. The final chapter, \\"Plato in the Academy,\\" attempts to pin down?with the help of some of Plato's former students, such as Aristotle the philosopher's beliefs about numbers. In a substantial appendix, \\"The Platonic Apocrypha,\\" Professor Taylor examines writings that have sometimes been attributed to Plato, including several letters, and offers cogent reasons for accepting or rejecting them as Plato's work.Praised by Dean William R. Inge of Theology as \\"a great book, an honour to . . . British scholarship,\\" this volume is an invaluable guide for students, teachers, and other readers interested in philosophy."},{"Title":"Plato, the man and his work","review":"This review departs to some degree from the traditional amazon review. For those who are simply trying to decide whether to purchase this book or not I suggest ignoring my review and looking to the other reviews. I will list some of the pros and cons of this book as I see them but my review is aimed more towards those with a serious interest in Plato as opposed to those who are simply looking for a basic introduction to some of Plato's ideas.I think Taylor's book is worth reading whatever camp you fall in (despite some flaws). If you are new to Plato and are just looking for an introduction this book is probably as good as any and if you are a serious Plato enthusiast Taylor is still worth reading despite being a bit dated.I should also point out that I am not a Plato scholar so my review should be read as what it is: a review by a graduate student in philosophy with an interest in Plato but no real credentials.The first pro of this book is that it is one of the only books that deals with every single Platonic dialogue (I know Catherine Zuckert's bookPlato's Philosophers: The Coherence of the Dialoguesdoes as well but I have not read it yet). It is, therefore, good for anyone who is looking for analyses of some of the dialogues that are not treated as often in the secondary literature. This also allows A.E. Taylor to provide a unified portrait of the Platonic philosophy and to highlight themes which appear in all, or most, of the dialogues.One con of Taylor's method, in my opinion, is that he attempts to follow a chronological reading of Plato based on stylometric dating. Personally I think that the attempts to date Plato's writings stylometrically are seriously flawed (there is some evidence that Plato continually reworked his dialogues throughout his life which would make any stylistic chronology impossible).Unfortunately there is probably no other doctrine neutral way to date the Platonic dialogues (and any chronology based on doctrinal changes would wind up being circular). For the reader who is interested in this problem I suggest taking a look at the article \\"Re-reading Plato: the Problem of Platonic Chronology\\" by Jacob Howland. Not only does Howland argue that all attempts to provide a chronology of the Platonic corpus are seriously flawed but he also argues that this is not in anyway a hindrance since the interpretative method of reading the dialogues in conjunction with each other, so that they are each able to shed light on each other, tends to produce deeper and more interesting interpretations than the interpretations which attempt to determine the \\"development\\" of Plato's ideas based on a chronological reading. It might be helpful to give an example of what I mean. One of Plato's most famous doctrines is that knowledge is recollection. In the Phaedo Cebes describes this doctrine in this way, \\"According to this, [the doctrine that learning is recollection] we must at some previous time have learned what we now recollect. This is possible only if our soul existed somewhere before it took on this human shape. So according to this theory too, the soul is likely to be something immortal\\" (72e). Cebes takes the theory about learning being recollection to be a proof of the immortality of the soul. I have been told by those who read Greek that in this passage and the lines following Plato is contrasting and playing with the distinction between recollection (anamnesis) and memory (mneme) and that Cebes misunderstands recollection in terms of memory (something we have known at a previous time in a temporal sense rather than the a priori in the more modern sense). We can see this misunderstanding if we compare what Plato says about recollection in other dialogues. In the Phaedrus Socrates says, \\"a human being must understand speech in terms of general forms, proceeding to bring many perceptions together into a reasoned unity. That process is the recollection of the things our soul saw when it was traveling with god\\" (249c). Here we see that recollection is not the memory of things we saw in the past but rather the gathering of many perceptions under one common form. Plato, of course, still speaks of this mythically as 'when we were traveling with god' but it would be a mistake to take Plato's myths literally (it would take me too far afield to explain why I believe that). The point of all of this is that in order to pinpoint the mistake Cebes makes in regard to recollection as an error we have to read the dialogues together. We could say that the Phaedo is an earlier dialogue and that Plato changed his mind. But we have very little, if any, evidence for doing so (why could the Phaedo not be later than the Phaedrus in which case everything would be reversed) and we would have a much more impoverished understanding of a fundamental Platonic doctrine (the notion that learning is recollection); whereas if we read the dialogues together they are able to shed light on each other and give us a much fuller understanding of Platonic philosophy.There is also some evidence that Plato himself composed the dialogues in terms of tetralogies and there is clearly a dramatic narrative tying many of the dialogues together. It seems more logical to me to read the dialogues in terms of the succession Plato himself devised rather than relying on a dubious chronology (I believe Zuckert follows this method in her book and Joseph Cropsey follows the same method in his bookPlato's World: Man's Place in the Cosmos).A.E. Taylor wrote this book at a time when it was still widely believed that we could make some fairly solid pronouncements about the chronology of the Platonic dialogues and this becomes a central part of Taylor's interpretations since he believes, \\"To understand a great thinker is, of course, impossible unless we know something of the relative order of his works\\" (pg16). While this is, I believe, a flaw of Taylor's method it is not a terribly serious one and I believe most of what he says about Plato does not depend for its validity on the validity of his chronology. This should not be a reason to entirely avoid Taylor, therefore, but should be kept in mind while reading.Another con of Taylor's book, which is also a pro to some degree, is his tendency to read Plato anachronistically. There are two main ways in which he does this. The first is that he tends to read Plato in terms of Christianity, as for example, when he writes, \\"the ideal of Socrates and the Christian ideal are fundamentally identical\\" (pg192) or \\"The conception set before us in these pages is manifestly the Hellenic counterpart of the 'mystical way' of Christianity\\" (pg181). The good part about all this is that Taylor definitely recognizes a religious dimension to Plato's thought which is not always recognized by analytic interpretations of his philosophy but which is essential to a genuine understanding of Plato. When Plato claims that the objects of thought are the truly real in contrast to the objects of sense perception he is not simply devising a theory about predication, or the status of universals, and when he argues for the superiority of thought over sense-perception he is not simply making an epistemological argument about the sources of our knowledge. These doctrines are tied to what we might call a doctrine of salvation, or a doctrine about the ultimate human good. This becomes clear in the Phaedo where Plato argues, \\"the soul of every man, when it feels violent pleasure or pain in connection with some object, inevitably believes at the same time that what causes such feelings must be very clear and very true, which it is not...every pleasure and every pain provides, as it were, another nail to rivet the soul to the body and to weld them together\\" (83c-e). Taylor recognizes this religious dimension in Plato which puts him above many analytic commentators on Plato (an analytic philosopher might abstract the arguments about the immortality of the soul from the Phaedo and attempt to determine their validity without recognizing the Phaedo as a dialogue about how the philosopher should live in order to achieve the ultimate human good). But ultimately I think Plato's ideas have more in common with his own religious context (Orphism, Pythagoreanism, and even, perhaps Indian religions) than they do with Christianity. Taylor's reading of Christian ideas back into Plato leads to at least some distortion (this statement has to be qualified to some degree since Christian writers incorporated a great many of Plato's insights into Christianity which is almost certainly the reason for the similarities that do exist between them but the problem arises when the similarities are reflected backwards rather than forwards, i.e. when Christianity is read back into Plato rather than Plato being read forward into Christianity).The other way in which Taylor reads Plato anachronistically is the way he tends to see modern debates reflected in the debates taking place within Plato's dialogues (like the debate over the epiphenomenality of consciousness). In some ways it is good that Taylor reads current debates (at least current at the time Taylor was writing) back into Plato. It allows us to see the almost miraculous way Plato was able to anticipate nearly every important philosophical question in the entire history of Western philosophy.And there is certainly nothing wrong with reading Plato in the light of our current concerns. I think one of the reasons Plato speaks to us today is because he was, in a way, living in a time analogous to our own. We often tend to think of Plato as living at the beginning of Greek civilization because our historical record becomes scanty as we move backwards from Plato (particularly in the dark ages after the Mycenaean collapse but before the classical age). But in reality Plato was closer to the end of Greek civilization. The Greek religions were losing their hold on young minds who were filled with new scientific ideas (one sees this in a number of the dialogues: one sees it in the Pythagoreans Simmias and Cebes in the Phaedo who are already ignorant of the religious aspects of the Pythagorean school to which they belong, one sees it in the new scientific explanations that are being offered for the old myths as in the story of Boreas in the Phaedrus, one sees it in the demands made for rational defenses of the superiority of justice in the Republic since the religious injunctions are losing some of their force.). We too live in an age where a religion which has existed for two thousand years is beginning to lose its hold to some degree in the face of new scientific ideas. Plato was such a giant, I think, because he held onto both ends of the chain at once. He did not entirely abandon the religious teachings of the past but he rescued them from their mythical form and presented them in a form that was acceptable to the more scientifically minded (perhaps we are waiting for something similar). For an example of what I mean we can again turn to the Phaedo where Plato has Socrates say, \\"It is likely that those who established the mystic rites for us were not inferior persons but were speaking in riddles long ago...There are indeed, as those concerned with the mysteries say, many who carry the thyrsus but the Bacchants are few. These latter are, in my opinion, no other than those who have practiced philosophy in the right way\\" (69c-d). Plato does not reject the old mystery religions outright - he merely rejects their literal interpretation (if the reader is interested in my personal opinion I think the modern atheists make the same mistake when rejecting Christianity that Plato seems to be arguing against in this passage- that is, they view Christianity as if it was just uttering nonsense rather than speaking in riddles which have to be deciphered - they think that when they have rejected the literal truth of the stories of the Bible, for example, that they have thereby refuted Christianity). I think that Taylor sees all of this fairly clearly as well and he is to be applauded for that.But Taylor's method of reading Plato in terms of the subsequent history of philosophy, or of translating Plato's arguments and ideas into the terms of more modern philosophers is no longer the preferred method of reading Plato (for example, when he says that \\"for Socrates and Plato, no less than for Kant, immortality is a postulate of the 'practical' use of 'reason' (pg207), or, when he uses the intrinsic/extrinsic distinction in scholastic philosophy to explain arguments from the Phaedo (pg204)). These interpretations are not necessarily incorrect and certainly help the reader familiar with Kant and scholastic terminology to understand Plato's point but we can no longer assume that something as simple as the translation of Plato into Latin was in anyway 'innocent' or left the substance of Plato's theories intact. We can no longer simply read backward and assume that the tradition as it has been handed down to us, and which has been derived in large part from Plato, accurately represents Plato's own thought. I think Heidegger is largely responsible for awakening us in this regard because despite Heidegger's many flaws (both personal and philosophical) he really made an attempt to go back and read the Greeks on their own terms (before all the Greek terms had been translated into their Latin versions, and before the problems Plato was dealing with had been solidified in the tradition). Heidegger really is responsible for a revolution in the way we read Plato, at least in the Continental tradition, and Taylor's book seems a bit dated in comparison in my opinion. For the reader who is interested in some readings of Plato that I think are superior to Taylor's in this respect I would recommendPlato's Sophist (Studies in Continental Thought)by Martin Heidegger,Being and Logos: Reading the Platonic Dialoguesby John Sallis,Self-Knowledge in Plato's Phaedrusby Charles Griswold jr.,Plato's Parmenides: The Conversion of the Soulby Mitchell Miller jr.,Paideia: The Ideals of Greek Culture Volume I: Archaic Greece: The Mind of Athensby Werner Jaeger (the second volume is the volume on Plato but it will not let me link to it directly; just click on the little plus sign by the paperback version and it will expand and show all three volumes), andOrder and History (Volume 3): Plato and Aristotle (Collected Works of Eric Voegelin, Volume 16)by Eric Voegelin.Two more books I have read on Plato since I first wrote this review that I thought were excellent and definitely worth mentioning are:Plato and the Good: Illuminating the Darkling Vision (Philosophy of History and Culture)by Rosemary Desjardins. Desjardins offers a really interesting and exciting interpretation of Plato's metaphysics, which is, in many ways, quite different from the standard interpretations of Plato's metaphysics that you get in standard introductions, but which I think has a great deal of textual support in its favor. The other book isToward a New Interpretation of Platoby Giovanni Reale. Reale was part of the Tubingen school so he attempts to read Plato in light of the unwritten tradition but his interpretation of Plato's metaphysics is quite similar to Desjardins' in a number of ways.As a final word I will simply repeat what I said at the beginning: despite the flaws of Taylor's book which I have attempted to spell out in this review I think his book is still worth reading. Taylor is a good writer, he gets a lot right, and many of his interpretations are very thought-provoking. I simply suggest that the reader keep some of the limitations of Taylor's book in mind while reading."},{"Title":"Plato, the man and his work","review":"If you want to understand Plato, I can heartily recommend a two-step process.First, read up on him in Copleston'sA History of Philosophy, Vol. 1: Greece and Rome From the Pre-Socratics to Plotinus.

I don't think you can go far wrong, and you will have a firm understanding of one of the greatest philosophers who ever lived --- well, two, if you count Socrates!"},{"Title":"Plato, the man and his work","review":"This book is 550 pages plus many footnotes which adds the equivalent of 20 or 30 more pages. It is not light reading lets put it that way. But if you can persevere and get through it you will learn a lot about Plato.The emphasis is on 'the work' rather than 'the man'. Taylor recommended biographies by Grote, E. Meyer, and his hero Professor Burnet if you want those biographical details.I read this book over an extended period of time while finishing quite a few other books in between. Having to read this book quickly like for a college class would in my opinion be a form of mental torture. There's too much information.I had already read some of Plato's dialogues plus the Timaeus and Critias, The Republic, and The Laws. Taylor's book is a good review and overview of those plus many others although The Republic is only talked about at a high level.Taylor saw three main phases of Plato's life:1) early writings which include the Socratic dialogues and some other books2) Academy period where writing slowed down a lot3) later writings which include The LawsThe Socratic dialogues were apparently written to preserve information about Socrates and may have been based on actual conversations with Soc.I still do not understand what the motivations were for executing Socrates. It sounds like he was feared by the authorities for some reason. This strange man chose to accept his execution rather than deny his principles even though he could have probably avoided it.Taylor says that Plato viewed the doctrine of the forms as his unique contribution to philosophy. I did not gain an understanding of the forms from this book but it sounds like Aristotle's Metaphysics may provide this.I'm most interested in the more mysterious and esoteric aspects of Plato's life and writings. However those are the very things that were never well known about Plato even during his lifetime.According to the legends Plato traveled to Egypt and experienced the Egyptian initiation process at some level as had Pythagoras. During those experiences the initiates came into direct contact with the mythological gods.I have read also that Plato was criticized by the other initiates for allowing some of what he heard in Egypt to make it into his writings. The initiates were sworn to secrecy and this type of information could become dangerous in the wrong hands. Perhaps The Parmenides contains some of those metaphysical secrets.Taylor provides one of the stupider interpretations of Plato's misunderstood and often contradicted Atlantis story. Taylor says Plato used the story to talk about events that happened during his own lifetime and Plato was telling history in reverse. This is an example of how someone like Taylor will try to answer mysterious questions by referring to main stream, orthodox academic sources.Even so it's hard to imagine how many books someone like Taylor must have read in his life.Taylor held Plato in very high esteem and considered Plato to be a literary genius but I'm not sure exactly why.Jeff MarzanoThe Secret Teachings of All Ages (Reader's Edition)Edgar Cayce's Story of the Old Testament From the Birth of Souls to the Death of MosesFingerprints of the GodsAtlantisInitiationInitiation in the Great Pyramid (Astara's Library of Mystical Classics)Fulcanelli: Master Alchemist: Le Mystere des Cathedrales, Esoteric Intrepretation of the Hermetic Symbols of The Great Work (Le Mystere Des Cathedrales ... of the Hermetic Symbols of Great Work)The Giza Death Star Destroyed: The Ancient War For Future Science (Giza Death Star Trilogy)Mythic Troy: The Complete Story Legend Archeology and IntuitionOccult Ether Physics: Tesla's Hidden Space Propulsion System and the Conspiracy to Conceal It (2nd Revised Edition)"},{"Title":"The Secret of Success","review":"Mr. Allen explains the secret if success in terms of universal principles at work in our lives.

In fact, many more Australians died on the Western Front in France than at Gallipoli. Nevertheless, the Gallipoli-hardened veterans assumed a special status within the defence forces and at home as early as 1915, and the term 'ANZAC' was born at the cove and in the gullies of the rugged Turkish peninsula known now as 'Gallipoli'.My grandfather was at Gallipoli, and Flanders and the Somme in France. Like the vast majority of his comrades who were fortunate enough to return, he hated talking about the war with his family other than in the vaguest way. He roundly denounced all war as a result of the horrors he witnessed.Most of the young travellers Wright encounters are the great-grandchildren of the WW1 soldiers. Their search for connection and inter-generational meanings is nowadays backed up with academic and family based reseacrh efforts and a superb, and accessible national archive. At the date of writing this review, there are now only 5 survivors of WW1 left alive in Australia.Wright has managed to capture the spirit and motivations of the modern pilgrims, as well as depict the tourist industry which has grown up to service their needs. Often they arrive as ignorant as their great-grandfathers did on this Aegean shore . Hopefully they leave better informed, and with a thirst to know more.Wright examines the criticisms of the partying and over-indulgence in alcohol accompanying the Anzac Day (April 25th - the day of the landing at Gallipoli) commemorations each year, and concludes that the young people share much of the exuberance and joie de vivre of their equally free-spirited forbears. He also portrays the sober, good-natured manner of the actual commemorative services, and the positive interactions with their modern Turkish counterparts.This is a very good book in the 'travel writing' genre, well-written by an experienced journalist. It is easy to read, and imbued with informed opinion. It is also much more, and I thoroughly recommend it to anyone with any interest at all in understanding this particularly Australian 'pilgrimage' phenomenon."},{"Title":"Turn Right at Istanbul: A Walk on the Gallipoli Peninsula","review":"Tony Wright says that all the great histories of Gallipoli have been written and he might be right. That will not, however, stand in the way of writers who want to tap into the Anzac legend's rich lode. Tony Wright's is one of the best book available (the other would be Mat McLachlan's) for the thousands of backpackers who travel to Gallipoli for Anzac Day. He calls it \\"a journey\\". It is subtitled \\"A Walk on the Gallipoli Peninsula\\" and offers practical advice for those planning a pilgrimage to what has become a sacred, if somewhat boozy, site. Yet it is more than a travel book.He took with him a diary written by his great uncle, George Reuben Moore, who landed at Gallipoli on April 25th, 1915, what Manning Clark called \\"that sad Sabbath morn\\". Moore didn't write anything in his diary for 23 days. \\"Perhaps he was a little busy,\\" Wright notes. His engaging book marries the people with the landscape - Great Uncle George; the dead, before whose graves he pauses; the heroes like Simpson and his donkey, and those who simply dug in and hung on; the Turks, including their great leader, Ataturk; the author's Turkish hosts and Australian travelling companions. He thinks Great Uncle George would have liked the young people he met on his \\"pilgrimage to the now-peaceful place that had once scared the hell out of him, and which laid such a spell on him\\"Tony Wright is National Affairs Editor of The Bulletin magazine and a senior political correspondent based at Parliament House in Canberra.

Although I like Lonely Planet's guides, this one is rather inadequate in that it spends too much time discussing Japanese culture and history and wastes too much space on big pictures instead of cramming that space with more useful information such as phone numbers, websites, and travel information (which is confined to a very small space in the back of the book). Culture and history are important things in Japan, but the amount of space given to them in this book defeats the purpose of this guide.In other words, buy the most recent issue of the Lonely Planet Japan Guide if you're planning a trip to or employment in Japan. If you really love Tokyo above all else you can substitute the Lonely Planet Tokyo guide. Either one has plenty of information about everyone's favorite megalopolis. As for the maps, you can do without them simply by asking your hotel or the average large information desk (especially at Narita Airport) for maps of the Tokyo Metro and JR lines.Author Yanagihara, while of Japanese ancestry, has a gee-whiz-wow attitude about everything. At times she seems to have less experience in Tokyo than the average English-language school employee. She certainly means well, but the result is a less than stellar guide - however, I get the impression her editors may be most at fault. Perhaps most unfortunate is the guide's invitation for inexperienced visitors to Japan to get lost - that is, to visit places like Kamakura, Nikko, and Fuji without providing any maps of the areas or decent advice on how to get there. There are other errors such as listing the Tokyo Monorail as the only way to access Haneda Airport, but Keikyu and Keisei Railways provide faster service to a more convenient station (Shinagawa). This should not be the case in a guide like this.If you want a easy-to-carry guide to Tokyo, this will do. For any info beyond that, look for Lonely Planet Japan and Lonely Planet Tokyo.Update (October 2007): I paged through the guide again recently and came upon this quote describing the Edo-Tokyo Museum:\\"...this wonderful museum illustrates Tokyo's rise from the humble riverside origins of Edo (the Eastern capital) to today's fast forward futuristic metropolis.\\"It's bad enough that Yanagihara and (worse) her editors don't seem to know that Tokyo, not Edo, means \\"Eastern Capital.\\" The fact that the main Lonely Planet Japan guide correctly describes the name means that someone at LP isn't doing the proofreading they should be, especially as Yanagihara is a contributor to the main guide. An oversight this bad ruins the credbility of \\"Best of Tokyo\\" and is a disappointing exception to LP's otherwise high quality."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Best of Tokyo (Lonely Planet Tokyo Encounter)","review":"I have been using Lonely Planet books for years and am surprised that it would turn out a guide as skimpy and shoddily written as this.

Yanagihara seems more bemused than informed, and one can only wonder why she was hired to write about a complex metropolis that she does not seem to understand.

The author will, for example, use words such as &quot;predicates&quot; and &quot;unary&quot; without defining them. He expects that you come to this book with a background sufficient to understand such terms. (I'd forgotten what these mean, but I still found this book to be a useful introduction to SQL--I just looked up unfamiliar terms in a computer dictionary.)Bear in mind that the book is an introduction to SQL: you won't find a &quot;right outer join&quot; explained in this text, nor will this book serve as a heavy-duty reference book for all your high-powered SQL questions. This book does not go into great detail about the design of database tables (e.g., don't expect a discussion of &quot;a fully normalized data model.&quot;)Given the narrow audience for whom this book was written, I believe it to be effective. I studied the book and then obtained a certification in ANSI SQL from Brainbench. However, I *studied* the book (I didn't merely *read*) it, and I tried the author's examples on my own, and modified them, and thought about them. It took me more than three 8-hour days to get through this book, and I still didn't find the Brainbench test to be easy.The CD that comes with this book has a 60-day trial version of Centura SQLBase 7 and a sample database. Nice touch. This allows you to follow the examples in the book, and modify them, and experiment with SQL (and destroy things with no real harm done).The book has the usual assortment of typos that slip into written works (for example, the author sometimes refers to a table by two different names, perhaps reflecting a name change during the process of writing the book).I don't believe the author explained correlated queries very well, and I went to an Internet tutorial to understand them better.A couple of important words of advice (&quot;corrigenda&quot;, if you will): If you copy the file &quot;pubssqlb.dbs&quot; to your own hard drive, make sure to change the &quot;read only&quot; attribute of this file to &quot;off.&quot; If you don't (at least, this was my experience), you'll see a cryptic error message when you attempt to connect to the pubssqlb database: &quot;Attributes not compatible.&quot; Also, be aware that the data in the &quot;type&quot; column in the &quot;titles&quot; table has extra spaces added to the data (e.g., &quot;business&quot; is actually &quot;business &lt;space&gt; &lt;space&gt; &lt;space&gt; &lt;space&gt;&quot;).

Though remembered as a ruthless tyrant, he was once acclaimed as the nation's selfless champion of liberty.Thompson was a leading authority on the history of the French Revolution. He wrote the standard biography of Robespierre as well as The French Revolution. He was a Fellow of the British Academy and Honorary Fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford. Thompson died in 1956.Using a mixture of chronology and biography, Thompson sheds light on the life of the Revolution's most controversial and unique character. Led by \\"common hopes and fears,\\" Robespierre was dragged into the bloodshed of the Reign of Terror.Robespierre had to be persuaded to sign for the death of Louis XVI, signing only in hopes that the death of the king would be the last death of the Revolution. Soon, however, the Girondins had to go and others followed them. Opponents of liberty and the republic as well as conspirators against the common cause were sentenced to death. Robespierre attempted to create a new social order with the Supreme Being at the head and reason as its chief basis. Robespierre's punishment of those who conspired against him, not the Revolution, seemed to be the final straw for the people. Robespierre was arrested, and after shooting himself in the jaw, was sent to the guillotine, forever to be remembered as the \\"dictator\\" of the Reign of Terror.The work presents a well-defined topic that is well supported. This is a scholarly study intended to enlighten readers about the man behind the myth.Thompson studied Robespierre in depth and shows bias toward him. The work does not put Robespierre on the highest plain, but shows a tendency to defend his actions and present him as a martyr. It seems that the author is attempting to change commonly held views about Robespierre in hopes that he will be remembered as a visionary champion of liberty and not as the man who sent so many to the guillotine."},{"Title":"Collection of Apophthegms New and Old","review":"\\"If a man will begin with certainties, he shall end in doubts; but if he will be content to begin with doubts he shall end in certainties.\\" Wonderful wisdom, great quotes, and a philosopher's keepsake."},{"Title":"Chilton's Motorcycle and ATV Repair Manual 1945-85","review":"Owned this book many years. is very in depth on most models in cluding materials that specific parts are made of.

Seasons of the Elk is one of my favorite wildlife books. It gives comprehensive knowledge about elk that I need to know. The content is well organized and easy to read. The page number is adequate so that it won't be too long and then exhausts your brains.Another strength of the book is the photo quality. These photos are not just beautiful, but also serves with educational purpose. As a wildlife photographer, I appreciate this and regard it as my goal to achieve, too! This high quality photo style is almost the trademark of the Northword Wildlife Series like grizzly bear, bighorn sheep, wolf and coyote. It's too bad I can't find moose, fox, caribou and pronghorn from Northword.I highly recommend Seasons of the Elk and other books from Northword Wildlife Series.

It's a well-known fact that Martin never (I stress NEVER) got away with changing Buk's writing. The Buk himself said enough in regards to the problems with WOMEN, where Martin did in fact try to spice things up, but Buk caught EVERY SINGLE CHANGE, and demanded they be changed back, thus producing the only Buk/BSP book to be reprinted due to errors. Why then, would anyone think Martin got away with this with Buk's poetry? As far as literary attacks go, Buk fueled these on his own, and was notorious for burning numerous bridges (i.e the Webbs, the aforementioned Wantling, Steve Richmond, Marvin Malone, etc.). A good poem is a good poem regardless of who gets attacked. Most of these people retorted on their own, and understood the nature of the attack. I'm quite suspicious of this reviewer and am positive it is one of those poets who was villified in this collection, namely in the poem: &quot;300 poems.&quot; &quot;he was rich and I was poor / and the sea rolled in / and I turned the / white / pages.&quot; You know who you are. Regardless of any of that, this is one of Bukowski's finest literary achievements, hail the Buk!"},{"Title":"Mockingbird Wish Me Luck","review":"Charles Bukowski had a rare gift. He could make desperation beautiful. He could make hate and pain beautiful. Bukowski had a magic way of twisting emotions into poems of unimaginable shapes. Each poetic flash serving as a portal into one man's interpretation of life. And that, I think, impresses me most about Bukowski. There is no pretension. His work... simply is. Mocking Bird came out in 1979 and some readers commented that B. was going soft. What they fail to realize is that people evolve. Bukowski was still Bukowski, but perhaps his poet eyes began to see some different shades of gray. And we certainly can't fault him for that. ."},{"Title":"Mockingbird Wish Me Luck","review":"This collection, along with Burning in Water, Drowning in Flame and The Roominhouse Madrigals is absolutely essential to anyone who loves Buk's poetry.

Another great one is &quot;the world's greatest loser.&quot; And then, of course, there's &quot;WWII.&quot; And the list could go on and on. There is just so much wonderful stuff here. . .Bukowski rules in heaven and on earth."},{"Title":"Mockingbird Wish Me Luck","review":"Charles Bukowski (1920 - 1994) had a gift for creating evocative titles, including the title for his 1972 collection of poetry, \\"Mockingbird Wish Me Luck\\". The title is apt. It derives from a beautiful poem, one of Bukowski's finest, \\"Mockingbird\\". I read Bukowski's poem as a parable on death and loss and cruelty. During the summer, a mockingbird has been following and taunting a cat. In response to the taunting, Bukowski writes that the cat \\"said something angry to the mockingbird/which I didn't understand.\\" One day, Bukowski sees the cat walk \\"calmly up the driveway\\" with the bird alive in its mouth \\"no longer mocking.\\" Bukowski writes \\"it was asking, it was praying/but the cat/ striding down through centuries/ would not listen.\\" The cat crawls under a car with its prey \\"to bargain it to another place.\\" And Bukowski concludes, \\"summer was over\\".Not every poem in this volume is as effective as \\"Mockingbird.\\" Bukowski was a prolific but erratic writer of short, unrhymed and unmetered poetry. Bukowski wrote in the language of common speech, punchy and colloquial. At its best, his writing has passion, rawness, a tough vulgarity, and, frequently a sardonic humor. His poetry tends to be autobiographical, but he also writes short scenes and narratives, such as \\"Mockingbird.\\" In the early parts of this volume, Bukowski writes effectively of the life of the urban poor, his experiences with women, his life at the racetrack, and his thoughts on writing poetry. The themes of his poems are frequently dark, including loneliness, death, suicide, and aging. The poems in the latter part of the volume begin to take a more positive, mellower tone, as Bukowski writes of his love for his wife and for his young daughter.Besides \\"Mockingbird,\\" the poems I enjoyed in this volume include \\"the last days of the suicide kid\\", Bukowski's reflections on growing old, \\"My friend William\\", a story of a friend who seemingly had attained success in his career and in his marriage, \\"consummation of grief\\", in which Bukowski writes that \\"I was born to hustle roses down the avenue of the dead\\", the poem \\"he wrote in lonely blood\\", Bukowski's tribute to his fellow California poet Robinson Jeffers, \\"a sound in the brush\\", a story of a casualty of war, \\"american matador\\", on the theme of sex and death, and, on, one of Bukowski's preoccupations, \\"I saw an old-fashioned whore today\\".The poems I have mentioned show the qualities of Bukowski, the toughness and grit, that will be familiar to most of his readers. I want to conclude with a poem by Bukowski that shows a part of him that may be less familiar. This poem, \\"marina\\" is written to his young daughter.\\"majestic, magicinfinitemy little girl issun,on the carpet-out the doorpicking aflower, ha!An old man,battle-wrecked,emerges from hischairand she looks at mebut only seeslove,ha! And I becomequick with the worldand love right backjust like I was meantto do.Bukowski had his sentimental and tender side that he usually kept carefully hidden.

Listen to them, I am sure they are all over the internet. I enjoy these Mockingbird poems as he had begun to reach such clarity. There are different periods in Bukowski's life. I enjoyed these most out of his poetry books from his Post Office era. I love these as much as Hot Water Music, and The Last Night of the Earth Poems, which are other of my favourites. Each period of his life is reflected in his writing, it is a strength. Writing is personal, it is a matter of taste, not better or worse. I hope you listen to his readings.

I was confused; you see, in AT YOUR DOOR you play investogators who travel the country, meet a wide array of monsters and chum up with guest stars (like Mr. Shiny, before he was famous). All that's missing is Don Knotts making a cameo. Actually, I'm sorely tempted to try the idea...I have heard many people complain that AT YOUR DOOR suffers from \\"monster-of-the-week\\" syndrome. In a sense that's true; there are dark young, serpent people, a shoggoth lord, mutated humans, tcho-tcho people, and chthonians, and it's hard to grasp why the investigators would be encountering this much weirdness. You can always sweep it under the End Times rug, when anything can happen and usually does. Alternatively the GM can play up the Shub Niggurath connection. All of the disparate adventures have some connection to that Mythos deity and some minor tweaking would allow this aspect to come to the forefront. Alternatively, the campaign could be played as a series of independent adventures. The weirdness doesn't have to be connected in some subtle conspiracy; if you look hard enough, the sane world falls away and you discover what is happening beneath the surface. If the PCs feel that there is some terrible conspiracy to uncover, let them run with that.As a series of loosely connected adventures (MANSIONS OF MADNESS is like this), I think AT YOUR DOOR is outstanding. As an actual campaign, it feels disjointed. Most of the adventures are interesting and, as mentioned by the previous reviewer, have become classic bits of Mythos lore. If you don't know about Mr. Shiny, bak bon dzshow, or the Milk of Shub Niggurath, this is the place to find it. AT YOUR DOOR seems to have strongly influenced the unofficial Delta Green mythos, and I would particularly recommend that it be converted to Delta green scenarios.As a bonus, the cover art is outstanding."},{"Title":"At Your Door (Call of Cthulhu Horror Roleplaying, Modern Era, #2326)","review":"This is one of the classic modern campaign supplements for Call of Cthulhu, and I'm surprised to see it still available 13 years later. There's a lot of good ideas to mine here, but I've never known anyone to run it without major modifications. It seems like everyone hates different sections. The root problem is, it's too all-over-the-place: Too many widely divergent scenarios, themes, and creatures, haphazardly slapped together. Even so, there are a lot of parts that I love, and some bits--such as Mr. Shiny, Tcho-tcho restaurants, Dawn Biozyme, and the City of Samson--have become enduring parts of CoC canon.What I'd really like to see is a total makeover of this supplement, along the lines of the redone Day of the Beast and Masks of Nyarlathotep. The scenarios could be made more consistent, the monsters more logically related (I mean, really, why would shoggoths and cthonians work together in a vast consipracy? Gimme a break.). And it's a perfect opportunity to add a chapter on how to turn the whole thing into a Delta Green mission."},{"Title":"At Your Door (Call of Cthulhu Horror Roleplaying, Modern Era, #2326)","review":"I bought this scenario in hope I could use it as a challenge for a Modern campaign. After all, there is a wonderfully evocative, creepy cover, and covers don't lie? Or can they...?While the campaign does introduce an intriguing opponent in \\"Mr. Shiny,\\" it fails to live up to its promise due to the contrived way each scenario seems to lead to the next one. You have to practically railroad the players to go forward as they puzzle over how the last scenario had anything to do with the one they are embarking on. Any player taking notes would be baffled after a few sessions of this campaign, which incidentally introduces us to a giant canine and a B-movie style giantess, which begs the question, \\"Is this just an extended \\"Blood Brothers\\" scenario?\\" I like camp, but the tone in this campaign just never settles down enough to play it as \\"Call of Cthulhu\\" or even as \\"Attack of the Giant Woman.\\" (Did I mention it features a giant dog? I am not kidding.)The completely random assortment of opponents keeps the pace moving, but really most of the threat is having one or more of the players raise their hand and ask, \\"What that heck was that about?\\" Like the other reviewers, I had to significantly revise it to make it flow, but if you are spending money on a complete campaign, there is no excuse for having to fix a botched attempt.If somebody sold me a bicycle with two bent rims that caught fire periodically, I wouldn't give it four stars and kindly suggest that \\"its a flawed classic\\" or needs revision to make it work. No, I would be mad as hell that the bike I paid for makes me look like a drunk, Special Ed version of the Ghost Rider riding to school on a banana saddle.But I digress...\\"At Your Door\\" is very bad science-fiction excruciatingly pounded into a \\"Call of Cthulhu\\" campaign. Lacking atmosphere and cohesiveness from the get-go, \\"At Your Door\\" is badly written, and graced with awful interior art that succeeds only in showing us in pictures that yes, \\"At Your Door\\" really does belong \\"In A Landfill.\\""},{"Title":"Judgment Calls: A Mystery","review":"This first effort by Alafair Burke starts a little slowly, but after reading a couple of chapters, I found myself absorbed in the storyline and caring more and more about the characters.

I'm thrilled to find another author contributing to the law enforcement/mystery genre!"},{"Title":"Judgment Calls: A Mystery","review":"Deputy DA Samantha Kincaid of Portland Oregon is faced with a particularly disturbing case. A thirteen year old girl is found raped, sodomized and left for dead in the woods outside of town. The girl, Kendra Martin, identifies her attacker as Frank Derringer. With that evidence the case is brought to trial. However, with flimsy evidence, Samantha sees pitfalls ahead as she goes against an idealistic and aggressive public defender. As the complexity of the case reveals itself, Samantha actually finds herself in imminent danger.Alafair Burke, daughter of MWA Grand master James Lee Burke, has written a very different book than the lyrically beautiful writing of her father. I don't mean this in a negative sense. Alafair Burke is a law professor and, like Samantha, a former DA in Portland. The book is character driven. With much influence from Sue Grafton, Sara Paretsky, Nevada Barr and Laura Lippmann to name a few, the character of Samantha is the key to everything. We must, of course, know everything about her including her preferences in food and love. She must have the obligatory pet, live alone, have a lover etc. In spite of the fact that this book is not of my personal taste, there is much promising about this debut writer. She delves into the personality of Samantha Kincaid with vigor in first person narrative. The character is dead on. I wonder if it is the author herself we are getting to know. The conclusion is complex with the obligatory exposition scene of the villain holding the gun over the hero while divulging all. Yet, it is deftly handled. Overall, recommended with mild reservation."},{"Title":"Judgment Calls: A Mystery","review":"I was impressed by Ms Burke's first mystery. The characters that will probably become regulars in her future mysteries all have a &quot;real&quot; feel to them from the beginning. Unlike most mystery writers of today's top seller lists,, Burke doesn't resort to escalating violence or grotesgue brutality.Being the child of a man almost of current poet laureate status of popular mystery, Ms Burke holds her own with the quality of her work. Judgment Calls isn't deserving of some of the shallow criticism thrown at it. If you expect Grisham BUY Grisham. If you expect James Lee Burke BUY James Lee Burke.If you're expecting a well written mystery with developed characterizations and plot READ Judgment Calls. If you want an entertaining read the Alafair Burke series looks to be off to a good start. I'm looking forward to future Samantha Kincaid adventures! I'm also looking forward to more Dave Robicheaux.

Two johns pull her into their car, beat her, sodomize and rape her. They leave her for dead in an isolated park. Two Samaritans find her and call 911. The emergency room doctors save her life. After she recovers she identifies one of the perpetrators as Frank Derringer, an ex-con out on parole who is supposed to stay away from underage girls as the condition for his continued freedom.Deputy District Attorney Samantha Kincaid goes against the advice of her immediate superior and decides to charge Derringer with numerous felonies that will put him away for a long time. At first her case looks solid but Frank's defense attorney makes such a compelling argument that a serial killer committed the crime that her boss and his superior force her to drop out of the prosecution. Samantha isn't willing to let the case slip away from her and see justice perverted so she starts her own independent investigation, an action that almost gets her killed.Alafair Burke, the daughter of well renowned crime thriller writer James Lee Burke, has inherited her father's talent for writing a compelling and enthralling novel. This legal thriller has plenty of action scenes, surprises and courtroom scenes so readers will find themselves thoroughly enjoying JUDGMENT CALLS which is, as hard as it is to believe, the author's debut novel. The protagonist has a vulnerable side that will endear her to readers as well as a bulldog tenacity that allows her to do her job in spite of overwhelming odds.

On to Missing Judgment as my next read."},{"Title":"Judgment Calls: A Mystery","review":"This has been one of the strangest books I've read in years. First, I have to explain that I guessed who the author was, or at least who her father was, when I saw the front cover of the book. James Lee Burke is one of my favorite detective novelists, and his main character Dave Robicheaux has a daughter with the unusual name of Alafair. Alafair Burke, then, would be Burke's daughter, right? Yes, turns out that's the case. The younger Burke is a lawyer who's worked with the DA in Portland, Oregon, and now teaches law in New York. She's based her book on her time in Portland.I don't usually like books with lawyers as protagonists. I think I'm at least a little more attracted to Lawrence Block's hitman protagonist than a lawyer as one. But given that I like Burke the father, I thought I'd try the daughter too. The book revolves around a young female prosecutor in Portland (something I suspect Ms. Burke knows something about) and her prosecution of a guy who's been accused of the rape of an underaged prostitute. The plot's entertaining, and the city's atmosphere is pretty well-done, to the point that I felt as if I knew Portland better than I had previously. I did have one minor complaint: the author uses enough acronyms in the text that a one- or two-page glossary wouldn't have been a bad idea. The confusing one (which she never identifies) is PPB. It turns out Portland doesn't have a Police *Department* like the rest of civilization: theirs is a Police *Bureau*. Talk about strange.I enjoyed this book a great deal, and now that I've read the first one I look forward to the next entries in the series."},{"Title":"Judgment Calls: A Mystery","review":"A hard-to-put down legal thriller by a debut mystery writer with a great new voice.

This book is not that bad, but there are several flaws in logic that just bug me.A character has his car repainted and an all new interior put in the day after the rape/possible attempted murder. At the trial the defense produces a witness that states the arrangements were made for this BEFORE the incident - thus claiming the defendant was not covering up his party to the crime. And the DA just says nothing? Well gee - I am the bad guy and I know my car goes in the shop the next morning for a paint job (totally different color) and an all-new interior. Then I KNOW I can do whatever I want in the car since any evidence will be GONE the next morning.Even worse, there is a 2nd unknown assailant - but the trial proceeds on the guy they arrested. Then when letters appear in the paper from someone claiming to be the REAL perp - with details known ONLY to someone who did it - they decide to let the guy go. Now wait a minute - they KNOW that there were TWO people that raped the girl, one they caught and one they can't ID. So MAYBE the guy writing the letters IS the 2nd guy, if so WHY would you let the other guy off? Nothing in the letters would exclude the guy on trial from still being the one.It is also a stretch that the victim never runs into the 2nd guy, as it turns out.I will probably pick up the 2nd book in this &quot;series&quot;, but this is for sure in the &quot;get it from the library&quot; class of book - maybe a discounted paperback."},{"Title":"Judgment Calls: A Mystery","review":"The career spotlight is not focused on Deputy District Attorney Samantha Kincaid with her current job. The vice cases she prosecutes aren't the big time career winners, so when local police come cap in hand for assistance with a sexual assault and attempted murder, she's interested. The usual hand passes have been given to this one as while the victim has got her details straight, she is not the ideal person to appeal to a jury. Thirteen year old Kendra Martin admitted belatedly that she's lately taken to prostitution to pay for her new habit, and was high on the night of her brutal attack. With a solid identification, Kincaid and the cops are ready to move on this one, dragging their reluctant victim along with them.The defense attorney seems to want to make a big statement on this one, and Kincaid is sucker punched at the trial with a hit on the integrity of the investigating officers. Former flame Chuck Forbes had his rising career almost snuffed out before it began when he was accused of leading a witness in a high profile serial killer case. This new case is likened to the same, and it is not long before the media take flight. Someone is staking claim to the attack of Kendra Martin and others, throwing Kincaid's case wide open to be linked with the older crimes. If there's a serial killer at hand, he'd like to eliminate the threat of his only surviving witness. Kincaid must not only protect her client, her friend Chuck but also herself from the threat of a maniac who has now decided he wants his own turn at being the media's darling.\\"Judgment Calls\\" was a debut novel for author Alafair Burke, who has written two further novels since featuring district attorney Samantha Kincaid. This isn't a stellar first novel, but it should introduce enough new faces for the reader to take the interest forward to the next book. There is little suspense as the whodunit factor is revealed along the way, and the rest of the journey is in the process - the detailing of which gets a little tedious. It gets to be sickly as Burke talks up her protagonist, via the secondary characters, to be some kind of avenging saint. Also, for a supposedly smart woman, Kincaid gets to do some rather dumb things. This is a light thriller read, possibly appealing to the reader who prefers the gorey details to be tucked away behind a teaching view into the courtroom, with some harmless romantic scenes included."},{"Title":"Judgment Calls: A Mystery","review":"Initially, I was drawn to this book by its setting --- Portland, my hometown. I like the feeling that comes with knowing a place intimately. That way, it seems that I somehow have an edge over the average reader. Along with the comfort of familiar street names, buildings and cafes, however, Ms. Burke demonstrates a meticulous knowledge of the inner workings of prosecutors and courtrooms. She should, having spent years as a deputy district attorney right here in Multnomah County. Ms. Burke's depictions of how the law works, with all its frustrations and flaws, are dead-on accurate --- with the possible exception of her belief that only rookie cops aren't fat. (I owed that objection to my husband, retired from the department after 26 years.) Ms. Burke handily reveals some gaping holes in our legal system. Some of its failings shine from the pages and you're left to wonder how victims --- especially young ones like in JUDGMENT CALLS --- deal with the imperfections. I could see how choosing not to press charges might look more attractive than facing the horror of testifying before a room full of invasive media, gawkers and general trial oddballs.In this case, thirteen-year-old Kendra Martin has been viciously raped and left for dead in the Columbia River Gorge, a scenic area a few short miles from the city center. The details are so gruesome that even Deputy District Attorney Samantha Kincaid winces when she hears them. The three major crime detectives that bring the case to Kincaid don't need to argue very much to induce her to fight to make this one stick. The victim, given mug photos, confidently identifies her attacker. Even her body language says she's sure. The suspect is quickly arrested and, in an unusual turn of events, pushes for an exceptionally speedy trial, insisting he's innocent.While the physical evidence convinces Samantha she has a solid case, she faces an uphill battle with her victim. Kendra's background isn't exactly squeaky clean, and she is no nave child. She turned to prostitution in order to support her drug habit. In addition, her mom isn't the best role model, with a shoplifting charge or two to her name. But the viciousness of the attack dictates the need to put this guy away. That, plus the threatening phone calls and a Toyota Tercel that Ms. Kincaid thinks is following her, make her more determined than ever. In the course of investigating this crime, Samantha stumbles onto evidence of a web of crimes that appear linked to Kendra's attack. The possibility of a serial killer sends her trial into a tailspin and mobilizes the full force of the police department to uncover the truth.Alafair is definitely James Lee Burke's daughter, no doubt about it. She pens a taut detective story with intelligent, witty dialogue and moves it along roller coaster style. While she may lack dad's polish --- polish that comes with vast experience and practice --- with her talent, she should have many years to work on it. For now, we can eagerly await another Samantha Kincaid mystery, due to hit shelves in the spring of 2004.--- Reviewed by Kate Ayers"},{"Title":"Judgment Calls: A Mystery","review":"I have been looking for a new mystery series and saw that the Samantha Kincaid novels had received fairly high reviews, so I ordered this first installment. How disappointing. Dry characters, dull dialog, and a plot that seemed to take forever to set up and resolve. I doubt that I'll be buying any of the other books in the series."},{"Title":"Judgment Calls: A Mystery","review":"I agree with all the other less-then-three-star people, (except for the one who really trashed the book, it's not THAT bad) this book is boring and the characters are not very well developed, you don't feel apart of the story.The first 50 pages are hard to get through and you don't get a sense of the scene around the characters. For example, Kincaid walks into a the girl's house and we get a pretty good description of the house and how it looks inside and then, in the very next paragraph, is dialogue. What happened? One minute she is outside and the very next they are already in the house sitted and talking. Did they knock on the door? Did it open magically? How did the girl look? What happened to the Happy Meal Kincaid brought? Did they sit on a couch, chair, floor?If you like your stories bare bones, this is for you. As for me, I like a little more atmosphere from writers such as Ian Rankin, Michael Connelly, John Connolly, Charles Todd, Erin Hart. These people breath life into their books."},{"Title":"Judgment Calls: A Mystery","review":"As a law teacher and former deputy district attorney, Alafair Burke certainly knows her legal stuff - there's just too much of it. Yes, this is a legal thriller. But, it's all legal and no thrill. Every legal term, document, division, and procedure is explained in dry, tedious detail, all the way down to the nine-digit case number.A rape case is going to be kicked to the general felony unit for prosecution, a dumping ground for cases not deemed serious enough for real lawyer work. The lead detectives convince Samantha Kincaid to prosecute instead, telling her, \\"...The suspects are bad, bad guys, Sammie.\\"Well, aren't they all.THE CHARACTER SETUP IS TRANSPARENT AND UNREALISTIC. After a phone conversation with a lecherous superior, it's no surprise who the bad guy turns out to be. Then there's the two page, unrelated description of a closed case. So unrelated to what's going on at the moment that you know it will be related later on.DIALOG IS DRY AND UNINSPIRED. When speaking to a group of panhandling kids:\\"Why don't you guys hightail it out of here before [the mounted patrol] give you a hard time.\\" The one I was pretty sure was Haley piped up. \\"What do you care?\\" \\"Honestly? I don't care whether you go to juvie or not. But the officers doing the rounds today are coming up on reporting time, and I got a bet with a buddy at the precinct that their unit's not going to meet their enforcement quotas this month. Listen to me or not. It's up to you.\\"When speaking with a potential witness:Hands still on her hips, she rolled her eyes and laughed to let us know that the notion of cooperating with the police amused her. She nodded in my direction. \\"Yeah, and what's she here for, fit me for my Girl Scout uniform?\\" I had some damn good tacos going soggy on my desk. The last thing I needed was for some twit to patronize me, but I did my best to keep the anger out of my voice.ATMOSPHERE IS NONEXISTENT. When told that the victim might again be in danger from her attacker: \\"I tried to calm down. ...Despite all the logical reasons not to worry, it was hard to concentrate, so I distracted myself by checking my bottomless voice mailbox.\\"After detailing (for two pages) the dating history and break up with a co-worker: \\"I set the table, blinking away tears before any could roll down.\\"Yawn.I gave it 100 pages but couldn't see my way through another 235. I kept hoping it would start to live up to all the rave reviews from the likes of Lee Child, Sue Grafton, and the Washington Post. But I don't understand what all the hype is about, other than friends of her father giving glowing reviews just to be nice. Bad judgment calls on their part."},{"Title":"Judgment Calls: A Mystery","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. I ordered it because of a Portland Oregonian favorable review. Early in the book the language was unacceptable for our library. Descriptions of the body were much too specific. I asked a friend for an opinion and received agreement that it was unacceptable for our library. If readers wish to read this type of writing, that is their choice, but if I purchase a book I am responsible for the contents to some degree. I am sorry I did not return it to the source at the time, it still takes up space in my home. If it is still possible to return it for a credit, I would like to do that, and order something more acceptable, as are the Alexander McCall Smith books. These are very engaging books and don't contain objectioable material. I would appreciate a response from Amazon if the book may still be returned at this late date. Thank you. Agnes Panner"},{"Title":"Judgment Calls: A Mystery","review":"Having been a James Lee Burke fan for quite some time, I fully expected to find an intriguing tale, but with JLB overtones. Not at all. Judgement Calls is fast-paced, immediately engaging and definitely the author's own. The dialog is realistic, sharp and often very funny. Burke's Samantha Kincaid is well drawn, an imperfect, thoroughly likable, bright Assistant District Attorney with minor emotional baggage (no angst) and an attitude to which any woman can relate. The other characters are better than adequate; not as detailed as one might like, but their motivations are clearly understood. The story is a gut-wrencher for anyone with teens (and Burke gets the teen attitude down to the rolling-eye sighs!). The story is a little convoluted, perhaps because of the legal details, but it pulls you in and by the end you've got it. I'm glad I started this book on Friday evening, because I was up all night finishing it!"},{"Title":"Judgment Calls: A Mystery","review":"As a loyal James Lee Burke fan, I couldn't pass on the temptation to read his daughter's debut. I knew it would be different from her father's, but I found myself comparing for the first twenty pages or so.While the prose is lean and gritty--a family writing trait--the inner turmoils are less pronounced and the settings less colorful. Soon, though, I found myself intrigued by this story of an underage prostitute discovered almost dead in the woods outside of Portland, Oregon. I began to care for the female deputy DA as she unraveled the case, as she struggled with her own relational hangups. I turned the pages...and forgot about comparisons.&quot;Judgment Calls&quot; starts a little rough, reading more like a manual on legal procedures at times, but Alafair Burke knows her stuff and begins to smooth out the ride as the novel progresses. She tells a good mystery, and I look forward to the sequel. Why live in her father's shadow when she can stand admirably on her own! And I'm sure Mr. Burke would agree."},{"Title":"Judgment Calls: A Mystery","review":"If you've spent any time inside a DA's office you know Alafair Burke delivers the goods. The story is believable and accurate in tone and detail. The characters seem real and the plot is not some far-fetched Grisham-like fantasy that could never happen in a million years. I enjoyed this book a great deal and have recommended it to several friends. Just because her dad is a legendary writer himself doesn't mean A. Burke doesn't earn her kudos. I am eagerly awaiting her next one."},{"Title":"Judgment Calls: A Mystery","review":"This may be the first novel for Alafair (I love that name!) Burke, but she is no novice at writing a gritty,fast-paced, witty page-turner. It must be in the genes! Protaganist, Samantha Kincaid(a Portland DDA) is entirely likeable &amp; this book leaves you wanting more of her, not to mention her old-flame &amp; current Portland detective, Chuck Forbes.

As she is preparing for her straightforward attempted murder trial , it takes some bizarre twists involving child pornography rings, a possible serial killer, and corruption in the DA's office. There is a secondary story involving her on again/off again relationship with her first love Chuck Forbes. Chuck, the son of a former governor, is now detective on the Major Crime Team.Alafair Burke is former deputy district attorney and is now a law professor at Hofstra School of Law, so she is knowledgeable about her subject matter. The characters were multi-dimensional and well developed. The plot of this story was pretty good, but tended to be slow at times due to the lengthy explanations of the legal process. One annoyance in the book was the liberal use of acronyms. There were too many and it slowed down parts of the story even more. This is a good start to a promising series, but it could have been better if it were better paced."},{"Title":"Judgment Calls: A Mystery","review":"Alafair Burke is inevitably tagged as \\"daughter of James Lee Burke\\" but don't be put off by that. Ms. Burke is worthwhile in her own right....she is not cruising on her father's fame.Judgment Calls is the first of what will become the Samantha Kinkaid series. Kincaid is an Asst DA in Portland, OR. In this first novel, Kincaid catches a prostitute murder case.The characters are well crafted as is the plot. The book is fast-moving and full of enough twists to keep you off-balance and guessing until the end.Well worth reading and following up the other two now out in the series."},{"Title":"Judgment Calls: A Mystery","review":"In her debut novel, Alafair Burke introduces us to Deputy District Attorney Samantha Kincaid in an excellent start to what promises to be a very enjoyable series. And the news is good because the second book in the series is already in the works.Sam Kincaid agrees to take a case that looks like it could be poison from the start. A 13-year-old prostitute and heroin addict has been raped, severely beaten and left for dead by a couple of men. Even though the girl can positively identify one of her attackers, the fact that she's a prostitute and may have been under the influence of drugs at the time will mean the jury may be unsympathetic to say the least. Sam puts a case together regardless and pretty soon the evidence begins building and the case looks stronger all the time. It's only halfway through the trial that things begin to go wrong and the case doesn't look quite so clear cut after all.This really is a particularly good legal thriller and the fact that it's a debut novel only makes it all the more commendable. Through Sam we are stepped through the legal procedure as seen from the D.A.'s perspective. This could have been quite tedious and boring, but in this case, the telling was anything but. As for the mystery, I thought it was very well constructed, complete with a clever twist or two at the end."},{"Title":"Judgment Calls: A Mystery","review":"JUDGMENT CALLS marks the debut of Alafair Burke, daughter of famous crime writer James Lee Burke. The plot involves Samantha Kincaid, an assistant DA in Portland, who's prosecuting a brutal rape/attempted murder. The case looks airtight, but then a possible link to a serial killer arises, as does the possibility that Samantha's lover (a cop) may have put an innocent woman in jail.Much of the book details the legal maneuverings around the rape case, and there's quite a bit of description of legal procedures that will be familiar to anyone who has seen a couple of episodes of Law &amp; Order. At times I thought the book dragged, but I enjoyed being in the company of these characters and the final plot twist is genuinely exciting. I look forward to reading more from this author."},{"Title":"Judgment Calls: A Mystery","review":"Judgment Calls, the debut effort from Alafair Burke, is a book that is difficult to set down. Readers are introduced to Samantha Kincaid, a young prosecutor navigating through the judicial system in search of justice for the teenage victim in a brutal rape case. Ms. Burke, through colorful descriptions, interesting character development, and a tight, riveting plot, takes the reader on a memorable ride from the start to finish of a criminal case from the prosecutor's perspective, a perspective that has not been explored much by other crime/mystery writers. Ms. Burke appears to have a very bright future in this genre and this reviewer is definitely looking forward to future books featuring Samantha Kincaid."},{"Title":"Judgment Calls: A Mystery","review":"I suppose when you pick up the debut novel of an author who happens to be the daughter of a bestselling author, it's natural to want to compare. But in all fairness, once I opened the book up, I promised myself that I wasn't about to compare Alafair Burke to her legendary dad, James Lee Burke. That way I wouldn't be looking for mysteries of the bayou, or some swamp, Cajun action thriller that the more seasoned Burke writes. I'd be looking for something original, something handpicked, something that came from the head of Alafair Burke. So, does the name James Lee Burke STILL come to mind? Well, get it out of your head, and read something by Alafair Burke.Alafair introduces us to Samantha Kincaid, known better as Sam. And she's from the Portland area, and she's a Deputy District Attorney. And she works for DVD, (drug and vice division) only to have a serious case on her hands. A thirteen-year old girl has been sexually assaulted and left for dead, and Sam is on a mission to find out who and why. And when she has questions, she gets answers, and she gets trouble. When she seems to get in too deep, her own character and integrity is questioned. To dig deeper would mean more trouble, but it could also produce results!Alafair Burke isn't afraid to get a little gritty from time to time, yet pulls this off quite nicely. One reviewer remarked that at times it was like reading a manual, and unfortunately he was right on. So despite some moments of dragging just a bit, Burke put together something impressive. And that's not just my opinion either. Lee Child, Michael Connelly and Linda Fairstein agree as well that Alafair Burke is an author worth reading!So just get it out of your head that this is a James Lee Burke look-alike. Get it in your head that Alafair Burke sure can write!"},{"Title":"Judgment Calls: A Mystery","review":"This book was one of the worst I have ever read. The characters were not developed and the plot was slow moving resulting in a very boring story. All-in-all it was a waste of time and money."},{"Title":"Judgment Calls: A Mystery","review":"There are two reasons why this book was published. Alafair Burke's daddy is the first one, and a near total lack of imagination from Henry Holt is the second. This book is yet another story penned by a lawyer wanting to be the next Grisham or Margolin, and the result is pretty bad. The characters are two-dimensional, the plot predictable, and the storyline listless. There is nothing scary, thrilling, insightful or remotely interesting in this book. What Alafair does manage to do is hit all the important bullet-points to catch a bored and overworked editor. She has the secretly bad cop, the fiesty best friend, the dedicated lawyer with the fragile heart, and of course, the serial killer. Her lack of talent reduces even the most potentially exciting scenes into something from the Batman TV show from the 1960's. She was even smart enough to add sexual molestation of a girl, which as all readers know is the \\"plot du jour\\" for substandard writing.It was embarrassing to see the writers in Henry Holt's stable laud this book on the dust jacket. After reading the book myself my opinion of these writers has diminished, or I am leaning to dismissing them as shills. The mystery genre, and its daughter, the legal thriller, is suffering from an excess of these books that follow the same bland formulas found in Harlequin romances. It is time for a fresh voice and inspired ideas to take the genre forward, and Alafair Burke does not even come close to having this talent. It is a shame neptism has allowed her to take the place another, gifted writer might use.Nothing works right in Jedgment Calls. Don't waste your time with this book."},{"Title":"Judgment Calls: A Mystery","review":"Ms. Burke should apologize to the souls of the trees that gave their lives for this pap. If 10% of what James Lee Burke has had rubbed off on this kid, it might have been salvagable. This book is marred by (among other things): stock characters lifted from a rejected script Steven Bochco used to line his cat box; a hackneyed, overworked plot; dialogue like no people ever spoke; and truly cringeworthy prose. It beats my previous low-water-mark for a novel by a non-writer, which was Chuck Scarborough's &quot;Aftershock&quot;.I guess Ms. Burke figured with the (likely) interesting cases she's seen and Dad's brain to tap, she could become the latest, greatest lawyer-novelist.

Paul, if you are reading this, please drop me a line."},{"Title":"The hitchhiker's field manual","review":"This is a cool piece of history. Below is a little piece from the book about my home state.From The Hitchhiker's Field Manual by Paul Dimaggio - 1973NORTH CAROLINANorth Carolina is another friendly place for hitchhikers. The law explicitly permits hitchhiking from the shoulder on state highways, and police are rarely interested in giving you a bad time. North Carolina is a southern state, and there are exceptions, but generally you can expect frequent rides and little trouble. Since it's founding as a colony, North Carolina has had an atmosphere notably more progressive than some of its neighbors.A representative of the highway patrol writes: \\"We have very little, if any, trouble with hitchhikers.\\" Ann ACLU spokesman says: \\"It is my general impression that the police in North Carolina do not attempt to interfere with hitchhikers. I have no personal knowledge of any prosecutions of personsfor hitchhiking.\\"Even the interstates are pretty cool. Hitchhikers from Raleigh, Greensboro, and Chapel Hill report no difficulties on highways there. Friends in Asheville tell of an occasional mass arrest on interstates on weekends and holidays, but no trouble on weekdays. Around Winston- Salem, the road has a brick boundary; you must keep on the grass, outside of the brick.Hitching is also good in the larger towns and cities. Vagrancy laws were declared unconstitutional in 1968. Charlotte, Greensboro, Gastonia, Tarboro and most other North Carolina cities permit hitching from the shoulder or sidewalk. Chapel Hill and Raleigh are fine. Occasionally, police in Greensboro and Greenville demand IDs, but there is no serious difficulty. As a general rule, any hitchhiker who has good identification and stays out of the smaller towns should have no problems.North Carolina is one of those lucky states with both seashore and mountains. On the west, from Asheville and beyond, are the magnificent Great Smokies. The Blue Ridge Parkway continues through this area from Virginia. On the coast are Cape Hatteras and Cape Lookout, with long shorelines and lots of wildlife."},{"Title":"On a Cold Road: Tales of Adventure in Canadian Rock","review":"A fantastic book! If you are a fan of the band, or of Canadian music in general, you won't be able to put it down. I guarantee that after reading this book, you'll never think of the music industry in the same way again.This book is really two books in one, blended together. First of all, it tells the story of Dave Bidini and the Canadian rock band &quot;Rheostatics&quot;. Fans will relish all the interesting twists and turns of the band's career, while non-fans will be heading to their local music store as fast as possible to hear what these guys sound like.Bidini's writing is intense and very personal. From the stinking tour bus to the bright lights up on the stage of Maple Leaf Gardens, you'll feel like you're right there with the band.The second aspect of the book is a collection of interviews with Canadian musicians who led the way back in the 70's and 80's. These snapshots of life in the rock biz are the most the most honest you're likely to come across. Crazy, hilarious, heartbreaking, and sometimes disturbing, they are an invaluable historical resource for the Canadian music scene.Buy this book, and once you've read it, go buy some Rheostatics CDs. You won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"On a Cold Road: Tales of Adventure in Canadian Rock","review":"Written during his band's cross-Canada tour, Bidini's stories as one of the founding members of the Rheostatics are interspersed with interviews he conducted with some of the biggest music legends of our time.Some people start playing an instrument after they hear a great song. Bidini's book will make people want to start their own bands. Descriptions of first gigs, first band break-ups and first record deals offer amazing insight into an industry and a life that goes far beyond ghost-written rock and roll 'autobiographies' both emotionally and intellectually. Bidini is a gifted writer."},{"Title":"On a Cold Road: Tales of Adventure in Canadian Rock","review":"I really enjoyed Dave's writing style and did get a great sense of the life of a big time rock star but it was hard to keep track of who the musicians were if you weren't into the 80s/90s Canadian music scene."},{"Title":"On a Cold Road: Tales of Adventure in Canadian Rock","review":"You don't have to be a Canadian or even KNOW any of the bands in this book to enjoy the stories as told by the rockers themselves.It's simply a great collection of road tales in the ever-entertaining realm of rock and roll touring. Of course, the fact that 2 gigs in the same province can be a day's drive apart, makes Bidini's collection ever the more fascinating.I simply could not put the thing down. Plenty of laughs and funny stories, a couple of shockingly painful stories, and some priceless moments of insight into Canadian popular culture, human interaction, and the music business.A great gift for your Rockin' and Rollin' friends!"},{"Title":"A voyage to Arcturus (Canongate classics)","review":"This book is categorized as Scifi/Fantasy but it is much more than that. You can argue that this book can be called religious philosophy. It is one of those books that you will never forget and it will have an impact on your life. It truly will expand your thinking and I believe help you grow spiritually. Once you travel with Maskull to Arcturus, when you return you will have a different perspective. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"A voyage to Arcturus (Canongate classics)","review":"Most books are read for instruction or entertainment. Many challenge the wits or beliefs. Few question our very grasp on reality, or confront us with spiritual dilemma. The fact that the author ended his life prior to publication might place him in the rare club of suicidal artists (John Toole, Ian Curtis, Nick Drake) credited as having revealed a tortured emotion too beautiful to bear.Like Hesse's Steppenwolf, Lindsay manages to draw out manageable manifestations of Jungian archtypes, but his imagery is far more expressive, discarding rather than merely augmenting day to day experience. His prose is not elegant, his sudden story changes are disorienting, and you finally leave the book with the feeling that, perhaps, the author has revealed great truths just beyond grasp.A very fascinating exercise. Very cult worthy."},{"Title":"A voyage to Arcturus (Canongate classics)","review":"It is a funny thing about this book. I read it at least 20 years ago and have not thought of it since. In spite of reading voraciously since then, all types of books, when I chanced on this website and started to browse, this was one of the first books I looked up. It is certainly memorable. It has a quality about it that separates it completely from not only any science fiction I've read, but also from other literature. It is a dreamlike quality that makes the story seem very real but just a little &quot;off&quot; our normal consciousness. Even the names are evocative but of what? The other reviewers capture this flavor quite well.This is a definite recommendation."},{"Title":"A voyage to Arcturus (Canongate classics)","review":"The book is a classic of fantastic literature. In Blakean tradition, with A Voyage to Arcturus, Lindsay has invented his own mythology to express his ideas, revealing a powerful artistic imagination. The story follows Maskull's journey through an alien landscape that reflects the tension between Apollonian and Dionysian forces within humanity. Lindsay's work is a true original. By integrating his own philosophical ideas with those of Nietzsche and Blake, in A Voyage to Arcturus, Lindsay provides a meditation on what he considers the driving forces of the human condition -- pleasure and pain."},{"Title":"A voyage to Arcturus (Canongate classics)","review":"A book that sends you to another world is a fantasy. A book that propels you like a cannonball into a surreal world that's like a combination of Dante's Divine Comedy, Burroughs' Naked Lunch and Vance's Planet of Adventure is something altogether different, maybe unnameable. A Voyage to Arcturus is quite simply a metaphysical voyage to an incredibly alien landscape that raises in its forms both the questions and the answers about the nature of reality, our perceptions, our senses (especially as regards to pleasure and pain) and role of God in all those layers of reality. Hints of Gnosticism, Calvinism, asceticism and hedonism waft across the pages of this tale like a fine perfume.Prepare to be amazed, horrified and bewildered by the sights you will see, the landscapes you will tread, and the parts of your mind that will open. A remarkable work only weakened somewhat by a rather superfluous beginning and some awkward phrasing."},{"Title":"A voyage to Arcturus (Canongate classics)","review":"Lindsay offers an imaginative diatribe against a world hopelessly blind to it's true spiritual nature in A VOYAGE TO ARCTURUS. The \\"hero\\" is Maskull, but he represents Everyman, and the world he visits is Tormance, which is Earth in disguise, stripped of it's nuances and complexities. Tormance is a world of physical and psychological extremes circling the larger of the twin suns comprising the star Arcturus.Maskull is on a quest for the truth, but it's more a result of compulsion than volition. He and his companion Nightspore are summoned by the mysterious Krag to make the journey because Surtur has returned to Tormance and compels them to follow him. Who Surtur is will be discovered much later, as will the identities of Krag and Nightspore. Maskull arrives on the south of Tormance alone and somehow knows he must head north. His ultimate goal will be to find the realm of Muspel, under the mysterious blue Alppain sun, where Surtur's true nature will be revealed. Until he gets there, he must deal with a world ruled by Crystalman whom many confuse with Surtur. This world is dominated by the blazing white sun called Branchspell. On his journey, he will interact with various strange inhabitants of Tormance who will in some instances strengthen and help guide him, but in others, frustrate him and expose his human weaknesses. It is all a necessary preparation for his ultimate test.Lindsay tries to offer us some strong medicine for the spirit and he couches it in beautifully descriptive prose. This is really not a book for Science Fiction or Fantasy buffs, although it could be categorized as belonging to those genres. It uses some wildly original ideas to philosophize about the nature of humanity, like Dante did in The Divine Comedy or Swift did in GULLIVER'S TRAVELS, but on a considerably less ambitious scale. The characters are purely symbolic so you can't truly identify with them, and Lindsay's basic view on Man's nature is pessimistic. You have to buy into his philosophy to truly appreciate this book."},{"Title":"A voyage to Arcturus (Canongate classics)","review":"One of the most original works in all of literature.

However, I certainly can say that I concurr and recommend highly that everyone read this book. The author is a kind of alchemist, weaving a tale that is compelling, hypnotic, perplexing and enchanting at the same time. I have come to believe that this story is an allegory - of the soul's innate craving for the pure, untainted vision of truth and reality that seems to forever elude it, while the wrapping of the mind and its manifold deceitful mechanisms lead him on to ever-changing phenomena and illusion. You will not remain untouched by this book, if you read it, as one reviewer has aptly stated. A very sad footnote is that author David Lindsay commited suicide at an early age, and thus the world was robbed of a brilliant writer who could cast a spell over his readers and make one truly consider the very nature of what we call \\"reality\\". Don't miss this one!"},{"Title":"A voyage to Arcturus (Canongate classics)","review":"This is among the most amazing books I have ever read. Some professional reviewers have complained about Lindsay's writing style as being too rough. That is like complaining that Michaelangelo did not smooth the rough edges off his sculpture &quot;Men Tearing Themselves Out of Stone&quot;. Lindsay's vision is far more important than his style, but I think his style heightens the effect. As one reads the book it becomes apparent that all of this is &quot;going on in his head&quot;, and that is the significance of the name Maskull; but is there really anything in a skull. It might as well be said that only what happens is real, and the thoughts of the hero are merely reflections of reality.This book is very complex. Many different levels or layers of meaning. Lindsay was indeed a genius of a high order. I have read others of his books, which have been unfavourably compared with this one. They do not quite approach this one, but all of them I have read are good."},{"Title":"A voyage to Arcturus (Canongate classics)","review":"A Voyage to Arcturus has zoomed into one of my top 5 books of all time. This is not regular sci-fi, fantasy, or fiction. It is jam-packed with philosophy but never boring. \\"Typical Epic Voyage\\" as one reviewer wrote? Not in the least. I do agree that the tone shares some similarity with Lewis's space trilogy, but Lindsay's book is a complete original.The main character leaves Victorian-style Earth and journeys to a planet orbiting the star Arcturus. There he finds his body has changed and he gains and loses different, novel sensory organs while encountering the unusual people who live there. Just as you might expect if you gained a new sensory organ (eg: what if you could sense electric currents like fish, or had sonar like a bat?) his outlook drastically changes with each encounter and the drastically contrasting ideologies of the natives. This is on a background of a potentially menacing god-like character and rapidly changing ideas of what it is to be male and female, young and old.Have I made it sound a bit weird? It is. And also completely engrossing, extremely well-written, and so clever! I loved it."},{"Title":"A voyage to Arcturus (Canongate classics)","review":"A waiter bringing food might say be careful this plate is hot, a reviewer of this book might warn be careful this book may burn you. Maskull, a man longing for adventures, accepts an invitation from Krag, an acquaintance of his friend Nightspore, to travel to the planet Tormance something Maskull doubts is even possible. They are to meet at a Scottish observatory called Starkness and depart from there. When Maskull and Nightspore get there Krag has not arrived yet so Nightspore leads Maskull to a spot on the shore some miles off where they hear the Drum Taps of Sorgie and tells him that if he hears it again he is to \\"try always to hear it more and more distinctly.\\" Krag finally shows up and they depart in a 'torpedo of crystal' propelled by Arcturian back rays. Maskull sleeps on the trip and wakes up alone on Tormance and faces many adventures as each time he thinks he has come upon the truth one lie after another is exposed as Krag and Shaping vie for his attention. Unlike most books \\"A Voyage to Arcturus\\" defies genre. It reminds of Buddhist and Gnostic themes yet pushes beyond either in this original novel. Illusion and reality, pleasure and pain are the main combatants here with pain as a kind of beacon from another world. Pain is represented by the character named Krag. Shaping also known as Crystalman is a sort of demiurge that has distorted the light of Muspel, Norse world of fire is M&uacute;spellsheimr, creating a world of illusion. \\"They say that when the world was born, Krag was born with it -- a spirit compounded of those vestiges of Muspel which Shaping did not know how to transform.\\" Alan Moore writes in his introduction to the excellent Savoy edition, \\" Naturally, the sensate creatures trapped in Crystalman's endlessly multiplying world of shape and dazzle are conditioned by their habitat, their solar system a gigantic Skinner box, its population become thrill addicted rodents, nuzzling repeatedly against the pleasure levers, seeking their reward.\\" I think reading this book every now and then acts as a kind of purgative to the reader living in our modern pleasure seeking world. A reader of \\"A Voyage to Arcturus\\" who was impressed and influenced by Lindsay's masterpiece was C. S. Lewis who later wrote: \\"Pain plants the flag of truth in the fortress of the rebel heart.\\" Oh and the Drum Taps of Sorgie they turn out to be Krag (pain) dealing hammer blows onto the human heart.

Here though, it clashes, and Lindsay risks loosing his reader before truly commencing his story. Why did he do this? To place the normality of early Edwardian England at odds with eerie Tormance perhaps, and so emphasise the illusion of everyday life? If so, it's a risky strategy, which must have put off many a reader.Lindsay's purpose appears to be not merely to entertain, which he does well, but to illustrate a Gnostic world view, where the world and its attractions are seen as the realm of evil, with truth lying beyond, entirely separate and distant.

For the most part, the main character is just going from place to place having brief adventures that present obvious moral characteristics. Each little adventure is quickly left behind and forgotten, simply because the main character has a compulsion to head North. Its a poorly strung collection of nearly unrelated events that culminates in, what a bit of reading has clarified for me, is a poor expression of some very ancient and ridiculous religious ideas (gnosticism, as it turns out--if you don't think its fair to call a religious sort of idea ridiculous, read about gnosticism before you get upset).

I read this book several times in my 20's and was struck (not literally) by the intensity of the experience of being drawn in to such an imaginative and desperate journey which to me implied that the author was as lost as I, but wasmuch better at expressing his condition (couched {groan} as a novel) than most people could ever hope to. The fact that he later committed suicide means that his desperation finally overcame him.

It was very strange.Also, I did not understand the ending. I won't say what happened because I don't want to spoil it, but I just had trouble figuring out exactly what happened.

Unfortunately Lindsay seems to be trying to go overboard with the weirdness, and that diminishes the effect of the text somewhat. It is well written, and the pacing when necessary is brisk.

The final chapter too doesn't really seem to mesh with the rest of the book. After hearing a lot of good things about this book, I really wanted to rate it higher, but Lindsay failed in my eyes to fully draw me into his world.

I was overwhelmed by it then, but a year or two later when I went to reread it, the book had disappeared. (Doubtless an unreturned loan to a friend.) When I learned the book was back in print, and in several aditions, I wasted little time in buying it. I now realize that I was right the first time. The novel is (at least!) a minor masterpiece.I will not get into details of the plot which centers on a journey of a man from earth across Tormance, a fictional planet circling the fictional two suns that make up the star we know as Arcturus. There, he searches for truth and has a series of fantastic adventures--some of them murderous--that entail the growth of extra limbs and organs whle his beliefs change as violently as his body.It was only the edition I have (Wilder Publications) that made me hesitat before giving this bood the five stars it richly deserves. The many misprints include misspelled words, sentences with words missing, poor punctuation, etc. etc. One major typographical stumbling block was having hyphens the same length as dashes. The most curious flaw, however, was placing the name, Frank R. Stockton at the top of left hand pages facing the book's title which was correctly placed at the top of the right-handed pages. A little research told me that Stockton wrote fantasies for children--which probably explains the suggestion at the front of this edition that parents discuss with their children how views on race have changed since the book was written. An otherwise strange caution since \\"A Voyage To Arcturus\\" is not a children's book nor is there any mention of race in it.In summing up, I would say do get this magnificent novel, but try to avoid the Wilder Pubications edition. There are many other editions listed in Amazon and they can't all be as flawed as this one."},{"Title":"A voyage to Arcturus (Canongate classics)","review":"It would be hard to add much to the foregoing reviews.

I'm merely chiming in. Anyone who knows me knows of this book, I have bought well over a dozen copies of Arcturus and given away many to family and friends. I have grown used to either confused or lukewarm responses to the book, sadly enough. In fact I have not personally met anyone that has been as profoundly moved by this book as myself (although it seems many of the reviewers here share my passion just as my mentor Harold Bloom does). I do not take Lindsay's fantasy to be the secret to life or a quest after meaning though, it is rather anti-Tolkien, anti-Lewis in the extreme. It is a complete purgation, a death march, an utter seering of the soul. I once heard that the initiation into gnosticism begins with a sense of profound loneliness and terror, Lindsay might be said to help bring about such an initiation. Many turn away from the book in confusion or only mild amusement with hasty dismissals. I can only speak for myself that this has an utter profound effect on me--there are moments here that are as great as Dante's Inferno, as Shelley's The Triumph of Life and as Robert Browning's excellent poem Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came."},{"Title":"A voyage to Arcturus (Canongate classics)","review":"I first read VOYAGE TO ARCTURUS at the age of 18, having just been thrust out of my parents' house and without any definite prospects for where or how I was going to live. VOYAGE paralleled on a vastly symbolic, transcendental plane, my personal schism between familiar reality and the complete unknown.It took me many years and several readings to partially categorize this tale-- which I now consider an Allegory as allegory is really meant to be, alive on multiple levels of inquiry, and primarily a \\"Gnostic\\" variety of story-- like THE MATRIX, THE TRUMAN SHOW, or EXISTENZ-- with the notion that the reality we know is false and that we must escape to our true supernal or authentic nature, which is being held prisoner by a manipulating or evil intelligence for its own ends.Lindsay was a man driven almost mute by the force of his vision-- his novels are difficult to read because in addition to having little talent as a novelist, he was attempting to render in words what can barely be grasped, let alone described-- what early ages would call \\"the Greater Mysteries\\". VOYAGE TO ARCTURUS succeeds best of them all, probably because only its incredible range of allegorical transformations and completely unearthly settings can begin to encompass such concepts in tangible form. This is the challenge of visionary art or poetry as well.Lindsay threw together words and concepts together to create startling impressions and clumsy though many are, they are not as easy to create as they look. Consider also the apparent roots-- the parts that form each word or name are like signals pointing to essential aspects of the allegorical character,often beyond what is actually happening at the time. \\"Tormance\\", the planet orbiting Arcturus that the action occurs on: \\"torture\\" or \\"torment\\" and \\"romance\\". \\" \\"Gleameil\\"-- \\"gleam\\" and \\"veil\\"... \\"Sullenbode\\"...\\"Wombflash Forest\\".. \\"Faceny\\"-- \\"facet\\", \\"fascinate\\"... \\"Oceaxe\\"-- \\"ocean\\" and \\"axe\\"... \\"Dreamsinter\\"-- \\"dreams\\" and \\"inter\\", with the hint of the macabre appearing, as so frequently, with the juxtaposition. Try also to sound them out-- these names and words have a peculiar music that is wholly unique and is part of the overall weird enchantment of the tale.As a visionary artist myself I have long appreciated the special challenge this novel has given me to visualize a metaphorical reality, a meaningful ecosystem of allegories that express both spiritual ideas and driving emotions in such beguiling unfamiliar and vivid shapes. I believe that VOYAGE TO ARCTURUS would indeed make a fine movie-- an ANIMATED one. But it would have to be done at a level of technique that the industry is only starting to develop for such purposes. No live-action movie, even with CGI help, could capture its essence appropriately.On the other hand, experimental techniques pushed to the limit, plus a consistent level of artistic intention-- and a complete divorcement from Hollywood could make it happen. Where the backing would come from, who knows? But if done right, this would make a film that would not only become a cult classic for SF and campuses but could perhaps change in some way, filmmaking as we approach it today."},{"Title":"A voyage to Arcturus (Canongate classics)","review":"I read Maskull's journey many years ago and have just rediscovered it via my kindle. The journey through Tormance, a planet of the star Arcturus, takes the earth-dwelling Maskull on an incredible journey toward Muspel. It is a complex and intriguing journey of discovery. An epic tale that has been categorized as science fiction fantasy but seems to go beyond either genre.I went searching for this classic after readingExiled: Autumn's Peril-Book One (The Chronicles of Caleath)and the rest of Rosalie Skinner's books. The epic quest and the unpredictable plot reminded me of Maskull's journey, which I enjoyed just as much. On withdrawl, I dove back into Journey to Arcturus, reported as being the inspiration for C.

But at the same time hard to follow the plot and its meaning."},{"Title":"A voyage to Arcturus (Canongate classics)","review":"'A Voyage to Weirdness' is a more apt title for Lindsay's classic. There is a lot I didn't like about this book though the ending did redeem it somewhat. However, it took over 200-something pages to get there and I'm still not sure if it was worth my time.For one thing, it seemed as though Lindsay made his world as weird as possible, not for any special meaning, but simply for the sake of weirdness. That's fine in itself, but it worked to make everything pretty meaningless on the whole. Consequently, it was slow plodding along through paragraphs of description that seemed to go pretty much nowehere and have no relevance to the main story. Parts of the world sounded downright juvenile and made me wonder if I was reading a book adaptation of a sci-fi B-movie.Another problem I found was that, even though I can bring Lindsay's world to mind down to the minute details, I found myself cold towards the characters themselves. Maskull himself had no redeeming qualities to actually make me feel for his plight and by the end of the novel I found I had forgotten all about him. This may have been intended, but it the whole novel left no impact on me.Despite all this, however, the ending was unexpected and did make me slightly glad I read through it to the end. Lindsay's was clearly intending a message with this novel, but I don't believe he completely succeeded at it. When taking as a whole, this novel could have been exceptionally better and much more remarkable if Lindsay could have stuck more to the meaning of his story instead of bogging it down with endlessly weird descriptions that went absolutely nowhere."},{"Title":"A voyage to Arcturus (Canongate classics)","review":"I was handed this book years ago by a friend at school, who had in turn been given it by another. I read it, passed it on to a friend and later found out that it was then read by several others before being lost without trace. It is an unforgettable book, extraordinarily rich in imaginative and descriptive brilliance, about one man's journey through a far-away world which may in fact be the mirror of his own psyche. While the writing can be at times turgid, it is more often inspired; the author has a great gift for description, and the various tableaux he describes remind one of the best bits of Tolkien, although perhaps even more evocative. But this is no &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;. Rather than enacting a classic tale of epic heroism, Lindsay takes us on a gripping journey through a planet where good and evil are not only locked in struggle, but cloaked in impenetrable disguise. It is the hero Maskull's task to unmask the truth, and thereby attain his own redemption. The real genius of this book lies in its ability to defy prediction. At no stage does the reader have the slightest inkling of where the narrative might be heading, or how the threads might eventually tie up; but one is nevertheless compelled to read on. A definite must-read for all sci-fi and fantasy buffs; would also be enjoyed by visual artists, psychoanalysts, anyone interested in pagan religion, or just anyone who likes great descriptive writing."},{"Title":"A voyage to Arcturus (Canongate classics)","review":"David Lindsay is one of the twentieth century's greatest and least appreciated geniuses. This, his first book, is also his best known, although it's debatable whether the science-fiction/Tolkien-fantasy crowd, into whose hands it has generally fallen, quite have the measure of its overarching ambition and audacious vision. Tormance, a planet of the star Arcturus, is a young world where raw particles of life flow and are trapped in the creations of Crystalman, the god of the visible world. Maskull, a human being, comes to Tormance from Earth and embarks upon an epic journey towards Muspel, the source of all genuine life, which is in constant danger from Crystalman's vulgar machinations. Maskull meets a succession of characters whose various philosophies and points of view represent the stages of his own spiritual progress, until finally he sheds his &quot;Maskull&quot; (mask, shell) self and awakes to the truth which Crystalman's world keeps hidden. The fight goes on, a fight in which pain is an ally and &quot;nothing will be done without the bloodiest blows.&quot; This summary cannot begin to convey the complexity of this work nor do justice to its vast scope or the astounding variety of its invention. As he travels through the book's epic landscapes Maskull constantly mutates, growing new eyes, new arms and new organs, seeing new colours and encountering a member of a third sex. Almost everyone he meets soon dies, killed either by Maskull himself or by their own inability to evolve as he does - bloodiest blows indeed. Lindsay's prose is pedestrian and often clumsy, but always clear and never verbose; the story moves quickly, its most complex ideas given concrete shape rather than conveyed through abstract discussion. A Voyage to Arcturus is neither science fiction nor fantasy, but a vision in words, as raw, bleak and powerful as a Scottish mountain. The problems it raises are deathly serious and forever immediate."},{"Title":"A voyage to Arcturus (Canongate classics)","review":"David Lindsay's &quot;A Voyage to Arcturus&quot; is difficult to categorize. The book has been labeled &quot;Science Fiction/Fantasy,&quot; but it is much more. The novel's hero/Everyman Maskull starts out on a journey to the planet Tormance, but is quickly separated from his two traveling companions. Maskull's journey takes him on an unusual search for the discovery of the truths of the planet and of his own being. He meets several unusual but memorable characters who are so interesting they could each become the subjects of their own novels. The entire book deals with a search for the truth and the struggle between good and evil...and it's not always easy to distinguish which character is on which side.This is a vast over-simplification of the story. The novel is rich, bold, and imaginative. The reader has absolutely no idea what is about to happen next as the story moves. I found the unpredictability (especially in light of current novels) very refreshing. Several reviewers are hoping for a film version of the book. Some novels should never reach the screen and this is one of them. First, no studio could produce the special effects necessary to bring the novel to the screen without cheapening the story. Second, I don't want to see George Clooney running around attempting to contemplate the meaning of life while playing a caricature of Maskull. Don't wait for the movie...read the novel and enjoy."},{"Title":"A voyage to Arcturus (Canongate classics)","review":"This is an excellent book, one I have read many times. Five stars for the story. Never have I read it in such a garbled edition, though. Zero stars to Bison Books. Chapter one (which was as far as I got) contained ten typos, some actually changing the meaning of what was going on (&quot;turned and confronted the party&quot; becomes &quot;turned and _comforted_ the party&quot;.) If you haven't read Arcturus, you'll just be confused by textual errors in what is already a demanding book. Nice cover, though."},{"Title":"A voyage to Arcturus (Canongate classics)","review":"Maskull attends a seance. After the usual assurances of genuineness, a spirit does materialize - really. That turns out to be the least of the evening's bizarre events, in which Maskull becomes bound up with someone named Krag and another named Nightspore. Mechanism aside, these beings carry him, willing, to a planet that circles the star Arcturus. The place holds many mysteries, among them the immanence of the world's Creator and creative forces. And, in Manichaean balance, a destructive demiurge also inhabits and shapes this world.Using a familiar narrative tool, Lindsay marches Maskull through different zones of this world, each one under the influence of some different intangible. Maskull first lands in a region devoted to - love? generosity? Although the mood is clear in narration, I don't think I know any one English word that captures it. The next territory founds its thinking on self-centeredness. Not quite selfishness, a slightly different thing, but a numbness to the feelings of others offset by active awareness of one's own desires. Next comes a land of duty, though not as simple an urge as that word suggests, followed by others. Physical changes accompany Maskull's entry into each sphere of influence. In the loving place, Maskull sprouts organs that perceive the vital principle in living things. The self-centered place replaces those with a sensory organ that detects how important each thing is to Maskull, and so on through change after change.As he wanders, like Dante traversing the Inferno, Maskull acquires his guiding Beatrice. In fact, he acquires a new one at each border - they often die, often at his hands. But, somehow, his murderous nature in each region arises from the same vicious innocence that a snake displays in crushing a rat, or a cat in tormenting a broken bird.All this just describes the first half of the book, though. The story maintains its subtlety and casual violence of mood as it approaches the godhead. Although the physical descriptions remain concrete, the spiritual transformations become more conflicted and ethereal.The book's contradiction and ambiguity, the vagueness and vividness re-emerge in my own responses to the story. I'm not really sure what I feel about it, except that I feel it very strongly. Lindsay's words imprison sensations that I find familiar, even when I have no name for them, and present them for study. This remarkable story defies easy analysis or even analogy. At the same time, it invites enjoyment with tinges of wonder. Open yourself to it.-- wiredweird"},{"Title":"A voyage to Arcturus (Canongate classics)","review":"&quot;A Voyage to Arcturus&quot; was David Lindsay's first andperhaps best novel (&quot;The Haunted Woman&quot; though more anovella than a novel is also very good). By thestandards of science fiction &quot;Arcturus&quot; is extremely old.It was first published in the 1920s when Lindsay waslate middle aged. Lindsay was a contemporary of JulesVerne and H.G. Wells, yet he could write in a very modern(timeless) style. The novel's age makes properappreciation somewhat problematic. The story starts outslow with the setting in a English gentleman's house withthe characters attending a sceance. The wring style forthis first part of the book is typical ofturn-of-the-century novels and gives no hint of what thereader is about to experience. When the plot moves toScotland and the characters prepare to leave Earth, thereader gets a hint that something magical is about tohappen. However once the plot gets to the planet Tormancethe story undergoes metamorphosis from dull shades of grayto brilliant colors. The reader immediately sees thatLindsay had a genius for writing speculative fiction.However this genius is difficult for a modern reader tofully appreciate because Lindsay had no real scienceficition tradition to draw from (he was creating allof his SF concepts from scratch). Though the novel isentertaining to read as a simple adventure story, it hasincredible depth. The planet Tormance is a world whereGod and Anti-God (like the Gnostic tradition) arecompeting for control of the planet. Both beings goby different names and are symbolized by differentaspects of the planet. For example, Arcturus isportrayed as being a binary star with a large orangestar symbolizing the god Shaping and smaller bluestar symbolizing the god Surtur. Each star has threeprimary colors but share one color. The influence ofthe two gods is subtly color coded throughout the novel.The principle character is named Maskul (Man/Skull).He was approached by the character Krag at the Englishgentleman's sceance and given the opportunity to travelto Tormance with the understanding that he could neverreturn to Earth. Krag's relationship between thedifferent gods of Tormance becomes clear as thestory progresses. After arriving on Tormance, Maskulbegins a journey of discovery as he travels across theplanet. The two gods try to influence Maskul throughvarious means. Maskul's journey is not unlike adetective story. He is basicly trying to unravel totruth about Tormance. However this is no easy matterbecause one of the two gods (the anti-god) is evilincarnate. This god is so wicked that he has madevirture appear to be evil, truth to be lies and himselfseem the genuine god while the true god is a pretender.All of this is done in a story where almost every objecthas two or three different forms of symoblism (some trueand some false). One can read &quot;Arcturus&quot; as a simplestory but the story is so rich that it's better to keepnotes because there is so much going on. &quot;A Voyage toArcturus&quot; is a remarkable story: It's a novel thatalmost no one has read. However it is almost unique andanyone who does read it will be permanently affected byit. David Lindsay made almost no money on this novel.When first published, &quot;Arcturus&quot; was panned in bookreviews and latter remaindered (people in the 1920s werenot ready for it). However this book has never beenout-of-print and will always have a loyal following.Gary A. Allen, Jr."},{"Title":"A voyage to Arcturus (Canongate classics)","review":"My favorite myths are Midas, Prometheus, and Brave New World. I think Arcturus could enter this pantheon, particularly in our age, when we seem only to be able to think in terms of pastiches of myths. We get several different mythical ideas in the novel, and even at the end it's unclear whether a key epiphany is real or merely a \\"take\\" of someone overly influenced by Krag (just as, say, Joiwind's views are a \\"take\\" of someone overly influenced by Crystalman).The ideas of Crystalman and Krag guide the narrative journey. Although at first it's frustrating to get so many accounts of these \\"characters,\\" these shifting accounts reflect how little we know of pleasure and pain, how many disparate experiences we group under these concepts. The Crystalman grin at death reminds me of those great Dickinson lines:The heart loves pleasure firstAnd then release from painAnd then a little anodyneTo ease the sufferingAnd then-if it should beThe will of its inquisitor-The privilege-To die.Likewise, Krag/pain sets the whole narrative in motion, just as we would scarcely move on to higher achievements without pain of dissatisfaction at our present state.I love the idea of all friction, suffering, and pain being caused by the admixture of spirit and matter. The final triumph of materialism would indeed lead us to treat our bodies and moods entirely like machines and output readings; to manipulate each with any device or drug available (and thus to end the mixing of spirit and matter, and to banish all pain). The idea of the world of will created by partial absorption of spirit stream into Krystalman's matter recalls Virgil's account of metempsychosis in Hades in the sixth book of the Aeneid, where Anchises \\"explains the cosmos, death, and the afterlife. A divine spirit sustains the universe; mortal souls are its seeds imprisoned and contaminated by the mortal body:\\"Nor death itself can wholly wash their stains;But long-contracted filth ev'n in the soul remains.The relics of inveterate vice they wear,And spots of sin obscene in ev'ry face appear.For this are various penances enjoin'd;And some are hung to bleach upon the wind,Some plung'd in waters, others purg'd in fires,...But, when a thousand rolling years are past,(So long their punishments and penance last,)Whole droves of minds are, by the driving god,Compell'd to drink the deep Lethaean flood,In large forgetful draughts to steep the caresOf their past labors, and their irksome years,That, unrememb'ring of its former pain,The soul may suffer mortal flesh again.\\"VI. 735-751The Thomistic synthesis of Aristotelianism and Christianity tries to overcome this dualism....to endorse the mutual interdependence of souls and bodies. But of course, this kind of interdependence sometimes feels like imprisonment. (Our manner of) dancing can only exist in a world with gravity-but gravity must feel like a torment to the dancer. Similarly too death is a precondition for (our manner of) life.[I use \\"our manner\\" there very cautiously. The very comprehensibility of deathlessness renders relative our implicit assumption of death as a common fate. One of my favorite ideas in Arcturus is the dependence of our ideas and dispositions on our sense organs. Perhaps if we all had mind-reading \\"sorbs\\" like Joiwind, we'd be capable of achieving her level of empathy. Similarly, organs like those of Oceaxe's might speed us on our way to the brutality and egotism of Iffdawn.]But here's a paradox: what exactly is Krag's mission? Does he \\"pain\\" all beings in order to make them realize that they are-or harbor within them--something \\"higher\\" than material bodies, and the pleasures they enjoy? I think only a Buddhist or Hindu could wish to become one again with the Muspel stream-a nirvana-like state in which all sense of individual consciousness is lost and one merges with all existence. Christian and Muslim theology endorses an afterlife of embodied souls (but, of course, has not reconciled numerous paradoxes...as even Jesus recognized when asked about the place of second and third spouses in an afterlife that seemed to promise to restore not only individuals, but their happiest relations).There's one way in which this book is dated-the persistent identification of woman with matter, and man with spirit. Although the women in the book (Joiwind, Oceaxe, Tydomin, Sullenbode) are strong, they persistently \\"divert\\" the hero from his course (recalling Dido/Aeneas, Circe/Odysseus)."},{"Title":"A voyage to Arcturus (Canongate classics)","review":"The only reason that \\"A Voyage to Arcturus\\" is classified as a science fiction book is that it takes place on another planet that required a rocket ship for our hero to reach it.The fact is Tormance, the planet revolving around the binary star Arcturus, could have easily have been another \\"realm\\" or \\"dimension\\" that could have been accessed by a looking glass or a pair of ruby slippers.This story is basically a philosophical parable is which Lindsay's hero, Maskull, journeys through the world of Tormance in search of the truth. During his travels, he meets several interesting individuals, each of whom represent a different lesson. And as Maskull meets these people, he goes through a series of spiritual transformations that sometimes manifest themselves as physical changes to his body.Lindsay skillfully uses the philosophies of Calvinism, Shamanism and Buddhism (and probably some others, too) to set up some interesting questions. And like all good philosophers, he leaves it to us to determine our own answers.I found his ideas on gender relationships, truth, nature and good and evil to be very thought-provoking.I also had fun trying to read into some of the names he gave his people and places. For instance, a character whose core philosophy is based on self-loathing is called \\"Hator\\" (\\"hater\\"?). Could \\"Tormance\\" refer to a series of \\"torments\\" that one must go through to find the truth? Only the author, who passed away many years ago, knows for sure.Word of warning: I have to agree with the reviewer who complained about this particular edition's proof-reading. There was at least one typo on every other page. Most of them are easy to spot...\\"me\\" is typed as \\"mc\\"...\\"far\\" comes out as \\"fat\\"...etc. But it does make me wonder if any of the errors were subtle enough to change the meaning of the story.This is an enjoyable book that tells an imaginative story and encourages you to think. and I highly recommend it...if you like that sort of thing."},{"Title":"A voyage to Arcturus (Canongate classics)","review":"This book is often classified as science fiction. While this is perhaps appropriate given the fantastical nature of the story, such a categorization is hardly all-encompassing. I have never cared for science fiction at all and this is my all-time favorite book.Others have detailed the plot as well as possible so I will not get into that. I only wish to say that the images from this book are very far-reaching and the messages are virtually innumerable. But the thing that is so marvelous about the way it is put together is that these lessons are not put forth in any kind of straightforward or didactic manner. They are given to the reader however he chooses to take them (well, with just a bit of help from the author). It is definitely one of the least manipulative books I have ever read, and it assumes great intelligence of its reader. This is very refreshing and fairly rare, in my opinion.Some would say this book is not for everyone. I disagree. I think it is for anyone, provided that the reader just puts in a bit of concentration and a whole lot of imagination. It is not a book that can be read in an evening or digested in a week. It can even be slow going at times, given the reader's mood, and it's true that David Lindsay's writing is far from flawless. Yet even with these faults, there is no question in my mind that it is a five-star book. It is the only book to which I come back year after year, just to keep certain parts of my brain open. David Lindsay was a unique and fearless writer and there is no other book quite like this one. (Good luck finding it, I don't even have my own copy, I just borrow the same sad dog-eared copy from the library every year.)"},{"Title":"A voyage to Arcturus (Canongate classics)","review":"A Voyage to Arcturus enjoys an almost unchallenged reputation as an important--albeit little-known--amalgamation of fantasy, science fiction, and philosophy. Some of this intellectual esteem is likely attributable to the book's allegorical style, which makes its themes obvious and easily understood, despite the assertions of its fans that the book is unusually complex or esoteric. In fact, as an allegory, A Voyage to Arcturus is facile by definition, a Gnostic analogue of works like John Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress, complete with symbolic names such as Nightspore, Sullenbode, Tormance, and Maskull.Another likely reason for the book's reputation is the contemporary lack of familiarity with Gnostic systems of thought. Gnosticism is diverse, but in general, it proposes that this world is inferior or fallen and was created by an evil demiurge who is in dualistic conflict with a greater, truer divinity. If you've already read The Other God by Yuri Stoyanov or similar books on religious dualism, or if you have any kind of grounding in ancient theology or the history of sects like the Manichaeans or Cathars, David Lindsay's ideas in A Voyage to Arcturus will seem kind of trite and predictable.On a literary level, even advocates of A Voyage to Arcturus admit to its rudimentary quality. In the afterword to the Bison Books edition, Loren Eiseley lists \\"overdramatic names\\" and \\"rude and awkward\\" prose among the novel's flaws (I would add \\"one-dimensional characters\\" and \\"episodic plotting\\" to that list). Those whom the book has inspired--Harold Bloom, Colin Wilson, Alan Moore, and C.S. Lewis among them--seem primarily interested in its occult and religious aspects, and therefore their literary judgment in this case is suspect.I say all of this not to disparage Lindsay's innovation as a novelist, but as a corrective to the sometimes uninformed and unjustifiably enthusiastic praise that A Voyage to Arcturus has received. What is interesting about Lindsay's novel is how he adapts a Gnostic worldview to a science-fiction landscape, e.g. two suns and creation via trapped matter. Unlike other reviewers, I also found the first few chapters to be intriguing and atmospheric--more so even than the rest of the novel.On the whole, however, A Voyage to Arcturus is a plodding, humorless book. Your time would be better spent reading Elaine Pagels and watching a marathon of original Star Trek episodes.PS -- Here's Colin Wilson from his introduction to the Centipede Press edition of Medusa by E.H. Visiak, who was a friend of Lindsay's: \\"Like Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, Arcturus consists of a series of encounters and adventures. But while Bunyan's characters are allegories of 'worldliness'--Mr. Worldly Wiseman, Giant Despair, and so on--Lindsay's are symbols of philosophical ideas. It sounds boring, yet the sheer power of Lindsay's imagination transforms it into a masterpiece. Again and again his vision leaves us stunned. Having said which, it sounds almost a contradiction to add that Lindsay writes badly, almost amateurishly; but it is regrettably true, and explains why subsequent novels, like Sphinx, The Violet Apple, Devil's Tor and The Witch, are virtually unreadable.\\" Accordingly, if one disagrees with Wilson's judgment of the book as a \\"masterpiece,\\" and also finds Lindsay's treatment of philosophical ideas rather trite compared with more academic works on subjects like Gnosticism, there's little else in A Voyage to Arcturus that makes it worth reading as literature."},{"Title":"A voyage to Arcturus (Canongate classics)","review":"... Contary to what another reviewer says below, Lindsay didn't die young and I'm pretty sure sure he didn't commit suicide (It's many years since I read a very interesting biography, but I think he died from something like a tooth infection that he didn't get seen to properly. I think he was about 69 when he died).Anyway, a *****************ing great book. Precursor and big influence to a lot.

Fortunately for us, the spirit of the Covenanters drifted through the air for centuries, passing by James Hogg and George Macdonald until it alighted in the soul of one David Lindsay, perhaps mistaking him for the poet of the same name from long ago. This is drenched in the Calvinist spirit, but combined with a supremely rare genius wedded to a brilliant imagination. There is no other book like it, simply put. It is science-fiction only in the sense that C. S. Lewis could be said to have written science-fiction. Don't bother to try to figure out who or what the characters represent. Maskull is no more a person than Bunyan's Apollyon was a person. They are all allegorical figures and 17th century allegorical figures at that. This is what a Covenanter would have written if it had been legal in Scotland to write fiction in circa 1680. It was on a dark evening long ago that I was treading through the snow and entered the Georgetown Library. I browsed the science-fiction section and this book caught my eye. It was the edition with an introduction by Colin Wilson. I settled into a comfy chair and read the intro.

He wrote perhaps the greatest underground novel of the 20th Century. He was the biggest literary influence of J.R.R. Tolkien. He was vastly admired by the literary intelligencia of Britain and Europe, including C.S. Lewis.But Lindsay's uncanny masterpiece- A Voyage to Arcturus - sold less than 500 copies, marking him as a bad-risk pariah among publishers, and sentencing him to a life of obscurity and frustration.Today A Voyage to Arcturus still doesn't generate a dime because anyone can download it for free from the Internet. Yet, this book has been named to any number of the \\"The 100 Novels You Must Read\\" lists. It's a work of singular genius. Imagine \\"Lord of the Rings\\" meets \\"Ulysses\\" or perhaps the \\"Odyssey\\" meets \\"Autobiography of a Yogi.\\" Reading it is like taking peyote while sitting in Zen meditation.The book involves the journey of a man by the name of Maskull (mask-shell?) who attends a typical early 20th Century-style s&eacute;ance which turns out to be not so typical. At the s&eacute;ance he meets two mysterious men, Krag and Nightspore, who invite him on a journey to another planet in a far-away star system. The planet is Tormance which orbits the star Arcturus. On Tormance, Maskull embarks on a dream-like journey through the deep reaches and layers his own psyche, but also through the fundamental nature of reality and consciousness.Sounds pretty deep, doesn't it? And so it is. This is not an easy read; it's never predictable, but unlike, say, Finnegan's Wake, it's not just a mish-mash of super avante garde literary esoterica. A Voyage to Arcturus has a logical structure leveraging a transcendental narrative that both makes sense and keeps you rocked off base at the same time. This is not a book designed to make you comfortable while it transports you through a sense of wonderment. It's not airy-fairy, New Agey feel good fair - it's better than that!This is a masterpiece that will jolt you off your comfort zone.

A third of the way into his journey, Maskull encounters a violently sexual woman, murders her husband, demands her obedience, and then has her sing a song while they travel. Its \\"words were pure nonsense--or else their significance was too deep for him\\" (113). The same can well be said of this entire book. A Voyage to Arcturus is a fever dream of exploration, metaphor, and metaphysics, but its dry voice is often its undoing, removing the reader too far from its universal aspirations. Lindsay's voice is so distant and dry that not even his vibrant landscape can enliven it--but that landscape is vibrant, alien, and thought-provokingly strange, with a sprinkling of images that linger in the imagination. His protagonist is alternately brutal and blank, with a changing character that reflects all but encapsulates none--he's a figure, not a person, and offers little for the reader to grasp on to. These aspects create an unexpectedly sterile story, one that's too easy to put down and to find distance from, although it's otherwise remarkably easy to read despite its density. It also enables Lindsay to reach an uneasy balance between exploring his concepts and leaving that exploration to the reader: not one that encourages reader involvement and internalization, but one that often remains at a cool distance and leaves the reader unmoved.Yet Voyage is in its way a success. It reads almost like poetry, and can be approached in the same way: by skating over it, bamboozled but affected and intrigued, or by digging into and dissecting it in the attempt to make sense of its madness. Clute's strong introduction to this imprint is an aid towards the latter goal, but even taken on its own the novel's final pages are sufficiently strong to cap off the story with something solid, if not simple. There's nothing simple to be found here, but there is plenty in the way of rich food for thought--sometimes too rich, sometimes as stale as the book is dated, sometimes made unsatisfying by the book's determination to deny its own conclusions, but an promising cornucopia nonetheless. I found A Voyage to Arcturus to be a long, slow, strange journey, but on the whole it's one I'm glad to have taken: cerebral to the point of dry, but still intriguing and wholly original, this may not be pleasure reading but it is worth picking up. I recommend the particular edition I read (Bison Frontiers of Imagination from the University of Nebraska Press) with certain caveats, however: the introduction is strong, but I counted 20 typos and even from a small press, that's unacceptable."},{"Title":"A voyage to Arcturus (Canongate classics)","review":"i first read this in the 1960's when i was reading 4 to 5 books a week...mostly science fiction.

Lindsay's sense of acosmic dualism, Good and Evil fighting for Man's soul, is at times almost Manichaean in its intensity. Harold Bloom's 1979 novel &quot;A Flight to Lucifer&quot; is a direct lift of Lindsay's earlier work, a sort of pale academic misprision of the luminous original. Read them both and see for yourself the difference between a Surtur and a Shaping!"},{"Title":"A voyage to Arcturus (Canongate classics)","review":"Little known by other than connoisseurs of the strange and mysterious, this odyssey of the questing human spirit is well worth the patience it takes to cope with the opening chapters, which lumber considerably as the author prepares us for the meat of the story. But once our characters reach Tormance - a planet circling the star Arcturus - the adventure begins in earnest, in a world where the spiritual takes physical form, and our hero Maskull battles a zoo of tempters and diverse philosophies as he strives reach the Blue Sun, and free his soul from the dreariness of everyday life.The early chapters remind me of a device sometimes used by H.G. Wells and Joseph Conrad, of assembling a group of interesting or intelligent people in a Victorian soiree, and, having made them comfortable with a cheering drink, confounding even their sophistication with an amazing yarn. Try The Time Machine, Victory, or Lord Jim; but in those the technique is used throughout, and is not at odds with story. Here though, it clashes, and Lindsay risks loosing his reader before truly commencing his story. Why did he do this? To place the normality of early Edwardian England at odds with eerie Tormance perhaps, and so emphasise the illusion of everyday life? If so, it's a risky strategy, which must have put off many a reader.Lindsay's purpose appears to be not merely to entertain, which he does well, but to illustrate a Gnostic world view, where the world and its attractions are seen as the realm of evil, with truth lying beyond, entirely separate and distant. In term of using characters to represent spiritual or moral forces, it compares well with Pilgrims Progress.

Now, some 30+ years & at least two dozen re-readings later, I can at last begin to fully appreciate the depth & immense power of Lindsay's work.\\"Allegory\\" to be sure, although that word hardly does the work justice, with its intimations of fustiness & neat symbols all in a row.

Aside from being one of the greatest SciFi novels ever written, it's also a powerful philosophical work, with a painful objectivity that religious scriptures lack. 'Arcturus takes the age-old dualistic conflict theme of the typical religious epic and turns it on it's side, making the main character the focus of a struggle between not one but two selfish, malevolent and powerful beings. Both &quot;gods&quot; claim to have humanity's best interests at heart, the one brutal and cruel, the other deceptive and devious.

When I saw a re-issuance I eagerly ordered it.The 2007 Wilder Publications issue is a travesty.1. The Cover is irrelevant and has no correspondence to Lindsay's text.2. The incredible number of typos and misprintings is disturbing, disruptive and misleading.3. The typeface is a catastrophe, with nearly-identical letter and word spacings.4. The book begins with an irrelevant publisher's admonition that has no correspondence to Lindsay's text.5. The author is named on every facing page as Frank R. Stockton: the Methodist minister who crafted \\"The Lady and the Tiger\\" short story. Did Wilder Press publish that too? Is David Lindsay's name on another book?and more ...I also bought the DVD to my great disappointment. The 1973 production featured an appallingly bad screenplay (converted to a Haight-Ashbury style), pre-school Claymation-like creatures, infantile lenswork, and crassly misinterpreted over-the-top direction. 1973 was the year that brought us Francois Truffaut's \\"Day for Night\\", if you need a reference to the era's film sensibilities and standards.

If that's what you're looking for in a book then you might enjoy it, but otherwise you're likely to be very frustrated and feel like you've paid for promotional material. The book starts out fairly well but gets worse and worse as it goes along. In the first few chapters the text is is interspersed with quotes and examples from well-known comedians. Most of these are really funny and support the text well. As the book goes on it increasingly begins to refer to one of the co-authors in the third person, use her jokes in the break-out boxes, quote her, refer to her techniques and praise her techniques and abilities. This is fine once or twice but it soon starts feeling like self-promotion and becomes really obnoxious. By the end of the book it becomes very clear that the whole book is, first and foremost, a pitch to hire Karyn Ruth for events, as a humor coach, etc. I was extremely frustrated realizing that I had essentially paid her to advertise to me. This situation is made worse by the fact that the co-author/comedian in question really doesn't seem to be very funny, especially in comparison with the people quoted earlier on. Now I fully realize that each person has their own sense of humor, but to me Karyn Ruth White is only marginally funny.

I certainly have faith (following their advice) that it gets easier in the long run.

They are not trite morality tales, nor are they pedantic sermon illustrations. While some scholarship has claimed that they are stories of everyday life, parables are far more ambiguous and surreal; they make us uncomfortable with our images of God and our understandings of society.This book is in two parts. The first, shorter one explains the parables in general. Buttrick describes the background of parables and how they stand within a rich tradition of Jewish rhetoric and theology. He criticizes individualistic interpretations, and provides some alternatives which make Jesus' words seem much more compelling. He also provides a mini-handbook on preaching parables, some of which readers of his earlier _Homiletic_ will recognize, but which stands out as an especially good way to approach the telling of parables.The second part, the larger section of the book, is a parable-by-parable analysis. Buttrick's exegesis is not only good, it's a fun read. With some parables he provides sample sermons and critiques which are enjoyable lessons in sermon construction themselves. As in _Homiletic_, it is easy to notice how tightly interwoven are Buttrick's theory of preaching, his theological perspective, and his approach to Biblical interpretation. This is &quot;Worldly Preaching&quot; at its best."},{"Title":"Speaking Parables: A Homiletic Guide","review":"Arguably David Buttrick is the finest homilitician in the United States.

Early December, 1941, finds him in Tokyo just before the bombing of Pearl Harbor, running the Happy Paris club and struggling to maintain his relationship with his beautiful and emotional mistress, Michiko, who also works in the club, playing the juke box. With talk of war everywhere, Harry is intent on leaving. But how? And can he, using his cunning and knowledge of politics, con his adopted country out of fatal combat with the powerful America? And escape the honor bound military man, Ishigami, who's stalking him with a mind poisoned by past wrongs and a sword bent on revenge?While DECEMBER 6 does not live up to GORKY PARK, and while Harry Niles is no match for Arkady Renko, Martin Cruz Smith's latest effort is stamped with his distinctive use of details. His prose is clean and reflective, never coarse or unfinished or abrasive. The plot is not linear but rather slips back and forth, weaving time, place, and characters into a novel that some will find confusing, others beautiful.Me, I ended up somewhere between confused and awed. Smith's touch is magic, but the sheer volume of research included in DECEMBER 6 made it at times read more like a school paper than a novel. One paragraph, which detailed some gruesome beheadings, managed to stretch more than two pages. Plus, during some points Harry Niles came across as unemotional and detached, although I was aware of churning undercurrents. The dialogue disappointed me as well. Still, I felt the ending was a fitting finale to an intriguing story of love, violence, and politics.A newcomer to Smith's writing may be overwhelmed by this fact packed thriller, but Smith's fans, as well as anyone interested in wartime Japan, will find DECEMBER 6 absorbing and thought provoking."},{"Title":"December 6: A Novel","review":"Martin Cruz Smith composes a complex and fantastic story surrounding December 6th in Japan seen through the eyes of roguish American entrepreneur Harry Niles. Niles, a Japanophile, was raised according to local customs by missionary parents and spent most of his life in Japan. While his parents were out preaching Christianity to an unwilling flock, Harry was minded by his often inebriated uncle. In other words he was running wild through the streets of Tokyo's pleasure district, Asakusa. He would spend time picking pockets and running errands for the girls of a local dance hall. Although considered a gaijin (foreigner) and kept at somewhat of a distance, he forged many important and lasting friendships with his group of mates.Fast forwarding, Harry is now a gambler and the owner of the Happy Paris, a nightclub with his fingers in many illicit activities. With the winds of war blowing, as an American Harry realizes that he'll have to flee Japan. Promised a seat on a plane out of Tokyo by Japanese big shots, he must first put his vast affairs in order. He must skip out on his Japanese mistress, Michiko, a suicidal and beautiful Communist sympathizer. He must break ties with his paramour, the British ambassador's wife. All the while he is being pursued by a fanatical and homicidal colonel who fancies himself as a samurai and seeks vengeance against a slight perpetrated by Niles.Niles also has conned the Japanese Navy into believing that desperately needed oil shipments have been diverted by the U.S. to a secret storage area in Hawaii. Not wishing to see his beloved Japan drawn into a conflict it cannot win against the U.S., he unwittingly helps push the attack on Pearl Harbor.Smith creates a kaleidoscope of action against the backdrop of pre-war Japan in a manner that keeps the reader in suspense till the very end. This was a very nicely crafted novel."},{"Title":"December 6: A Novel","review":"Harry Niles is rarely at rest. Life has offered too many distractions for him to pause and reflect. Cruz Smith has drawn him as a man seemingly devoid of values - opportunist, womanizer, manipulator. If Harry was truly that simple, we would be unlikely to follow him through his complex life or along the twists of Tokyo's back alleys. The son of Baptist missionaries, his childhood allowed him opportunity to become virtually Japanese. He played &quot;the 47 Ronin&quot; with schoolmates, keeps his living quarters impeccably Japanese, when even his neighbours maintain a &quot;Western&quot; room, has a Japanese lover and is fluent in the language. He even addresses a businessmen's club extolling Japan's desire to oust Western imperialists from Asia. But he knows war is imminent, and he's keen to know the initial target. It's his mission.Smith presents a story deeply researched and fluently expressed. There's never a dull moment, even during the flashbacks to Harry's youth. He becomes a hustler early, attracted to the &quot;floating world&quot; of Tokyo's theatre, art and gambling circles. These many facets of underworld life gain him entrance to a wide cross-section of a society distrustful of &quot;gaijins&quot; - foreign barbarians. Harry encounters Tojo, plays poker with Yamamoto, watches the con of a scientist looking for military support, and money. On the other hand, there's the nagging sensation that Harry has another agenda. He has suffered much at the hands of Japanese, and will endure more if war comes. He tries to maintain his &quot;cool&quot; even at the expense of dignity.The modern &quot;thriller&quot; is only mildly concerned with characterisation or even plot. Harry becomes Cruz Smith's vehicle for showing off his research. That's not a fault, but the unprepared reader can be overwhelmed. Smith has detailed prewar Japanese life, both civilian and military, high and low, to an amazing degree. He understands the theatre, woodblock art production, military attitudes and the impact of America's embargoes on pre-war Japan. In a surprise flash, Cruz Smith even dredges up Archbishop James Ussher's pinpointing the date of the onset of the Biblical Flood. He uses this point to give Harry the edge in a gambling dispute. Now that's research!Books such as this are an escape. You tuck away your reservations about what's plausible and let yourself sink into the narrative. Turning pages to encounter the next episode, you are caught up in events right along with the protagonist. If the writer is skilled, as Cruz Smith certainly is, distractions are rebuffed as you follow the adventure. Only after the last page is closed do you sit back to consider whether the book reflects any level of reality. No matter. If the author has kept your mind captive through his tale, he's accomplished what he set out to do. Sink yourself into this book. Ignore the little quirks of impossibility and enjoy a fine story. It's well written and exciting stuff. Never mind that you know how it will turn out."},{"Title":"December 6: A Novel","review":"Looking for a novel that will entertain, enlighten and educate? You'll find it here in Martin Cruz Smith's intelligent and engrossing story of Tokyo on the eve of Pearl Harbour. Centered by the enigmatic Harry Niles, the story gives the reader insight into what it may have been like to have been raised as an American in Japan prior to the war. Niles character, similar in many ways to Rick Blain in Casablanca, walks a thin and dangerous line in trying to sort out his feelings for a very volatile Japanes woman, the friendships he developed growing up and his loyalty to the US.The novel is extremely well researched and keeps the reader guessing till the end. Well worth your time."},{"Title":"December 6: A Novel","review":"On the eve of the Japanese sneak attack against the U.S. at Pearl Harbor, Harry Niles, a roguish expat American adventurer, who had actually been raised in Japan and grown up in a near feral state in the mean streets of the seamy side of Tokyo, finds himself still stuck in that country, angling to get out.All around him the people he knows, both Japanese and foreign, are engaged in an elaborate dance, fearing and expecting war but hoping against hope that they'll be proved wrong. Martin Cruz Smith does a wonderful job of conjuring up this lost pre-war world of depravity, dissolution and Japanese honor, and of creating a sense of what it might have been like to be completely enmeshed in that culture, so alien to us and yet so familiar to his protagonist, Niles.The book actually opens with the young Harry, son of Southern Baptist missionaries and now a Tokyo school boy, fleeing from his schoolmates in an eerie game of 47 Ronin which puts Harry on the receiving end of his friends' relentless blows. As in the best novels, the seeds of the rest of the tale are all found here, for the opening scene will eerily reach its denoument, years later, as Harry struggles for his life amidst a militant Japanese society bent on establishing itself in the modern world. In the meantime, Harry is tied to a lover, a bohemian Japanese woman he barely understands, as he philanders with the British ambassador's wife and struggles to stay afloat amidst the intrigue of competing Japanese factions. The adherents of the Japanese navy and army are in seeming conflict, despite the superficial loyalty to the emperor they share, while the Tokyo police are shadowing him closely.At the same time, a skilled Japanese swordsman, Colonel Ishigami, has returned from the Chinese campaign intent on taking vengeance on Harry for a loss of face he caused him some years before in China where Harry had been doing a little blackmarketeering. There's a secret plan to develop synthetic oil and a question of who may have been stealing oil shipments to the island nation that Harry must decipher for some of the parties and all the while he's got to nail down a way to get out of the country, without giving his exit plans away to a government that wants to keep him there and a lover who threatens to kill him if he goes.This is a deep and complex tale and one that is compelling from beginning to end. For a first class adventure, in the old film noir Humprhey Bogart mold, you won't find better. I don't usually offer glowing praise about the books I read like this, but when they hold me to them and keep calling me back till late in the evening, what else can I do? As an author of a very different sort of adventure, The King of Vinland's Saga, about vikings in North America in the eleventh century, I know how hard it can be to keep a story moving with this kind of power. Martin Cruz Smith is an author with much to teach and well worth reading.SWM"},{"Title":"December 6: A Novel","review":"Dec 6 to me is a new version of the Story of the 47 Ronin and how the gestalt of the 47 Ronin plays out as Yamato spirit in pre-WWII Japan. Indeed at the books beginning we find Harry Niles playing the 47 Ronin's \\"evil\\" lord Kira. and appropriately his school mate enemy-friend, Gen plays the heroic Oishi. The general plot of the 47 Ronin is presented early on in Dec 6 and serves well for understanding how the Yamato spirit drives the militant Japanese and the resulting subtle actions and interactions of the characters in the book. M.C. Smith's version of the 47 Ronin shows the horrific consequences of the rigid demands of the Yamato spirit. Ironically it is perhaps best said by Smith's Adm. Yamamoto \\"Whenever I mention oil, the army says not to worry because we Japanese have Yamato spirit. Yamato spirit, Yamato spirit, that's all the army knows. They say Japan is so different, so superior, we will necessarily win. You know, I have seen the cherry trees in Washington, and they are just as beautiful.\\" (December 6; page 147)The writing, characterization and plotting are top notch. Kudos to Martin Cruz Smith.

Here he introduces us to roguish Harry Niles, the prodigal son of American missionaries and owner of the \\"Happy Paris\\", an American jazz-styled bar whose main attraction is the beautiful disk jockey Michiko; Harry's paramour. Harry is caught up in an interesting dilemna, how to flee Japan in the company of his other lover, the British Ambassador's wife, before Emperor Hirohito's military forces launch their surprise attacks on British and American territories in the Pacific and East Asia. He's also been busy conning the Japanese Navy into thinking that Hawaii has secret tanks filled with oil that should have been shipped to Japan. But that's not the least of his worries. A homicidal Japanese colonel, a war hero newly returned from the China front, is in hot pursuit of Harry, hoping to avenge his honor and dignity, which he believes Harry stole one night on the outskirts of Nanking. Harry is a complex, fascinating character, torn between his love for Japanese culture and his American heritage, hoping to prevent a war between both nations. But regrettably, his schemes have led inexcuriably to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, placing both himself and Michiko in grave danger. How Harry manages to resolve these dilemnas is told in a swiftly paced, succinct resolution which will leave the reader breathless. Those interested in learning about life in Japan prior to December 7, 1941 as well as devout fans of Smith's oeuvre will not be disappointed with this well written thriller."},{"Title":"December 6: A Novel","review":"I've only recently discovered Martin Cruz Smith, but he is quickly becoming one of my favorite authors. I found December 6 to be a superb effort on his part. The premise is interesting, if not totally unique. Other reviewers have noted similarities between Harry Niles and Bogart's Rick in &quot;Casblanca.&quot; But the reader knows what Niles does not. The clock is ticking even faster than he knows. Time is running out, and Tokyo on December 7, 1941 is no place for an American to be -- even a Yank who is more Japanese than Western in his outlook.Tension mounts nicely as Harry attempts to wrap up his final affairs and get the hell out of Dodge. But complications continuously arise, making his depature ever more difficult.Is Harry a spy? A con man? A traitor? A hero? Or some combination of each trait?

It was a very good, almost precise description of the times and included an excellent view of the Japanese trend of thought at that time. The author's research about Japan must have been quite extensive and he must have interviewed actual \\"gaijin\\" who lived in Japan at that time.This is a must-read for Japanese even if they didn't like \\"The Rape of Nanking\\" by Iris Chan, which was rather an imprecise and exaggerated picture of the Japanese people during the same time period that is so finely drawn in Smith's \\"December 6.\\""},{"Title":"December 6: A Novel","review":"Many writers today find a successful formula and stick to it... over and over.

The only other Smith books I've read are his Renko detective ones set in Russia but I thought I'd try this since those books are so good.

The old ways of Japan makes you think they were crazy, but beautiful like lovers in a suicide pact. Like Romeo and Juliet. Harry Niles, the son of Japanese missionaries, was brought up by a Japanese nanny, went to Japanese schools, and lived on Tokyo streets. He shouted that he would die for the emperor louder than his classmates. Later he becomes a cynical bar owner and gambler. The plot involves the machinations of exotic characters, like Geishas and Samurai, and the developments that led to the war. There are omens, such as the flammable nature of the structures in Tokyo. There are parallels like Japan's involvement in a land war in China that it can't extract itself from without \\"losing face.\\" The novel would not be complete if it did not include the cultural clash of East meeting West. This novel piqued my interest in Japan again, and next I am going to read Japan at War: An Oral History.

Smith's lead, Harry Niles, is a fun somehow relatable character although its unlikely anyone has lead a similar life, as an American missionary living and thriving in '40s Japan. The fantastic atmosphere that's created here really illuminates a part of the world many Americans don't know especially during that time frame. Truely a great read!"},{"Title":"December 6: A Novel","review":"Terrific characters and plot but the sense of place in pre-wwII Japan is the most outstnding quality of the book. Highly recomended."},{"Title":"December 6: A Novel","review":"\\"December 6\\" (apparently published in Britain under the title \\"Tokyo Station\\") is a very good read - well written, well researched, and immensely suspenseful. My only criticism of the book pertains to a few minor proof-reading errors in the edition I bought - several times the word \\"gallons\\" was used instead of the intended word \\"barrels.\\" I almost threw the book aside at that point, but I'm very glad I didn't. The errors turned out to be totally inconsequential, and the book turned out to be totally enjoyable.In this book Cruz describes a narrow slice of the culture of pre-war Imperial Japan. Even though I lived for a while in Japan many decades later, I can say that Cruz's descriptions immediately transported me back to those narrow streets, wooden buildings, and mostly self-effacing people.It occured to me as I was reading this book that in recent years our focus has dramatically shifted from East Asia and the \\"Pacific Rim\\" - remember that buzz term? - to Europe, the Middle East, and Western Asia. Japan has, to a great extent, been ignored, certainly in the U.S. mass media. While people still read volumes about Hilter, Himmler, the Gestapo, and the Holocaust, we encounter relatively little in the English-speaking media these days about Hirohito, Tojo, the Kempeitai, and mass murder by Japanese militarists. This is truly a shame, for the lessons to be learned from studying oriental culture and the history Japanese militarism are at least as valid as those we learn from the study of other cultures and of western facism. Martin Cruz Smith is to be congratulated for bringing Japan and the Orient back into our field of view.If you enjoy suspense and have a taste for the foreign, this book is for you."},{"Title":"December 6: A Novel","review":"December 6 is a spectacular novel. It is, in fact, Casablanca set in Japan.Niles is an American who owns a bar in Tokyo. Other Americans in Japan consider him a traitor to the American cause, but they do not understand him. The Japanese consider him a dangerous foreigner. They do not understand him, either.Not even the reader will understand Niles's motives until the last pages of the book. Perhaps he does not understand himself.Not understanding Niles is okay, though. He and Japan, retain their sense of mystery.Martin Cruz Smith is among America's finest popular novelists, and this book shows why. It has mystery, excitement, and lavish characters all portrayed against the rich backdrop of a different land in a different time.I will confess that December 6 is a bit slow in the beginning, as many, many great books are. It's worth the work. I cannot recommend December 6 highly enough."},{"Title":"December 6: A Novel","review":"First book I have read by Mr. Smith I will certainly read more. The story is very strong in the fiber of Japan, its ways, the peoples feelings, and the time embarrassing as it was to the beginning of the War. It was stated and seemed to be fact that they always knew they could not win, but face caused them to fight to the last. Harry, the main character moves through the story in a slippery way as he was more Asian than American but in his heart he also knew there wasn't a chance to win. I will now begin my oddesey of reading all his books. He is a fine Novelist."},{"Title":"December 6: A Novel","review":"Martin Cruz Smith writes a portrait of the last two days before the start of World War II in Tokyo. The story focuses on Harry Niles, an American who spent much of his childhood in Japan and then returned as an adult and nows owns a nightclub. He may also be a rogue, opportunist, either a collaborator to the Japanese or American spy or perhaps both. Niles hopes to get on a plane to Hong Kong and then on to California, but has to dodge a psychotic Japanese officer bent on avenging a perceived breach of his honor, the police who suspect his involvement in a plot to undermine Japan's oil supply, and a possibly murderous girlfriend. The Japanese quest for oil is an underlying theme of the book and the reader is introduced to Admiral Yamamoto and Japan's justification for the attack on Pearl Harbor. Smith puts forth Japan's side of the origins of the Pacific War and gives the reader an excellent understanding of their point of view while avoiding a sanctimonious anti-American tone. Unfortunately, December 6 is confusing and plodding in the first half and many readers are likely put it down. The action then heats up and the plot develops into a tense thriller that I will not forget. December 6 gets a weak four star rating (let's say 3.51 which rounds up to 4), but to paraphrase Randy Jackson, Smith started roughtly, then brought it home."},{"Title":"December 6: A Novel","review":"Harry Niles, the ne'er-do-well son of a Baptist missionary in Pre-WW II Japan is the protagonist of this fine thriller, a character closely patterned on the Rick Blaine character of Casablanca. Harry has had an adventurous youth growing up in the risqu&eacute; Asakuza \\"arts\\" area of Tokyo under the rather derelict \\"supervision\\" of his Uncle. He's the proprietor of \\"The Happy Paris\\", actually an American Expat bar in Tokyo. Ostensibly a simple bar owner, Harry is in actuality a seemingly perpetual thorn in the side of the local Tokyo authorities-from the police to the military. The problem is Harry doesn't fit in with the form for a gaijin-a barbarian foreigner. Though definitely foreign, Harry has been raised in Japan virtually all his life and is, in terms of behavior, outlook and temperament, more Japanese than American. Moreover, his boyhood school chums have all grown into roles of prominence in pre-war Japan That Harry has in fact helped the authorities out in some singular cases diminishes their suspicions of him not one whit.And they are justified in their suspicions-for Harry is as American as they come in his heart-of-hearts and in fact is scamming the Japanese Navy. Or is he? That's the question vexing the authorities as they prepare for Pearl Harbor. How this all plays out forms the basis of an excellent suspense novel.A first rate novel, as it turns out, populated by interesting, exotic characters, a vivid presentation of pre-war life in Japan, complex plot twists and a very high level of suspense that sustains itself throughout the book.This is Smith at his best. He excels in the historical suspense novel and in Harry Niles has developed a truly engaging and absorbing character around which he has crafted a first class story."},{"Title":"December 6: A Novel","review":"I like this book as much as I liked Rose, which was another historical thriller/mystery by this author. All the standard Cruz-Smith strengths are in play here: economical, smooth prose; great, cutting dialogue; and tremendous characterization. This book is also extremely well plotted, and the pacing is simply incredible. Harry Niles is the kind of protagonist that this author has a patent on: a survivor as opposed to a standard, cookie-cutter &quot;hero.&quot; There is nothing heroic about Harry Niles. He is a hustler and a con man - the only son of missionary parents who makes his own way in Japan just before World War II. As one character observes, Harry is a &quot;fish that could live in a tree if he had too.&quot; Also, this author creates the most interesting and frightening villains in fiction. His Ishigami, a samurai run amok, is spellbinding. Lastly, this book is a fascinating look into another time and another culture. Buy this book. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"December 6: A Novel","review":"After reading Gorky Park many years ago, I knew I chanced upon a very good writer. I went back and read his very early books that not many people have read and saw how over time Smith kept improving as a writer. I still chuckle when I think of the russian police officer walking around Havanna in his topcoat.(Havanna Bay) December 6 is I believe his best book to date. Very clever, creative and believable. If you haven't discovered Smith yet, now is the time to read December 6 and then go back and read all his others."},{"Title":"December 6: A Novel","review":"Let Martin Cruz Smith take you on a walk through Japan just before Pearl Harbor. You'll enjoy and you'll learn.Smith uses a character not unlike Rick in 'Casablanca' to take the reader to Tokyo in 1941. You'll take some time and feel the Rape of Nanking up close. You'll explore the 'inscrutable' geisha personality. You'll look into the Japanese psyche and understand why the attack on Pearl was inevitable. And if you believe that President Roosevelt knew that we needed to enter World War II, then you'll understand why economic sanctions worked in 1941, probably for the only time in history.Cruz' wonderful style brings his characters to life as well as ever. If you've enjoyed anything Martin Cruz Smith has written you need to read \\"December 6\\"."},{"Title":"December 6: A Novel","review":"This is the first book of Martin Cruz Smith that I have read and overall I would say that the book was pretty good. The sequences of flashbacks was a little too much for me and at times I almost forgot what time period we were in.The story was very well done and made you question the main characters character many times over. Even at this point I wonder if he was a good guy or just another thief.I will read another Smith book again."},{"Title":"December 6: A Novel","review":"Well done thriller that offers a deep understanding of Japanese culture during the years leading up to Pearl Harbor. Great atmosphere, sharply etched characters, and superb dialog. The plot is fascinating and there are no punches pulled regarding Japanese savagery in China. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"December 6: A Novel","review":"I have enjoyed all of MCSmith's books. I guess I started with Gorky Park years ago. His writing is intense, you need to look between the lines and and keep thinking all the time. I was glad for the ending--almost didn't happen!! I also thought of Cabaret and Casablanca as similarities of pre-war situations. I liked it!!"},{"Title":"December 6: A Novel","review":"I've always liked Martin Cruz Smith's writing (Polar Star, Gorky Park)but thought he was a little unpolished but this is a superb novel and very well-researched. His use of flashback isn't quite up to La Carre's Perfect Spy. I would have liked to have seen more into the main character's youth, which was as fascinating as his adult adventures. This book, while too short, is well worth the price."},{"Title":"December 6: A Novel","review":"There's no hero like a flawed hero, and Harry Niles is perfectly flawed. The reader herself isn't sure about Harry...does he have feelings for America (he is an American, but was raised in Japan), or has Japan stolen his soul? His love affair with a strange Japanese girl has a violent passion that intrigues, and &quot;friends&quot; from his past make for exciting and unexpected moments. Martin Cruz Smith has an elegant style of writing that adds something lovely to this story of an onlovely time."},{"Title":"December 6: A Novel","review":"Many of the other reviewers here have already hit some of the flaws in December 6 right on the head: not everyone is really going to know, four years in advance, just how the war will end. And the closing of the novel leaves too much unanswered, with some characters' fates not clearly delineated.What really made December 6 an interesting read for me were the flashback chapters which alternated with the present-day chapters (i.e., 1941). It is these chapters that show the young Harry Niles, outwardly a gaijin in a country that will never fully accept him, but inwardly just as Japanese as his ethnically Japanese friends. Smith renders with unsparing detail the artsy community of Asakusa and the people who are the greatest influences on the young Harry Niles, the witty artist Kato and the beautiful Oharu. These chapters do a remarkable job of drawing parallels between what happens to Harry in 1941 and his childhood, and showing just how and why Harry the boy becomes the man he is by the time Japan bombs Pearl Harbor.Overall a very absorbing read, even if flawed, for anyone who is interested in the years that led up to the clash of Japan's empire and America's &quot;Arsenal of Democracy.&quot;"},{"Title":"December 6: A Novel","review":"While this novel is historical fiction, it does a great job of teaching the reader about Japan in 1941. The research of Japan was great. For readers that don't understand the reasons for WWII from the Japanese perspective, this novel lays our the ground work. Too many novels treat the Japanese like \\"yellow devils\\". This work shows that there is a another point of view. I enjoyed the book. It challenged my way of thinking. It makes good summer reading."},{"Title":"December 6: A Novel","review":"I will simply say that the abridged audio version is brilliant as written by Martin Smith and excitingly realized in audio by John Slattery. Smith picks a relatively unexplored historical niche as his venue for capturing the giddiness and sentiments of pre-war Japan while Slattery's talent create a masterful performance that is rare for audiobooks. You can nitpick all you want, but this one stands out as a real treat."},{"Title":"December 6: A Novel","review":"It is the year 1922 in Tokyo. Harry Niles is 11 years old and at the beginning of his career as a supreme con man. After meeting his various Japanese friends, we switch to December 6, 1941 two days before the attack on Pearl Harbor.Harry now owns and runs the Happy Paris nightclub. His sidekick is Michiko, a rough and tumble Japanese woman of many native talents. But then there is colonel Ishigami, a throwback to the old samurais with their finely honed swords. He is after Harry and wants to slice off his head. He travels around the Asakusa district with a head box, in case he is successful.The author gives us incredible descriptions of pre-war Tokyo, the artisans in the neighborhood, the geishas in the willow houses, the stuck-up military, and all the little folk teeming around.And then we get to December 6. Harry clearly sees that any war can only be fought because and for oil. Japan cannot sustain a war, not having any oil. Harry cons the Japanese navy into believing that large quantities of oil are stored in Hawaii: Destroy it, and the US Pacific Fleet is grounded. The attack on Pearl Harbor fails to find or destroy these reserves and the Japanese leaders realize that the war is already lost.All this sounds rather simple. But Mr.Smith painstakingly researched this book and made it authentic and believable. On a personal note: Negotiations between the US and Japan had been going on since June, 1941; why then did Roosevelt put the whole Pacific Fleet in one big heap into Pearl Harbor?This book is a show stopper. Don't miss it!"},{"Title":"December 6: A Novel","review":"If there's a bigger Martin Cruz Smith fan around than your's truly I'd like to meet them. I sacrifice budget or food in the house when he has a new release. Maybe that's why I felt so let down when I finished DECEMBER 6TH.Another review nailed it. Casablanca goes to Japan! Thirty or so pages into this the comparison was way obvious. To me there's nothing worse than taking a classic storyline and trying to disguise it as something new.I wanted this to end. I didn't want POLAR STAR, RED SQUARE, or HAVANA BAY to end. ROSE well ... let's leave ROSE alone. It wilted OK?In so many other works by Smith I felt the chill of ice, smelled the cabbage boiling. I could see the colors of Cuba! Here, not only was it already familiar but it was almost a draft instead of a complete work.Bring back Arkady. He is a never miss character and always brings depth to the story.Sorry Martin. Maybe DECEMBER 6TH won't live in infamy."},{"Title":"December 6: A Novel","review":"Looking for a novel that will entertain, enlighten and educate? You'll find it here in Martin Cruz Smith's intelligent and engrossing story of Tokyo on the eve of Pearl Harbour. Centered by the enigmatic Harry Niles, the story gives the reader insight into what it may have been like to have been raised as an American in Japan prior to the war. Niles character, similar in many ways to Rick Blain in Casablanca, walks a thin and dangerous line in trying to sort out his feelings for a very volatile Japanes woman, the friendships he developed growing up and his loyalty to the US.The novel is extremely well researched and keeps the reader guessing till the end. Well worth your time."},{"Title":"December 6: A Novel","review":"There are few thriller writers that can evoke a place and time like Smith. When you hear about an author's exhaustive research to recreate not just the look but the experience of a place this is yet another good example of his talent as a writer. Just the choice of pre-Pearl Harbor Tokoyo is original. The character of Harry Niles owes alot to Casablanca's Rick Blaine and no doubt Smith had him in mind when writing. He handles the anti-hero well, slowly giving a piece by piece back story of why the reader should sympathize and eventually even root for Harry. That's hard to do as a writer, but Smith frequently chooses memorable main characters (Arkady of Gorky Park, Polar Star, Red Square and Havanna Bay fame is his best example)that are a bit on the dark side. The book is fairly fast paced. The introduction of an honorable but homicidal samauri from Harry's past raises the book to a new level of suspense. Even the descriptions of the ritualistic lopping of heads is fascinating. The love story angle is unconventional and Smith handles Harry's thoughts on the relationship perfectly. As with all his thrillers, the ending is wonderfully tense and unexpected. This is a &quot;downward spiral&quot; type plot where the reader knows the main character is heading deeper and deeper into trouble as things close in around him. But, Smith keeps the twists and rich descriptions at a level where the reader stays with him. December 6 is not as strong as Gorky Park or Rose, the latter being the high point with its totally original setting and beautiful writing, but from an always reliable writer it is strong stuff. How many writers are as reliably entertaining as Martin Cruz Smith: not many."},{"Title":"December 6: A Novel","review":"Author Martin Cruz Smith had a great idea for his novel: What was it like to be in Japan, specifically Tokyo, in the 48 hours before Pearl Harbor. From this setting the author has concocted a tale of intrique, mystery, and sometimes confusion, all through the eyes of Harry Niles, son of Baptist missionaries in Japan, who has become more Japanese than American. Some flashbacks illuminate his early years and suggest some of the reasons why Harry turned out to be an owner of a nightclub, a person who wheels and deals with both Japanese officials and Westerners, and manages to juggle a couple of love affairs--if that is the right term for Harry's involvement.The good things about December 6 include some fairly convincing atmospherics of pre-war Tokyo, a story that in the last third of the book moves briskly and with some excitement, and an ending that fits the protagonist and the various people who have an \\"interest\\" in Harry. The book points out the strains of the economic straightjacket that Japan found itself on the eve of WWII, caused by the restrictions on oil imports, and thus the use of inefficient charcoal burners to provide fuel for essential transportation and other limitations.What is less fulfilling is the idea that Harry, shadowy character that he is, would be able to pull together enough information (and guesses) to predict the attack on Pearl Harbor. Harry acts as if he is the Savior of Mankind, even attempting to gain access to the American ambassador, who is playing golf and ignores him, about the dastardly plot underway. Although Harry is satisfying as a character, many of the others are cardboard cut-outs, e.g. the American ambassador, the dialogue occasinally lapses into expressions that were not common until late in the 20th Century, and the character of Ishigame, the Japanese officer whose great talent is severing heads, and his pursuit of Harry because of \\"lost face\\" in an earlier encounter with Harry during the \\"Rape of Nanking.\\" [Yes, Harry did get around, a fly on the wall of history!].Most readers will find the book an interesting snapshot of Japan in late 1941, the nuanced protrait of Harry and some of his associates, including the mysterious Michiko--the girl friend from hell. But one is left with the impression: Couldn't this have been a better novel with a little less derring-do and a bit more research on the actual events of the pre-Pearl Harbor days?"},{"Title":"December 6: A Novel","review":"This is a well-researched book that gives the reader a good look at the seamier side of Tokyo and Japanese attitudes towards &quot;Gaijin&quot; in the years before WWII. It tells the story through the eyes of an American raised in Japan who grew up fraternizing with artists/pornographers/actresses and came to run a nightclub. The plot weaves back and forth from his youth, ostensibly &quot;formative years&quot; and December 5-6, 1941.I found that the flashbacks did not add much to the book. It only showed that every urban center has a seedy side. So also his girlfriend added nothing to the book except for an unlikeable character and a relationship that had all the warmth of an ice cube tray.The last stage of the book has some action and is far less stagnant than the first two thirds. As the attack on Pearl Harbor nears, his protection from the higher ups for whom he had done work, begins to falter. He also has to escape from his nemesis - a blood thirsty killer who had made his mark in the Rape of China.The book was filled with details that did nothing to move it along. The main character was interesting, the rest seemed like cardboard cut-outs. All-in-all the cultural aspects were fairly interesting and the last portion's action and intrigue lifted this to a three star. I give it only a lukewarm recommendation."},{"Title":"December 6: A Novel","review":"I think I've read all his work (at least under the name Martin Cruz Smith) and this is my all time favorite.

I suspect a sequel is in the works. I hope so. Harry Niles in post war Japan?"},{"Title":"December 6: A Novel","review":"Probably the single most important thing a book can do for you is hold your interest, and this one does. You can get a good idea of the plot by reading one of the other reviews on this site.I've already given this book my praise, that it holds your interest. It's more interesting to me to discuss the flaws.Flaw number one is the godlike omniscience of the hero, Harry Niles. He KNOWS exactly how history will unfold. He knows that America will win the war. It's a slam dunk. And he focuses on oil oil oil oil and oil as the five reasons that America will win. Isn't that topical.It seems to me that the victory over Japan was not a slam dunk. America was aided greatly by breaking the codes and therefore knowing when and where and with what strength Japan would attack. It is just too damn easy, after the fact, to say with certainty how things would develop.Let me suggest a reasonable alternative ending to that war. Let's say that FDR had a more conciliatory personality. He may have arrived at a negotiated peace that allowed Japan, and for that matter Germany, to hold on to some of their early winnings.What I'm saying is that the nearly unconditional surrender of the Japanese and Germans was not a foregone conclusion in 1941, but to Harry Niles it was. Funny how strong hindsight can be.In fact, several other characters in the book also had the same certainty of Japan's ultimate and total defeat, and this greatly impacted the big surprise ending. Sorry, but it's just a bunch of bull.My other complaint with this book is that it has what I call a &quot;too cute&quot; ending, which is rampant in modern novels. They don't tell us how things end. The author leaves us hanging, and we are supposed to draw our own conclusions. What happens to Harry Niles and his girlfriend Michiko? He's writing the damn story so he can tell us the damn ending, doncha think? We're supposed to operate on hints and figure it out for ourselves? No. No. No, I don't think so. Tell us the damn ending.

His work is painfully researched (accounting for the relatively short list of published works) and beautifully written. &#65533;December 6&#65533; is no exception, as Smith again demonstrates the range of his talents, this time setting the story in 1941 Tokyo. He spins the unusual story of Harry Niles, the son of American missionaries stationed in Japan. Alienated from his parents as they are off proselytizing in rural Japan, Harry is left to grow up on the streets of Tokyo. Much more Japanese in culture and beliefs than American, the enigmatic Niles, now an adult Tokyo nightclub owner, finds himself in a precarious situation on the eve of the Pacific World War II.Give Smith credit for creativity: this is certainly an unusual, if not bizarre, subject for a story. Harry Niles is a mysterious main character. Accepted fully by neither western nor eastern cultures, perpetually only a step ahead of (or behind) the law, the reader never knows exactly where to categorize Niles: hero, spy, traitor, patriot?. Supporting characters are likewise complex and unable to be easily quantified. Michiko, Harry&#65533;s mistress: the cool and aloof juke-box jockey, yet also the submissive geisha. Ishigami, the sword-yielding samurai demon with a uniquely Japanese penchant for both honor and terror. Smith adroitly blends Japanese tradition in the background, avoiding the tendancy of many western authors writing of Japan to allow the culture to overshadow the story. The imminent war is portrayed from a uniquely Japanese, and fatalistic, perspective. Like all of Smith&#65533;s novels, the characters and events are intricately woven in a complex fabric of intrigue and suspense, leading to a surreal, nearly mystical, climax.What &#65533;December 6&#65533; lacks in sheer thrills and fast action of Gorky Park is compensated by the intelligent and convoluted story line and though-provoking characters. As with all of Smith&#65533;s novels, &#65533;December 6&#65533; leaves the reader anxiously awaiting his next effort."},{"Title":"December 6: A Novel","review":"This is a most unusual historical novel, an espionage thriller of sorts, but much more. Martin Cruz Smith's hero, Harry Niles, is even more unique then the tale he tells - the story of Japan on the eve of Pearl Harbor. The perspective is Japanese, interpreted for us by a chameleon.Harry Niles grew up in Japan, the son of American Baptist missionaries, zealous in their determination to bring the light of God to the Japanese. Harry's Uncle Orin, a devout alcoholic, baby-sat him as his parents wandered the country spreading the Word, with no knowledge of the Japanese language, or culture, and no desire to learn. The couple saw Harry as a \\"sort of amphibian, neither honest, nor stupid, neither adult nor innocent, neither American nor Japanese.\\" And Harry, who ran wild in the streets of Tokyo, at home in the shady underworld, dance halls, and back-room card games, learned early to survive well in this environment - and became a master of the \\"artful scam.\\" He survived Japanese school, where he was the only \\"gaijin,\\" (foreigner), forever playing the Indian to the Japanese schoolboys' cowboy...or samurai, as it were. He also learned the aesthetics of Shinto, which he was more comfortable with than his parent's Christianity; as well as Japanese ethics, their world view in general, their take on international politics, etc..The narrative switches back and forth between Harry's adolescence, and his present life, in early December, 1941. He owns the \\"Happy Paris,\\" an American jazz bar, where a juke box provides the music, and his Japanese Communist lover, Michiko, selects the tunes. He is a con man with a heart of gold. Niles has more than an inkling that the Japanese are about to attack Hawaii - he is a man with many sources, and knows how to do simple addition. And 2+2 = Pearl Harbor. He needs to be on the last flight out of the country - otherwise the consequences won't be pretty. Japanese military and intelligence officials don't particularly care for him, and neither do the Americans, nor the Brits, for that matter. His last days in Japan, before the war, are filled with intrigue, suspense and murder.Cruz Smith writes a tight, taut narrative, as always. He is a master at building suspense, in a real life drama that is already fraught with tension. His research is impeccable and I learned much while enjoying the read. Descriptions of a meeting of the elite Chrysanthemum Club, where Harry tells the Japanese version of the upcoming hostilities, are both hilarious and informative; as is the scene where Harry plays catch with the Japanese Giants' baseball team. One minute you're laughing, the next you're biting your nails.Harry Niles is Smith's real masterpiece, however. Niles breathes life into every event and person that surround him. He is a perfect anti-hero on the surface. He is well aware of the multitude of contradictions that make-up his persona, and accepts them, even enjoys them, with a dark, sardonic humor. The scam has a whole new meaning in Harry's hands - his cons can cause war! Yet he is also a decent and kind man. Just beneath the surface, there exists the man who saved many Chinese lives in Japan's brutal rape of Nanking. And he continues to help both friends and strangers up until the novel's last page. Harry just doesn't want anyone to know. He doesn't want to be anyone's hero.This is one of Martin Cruz Smith's best works. The historical aspect and original point of view make it 5 Stars all the way!JANA"},{"Title":"December 6: A Novel","review":"You will never think about Pearl Harbor and December 7, 1941 in quite the same way after you read December 6. You will also have a new appreciation of the gap between an embassy staff trying to understand the surface of a culture and the depth of experience and knowledge that is required to begin to truly understand another society.In fact, this book is as useful in helping to understand Japan in 1941 as it is for trying to understand our current challenge in dealing with the reactionary Wahhabi sect of Islam, the system of terror based on religious belief, and the isolation of Hezballah, Hamas, and Al Qaeda from the West. The core principle that language is only the first of many cultural differences is the key to understanding the challenge facing any diplomat or intelligence agent trying to penetrate and predict a truly different society.Martin Cruz Smith has created an American missionary's son who is as vivid and believable as any of the Russians in his Gorky Park series. Smith suggests that a young man who had grown up inside Japanese culture with Japanese playmates and fluency in the Japanese language would have a completely different understanding of the culture than the American embassy or missionaries who came as outsiders to change it rather than understand it.Smith creates an almost Humphrey Bogart like character in an almost Casablanca scene but with distinctly Japanese differences. He tells the story of a culture that believes in seppuku (ceremonial suicide), a culture which saw everyone not Japanese as not quite human (and therefore saw the killing of hundreds of thousands of Chinese as an event not worth noticing), and a culture which felt its very life being suffocated by the huge presence of the Americans across the Pacific and their potential ability to strangle Japanese society by cutting off the flow of oil. This is a culture very unlike Vichy, France and even more alien than the Gestapo and the Third Reich.You will find the personalities, the plot, and the scenes believable, engaging, and intriguing. Once started this is not a book you will want to put down."},{"Title":"December 6: A Novel","review":"I found the book riveting from page one. It works on so many levels, from its atmospheric setting in Japan to its exciting story lines, set both in the childhood past of American Harry Niles and the present, the day before the attack on Pearl Harbor. But the intriguing characters in the novel are what drive the story. Harry Niles is by far one of the most interesting characters I've encountered lately. So is his Japanese mistress, the unpredictable and scary Michiko.One of the most suspensful and delicious scenes in the novel takes place in a Willow House, where Harry is forced to make small talk and observe Japanese decorum while knowing he has just minutes to live. He has been lured to the Willow House by his lover, at first unrecognized because of her geisha makeup and demeanor. There, he encounters bitter enemy, Ishigami, the master swordsman who has sworn to behead him. Ishigami is like a cat playing with the mouse before pouncing. The reader cannot help but wonder throughout the book how Harry will survive.I read a huge number of books, both fiction and non, and this one is a gem. (Another great novel set around the time of WWII is Joseph Kanon's &quot;The Good German&quot;). December 6 is one of the few books that I will actually go back and reread, slowly, to figure out how the author managed to put it all together.Finally, as a response to the reader who claimed he was not an old white man and why should this book be on his &quot;must read&quot; list, I am not an old white man either. If a reviewer is going to give one star and a grumpy one-liner, but no concrete criticisms at all, his review enlightens no one."},{"Title":"December 6: A Novel","review":"I resisted the characterization of Harry Niles as Rick Blaine and still to some extent continue to do so. He's more a character out of Hemingway, living in Paris or London or Madrid after the First World War. And like the Hemingway men, tragically flawed at several things save survival. For Harry is really the best at surviving.Additionally I mistook the juxtaposition of the tales of Harry the scoundrel adult bar owner and Harry, the Charles Dickens street urchin as being whimsical at best, boring at worst. I was mistaken and seeing what Harry is and then seeing how he got there was fascinating and fulfilling.This book grows on you, slowly at first, then by leaps and bounds. It is a mystery, romance, war story and to be truthful it went from &quot;interesting&quot; to &quot;riveting&quot; in about 200 pages.Like all Cruz-Smith exploits, it is both well written while at the same time being very well researched. Other reviewers have given the plot so let me just leave you with this. In a strange (still) land at a time no one is too certain about what really went on, Cruz-Smith makes you feel at home.

In flashbacks we see how much Harry will take and improvise to avoid submitting when his boyhood \\"friends\\" make him the target of their samurai games.The same friends are in his life on December 6th\\": Hajimai, a soldier about to ship out and Gen, an aide to Admiral Yamomoto who recognizes and uses the talents of Harry the businessman. They are hooked up with Col. Ishigami, a sadistic veteran of the rape of Nanking who is particularly good at beheading people with his saber.While trying to wrap things up over the weekend and make the Monday morning clipper flight to Hong Kong, Harry will confirm his suspicions that Pearl Harbor is to be attacked. Again through flashbacks we learn how powerbrokers on both sides of the coming conflict know Harry and why he knows things they would like to know. His relationship with Michiko, the part Communist part geisha \\"Record Girl\\" who tends the Happy Paris jukebox, and efforts to stay out from under Ishigami's sword are part of a pace that keeps you excited and surprised by what happens next.The ending is jst plain phenomenal. Smith puts his hero in a box he'll never get out of. Then ... I'll say no more except that you'll want to experience the finale for yourself.P.S. Smith has created his best ever character in Harry Niles, and John Slattery (narrator of the audiobook) captures Harry's personality perfectly with a comfortable, believable delivery of the con man's lines combined with unobtrusive yet distinct voices and accents that set Harry apart from the rest of the cast. I hope there's a movie and Slattery gets the part."},{"Title":"December 6: A Novel","review":"There are few thriller writers that can evoke a place and time like Smith. When you hear about an author's exhaustive research to recreate not just the look but the experience of a place this is yet another good example of his talent as a writer. Just the choice of pre-Pearl Harbor Tokoyo is original. The character of Harry Niles owes alot to Casablanca's Rick Blaine and no doubt Smith had him in mind when writing. He handles the anti-hero well, slowly giving a piece by piece back story of why the reader should sympathize and eventually even root for Harry. That's hard to do as a writer, but Smith frequently chooses memorable main characters (Arkady of Gorky Park, Polar Star, Red Square and Havanna Bay fame is his best example)that are a bit on the dark side. The book is fairly fast paced. The introduction of an honorable but homicidal samauri from Harry's past raises the book to a new level of suspense. Even the descriptions of the ritualistic lopping of heads is fascinating. The love story angle is unconventional and Smith handles Harry's thoughts on the relationship perfectly. As with all his thrillers, the ending is wonderfully tense and unexpected. This is a &quot;downward spiral&quot; type plot where the reader knows the main character is heading deeper and deeper into trouble as things close in around him. But, Smith keeps the twists and rich descriptions at a level where the reader stays with him. December 6 is not as strong as Gorky Park or Rose, the latter being the high point with its totally original setting and beautiful writing, but from an always reliable writer it is strong stuff. How many writers are as reliably entertaining as Martin Cruz Smith: not many."},{"Title":"December 6: A Novel","review":"The latest entry from America's smartest writer is one of his finest to date...No one working in American fiction strikes me as a more capable, inventive master of the modern genre novel...And no one gives you as many of those shock-of-recognition &quot;epiphanies&quot; that leave you shaking your head at the author's brilliance.Cruz Smith is the finest novelist working in America today. Period."},{"Title":"December 6: A Novel","review":"Martin Cruz Smith has set his newest novel, DECEMBER 6, in Japan on the eve of Pearl Harbor. He tells the story of Harry Niles, the American son of missionaries who left him to grow up on the streets of Tokyo. Now a 30-year-old man, Harry owns the Happy Paris, a tearoom he transformed into a &quot;...bar stocked with scotch instead of sake and a red neon sign...,&quot; in Tokyo's &quot;Azakuza&quot; district. The saloon is a hangout for Western journalists, a meeting place for expatriates, and a watering hole for those on the move through Japan.Harry, had a tough time growing up in the &quot;Hell's Kitchen&quot; area of Tokyo. Always a gaigin (a foreigner) among his schoolmates, he was never really accepted and was the target of the samurai and Shinto games they played. He calls himself a philosopher and says, &quot;My talent is speaking more Japanese than most Americans and more English than most Japanese. Big deal.&quot;He is neither a Westerner nor is he Japanese. But Harry is an expert con man. He has his own business, he is part of a network of acquaintances and loves his mistress, Michiko. His life is full, and he is as content as anyone who lives the nightlife on the fringes of any society.Everyone Harry knows believes that Japan and the United States will go to war. The only question for them in December, 1941 is when. And although Harry thinks he has a plan to prevent an attack by the Japanese on Americans, he also has a ticket in his pocket for the last plane out of Tokyo. &quot;Well, it may be petty of me,&quot; Harry declares, &quot;but I still want to come out of this war alive.&quot;In alternating narratives of Harry the boy juxtaposed against Harry the club owner, Smith paints an extraordinary picture of life in Japan before the bombing of Pearl Harbor and captures the essence of that strange, exotic country on the brink of war. For the verisimilitude of DECEMBER 6 Smith says, &quot;I was able to visit Japan with a guy I met who lived there during the time of the story...[and for his research he] reads newspapers of the time and memoirs of people who lived through the era [he is] writing about.&quot;Smith lives up to his reputation for presenting readers finely wrought suspense-thrillers. And, in DECEMBER 6, he goes over the top. His deft interweaving of an historical abomination with the romantic tale of a man without a country is both moving and thought provoking.Fans and newcomers to Smith's work will not be disappointed in this, his best novel to date.--- Reviewed by Barbara Lipkien Gershenbaum"},{"Title":"December 6: A Novel","review":"I will always gladly pick up anything new from Martin Cruz Smith, as he has never really disappointed me yet. His Arkady Renko novels (including the classic Gorky Park, and fascinating but convoluted Havana Bay) have gotten plenty of praise, and I also loved Rose. Perhaps more than anything, Smith is known for painstaking research. He developed a wonderful setting for each of his densely-plotted books. Moscow in winter, a North Sea fishing boat, a grimy English mining town, and tropical Havana all come alive in the pages of Martin Cruz Smith novels.In December 6, he turns his trained eye upon Japan at the outbreak of WW II, and his character Harry Niles will draw inevitable parallels to Bogart's Rick of Casablanca fame. Niles is a nightclub owner as well, and in a society where children aspire at an early age to &quot;die for the emperor&quot; Niles is always reminded that he is an outsider, or a &quot;gaijin&quot;, even among a society he loves. He senses war about to break out, has a seat on the proverbial &quot;last plane out&quot;, but immerses himself in a ruse designed to try and trick the Japanese authorities into calling off the attack which he believes will doom the empire. We all know the attack takes place, and the outcome (some here have criticized Smith for making his characters so sure of the exact outcome of the war on the day it breaks out), but how it happens still holds your interest throughout the novel.After reading a Martin Cruz Smith novel, and this one is no exception, you remember the setting, and you vividly remember certain scenes (a flashback to Nanking involving a pivotal conflict with a fanatical general stick in my head), but you remember little about the various twists and turns of the plot. The tea houses, nightclubs and palaces of Tokyo come alive in his descriptions. I was a little disappointed in the ending, as Smith is not a writer who likes to tie up everything with a bow at the end, but I still recommend the book as a great historical glimpse at a fascinating culture swept up in the hysteria of the war. He made me care about the characters, including Harry and his pragmatic mistress Michiko. 5 stars, maybe 4 1/2 if Amazon let me, but a fast-paced and enjoyable read."},{"Title":"December 6: A Novel","review":"An old Jesuit professor of mine at Sophia University in Tokyo used to say that &quot;if you have been for a week in Japan you can write a book, if you've stayed for a month you can probably write a paper, and after a year a couple of pages&quot;. As an ex-resident of Japan and -at the same time- a Martin Cruz Smith fan I was sorry that my -limited but first hand- knowledge of things Japanese spoiled my reading pleasure. Undoubtedly the book, which is published here under the title &quot;Tokyo Station&quot; as December 6 is not a date us Europeans recognise, is good and most enjoyable for readers unfamiliar with Japan. Well written, beautiful characters, interesting albeit slow plot. However Mr. Cruz grasp of Japan is epidermal and the book seems artificial when it comes to portraying Japan and the Japanese. This, in addition to the fact that in any war it is the winner who writes its history when it is over, made the book less enjoyable than what it would've been in a different setting."},{"Title":"December 6: A Novel","review":"Poor Harry is neither a fish or a chicken, but halfway between. And the world of December 6 1941 is deeply in need of a strong swimmer.

I'm thinking that someone decided the British wouldn't pick up on the significance of December 6 as the day before the Pearl Harbor attack, and changed the name.Anyway, it's a good read, but I unwittingly bought both books and was astonished to see that the type setting is identical, exactly the same formatting, same typeface. Only the cover is slightly different. Boy, if I wasn't such a Martin Cruz Smith fan, I might be upset!"},{"Title":"December 6: A Novel","review":"Harry Niles is a cultural schizophreniac: a son of US missionaries, he is more at home in the Japanese demi-monde. He owns a jazz club, the &quot;Happy Paris&quot;, where his lady-friend selects the records from a jukebox. Sounds a bit formulaic? Forget any preconceived ideas, because nothing and nobody in this book are remotely what they seem to be.Other reviewers have already done a very creditable job in summarising the novel, so I will not repeat the exercise - except to remind the reader that Martin Cruz Smith does not write fluffy pulp with happy endings. The final spin is worthy of a grand master.I read this book starting very early one morning after arriving in Europe with an 8-hour time difference. I did not put the book down until it was finished. Harry's character and motivations are beautifully portrayed, and his life as a foreigner in Japan is described in a way that rivals James Clavell's &quot;Shogun&quot; (one of my personal favourites) - but with more twists and turns, and set to darker music. Very, very much recommended."},{"Title":"December 6: A Novel","review":"As usual, Martin Cruz Smith provides a backdrop story that leaves you believing that it could only be done by a native.

The main character Niles is an American expat club owner who grew up in Japan. He is neither totally American or can ever be Japanese, but he loves Japan and the Japanese. Think Rick in \\"Casablanca\\" and you have most of the character. The whole story takes place in about four days (with flashbacks for background) as Niles tries to get out of Dodge, avoid his enemies, and help his friends. No good deed goes unpunished should be the subtitle.I'm a sucker for historical novels.

I am waiting for Martin Cruz Smith's next gem as one of my favorite authors. Am sure glad he's on the Kindle... your next title, Martin, onegaishimas!"},{"Title":"December 6: A Novel","review":"I've always enjoyed Smith's books because they immerse you in a new world. He paints word pictures of a place and time so vivid that you actually seem to know them. This isn't just praise of Smith's writing expertise (although that is great) but of his incredible research talent. He must totally immerse himself in a historical environment before he puts a word on paper.I knew little about pre-war Japan before reading &quot;December 6&quot;. With a fast-paced plot and Japan-raised American Harry Niles as guide, I was whisked through a crash course in Japanese history, culture, and psychology. Like most historical fiction, it requires some suspension of disbelief (gee, how DID Harry bump into all of the key figures in Japan that day?). I find so few books that so convince me of their time and place that I'll willingly ignore some plot contrivances."},{"Title":"December 6: A Novel","review":"The setting, Imperial Japan in the days leading up to Pearl Harbor, and the characters, American business man and con artist Harry Niles and his Japanese mistress Michiko, make this a most interesting novel. Martin Cruz Smith has dramatically depicted an American who was raised Japanese -- his Southern Baptist missionary parents abandoned him to a Japanese nanny -- but remains forever an outsider. As the clouds of war gathered, the conflicts that turned Harry Niles inside out and threatened his very life make for a page-turning thriller."},{"Title":"December 6: A Novel","review":"Perhaps no American memory is as deeply engraved as the one showing Japanese bombers destroying most of the Pacific fleet in Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. In the background is a memory of seemingly dishonest negotiations with Japanese diplomats in Washington, D.C. while the Japanese fleet got ready for its sneak attack.But equally strong memories must exist among Japanese who were in Japan at the time, as their nation was in the process of starting the great Pacific war. Martin Cruz Smith does something that's almost impossible. He takes us to the Tokyo of December 6, 1941 and lets us perceive what was going on in the minds of the Japanese as their Imperial expansion began its final, unsuccessful phase. Even more remarkable, he creates a character who's part American (by birth, tradition and family heritage) and part Japanese (by experience, friendship and preference).Inevitably, readers will be reminded of Casablanca's Rick waiting in Paris as the Nazis march in, planning to catch the last train with his new love. But our Harry is planning to get on the last plane out instead, and alone. He's got some complications to deal with . . . including an angry mistress who doesn't want to be left behind, the Japanese authorities looking into irregularities, a samurai with a grudge, and criminal interests on the look out for themselves. Like Rick, he's a saloonkeeper with an eye to the main chance . . . as well as a keen sense of survival. You'll see a seamier side of Tokyo than most tourists did, so the book is not for those with delicate tastes.You probably won't read a book this year that will shift your orientation as much as this one. The story's fascinating, the culture's strange but attractive, and the moment will be burned in your mind . . . just like the Day of Infamy itself.If you liked Gorky Park, you will probably find many of the same sorts of appeal here as we see the all-to-human side of our once bitter enemy . . . and now firm ally.After you finish this story, I suggest that you think about what benefits countries would gain from having more citizens who find themselves able to operate and live comfortably in either land. How can you become one of those citizens? What benefits can you provide?Sayonara."},{"Title":"December 6: A Novel","review":"To sum up my impression of Dec 6, I found it hard to follow, yet informative. It kept my interest even though I felt like I was missing vast chunks of plot, descriptions, etc. There were many situations that to me seemed implausible yet thought if I wasn't missing so much plot that perhaps they would make sense. Despite not feeling like I was getting the entire thing, the characters seemed very interesting, which means to me how really interesting they would be if I was smart enough to get the whole plot.Hard to follow. It seemed like the events, spare the flashbacks to childhood were occurring in one day. This seemed really hard to believe. My mind kept trying to squish everything into one day and I ran into all kinds of logical hurdles, thinking, \\"this is this time, but what time did they bomb Pearl Harbor? and what about the international date line?\\" And then it was Dec 8 in Japan, but we think of it as Dec 7. Dec 6, was that Japan time or our time? Does the story last over 2 days? That would make a lot more sense to me for all those things in the book to occur over 2 rather than 1 day. In that case they should have named it \\"Dec 6 and 7 in the Japanese Time Zone\\" but that may have seemed a little clunky, but it would have alleviated a lot of confusion for me.Suffice it to say I found the time logistics challenging and this contributed to my overall distraction and inability to really focus on the author's amazing storytelling/descriptive abilities.Informative. We generally get the western view point - \\"ATTACKED!\\" \\"A day that will live in infamy\\" etc. And though some cynics say we drew Japan into the war they never were able to clearly explain to me, or I wasn't able to understand, how we forced a country to attack us. This narrative gives some explanation. An island, no natural resources, being starved of oil and other things by embargo - add some Yamoto spirit and - whammo! -we have a world war on our hands.The strange world of honor. It's something we hear about in the west but to see this description - honor on the first person level, a compassionate inside story, made the Japanese character so much more understandable. When he described the celebration after their \\"victory\\" at Pearl Harbor I can imagine similar celebrations in the US. Patriotic pride, 4th of July Parades. These things tend to make me feel nervous.Kept my interest. Based on the above. Harry being so smart I wondered what he had up his sleeve. However I didn't know if I would have been so driven to complete the book if it wasn't assigned as part of a book club. The club kept me going when otherwise I may have given up.Some implausibility. How is it that a lone American, a swindler, gets access to the oil records of these large corporations and dupes the Japanese navy into thinking that there were large reserves of oil hidden in Hawaii. I don't know. It may have been explained but because of the confusion I was having with the international date line I may have missed it.Interesting characters. Kiko the art teacher, Ishigami as evil incarnate, the force of destruction no one can beat, like a gay Jason (from Friday the 13th) who happens to be a samurai colonel. And, of course Michiko, the infatuated fatalistic lover who would like nothing more than to a murder suicide.Colorful descriptions. I particularly enjoyed the ambassador's party when Harry was a kid, playing tug of war, beating up the big guy, climbing the fence, I could just see the fire flies. I felt like there were a lot of great description that I probably missed because I was so confused by the logistics of the plot. I could benefit by a re-read. But I probably won't."},{"Title":"December 6: A Novel","review":"The days leading up to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor form the basis of this thriller focused on an American who lived in Japan from birth to his late teens, then returned ten years later--after the Nanking Massacre but before the United States entered the war. The son of missionaries who often left him in the care of others while they traveled, Harry Niles, as an adolescent, always considered himself more Japanese than American, though he was often tormented, and sometimes even tortured, by his Japanese peers for being different. When he embarrasses his parents by flouting their strict morality, he is hauled back to the United States in disgrace.In the ensuing decade at \\"home,\\" Harry learns how to manipulate others, becoming successful professionally by bending, if not ignoring, the rules. When he returns to Japan, he is distrusted by his fellow countrymen, while, at the same time, equally distrusted by his Japanese counterparts. Owning a Tokyo nightclub and living with Michiko, a woman whose self-serving nature matches his own, Harry reconnects with some of his acquaintances from high school, some of whom are now in the Japanese armed forces, and finds himself dealing with powerful yakuza figures, Nazi businessmen, and the confused diplomatic community. When he becomes privy to information which suggests an attack on Pearl Harbor is imminent, Harry tries to prevent war while protecting his own neck.Filled with realistic details which reflect a great deal of research into the political and cultural background of the period, the novel uses Harry's split loyalties to show Japan's belief that its desire to control the Pacific is no different from England's control of its colonies during the Empire. Showing the Japanese point of view, the author provides action scenes reflecting life in Tokyo for people ranging from Prime Minister Tojo to geishas and prostitutes, and the international colony of businessmen. Scenes of everyday life ring true, not just in terms of physical details but in terms of the cultural milieu of the characters.Harry is not an admirable character, either to the Americans or to the Japanese, but he, unlike many of the people with whom he associates, makes no pretenses of being anything other than who and what he is. Suspense develops relative to Harry's predicaments, a necessary structural device since readers already know the historical outcome. The final confrontation between Harry and members of the Japanese military, however, is less realistic than one would expect and the introduction of samurai values into the scene seems gratuitous and even trite, an easy way out of a difficult problem of plot. Still, the novel is exciting, well-researched, and imaginative, another one of Cruz Smith's carefully written historical thrillers. n Mary WhippleStalin's Ghost: An Arkady Renko NovelWolves Eat DogsRed SquareRose"},{"Title":"December 6: A Novel","review":"Surprising deriviative of Casablanca, perhaps unnecessarily so, it still works as a unique--if somewhat turgid--insight into a fascinating culture.One person's &quot;complicated&quot; is another's &quot;convoluted.&quot; The setting is never less than interesting, but the narrative is never quite satisfactory. The dialogue is unbelieveable at best, often belabored, and the plot's gimmick is telegraphed to anyone with a knowledge of Pearl Harbor. The prescience of the novel's key characters to universally agree that Japan will lose the war--literally 12 hours after the attack--is, well, ludicrous.

Author Martin Cruz Smith does an excellent job recreating historical Japan the day before Pearl Harbor. Like a lot of people, I've always found Japanese culture fascinating, and Smith has obviously done a ton of research to give the reader a vivid sense of what pre-WW II Japan was like.Unfortunately, Smith spends more time on the setting than on his characters. This is novel that resembles CASABLANCA in its plotline, with the main character being something of an cynical, self-interested anti-hero. He's an interesting fellow, but I never really warmed to him, and I thought most of the huge cast of supporting characters bordered on stereotypical. A lot of the dialogue in this book is ponderous and stilted, with a lot of the Japanese characters talking like the messages in fortune cookies.DECEMBER 6 is a novel with a huge number of flashbacks, and it seems like every other scene is a flashback to a different time period. The plotline is told out of order, and I've never been a big fan of this type of storytelling approach, which I usually find more frustrating than illuminating. The ending is ultimately a disappointment, and leaves certain issues in the plot unresolved.All in all, this is a decently written historical novel, but I would only recommend it to readers with a pre-existing interest in Japan and the history of World War II.

Their research is very solid and remains one of the \\"classic\\" studies that is, as far as I can tell, practically \\"taken for granted\\" today. I have read a fair amount of literature on this topic and, as far as I can tell (correct me if I'm wrong), most if not all of the author's conclusions remain virtually uncontested to this day. This is amazing considering how long ago this study was published (several decades), but let me tell you this study seems to be very solid. Later research has largely vindicated its conclusions. For example, one of the author's conclusions is that glossolalia is a learned behavior. This was supported by other studies (Samarin comes to a similar conclusion I believe) as well as an experiment done in the 80's in which researchers demonstrated that glossolalia is a learned (or at least learnable) behavior by teaching a group of university students who had no prior exposure to glossolalia to speak it fluently. For such a small book (86 pages plus bibliography) he cites a very extensive number of sources, ranging from numerous technical and scientific books and journals to Plato's Republic. His brief overview of the history of glossolalia cites two different dictionaries, Plato, Plutarch, Virgil, the Old and New Testaments of the Bible (which he appears to be quite familiar with), Morton Kelsey, church fathers Irenaeus, Origen, and Augustine, John Sherrill, and numerous others. Interestingly enough, this study (and several other studies by Samarin et al. that have had conclusions very damaging to Pentecostalism) has gone completely unanswered by charismatics for the last 30 years. The best we get from them is that \\"it's a divine gift and you can't reduce it to human reason\\" or \\"God wouldn't cooperate with a study\\" or \\"you can't understand tongues if you've never experienced it\\" or some bogus excuse like that. Talk about special pleading. Interestingly enough, I'd observed some of the same things that the author mentions on my own; for example, both me and the author independently observed the special pleading phenomenon with regard to tongues.Some of his conclusions are downright startling. For example, the author's study found that something around 85% or more of the people who spoke in tongues had previously suffered some form of anxiety crisis whereas only 30% of those in the control group (i.e. non-tongues-speakers) had experienced one. The difference turned out to be statistically significant - which would seem to indicate that glossolalia is often directly related to some form of stress.He even touches on \\"interpretation\\" of tongues. As part of their experiment, they recorded people speaking in tongues and gave it to several different people for it to be \\"interpreted.\\" Not surprisingly, every interpretation was completely different. He also gave an example where someone who had been a missionary in Africa stood up and said the Lord's Prayer in an African dialect. Thinking he was speaking in tongues, someone \\"interpreted\\" this as a message about the imminent Second Coming of Christ.His conclusions are also devastating to Pentecostalism. First, contrary to popular claims, people who speak in tongues are no more mentally healthy than anyone else; the mental health of both groups ended up being about the same. (Interestingly enough, they did find some differences in certain factors such as reliance on authority figures, depression, and certain types of stress/anxiety but found that apparent benefits of glossolalia were not derived from the speaking in tongues itself but in other things related to the experience of speaking in tongues; people who had had some kind of \\"falling out\\" with their original group of tongues-speakers still retained the ability to speak in tongues but did not derive any apparent benefits from it). Also, there is not a single verified instance of a tongues-speaker being able to speak in any language learned in anything but the normal way (i.e. contrary to claims by people like Randy Clark, there has not been a single verified instance of anyone \\"receiving\\" the ability to speak in a foreign language that they had not previously been exposed to). He comes to the conclusion, with much supporting evidence from his data, that \\"We have shown that speaking in tongues can be learned, almost as other abilities are learned. Whether one calls the practice a gift of the Spirit is, then, a matter of individual choice. Speaking in tongues does make the individual feel better... [however] Glossolalia rarely benefits a wide segment of the community. ... We hope therefore that its [glossolalia's] practitioners as well as the scientists who study the phenomenon will be modest in their claims for it. For it is not uniquely spiritual; it is not uniquely the result of God's intervention in man's speech.\\"I would recommend this book very heartily to anyone who is seeking to understand what to make of glossolalia or what glossolalia is as a phenomenon. I would recommend in addition to that William Samarin's study \\"Tongues of Men and Angels.\\""},{"Title":"Psychology of Speaking in Tongues","review":"I would not begin to \\"review\\" a commentary on a Scriptural act, unless I was willing to intensely look into Scripture myself and study the subject matter. I don't care what psychological studies say about speaking in tongues. Psychology is the study of the soul, speaking in tongues (when genuine) is a Spiritual manifestation of the Holy Spirit within us (Romans 8: 26; 1 Corinthians 14: 2). How can it be \\"learned\\" in the natural, if it is a spontaneous Holy Spiritual act within us? How can healings be learned by the natural? How can miracles be learned by the natural? How can casting out of demons be learned in a world filled with them? But by Christ, thru His Holy Spirit! If the Bible is true, then man is a liar (Romans 3: 4). The soul and the spirit (in Hebrew nephesh and ruach, respectively), two very different and unrelated organs of man. One relates to the world, the other to the spiritual things. One understands (or attempts to), the other knows. Now, glossolalia is quite Scriptural and to be found quiet frequently in the book of Acts; as Jesus said \\"a sign to those who follow Me\\" (Mark 16: 17). Yes, Paul did \\"seem\\" to cite it bellow \\"prophecy,\\" but he also \\"spoke in tongues\\" more then anyone at Corinth, and wished every believer to also (1 Corinthians 14: 5, 18). You would do better to either stick to secular reviews of worldly things, or read the Scripture when discussing a Scriptural topic. No other book is more \\"understandable, concise, to the point, and informative\\" and while it may indeed by sensational, the Bible is \\"...not based on speculation, emotion, or hearsay but rather on solid empirical data\\" by eye witnesses, spanning millennia. Or maybe, people should just attend a real Holy Ghost filled service and get Baptized in the Spirit, with the evidence of speaking in other tongues as the Holy Spirit gives you the utterance (Mark 16: 17; Acts 2: 1-4; 10: 44-47, 19: 1-7).I would suggest people read the eye witness accounts of Azusa Street by Frank Bartleman, or some of the sermons of William J. Seymour, John G. Lake or Smith Wigglesworth. I strongly recommend the forgotten life of H. B. Garlock, recorded in his autobiographical: Before We Kill and Eat You.

It isn't straight. Except for her nose, Clara sees herself as just a normal 9th grade girl. She definitely isn't one of the popular crowd, but she's perfectly happy with her best friend Gerri. Clara likes acting and cooking, and she gets great grades. Her life, she thinks, is just like everybody else's. Clara Wilson has a lot on her mind. Her best friend, Gerri, has started moving in circles that will never in a million years include Clara. Amos MacKenzie always thought Clara Wilson was one of the prettiest girls in Melville Junior High, but he's never had the courage to approach her. Amos is embarrassed that his father is a milkman, and that his entire family is poor. He hates the way his parents hide their secrets from him. He wishes that something would happen to him, anything to get rid of the boredom of his daily routine. He doesn't much like home these days. His dad's corny questions are bugging him more than usual, and his mom's gone religious for no apparent reason. The Tripp Brothers are the biggest delinquents in town. They smash mailboxes, shoplift groceries, and cruise around in their Seduck (half sedan, half truck). They've just turned their sights on the school's newest, cutest couple. And that can only mean one thing for Clara and Amos, danger."},{"Title":"Crooked","review":"The book Crooked was a good book. I taught that all the characters had a great contrast with one another.

I really enjoyed the description of Charles blue veins popping out, that part completly gave me shivers and made me gag for quiet some time.This book semmed different from others it seemed as if the characters were always in weired situations, dark compeling scenes.

Besides being well written, Crooked is easy to relate to (for young people) and is written at a nice pace. Things never happen too fast and there aren't any slow, boring parts either. The characters are diverse and their interactions seem like something that could actually happen. There is a slight element of cheesy-ness in the dialogue but it is tolerable. All of this makes for a book that is worth reading."},{"Title":"Crooked","review":"My first time through Crooked, I wasn't astonished, but I was satisfied.

The book was a long read but it was well worth it. The whole deal about the Tripp brothers going after Amos and Clara just creeps me out.

I was pleased, but I am a quote gatherer and there were no quotes that jumped out at me this time. A great read in all other respects."},{"Title":"Crooked","review":"Recently, I have read \\"Crooked\\" by the McNeals, and found it to be an over dramatic performance which ended up being somewhat realistic. After all that Clara Wilson (the main character) went through in the book, you'd expect her to catch a break in the end, but, oh no, she doesn't, she almost has the worst thing that could happen to a woman happen to her, but once again she triumphs over the bad guy. So, I'd have to say that this book was not what I had expected, but at least it was somewhat realistic, at least in the depressing parts of the book, which was mostly the whole thing.After all the stating and going on and on about Clara's \\"crooked\\" nose I had expected something more in depth to happen involving her nose. I can see why they titled the book \\"Crooked\\", it was used as a metaphor, but still, it was mostly portrayed by Clara's \\"crooked\\" nose, which was probably the metaphor, meaning: life is not always as one expects, it can have a few \\"bumps\\" and turns, but you have to take what it gives you."},{"Title":"Crooked","review":"The book Crooked is a great read. It is about two students in high school, named Amos Mackenzie and Clara Wilson, whose lives become a thrilling rollercoaster ride after they meet each other.

It dealt with things that I can relate to as a teen, it wasn't about perfect teens who have perfect lives. It showed that everyone has their own problems. It was honest about intimidation, the character could admit he didn't want to do something because he thought he would get beat up or teased. My favorite character was the bad guy Eddie. He wasn't really a bad guy underneath it all though. I kept reading this book and finished in two nights. I suggest y'all read it.

Both the lives are connected, so it makes it not too hard to follow even with the switched view.I liked the problem, and solution of the book. I like how everything is related, and how it all comes together in the end. It really makes the book interesting!Overall, I really liked this book. The story was a good one, the way it was put together.., it was all great! I just wouldn't give it a 5 star because I have to REALLY love a book for that, and there were some parts that I didn't really like! For example, I didn't like how the story went on and on.

First of all, I liked the authors' style of writing because it was unique, and really made the book more interesting. My favorite part of the book was near the end, because that's where everything began to fall into place, and it made me want to keep reading until I finished it. After reading this book I learned that trust is a big part of friendship, and that what's appealing for you might not always be fun for someone else.

Its reviews state it was written in the perspective of two teenagers who find solace in each other after a series of misfortuante events in their lives. To be frank, this book has absolutely no flow. The characters suddenly go from strangers to friends. The language and dialogue is defintely not how a teenager would sound or feel. The reviews of this book are a misrepresentation. AS well, the writing is definitely 180 degrees away from a real teens POV."},{"Title":"Crooked","review":"Crooked. Such a funny word. Does it mean tilted to the side, does it mean not so straight? I think it means both. The characters in this book are so real. They could be people from down the street, or someone you would walk by once in your life. When Amos's dad dies it's tragic. The things that happen from then on just keep going. Clara's parents split up, and then there's the whole Eddie thing. I could not put this book down! You have to read it!"},{"Title":"Crooked","review":"I love the way Crooked was written, and I wouldnt mind reading it again. I loved the different perspectives the author has given each chapter, and I loved how everything was based on real life facts! I mean everything that happened, or was told in the book Crooked, has actually happened to someone. It just fascinates me on how the author can put the facts from life in a book."},{"Title":"Crooked","review":"The book Crooked was a great book that was about a girl namedClara Wilson. Clara is a 15 year old girl who is having many troubles with her social life. She loses her best friend when her friend is accepted by a group that Clara will never be in. Along with her social life disasters her parents are having difficulties. Her father is always out of town and her mother doesn't know what to do with herself. When her mother gets offered a job in Spain Clara has no idea what she should do next.Then she meets a boy named Amos Mackenzie who, it seems, is having the same problems she is having. He had lost his father of cancer and, just like clara, has no idea of what to do next. When these pair meet up the trouble begins.I liked this book a lot because it was a book that people my age can relate to. I also liked it because it is very realistic because the things that happen in this book happen in real life. The only thing that you have to watch for is the change of view points which happen every chapter."},{"Title":"Crooked","review":"Clara Wilson and Amos MacKenzie battle the subtle ferocity of life in their small town as they explore love for the first time with each other. Clara-desperately insecure about her crooked nose-usually keeps to herself, in turn keeping her family and personal problems bottled up inside as well. Throughout the novel, most of the characters at some time or another want to share all their concerns and intimate problems, yet the adult world in the McNeals' book is unbelievably unaware of the stress these teens are going through.The emotional landscape of this novel is hauntingly realistic. With the terrible Tripp brothers lurching behind any chances of Clara and Amos' happiness, the protagonists are constantly fighting to keeping their heads above water and keep from drowning in a pool of pathos. Yes, sounds quite dramatic. Well, it is. This is not a book for the timid; however, it must also be noted that this novel does not contain gratuitous violence or explicit sex scenes, it sneaks up on the reader with the powerful force of its psychological plot. Clara and Amos' fight to not become victims in a world where their lives are controlled by nearly everyone other than themselves. This is an excellent novel about survival, love, and making the best out of what you've got."},{"Title":"Crooked","review":"As suspenseful, dark, and dreadfully realistic as Robert Cormier's work, \\"Crooked\\" takes the reader into the lives of two freshmen who are sympathetic characters. Not only are the characters likeable but the themes in the book are universal: negative body images, cowardism and bravery, coping with loss and divorce, beginning adolescent romantic relationships, and cliques. The twists in the plot are also engaging in that there are no clear trouble-free paths connecting the characters with their goals. Just like real life's various journeys during our teen years, \\"Crooked\\" offers no easy ride. The conclusion is well worth your time as well. Recommended audience: 14 and up."},{"Title":"Crooked","review":"A great book but very slow paced. I really liked the changing of characters for each chapter. AWESOME!!!!!"},{"Title":"Crooked","review":"I thought that Crooked was a really good book. The characters' personalities were easy to get to know, which made it a lot easier to get into the book. I liked how Clara and Amos had almost the same situations at home, so they could share their feelings with eachother and help eachother out. It was interesting that right after amos' accident with the Tripp brothers, he suddenly became very popular. I'm glad that amos and Clara hooked up, they're a really good couple."},{"Title":"Crooked","review":"As a teacher at the middle school level, I can well understand the insecurities and emotional changes inherent in adolescents. While I was reading Crooked, I was struck by the absolute reality of the intense feelings that Clara and Amos had about absolutely everything. This, added to the parallel happenings both in their home lives (his father's death and her mother's disappearance) and in their outside worlds, (his being stalked and her misplaced attraction to the stalker) kept me turning the pages. I have wholeheartedly recommended Crooked to the school librarian and to students of both my drama and English classes. I have also recommended Crooked to friends who would like to better interpret and appreciate the ups and downs of the young adult. We anxiously await the next McNeal book!"},{"Title":"Crooked","review":"Clara's fixation with her crooked nose helped me remember when I refused to smile because of my crooked teeth for about four years starting at about 12. I related well to the problems of a ninth grader even though it's been many years. McNeals made their main characters real people. Places were uniquely genuine. I'd recommend this to all young adult readers. A former sophomore English teacher in Utah."},{"Title":"Crooked","review":"I throughly enjoyed this book. For me, it never faltered. Yes, I scanned over some parts but it never hindered the story. The story presented real characters with real problems. It showed how people can be mean, funny, or selfish. And that is what I like about it. It was real. During the whole story, it never appeared like any of it was contrived simply because it was constantly going. And the third person narrative allows for the reader to make their own decisions on how a sitution was handled. And at the same time, it allows you delve into both Clara's world and Amos's World."},{"Title":"Crooked","review":"My daughter gave me this book to read and I enjoyed it very much. I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys YA books."},{"Title":"Crooked","review":"Even though I am well beyond the ninth grade, I found this book to be utterly delightful. It captured the very essence of my tumultous teenage years filled with insecurities and confusion. Although I did not suffer from a crooked nose, as Clara did, I could feel her pain in my remembrance of (perceived) physical defects with which I had to bear. I, too, wanted desperately to have friendships with classmates who treated me poorly, yet, I persisted in pursuing their approval. Throughout the book, I found that I could easily identify with the struggles with which Clara, Amos, and Bruce had to deal, whether they were with family tragedies, school issues, or peer pressure. And in the end, I was reminded of the true essence of beauty and personal worth, which brought a smile to my face and to my heart. I eagerly await future works from the McNeals!"},{"Title":"Survey of Accounting.","review":"This textbook was very informative and it helped me to better understand the accounting concepts that was discussed in my class."},{"Title":"Survey of Accounting.","review":"This is an interesting and detailed book.

In tiny and hesitant hints sprinkled here and there, Malcolm Bell tells us that Britain, after independence, was no longer the West's foremost slaveholding nation. The Revolution removed 600,000 slaves from the British Empire so that by 1814 the United States, in effect, was the West's greatest slaveholding nation, though Bell does not quite dare to use that description. The story he tells deals with the fate of these slaves in general and, in particular, with the thousands of slaves owned by the Butler family over four generations.Likewise, the book does not perpetuate the myth that the Revolution and the Constitution created a government of the people, by the people, and for the people. From the perspective of the Butler family, it created, more accurately, a government of the dynasties, by the dynasties, and for the dynasties. Five generations of the Butler dynasty are given roughly equal coverage with the slaves. Thus, this book describes dynastic upwellings originating in Britain with Major Pierce Butler and eventually stretching from Georgia and South Carolina to Philadelphia, Boston, France and Switzerland. Nearly all imaginable dynastic interests interplay: political, economic, as well as familial ones down to the education of the off-springs. Interwoven are the important relationships of the Butler aristocrats with their plantation managers like Roswell King.The chapters dealing with slavery tell the heartless tale of the servitude of blacks. Living in filfth and unsanitary conditions, their mistreatment was unrelenting, yet they bore their fate with surprising dignity and unexpected occasional loyalty to their masters. Their humaneness outshines the character qualities of their owners. Nevertheless, while receiving equal focus, even empathic treatment, they do not come to life like the major stars of this dynastic book. The latter associate with the famous and powerful and, thus, this book also sheds light on George Washington, Benjamin Rush, Charles Lyell, the famous British geologist who decisively influenced Darwin, Thomas Pinckney, Thaddeus Steven who condemned Pierce Butler in 1848 for having slaves by likening him to an insignificant insect, and Henry James.By 1859, a heavily indebted Butler estate caused the gang sale of the slaves. It was weeping time and chattel slavery, the worst form, permitted slaves to be sold individually, ripping families apart. It recalls the observation of a European visitor in 1835 who emphatically stated upon witnessing a slave auction \\"you call this the land of liberty and every day things occur at which the despots of Europe would recoil in horror.\\"Bell draws from massive primary sources, diaries, steamship records, newspapers, legal records, etc. and allows the reader to draw his/her own conclusions. He does not develop the theme of humans as commodities that is the crucial underpinnings of slavery and which surfaced in indentured immigrant servitude and in subtle elements of America's economic processes of subordinating humans to corporate interest far too excessively, even in the recent transmogrification of former depts. of personnel into \\"Human Resource Department.\\" The view of humans as commodities pulsates throughout society and surfaces even in organized sports, the military, the educational system, etc. Had Bell dared to expand the theme of humans as commodities, his superb book would have acquired brilliance."},{"Title":"How to Massage Your Dog","review":"I was severely disappointed with book. It has entertaining cartoons, with virtually no usable information for individuals wishing to take the subject seriously, or even just wishing to get good basic info on canine massage."},{"Title":"How to Massage Your Dog","review":"An amusing little book that is useful in helping the loving dog owner give and receive physical relaxation from their pet. It isn't a medical or chiropractic guide to the canine but rather has humorous cartoons and three simple techniques to get started in massaging your dog. A conversation starter and an interesting inexpensive gift for the Holidays. Origins stores are featuring this @ list price with dog biscuits as a Christmas gift."},{"Title":"How to Massage Your Dog","review":"I agree with the other reviewers that the pictures in this book are good, but they are probably the highlight in a very basic and intuitive book that provides very little information. I happen to be a licensed massage therapist, so I may be a little hard when it comes to critiquing this book, but the book suggests using OIL to massage your dog! I can't imagine my dogs enjoying that, plus they have plenty of oil on their coats that you shouldn't need that. I would not reccommend this book because you can basically figure out most of these techniques on your own. Take a lot at other books that are published on the subject. It's not worth the money or the money to ship."},{"Title":"How to Massage Your Dog","review":"This book isn't meant as an in-depth guide to massaging your dog, but provides humor with some simple techniques. The couple of techniques I've tried on my dogs seem to meet with their approval :-).

Jim is a very close friend of mine, not only is he college educated, when I asked him about his choice of words he intentionally picked the word associated with a strong sense of right or wrong, ie driving while overly tired a bad decision for anyone. But this reader is dead wrong about the overall content of his book. I loved it as have many, many other readers. Some people are just plain anal retentive I guess, for the rest of us this book is a great escape from the real world. So Michelle K. get a grip. The rest of us look forward to the next book by Jim. To each his/her own but being mean is just not a good quality."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Monster","review":"From the time I got the book until I turned the last page I could not stop reading.

I would agree there are editing issues BUT for a first time author the story line was original and thought provoking. I loved it. Although the sex was steamy it was not over done or dsigusting as some of the more well known authors have gotten. I mean some of the stuff they write is way over the top. This book however is grounded in a sense and sensibility that I hope shines through in the next book that this author writes. I would tell anyone who likes Vampires to get a copy. It really is good to the last word."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Monster","review":"Who knew this kind of storyline was still out there. I have to admit I wish there was a little better editing but the story got me hook, line and vampire. The more I read the more I wanted to read. Malcolm pulls you into him like smoke in a chimney and yet when it is all said and done you want to know more about all of them. The book rocks no matter how you look at it for a new and first time author I am glad I purchased the book and I have since bought some for Christmas gifts. I hope this is not the end of these characters I eagerly await something else from them."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Monster","review":"It really took me a while to buy this book, as I read this genre all the time and particularly like to get a true feeling for an author before purchasing the book. So when I thought the time was right I bit the bullet and ordered it...I was so surprised by the vivid imagination of this author. The scenes are set in a style that is both refreshing and rewarding. I found it easy to dive into the storyline and felt like I was in touch with the characters. Since it is a vamapire story there was sex of many varieties and although graphic, they were not overtly gross or demeaning. There are editing issues, but the story shined through for me and I have told all my friends to pick up a copy. I hope there will be more from this author in near future, I visited his webiste and saw there is a sequel in the works, however there is no time table given. I hope it is well on its way to us the readership."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Monster","review":"My friend told me about the book and I reallly like vampires and although it is very detailed i think it is a good book.

I was delighted every page made me want to keep reading. Then I read the other review and this book although not the best book in the world, is most definitely not the worse one. I agree there could have been stronger editing in areas but anyone who wants to read a vampire story with out sex, does not need to read about vampires for that is the innate desire of the blood in them. The vampires in this book are real to life and can have you thinking they live next door to you. I have now passed this book to several of my friends and they loved it as well and even gave some a gifts. I can tell you that it has been a long time since I would walk through a novel and see everything that was going on. The storyline here left me wanting more and the sex scenes were not overly done and hardly graphic, but they were STEAMY and for that I was happy.

I wanted to be the release he so longed for, and then he was out, alive away from the monster who held him captive. From here the story was out of control, I would not let myseld take a break from the action, it was coming at me from all directions, Sarh, Malcolm, Celeena, The Vampire, the witch and the werewolf, I was in heaven and sweet realease was promised as I engulfed each word for what it was pure and simple promise of something more to come.

Both my daughter and son have taken the time to contact Jim online at his website and are thrilled to be able to talk with. WE all like the book although vampires are not what I would normally buy I did read the book as did my wife. We agree it was different yet very appealing. Thank you again Jim for taking the time.

If you write, or have thought about writing it is an arduous task at best. I am aware of many of the idiosyncrasies throughout the novel, BUT make no mistake I used conscience(a sense of right or wrong) purposefully over conscious(wide awake) to reinforce the fact that Ethen is overly tired and thus making a terrible decision to drive. Never the less, I have learned a tremendous amount from all of you both friends and foes alike and I will use the information from you all to refine the next novel and improve the storyline. I am thrilled to have the opportunity to have my book in the publuic and I will never feel bad for the effort I have put into it. I will not be dettered by anyone in my goal to improve both my craft and my characters. I love to write and daily I engage myself in that task. I am not perfect, yet I continue to put down in ink the thoughts of the lives of the characters I have dominion over. I am excited with each new page and I shall forever write. For those of you who have found me on the web or visited me at a signing THANK YOU. For those of you who have nothing good to say, THANK YOU as well, I do learn from the wisdom in your words once the animosity is erased.Lastly, \\"Life from the Blood Pool\\" is in the completion stage and I look forward to the text going to press.

When someone or something enters his room and is there to kidnap him fear erodes his emotional balance and sets in motion a spellbinding novel with strong character driven to make you want to read.

If this has happened to you: DON'T!! The first sentence was a shock: \\"It is amazing what your mind will bring into conscience thought while you drive.\\" 'Oh, my GOD, I thought. This is a kid who doesn't know the word 'conscious' from 'conscience.' I'm in trouble!' It got much, much worse. So nightmarishly badly penned that I would have believed it was conceived and executed by a 12-year old. Now I have to wonder what I DID to Amazon to make them believe I have such low literary standards!? If you buy this book, no matter how much you enjoy vampire novels or works of naivete, believe me, you won't make it past the first chapter, and THAT will be an agony.If it were possible to rate this a 'zero,' I would. Please send this kid to an English class, QUICKLY. I fear for the sanity of a nation otherwise."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Monster","review":"This is a great book if you like vampire stories. Although not as detailed and developed as something like Anne Rice's The Vampire LeStat, there is plenty of action, mystery and romance to keep you turning those pages.

Take the time to read this thrilling book. You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Monster","review":"For me the idea of a vampire this compelled to be with his family or the family he creates is an idea first. I read the book as a result of myfriends birhtyday present to me. I have always enjoyed vampires and this was no exception. The world revealed in the book shows a imagination fresh and full of ideas yet to be seen with vampires. Lastly, the mix of witches and wereanimals was a pleasant surpriese, I had not expected that. I tell all my friends to read this book, although it does not follow a typical storyline it kept my attention all the way until the end. It was nice to learn there will be a sequel to the story which i am waiting for."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Monster","review":"You need only read the jumbled, nonsensical summary of this book to see why the author had to go to PublishAmerica to get this thing in print. And someone really, really ought to tell him that complimenting his own book and plugging it in reviews of other peoples' books is probably not the hottest idea around."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Monster","review":"This has to be the most poorly written, sophomoric vampire book ever published. And how it ever got published is a complete mystery. I managed to read only three chapters before giving up in disgust. Then I read the reviews on Amazon and thought I had maybe not given the writer enough of a chance -- although I got the impression that all of the reviews were written by the same person using different names. So I read another three chapters -- a total waste of 10 minutes. My advice? Save your money. There are some super vampire books out there. This just isn't one of them."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Monster","review":"At first I did not want to get this book, but another friend of me told it was good so I decided to read it. They told me it was not a blood and guts kind of vampire book and that I would like it. Guess what I tried it and I liked it. I think anyone who reads the book will find it surprisingly twisted with more turns than you can imagine."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Monster","review":"This is the worst book that I have EVER read in my life. I read this book a couple years ago. It was so bad that I couldn't even finish it. In fact I was only able to get through one chapter. It was clearly self-published because there is no publishing house on earth that would publish something so badly written. It was full of typos and was a grammatic nightmare. When I bought this book, there were some wonderful reviews about it. I must assume that these were all written by the author's families and friends. And the book description was clearly written by the author as well. I think that is a shame. I asked for my money back after buying this book. And I would suggest that others save their money for a book that it worth the time and cash spent. Zero stars in my opinion."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Monster","review":"Unfortunately this book is badly written, excruciatingly so. It has some good ideas but they are laid out as if the author was making a list rather than communicating his ideas to the reader. Maybe a good editor and a couple of rewrites could have fixed it, I don't know. I read a lot of paranormal stuff and I usually finish any book I start, including some pretty mediocre romances and science fiction, but this one...I just couldn't do it. Sorry, it's going straight to the book swap - maybe someone else can enjoy it."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Monster","review":"I was alittle dissapointed in this book..my friend readit and recommended it to me.

Who would think that a vampire story could get me so excited. I never read this kind of stuff as I did not think I would like it. I got the book from my girlfriend for my birthday and I could not put it down.

I wanted to believe in him and the love he has for his family. If you have not bought this book you should."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Monster","review":"I think vampies rock, totally. My sister hit me up with this book for my b-day and she was right on target. The vamps and witches and shifters kept me glued to my chair until the last word was read. I have read most of the big names and this story was original and reeled into the world of Malcolm and his children of the night. Although alot of people think of vampires and the stories that go with them as merely heartless killers that was just not the case here, not only is the storyline unique, this is the first time I have ever read about vampires such as these. I was happy when my internet searches turned up information on the upcoming book in this series. I anxiously await the return of Malcolm. Kudos to this first time author."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Monster","review":"I ordered this book and forgot that it was coming in with the Holiday rush. Soon after the book arrived I settled in for the evening with a glass of red wine and started what was to become a love affair with Malcolm. I love vampires and although I know they are not real, this book made me want them to take me into the coven and allow me to become part of the secret society of Vamps. I told all of my friends about this book and so far three of my co-workers have ordered thier own copies and they said they loved it as well. It was nice to read an original story and also to know that more will come from this author get your copy and enter the new world of Blood Drinking. Oh yeah Sarah aint too bad either!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Monster","review":"I was a huge Ann Rice and Vampire Chronicles fan and quickly found myself searching for other books along that same line. I finally gave up years ago after finding any others I read either plain boring or in some cases just silly.

Congratulations and keep these books coming!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Monster","review":"I couldn't put this book down once I started reading it.

I like all the rest have read the more prominent writers in thi genre and have enjoyed them but felt something was lacking, now maybe I have found a new author. The roler coaster this book took me was worth the ride. I would tell all of you to get a copy it is worth the read.

Although I never read this specific genre I found myself intrigued enough to order the book. Although I feel there are things that could be improved I also feel the first go around for any author is difficult at best. I liked the premise of the story, I know vampires are eccentric in nature and this book reveals them in that light. I also found the blending of witches and other worldly beings refreshing. Even if someone thinks this novel moves like a cartoon all the more reason to find escape from the reality of the world in this true to life fantasy.

Entertaining, thought provoking and very sensusal without too much smut. I hope there is more from this writer as I am telling everyone I know to get a copy, the sooner the better. I have opened up to this genre more than I ever thought I would, the character interaction in this novel is over the top, I think I am in love with Sarah who would have thought a vimpiress and a witch with so much to offer the mortal men of the world.

Since I know how hard it is to write and to get someone else to read the your work I thought the lower starred reviews were harsh considering the writes themselves are not puclished...

A friend told me about \\"Memoirs of a Monster\\" so I logged on the web and here we went. I was so happy when the book arrived. Reading about vampires and detectives and lustful love in this manner was unbelievable. I eagerly await the second book. I have also sent my book to the author via his website to have it signed.

This book with the lengthy title of Lineage and Descendants of Joseph Sommer and Elisabeth Barbe Garber: The Beckler and Stuckey and allied families Augspurger, Beller, Boller, Burkey, Ernst, ... Stutzman, Troyer, Yoder, Yordy, etc. was compiled by Grace Hilty Croft Christensen. It is a genealogist's gem filled with information about the listed families. Many family historians and genealogists contributed data to this publication, so there is no author as such.

These materials include Bear Flag Lieutenant, The Life Story of Henry L. Ford (1951), Montgomery and the Portsmouth (1958), and William Brown Ide, Bear Flagger (1962). All of these volumes provide quality research and discussion of Bear Flag Revolt related events and persons, and including the Bear Flag itself. I recommend all of these works.The present work also has the significance of being only the second work of substantial value written about William Brown Ide; the other(s) being the biography(ies) written in the 1880s by Simeon Ide, William's brother.William B. Ide was a significant player in the California Bear Flag Revolt of 1846; the writer of its \\"Proclamation;\\" and an active participant in California events until his untimely death in 1852.

Essentially the authors's subjective interpretation of the nine tenths. If they had actually known Oscar Levant, their opinions might have some relevance. They didn't know him.

Perhaps this is because he lived for so much longer. Probably it is because of Levant's numerous talents other than music.Because Levant was so social and knew so many of the luminaries of the arts of his time, this book pulls in a nice glimpse of the New York arts scene, MGM's Hollywood in the 40's &amp; 50's, the U.S. classical music scene, and growing up Jewish in New York in the 20's.Last but not least, Levant was a notorious wit; he was so funny that he could afford to be obnoxious and insulting and still count on being a welcome guest in the homes of his many friends. This biography captures such wit, and is entertainingly written (with tongue firmly in cheek) in its own right.I am among those who prefer to not focus on Levant's later addiction to prescription drugs; such a living hell would seem to be too much a sad and undeserving fate for one of America's great entertainers and quirky geniuses. Here too, the subject matter is handled sensitively but unflinchingly.The authors of this book have done a womderful job in fully depicting a very deserving and overdue subject: the life of Oscar Levant."},{"Title":"A Talent for Genius: The Life and Times of Oscar Levant","review":"I first developed an interest in Oscar Levant after reading about him in &quot;Harpo Speaks&quot;. Since that time, I've read all of his three books, have listened to two of his albums, followed by the reading of this book.This book is one of the best biographies I have ever read. It reveals the good, bad, and the ugly of Levant's character. The authors spend a little too much ink playing the role of psychoanalyst, but most of what they offer seems to make sense regarding Levant's wild behaviors.Overall, this is a fascinating book. Levant was a true original, and this book does an excellent job of filling in the empty spaces of Levant's autobiographies."},{"Title":"A Talent for Genius: The Life and Times of Oscar Levant","review":"These two biographers have done a superb job reconstructing a life that Oscar himself was content (for an audience) to remember with zingers and one-liners. Anyone who has read Levant's hugely popular, now out of print, memoirs, knows that Oscar Levant was a sad, strange man with a razor wit and many compulsions and addictions. Perhaps this book's greatest gift is to show that he was also a decent, even sweet and thoughtful, man of great musical talent who deserves remembering."},{"Title":"A Talent for Genius: The Life and Times of Oscar Levant","review":"In the opening chapter of this book the authors describe the home from which Levant came, and his Pittsburg childhood. On his mother's side they were both a very musical family, and one which had 'sarcasm and humor ' as an unending part of their talking with each other. The roots of Levant's later work are clearly in this childhood, and his specially close connection with his mother's family. Also the lively Pittsburgh world of the time, including the Colwell Street brothel and the teeming immigrant-filled streets were an essential part of the education of this very street- wise classical musician.Levant's life involved a number of very great successes. He was a composer of more than talent, and of course arguably the best interpreter of his friend Gershwin's music.He could be quite nasty , and a louse but it seems that many were willing to forgive him , perhaps because they appreciated his great difficulties in life. One of his famous sayings is something like, \\" They threw me out of the insane asylum because I was making everyone there depressed\\"Levant had a career not only as classical pianist and composer, but also as TV talk- show host, and much later towards the end ' guest' on the Jack Paar show. He worked with the great musicians of his time. After a short first marriage he had a thirty - five year marriage to the singer June Gale. The couple had three children.What is to say finally about a man who had so much talent, did so many things, but also suffered so much and was not particularly loveable many times?Who else but him could have given us,\\"Roses are redViolets are blueI am a schizophrenicand so am I \\""},{"Title":"A Talent for Genius: The Life and Times of Oscar Levant","review":"If one is a fan of Oscar Levant, I highly recommend looking into this book. The authors of this book had the amazing ability to work with Levant's wife, June, before she passed away helping to add any information that Oscar left out of his three autobioghraphies.A fascinating figure of the twentieth century, the book highlights Levant's many talents as well as his many flaws and dark moments. The end of the book will surely touch your heart as well as break it as one dives into the complex life of this amazing, tortured, genius.Only qualm would be the lack of explaination with certain phrases or words that then requires extra research (example, the word Pirandelloish, which in actuallity is not a word, but one Oscar made up)."},{"Title":"A Talent for Genius: The Life and Times of Oscar Levant","review":"Let's make no bones about it; Oscar Levant ended up a hopeless addict. I really doubt that his life could have been turned around through intervention programs. This books spells it out. It digs down deep into Levants soul, and is very honest at that. It's pretty hard to find good research on Oscar. This, so far, is as best as it comes. However, I'd like to see more; i.e., his 3 daughters. Much of this book is rehashed material. Some is unique."},{"Title":"A Talent for Genius: The Life and Times of Oscar Levant","review":"About nine-tenths of this comes directly from Oscar Levant's three memoirs. That doesn't make it plagiarism, I suppose, since the \\"derivation\\", to put it charitably, is more or less (less, actually) acknowledged. It does make it copying someone else's biographies. (An AUTObiography is, after all, a biography.) It also makes reading this a chore for anyone interested enough in the subject to want to get the story from the horse's mouth. (And if you aren't that interested even, WHY are you bothering with THIS?) I deduct three stars.I deduct a fourth star for this book's abuse of the English language with solecisms such as \\"germophobe\\" and \\"homophobe\\". (If \\"homophobe\\" were a word it would mean \\"clinical fear of sameness\\". The author wants it to mean misohomosexualism, hatred of homosexuals, -- someone I know maintains that \\"homophobe\\" is no worse than \\"chocoholic\\", which is rather like saying that Attila the Hun was no worse than Adolf Hitler.)I deduct a fifth star for its politically correct pseudo-psychological speculation. It proffers the theory that Oscar Levant remarked upon the libretto of covertly homosexual minor composer Marc Blitzstein's heavy-handed socialist opera \\"The Cradle Will Rock\\"'s \\"pseudo virility\\" (Levant's phrase) in order to mask Levant's supposed homosexual attraction to George Gershwin. Au contraire, mon frere: 1) Marc Blitzstein did not even WRITE this opera's libretto; he only wrote its music, and Levant PRAISED its music. 2) Levant's assessment of this opera happens to adhere closely to the critical consensus. 3) There is no evidence whatsoever that Levant had any homosexual tendencies, and it is absurd and perverse to suggest that Levant's obvious, though severely qualified, admiration for Gershwin the man, in contradistinction to his even more obvious, and much less qualified, admiration for Gershwin the musician, constitutes evidence.On the other hand, \\"A Talent for Genius\\" is an intriguing title. Too bad the authors never explain what they mean by it.In any case, don't even consider this until you're read \\"A Smattering of Ignorance\\", \\"Memoirs of an Amnesiac\\", and \\"The Unimportance of Being Oscar\\", and then just skim it to try to find its scant new material -- or pass it by completely. Good luck."},{"Title":"A Talent for Genius: The Life and Times of Oscar Levant","review":"Oscar Levant was probably the funniest and most entertaining man I ever saw as the host of a TV talk show. His show I think was called \\"The Oscar LevantShow\\" and was on late night TV probably on channel13 PBS in the late 60s. My favorite quote of Oscar -- \\"When I was young I looked like Al Capone but lacked his compassion\\"The book is first rate and of course I knew nothing about Oscar's piano playing and composing career.I knew one or two of his movie roles and that hewas a big part of the broadway musicals scene inthe 1940s & 50s. Or so it seemed. Finally I knewOscar loved to sleep and he said his ambition waswhen he died he wanted to die in his sleep.The best complement I can give the Kashner Schoen-berger book is it is the bible for Oscar Levant's life.

From that perspective, you do get what you pay for - an inexpensive set of tests that cover a lot of the PMP material and allow you to simulate exam conditions through the CD-ROM.If you are picky about quality, then just keep in mind the following:1. On the CD-ROM, there were several questions that had the wrong answer marked as the right answer.2. There were also several questions that had an entirely different question's explanations listed which did not relate to the question at hand at all.3. On the CD-ROM, some of the explanations tend to be too simplistic or just useless. For example, some of them just state \\"Choice X is incorrect.\\" There were many explanations that explained what was wrong logically (Ex: \\"A is not the same as B\\"), but did not go the next step in explaining how the answer fits with PMI's methodology.Those are my caveats, however, I feel that overall, for the money, this book delivered what I was after."},{"Title":"PMP Practice Questions Exam Cram 2","review":"The CD did not work - I was using my work pc and the disc required that it make \\"changes to my computer.\\" I was unable to allow this since I did not have administrative rights to my machine.So I had to do the questions in the book.

Here are my thoughts:1) A number of readers are indicating certain material was focused on the prior version of the exam. I've noticed that Amazon has placed both the Exam Cram I and II book reviews together, and suspect that there might be some reviews that are referring to the Exam Cram I book utilized for the newer exam.2) I found the book to be very beneficial in that it is laid out by the 5 process groups (Initiating, Planning, Executing, etc.) + Project Management Framework and Professional Responsibility. The format and layout of the book, with the questions organized by knowledge areas within each chapter, is quite good and the questions are in the ballpark of what you're likely to see on the exam.3) In studying for the MCSE, CCNA, Series 7, and Series 24, I am a HUGE fan of questions and the book comes through with 500 practice questions for around $25.00. The questions helped surface areas (for me) that I missed or didn't absorb with the PMBOK and Mulcahy books and overall, added to my understanding of what the exam will be looking for in the way of the \\"right\\" answer.4) Yes, I did notice maybe a couple of incorrect (odd) answers or answers that didn't quite sync with the question that was asked. I'd say, maybe there were 10 +/- of those, so the book is not 100% perfect, but that should not detract from the other 490 good questions.5) The answers, in some instances could have elaborated a bit more.6) Overall, I'm very glad I purchased the book and went through every question.

For me, I think the questions forced me to really think in depth about how PMI views the many aspects of project management.The CD was the most useful for me (the book is just the CD questions organized by topic) but it did have some limitations. There was no apparent way to go through the questions in chunks with out repeatedly seeing some/many questions you'd seen before, so I ended up just plowing through all 500 questions over a few days. I didn't find the timed version of the exam particularly useful. Several of the questions (maybe 9 or 10) had \\"correct\\" answers that were clearly wrong, sometimes with explanations that were targeted to different questions. Also, many of the questions had misdirection built in that wasn't evident on the actual PMP exam. The practice results didn't really reflect my readiness for the exam very well; my average percent correct was about 12 points higher on the PMP exam than it was with the questions on the CD.But even with those limitations, the thought processes that were forced by the questions on the CD were invaluable in preparing for the exam.

I have read a lot of books about the Yankees and this one was easily one of the most entertaining.Lou has a great sense of humor and I appreciated his opinions on players, managers and ownership. However, I now see Lou in a new light. He shows himself to be very concerned with money in this book, as well as a habit of running to ownership and management.... breaking the clubhouse code.I have heard the rumors before. Lou was Goerge's Inside Man who could be counted on to gossip about Billy Martin and other Yankee players to earn \\"Favorite\\" status. And it's all in here. To Lou's credit, he did explain some of these stories, but he often makes himself out to be the victim. This habit of being a company man did earn Lou a manager's job with the Yankees, but he couldn't win it all in New York as a manager, something that Billy Martin could do and I wonder if Lou has ever thought about that while spouting on and on about Billy Martin in his book, and no doubt to the Yankee brass while he was Hitting Coach.One thing that I actually did feel bad for Lou about was when the Yankees made him Manager-in-waiting during the season. This put unfair pressure on him and to Billy Martin's credit, he didn't hold it against Lou. It must have been hard on Lou, but ultimatley he didn't have the true backbone or loyalty that Billy Martin had, and let's face it... Lou saw a carrot at the end of a rope and he did what he had to do to ensure his career as a manager at the expense of Billy.Regardless of my own feelings about Lou, I still think that this book is great and should be read by baseball fans everywhere. As for me, I'm glad that this clown isn't associated with the Yankees anymore (although I bet you he still wishes he was), but I'll gladly read his books which I'm sure is the only thing he really cares about anyway. With Lou, it all boils down to his money."},{"Title":"Sweet Lou","review":"Very interesting but anyone on that Yankees team was interesting.Lou gives a look into his life that keeps you entertained.I hope he someday writes a sequel to give us a look at him as the Manager, the great Manager, he is."},{"Title":"Heavy metal erotic special: [Horacio Altuna's humorous look at adult situations]","review":"AMAZON DOES NOT HAVE THIS IN STOCK, BUT IT IS AVAILABLE ON THE HEAVY METAL SITE AND IS WELL WORTH THE PURCHASE PRICE.

It is also about the death of the balance of power and the decline of both France and Austria-Hungary. The focus of the book is what leaders were thinking, how they pursued their goals, and the outcome of their machinations and wars, most petty, some major. This approach (diplomatic history) contrasts sharply with analytic or narrative histories whose principal aims include the search for broad trends, the interpretation of deeper causes, and portraits of culture and everyday life. Instead, here, you get what the powerful were trying to do, literally from moment to moment. For myself, while fascinating in many aspects and essential, I found it pretty dry as a reading experience.The beginning of the period, in the wake of the 1848 revolutions, marks the end of a long period of \\"revolutionary diplomacy\\", whereby the ideals of the French Revolution influenced many diplomatic actions. Napoleon III seized power and concentrated on more traditional balance of power diplomacy, as head of the most powerful nation-state at the time. The Brits were content to develop on their own, only stepping into continental entanglements when they could no longer avoid it. Russia, Austria-Hungary and Turkey were in perhaps terminal decline, though clinging to the perquisites of power in their respective multi-ethnic autocracies, in which nationalistic ambitions of an astonishing array of players were threatening them with territorial dissolution. In the effort to unify the country, Italy was having its own revolution. The great wild card was Prussia, at the beginning of the period a small kingdom that, under the leadership of a strategic genius, Bismarck, was slowly consolidating its hold over a vast territory of Germanic speakers; it was a nation in birth, a coming industrial superpower with a huge population that would irrevocably shatter the balance of power.Until 1870, these powers struggled for the typical fruits of the time: gaining territories, trade rights, and any number of privileges or concessions from each other. The complexity of these concerns is daunting and almost without exception obscure, but they were indeed the principal concerns of the leaders of the time. When disputes reached a certain point of impasse, they were often resolved by small-scale war, giving the victor the spoils of whatever was demanded, be it passage into and out of the Black Sea, domination of Poland, or control of the Suez Canal for trade with Asia. The book attempts to cover every single one of these disputes, showing exactly what was contemplated in chronological succession and the what happened in the end. Some readers seem to like this detail, and the gist is important to understand, but a lot of it is historical trivia of little interest, at least in my estimation.Each power was juggling so many interests that the whole is like a dark forest of thorny complexities, obscure secret agreements, and tenuous alliances of mutual benefit. It was like they were all playing chess on the same board - some controlling the major pieces, some smaller ones, all in potential conflict or cooperation at one time but not another. Another analogy that comes to mind is competing LEGO constructions in a limited space, each player endowed with its own array of pieces that they traded and fought over or used collaboratively.Beyond the petty wars (to 1870), there were 3 major engagements that led to decisive consequences. 1) The Crimean War removed Russia as a top-tier player until after WWII. 2) The Prussian victory over Austria-Hungary reduced the latter, with all its ethnic divisions, to a dependent power, ratifying German domination of central EUrope. 3) In 1870, France also fell from the top tier, when it capitulated to Prussia after a brief war.The Conference of Berlin led to the longest period of peace in Europe since the Roman Empire. Over the next 40-odd years, European diplomats played the game of the balance of power, all the while investing in the new determinants of power: commerce, heavy industry (in particular steel production), and military technology; they avoided outright war. The two greatest achievers in this realm were Great Britain (with its mechanized navy) and Germany (split between navy and ground forces), leaving others behind in one or more areas. They created innumerable systems of alliances, peacekeeping, and trade, but all for the traditional parochial reasons. It should be noted that many of their motivations were face-saving and for appearance and prestige, for they had to take public opinion increasingly into consideration. This added to inflexibility.The outbreak of WWI is part of a long discussion in the book. This was one of the most interesting dissections of diplomatic detail that I have ever read. According to Taylor, the bottom line was that the various powers thought the war would be short and decisive. Germany wanted to dominate Europe and thought it could do so by aggrandizing its territories. France, Russia, and Great Britain feared this and hoped to preserve the balance of power to their advantage. Austria Hungary and Turkey wanted to maintain the integrity of their territories from splitting into ethno-linguistic nation states. Oddly, none of the major powers seemed to have any clear goals, backup plans, or even coherent strategies, but went into it as a way to impose solutions to their advantage by force rather than diplomacy - that is, the way things had been done prior to 1870, but with far more advanced military machines that mobilized not just whole populations but industrial economies. Once started, no one could back down and it became a catastrophic war of attrition, bringing in the USA and ending the era of EUropean domination of the world. That brings us to 1918.I believe Taylor's interpretation of the European modus operandi - the fight to maintain yet disrupt the balance of power - is correct. What I missed was a lively narrative with biographical texture and descriptive detail. I know that that is not part of the strict discipline of diplomatic history, but potential readers should be aware of this.Recommended. It is a fundamental text, but something of a chore to read."},{"Title":"The struggle for mastery in Europe, 1848-1918 (Oxford history of modern Europe)","review":"I have read this three time.

Un libro para releer."},{"Title":"The struggle for mastery in Europe, 1848-1918 (Oxford history of modern Europe)","review":"What A. J. P. Taylor's The Struggle for Mastery in Europe suffers from in being nearly fifty years old, it more than makes up for in style. It is a riveting book that is smattered with wit and an author's thorough knowledge of his subject. Alternate titles might have been The Struggle to Prevent the Mastery of Europe, or the Decline and Fall of the Balance of Power.Taylor's unyielding faith in diplomacy reflects a Cold War notion that any political problem can be solved by maintaining a diplomatic balance. He deftly navigates the Byzantine web of diplomatic intrigue to show how negotiations, not war, ultimately resolves crises. His whig interpretations are at times blatant. Conservative Russia and Prussia are often &quot;humiliated&quot; and &quot;old fashioned&quot; while liberal France fell victim to its own &quot;ingenuity&quot; or suffered &quot;shattered prestige.&quot;Not all events are treated equal. The 1867 Anschloss or the 1894 Dreyfus Affair receive practically no attention, while obscure diplomatic conventions receive detailed analysis. Great leaders like Napoleon III or Bismarck receive Taylor's praise while British statesmen of lesser stature receive criticism. Taylor is also anti-imperial, stating that colonies are a sign of weakness (though he later seems to suggest the opposite). His treatment of the coming of World War One is perhaps his greatest weakness, or perhaps this is where the book is most dated. He seems to be somewhat surprised that war erupted in the face of diplomatic failure. He fails to see that many at the time lost faith in diplomacy and allowed the war to happen.In the end, though, this is a fine work. Taylor interjects personal philosophies throughout the book. &quot;Men learn from their mistakes how to make new ones (p. 111);&quot; &quot;Once men imagine a danger they soon turn it into a reality (p. 450); and &quot;A historian should never deal in speculations about what did not happen&quot; (p. 513) are but a few examples. (This last is a personal favorite as it flies in the face of alternative history.) Clever recto page headings and use of dates keep the reader aware of what is happening, and Taylor is a master of the semi colon. All in all this remains a very informative work."},{"Title":"The struggle for mastery in Europe, 1848-1918 (Oxford history of modern Europe)","review":"I think what made me start loving Alan Taylor is the passage from &quot;Struggle&quot; about Louis Napoleon's government being &quot;run by gangsters&quot;. After a lifetime of school histories unwilling to venture a judgement, scrupulous in their aridness, this was a revelation.Taylor suffered ostracism for his outspoken views, especially from Oxford, where his trampling of sacred cows prevented him from gaining a professorship. On the other hand, his rival, Hugh Trevor-Roper, played the Tory historian and prospered. (It was, of course, Trevor-Roper who staked his reputation as an historian on the authenticity of the fraudulent Hitler diaries of 1983, hopefully giving Taylor the last laugh. But being an establishment historian, Sir Hugh was immunized from serious career consequences.)If you want to understand the century past, you must begin in the century previous, in about 1848. When Taylor deposits you in 1918, you will be on secure footing while reading his, &quot;Origins of the Second World War&quot; or Ian Brendon's &quot;Dark Valley: A Panorama of the 1930s,&quot; leading you in turn to WWII, which brings the nineteenth century to a close in 1945. It is said that Alan Taylor liked paradox. I wonder how he liked this one."},{"Title":"The struggle for mastery in Europe, 1848-1918 (Oxford history of modern Europe)","review":"A. J. P. Taylor's The Struggle for Mastery in Europe is the book to start reading about those 70 crucial years in Europe's history.The book begins with the Revolutions of 1845, that's why it would be a good thing to have some knowledge regarding the Napoleonic Wars and its outcome (Treaty of Metternich). Taylor analyses the out coming system of the Balance of Power that governed European diplomacy until War World I. According to This system, the five great powers (England, Prussia, Austria, Russia and the defeated France) would balance each others force, avoiding the out come of war.The system worked pretty well until the fall of Bismarck. That is because Bismarck, as his successor once said, knew how to \\"play with three balls at the same time\\". He could keep Russia and Austria tied to Germany at the same time. Thus, France was checked. Nevertheless, when Germany didn't renewed its treaty with Russia the obvious move was Russia's alliance with France.It could be said that by 1885 the outcome of a Great War was a matter just of time. The system of alliances so well designed by Metternich and so well understood and curried out by Bismarck was at the same time the cause of War World I. Without a great politician as Bismarck nobody could make Metternich's system work.All through his book, Taylor explains what I have just summarized in a really better way. I highly recommend the lecture of this great book."},{"Title":"The struggle for mastery in Europe, 1848-1918 (Oxford history of modern Europe)","review":"A. J. P.

This is the real deal: Taylor was a genuine historian who never went further than his facts--and his facts are incredibly well researched, well documented, and bountiful. This is true historiography: the way history ought to be done! Plus, Taylor writes very well, in a lively and entertaining fashion. He has good language, wit, and trenchant observations.It must be noted that this is a history of diplomacy--with some political and military of necessity treated. What does this mean? Well, it means that the characters of Taylor's book are mostly forgotten professional diplomats, and therefore most of their names won't be familiar to those unschooled in modern European history--Bismarck and Disraeli excepted. But this esoterica only increases the value of Taylor's work; for it reveals these forgotten characters to us once again: a gem of historical literature."},{"Title":"The struggle for mastery in Europe, 1848-1918 (Oxford history of modern Europe)","review":"This is A.J.P. Taylor's masterpiece of history. Taylor is an exquisite writer, with a unique style that cannot resist the irony and contradictions inherent in the very fabric of European diplomacy. This sprawling tale of folly and pretension is informed by Taylor's exhaustive reading of the official foreign affairs correspondence of the respective nations involved, as well as his own mastery of modern European history. His prose is consistently edged with wit on the verge of sarcasm, always keen to the absurd roots of tragedy. For Taylor there are no sacred cows: every class, every institution, every political party, even cynicism itself fumbles in the dark, toiling under the weight of its illusions and contradictions. One does not emerge from this book with an enhanced respect for statesmen, generals or revolutionaries. This is one of the few history books I plan on reading at least twice."},{"Title":"The struggle for mastery in Europe, 1848-1918 (Oxford history of modern Europe)","review":"Taylor successfully tackles a sprawling, detailed subject -- seventy years of byzantine European diplomacy that set the stage for the First World War and, not so indirectly, the Second. He doesn't hold the reader's hand, and assumes you are familiar with many of the events and people he discusses. I wasn't, so I referred often to Britannica, Encarta, and Wikipedia as I read. By doing so, I learned a lot from this book."},{"Title":"The struggle for mastery in Europe, 1848-1918 (Oxford history of modern Europe)","review":"A.J.P. Taylor (1906-1990) wrote THE STRUGGLE FOR MASTERY IN EUROPE: 1848-1918 in 1960. This book makes the diplomatic connections and clearly explains the causes and effects of European diplomacy history at a time when the Europeans experienced political revolutions industrial revolutions, etc. Taylor connected the economic changes and diplomatic tensions in a readable style that is unmatched.Taylor began this book with the 1848 revolutions and the attempts at national unity in Central Europe (Germany, the Slavic peoples, etc.) Taylor clearly showed the tensions that frustrated Italian national unity. What the crowned heads and diplomats feared was that nationalism and unity would come from \\"below\\" rather than from the \\"conservative\\" European political leaders who feared the masses yet had to take the masses into account re poltical and diplomatic decisions. Taylor showed how Napoleon III (1852-1870) was able to take advantage of the June Days (1848) in France only to blunder in diplomatic endeavors. As Taylor noted, Napoleon III was too much of a dreamer and was to cautious of an adventurer.Taylor carefully treated the diplomatic tenions in the late 1840s-1850s. The Russians feared Magyar or Hungarian unity as well as that of the Polish. Czar Nicholas II (1825-1855)and his advisers feared was that the Russians would be more of an Asian political entity than a European power. What the Russian political leaders did not fully realize was that the Russian political and military systems were too weak for the Russians to realize their diplomatic ambitions. Czar Nicholas II took the Russians into the Crimean War (1854-1855)ostensibly over Russian Orthodox and French Catholic access to the Holy Places which were in Turkish controlled Palestine. As Taylor noted, Napolean III was looking for glory in confronting the Russians, but Napolean III needed British help, an ally, to confront the Russians. Czar Nicholas II had a better claim re the Holy Places than Napoleon III did simply because the Czar was the official protector of the Russian Orthodox Church, and Napolean III had no such claim to the Catholic Church. The British simply saw a chance to further hinder Russian ambitions re the Turkish Straits and Russian direct access to the Mediterrean Sea. As noted in this book, the Crimean War demonstrated weaknesses of the belligerents and most glaring the weakness of the Russians who never learned.Taylor next dealt with Italian unification. The Italian leaders, especially Count Cavour (1810-1861)knew the Italians could not dislodge the Hapsburgs from Northern Italy without an ally. Napolean III attempted to resurrect French greatness by allying the French with the Italians. Even in victory, Napoleon III blundered, The Italians \\"kept their end of the bargain\\" only to be disappointed that Napoleon III refused the let the Italians have Venetia and Rome.Taylor's treatment of German unification was well done. William I (1862-1888) and Otto von Bismarck (1815-1899) were able to manipulate the Danes into a war vs. the Prussians (the Northern Germans) and the Hapsburghs who easily defeated the Danes in 1863. As Taylor noted, Bismarck undermined the Hapsburgs and Prussian forces defeated them in the Seven Weeks War (1866). The French and Napoleon III managed to isolate themselves without accounting for their diplomatic and military weakness. Bismarck tricked the French into starting the Franco-Prussian War (1870-1871)which was a disaster for the French and completed German unification. Readers should note that the French and British were preoccupied with the U.S. Civil War and French designs in Mexico ended in 1870. Taylor should have emphasized these events.As readers may know, after the Franco-Prussian War Bismarck knew that peace could be kept as long as the Russians were placated in Eastern Europe and the French were isolated. Bismarck's \\"system\\" was threatened when the Balkan people rebelled against the Turks in 1875-1876. The Europeans urged the Turks to make reforms to defuse a potential disaster, but the Turks responded by committing The Bulgarian Massacres which outraged the Europeans and led to the Russo-Turkish War. Bismarck knew the potential danger of the Germans being drawn into a war he did not want. To paraphrase Bismarck, the Balkans were not worth one Pomeranian solider. When the Turks were defeated and the Bulgarians got a seaport on the Mediterranain Sea, the British and Hapsburgs opposed the settlement. The British would not tolerate the Russians having access to seaport by proxy via the Bulgarians. Bismarck quickly moved to renegotiate the Treaty of San Stafano to avoid war.Many Europeans thought the time of perpetual peace and prosperity had occured after 1878. Bismarck knew better and knew that the Germans could maintain peace by skilled diplomacy. Taylor gave a solid detailed account of Bismarck's secret alliances with the Hapsburgs, Italians, and Russians. Bismarck pledeged German DEFENSIVE alliances and neutrality to the point that no one could act without the Germans. Readers should note that European and U.S. imperialism deflected European energy. Bismarck, as Taylor noted, was a diplomatic genius.When William II (1888-1918)came to power, Bismarck was dimissed, and his system gradually collapsed. As Taylor noted Bismarck's successors were not nearly as astute as Bismarck. This obviously led to W.W. I, which led to German defeat. Taylor made an interesting comment that the Germans involvement in W.W. I was not due to bad policy. It was due to no policy, and the less able German diplomats and leaders were unaware of the dynamics of European diplomacy. What may have made total war possible was the fact that crowned heads and skilled diplomats did not push for war as much as the masses pushed for war.The Russians who appeared never to learn anything about their own weakness were in part to blame. They were easily defeated in the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905)which sent shock waves througout Russia and Europe. The Russians should have realized just how bad their system was and how weak they were. They never learned this until defeat in W.W. I.Taylor concluded this book with the fact that while the Germans were defeated in Western Europe, the Germans won W.W. I vs the Russians and extracted the Treaty of Brest-Listov in 1918. Taylor noted that W.W. I ended any European Balance of Power simply because the Americans were the \\"new players on the block.\\"Taylor wrote a comprehensive book. Readers who examine this book will have a better understanding of how diplomacy is conducted and recognize folly and blunders. This book undermines popular textbook versions of diplomatic history which rarely if ever \\"come to grips\\" with diplomatic history. A.J.P. Taylor's other books that deserve mention are THE ORGINS OF WORLD WAR II, THE HAPSBURG EMPIRE, etc. Anyone interested in careful scholarship and good written expression will benefit from these books."},{"Title":"The struggle for mastery in Europe, 1848-1918 (Oxford history of modern Europe)","review":"This is A.J.P.

This is only one aspect of history, but in fact this book is an excellent guide to 19th century Europe overall, or its second half, and it has enough about economic and political developments to be readable as a general work. It is also extremely entertaining, both in a gossipy kind of way and because Taylor isn't afraid of going through the strategic intricacies of each situation. Don't be discouraged by the length; this is extremely readable.

Within these confines, he wrote an excellent - academically serious but also readable. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Yankee No!: Anti-Americanism in U.S.-Latin American Relations","review":"McPherson's take on anti-Americanism (ie, \\"anti-USism\\") in the cold war Caribbean was written as an historical guide to the 9/11 era and its recurrent themes of \\"Why do they hate us?\\" and \\"How can they hate us?\\" He explores the wilful naivite behind the plaint by referring us to an earlier era which has merged almost seamlessly with the new.McPherson takes anti-USism as unique, but I disagree. There most certainly is an anti-Britishism (re: Ireland, India) and anti-Russianism (Poland, the Baltic States.) There doubtless was an anti-Rome-ism too. Colin Powell's \\"Pottery Barn Rule\\" (\\"You break it, it's yours, you've bought it\\") is the historic norm. Great powers, by nature, inevitably act the bull in the global china shop and are as inevitably hated for it. Although more thoughtful policy makers are aware of this dilemma, such knowledge has little practical effect.McPherson's analysis of anti-Americanism in Venezuela, Cuba, Panama, and the Dominican Republic stresses the underdog resentment of America's neighbors, and suggests anti-Americanism is more an elite than a grass-roots phenomenon. His recounting of the US-Cuba rupture is his key point. In the need of the new revolutionary elite to consolidate sovereignty over their country, Fidel's early pragmatic \\"Menshevism\\" gave way to a radicalizing class war and anti-Americanism, both of which were only latent and needed considerable stoking to emerge as a mass force. This echoes the need of conservative elites to promote their own anti-Americanism, to keep the Colossus of the North from trampling their own turf, a problem too remote from the majority's daily struggle for survival.The US, for its part, conveniently conflated anti-Americanism with Communism as a rationale for extending its cold war battlelines: who else but Commies could find fault with the USA? This raises a question that McPherson seems to avoid: that anti-Americanism might also be a manipulated pretext in Washington, a rationale to pursue policies otherwise morally unacceptable. McPherson quotes US Secretary of State Christian Herter that his Department \\"applied a series of tests to the Castro regime\\" in its first ten months, without specifying as to what said tests might have been. But we know that Fidel was not the only one pursuing disingenuous \\"ambivalence.\\" Anti-Castro actions and McCarthyite red-baiting were already conveniently outsourced to the CIA, exiles, and private agencies, allowing the US to maintain its facade of diplomatic neutrality. The upper middle class, middle-aged white males running the State Department reacted much the same to Carribbean anti-Americanism as they did to the simultaneous civil rights movement at home.Because at bottom they already knew the answer to their posed question. Without indulging in conspiracy theory, how convenient and necessary it seems for \\"them to hate us\\"; how readily the coup d'etat of the Patriot Act was rushed through after 9/11. George Bush's pained query, then, becomes a self-serving rhetorical device, not a puzzled wonder at the way of the world.Although now a decade old, the book is still timely as the US yet treads the world's turf in endless wars for love and respect; still imposing its way of life - in Stalin's famous phrase - as far as one's army can reach."},{"Title":"Yankee No!: Anti-Americanism in U.S.-Latin American Relations","review":"do not be fooled by the lying apologists of the us.

I have been collecting books for 40 years and I have never seen this before. The seller sold me a book which far exceeded any of my expectations. I was just looking for a copy to read, now I have a collector's item. Thanks.Many of us know the story, it is the end of the world and people in a small area of Australia are waiting to die. The book begins with the population expecting to have up to six months remaining before they are poisoned by radioactive illness. Do they sit around and wait to die? Are they in denial? Do they do that one last thing in life that they always wanted to do? Do they drink themselves to death before the illness strikes? What if the timing of the death cloud changes and they only have three months to live? The book follows four or five main characters and we are the observers of their destinies.A very good read. Interesting and compelling. Since the book was first released in 1957 it has remained timely and something we should all consider. What would we do? How prepared are we for a death that we know is coming?

We follow the characters through their different ways of coping with this fate and supporting each other to the end - while some strange but plausible behaviours and events unfold. Depressing? Certainly. Nevertheless it does reflect the world when it stood on the brink of destruction in the late 50s and early 60s.

Only people living in the farthest reaches of the the southern hemisphere remain alive. They too will all be dead in a matter of months as the unstoppable cloud of deadly radiation ultimately covers the entire planet.The novel features a number of Australian characters as well as an American submarine captain. As doomsday approaches, their lives are touchingly described. On the Beach contains some interesting scenarios and there are many moments of poignancy especially in the final pages.Much of the narrative contains accounts of everyday life as the characters strive to go about their business as if the end weren't just around the corner. Since everyday life isn't all that exciting, these portions of the book may be seen as rather dull.

Those families who could afford it really were building fallout shelters.It was a chilling time and this novel may well have helped the world's leaders get the prespective needed to move on toward a nuclear test ban treaty. It could have given them a sober dose of sanity that ultimately led to rational co-existence between East and West.While I agree that the writing at times is slow, the complaint from another reader about gender treatment is annoying. The young mother's sentimentality underscores the tragedy of a nuclear holcaust. The romatic angle with Towers and Davidson reconciles the the straight-laced with the foot-loose during the final moments of truth.I also found it interesting to note that the author was a successful aeronautical engineer as well as a novelist."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"\\"On the Beach\\" follows a US submarine captain who's found his way to Australia after an all-out nuclear war has decimated the northern hemisphere. Global winds slowly carry the deadly radiactive waste towards the Australian Continent and people there come to terms with their impending death by undertaking various hobbies such as race car driving and gardening.I give it only two stars. One of the most disappointing aspects of the story is that no one TRIES to survive. No one builds a radiation-proof shelter, stores food or does anything to extend their life even one single day. Every character in the book just accepts their impending deaths as an inescapable certainty.The will to survive is imbedded in our genes. Our adaptability and ingenuity have carried us through the last 50,000 years as a species. Accepting the end of mankind, as one might accept a dull, rainy day misses the point and promise of post-apocalyptic literature. Instead of the will to survive, we are shown a pathetic, poorly-imagined end to humanity. \\"On the Beach\\" fails to inspire or entertain."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"I fancied myself well-read. I also thought I had felt it all and conquered it all. But when my English teacher made me read this book, my universe was ripped into two pieces and forced down my throat in a way that hurt. I had to stop and look at what I held dear, how fragile it all really is, and my own mortality that I thought I'd accepted. It's impossible for me not to admire the characters in this book: facing their deaths, agonizingly slow in coming, with as much dignity as each individual could muster. Dashed hopes, dreams cut short, beauty that was never to be...innocent victims, and nothing left in the end but the waves sighing along the rocky shores of a nation that was nothing but a Dreamland to me before.

What is shocking about it is both the idea and the sheer imaginative brilliance with which Mr. Shute brings it off.\\" --San Francisco Chronicle\\"The most haunting evocation we have of a world dying of radiation after an atomic war.\\" --The New York TimesSeriously? Whoever is at the Chronicle and the Times needs to be fired. The book paints a picture of a world decimated by the after effects of a nuclear war. Yet what does the remaining population do? Prepare? Try to survive? Hell no. Calmly wander around in blithe denial of what is coming.Is there mass hysteria? Is there the unraveling of the fabric of society? Hardly. As this book would have you believe, the remaining population has resigned itself to denial. The most that society has degraded to is drunks passed out on the street and nobody caring.I suppose I should be easier on the writer, this was penned back in the 60's, and for all it's unbelievability, it was a good read and I did enjoy myself.Haunting? Hardly. I couldn't help feeling like radiation death was nothing more than something the characters in the books would say \\"Tut Tut, Cheerio. Time to die old man.\\" Puke/Crap/Puke/Death.

No heroic action sequences. No great battles for humanity.Just the end of hope, the end of the future, the end of life. This is a depiction, stark and realistic and unromantic, of how humans deal with the knowledge that the end of life on Earth has come, that they are going to die and leave nothing behind.Quite possibly the most depressing post-apocalyptic work of them all, but a real tour de force. A vivid work that stays with you long after you've finished."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"Years ago I saw On The Beach on TV. It was a good movie but not a great movie. Worth seeing. I wondered how the book would compare.In 1957 at the height of the cold war between the USSR and USA, while both countries stockpiled thousands of megatons of nuclear weapons, Nevil Shute wrote a classic novel about the end of the world after a major nuclear war. Basically the small country of Albania started the nuclear war. China and the USSR exchange nuclear devastation. One plane gets through and knocks out a US city another 2 planes bomb England. The USA retaliates and launches a massive strike against the USSR who did not bomb the US. The USSR retaliates with a massive strike against the USA. Over 4000 North Hemisphere detonations.The innocent Southern Hemisphere did nothing and does not get Nuclear strikes. All human life and most animal life in the Northern Hemisphere is killed by radiation.We see a US Submarine crew in Australia and Australians awaiting the slow drifting of nuclear fallout and death to all coming into the Southern Hemisphere. I wont ruin it for you by telling too much of the story.Parts of the book were poor...like calling baby Jennifer \\"it\\" who is dying of radiation poisoning.Lots of red suicide pills given out. The last Grand Prix auto race in Australia is won by a scientist who monitors radiation from the last US submarine. He wins driving a Ferrari he got for next to nothing as its the end of the world.There are really great parts to the book and it is well worth reading. This is a historic 1957 classic sci fi end of the world book. . There are lots of great parts like the race car and the submarine crew finding what is causing a CW transmission in dead Seattle.I found the book kind of depressing. The reader wants to help these people escape approaching death. Death for all is inevitable. There is no escape for anyone. Nevil Shute had the main characters leading a semi normal life to the bitter end. The vast majority of the people did not behave crazy with rape, robbery and mayhem. Of course there is some but the majority of people just wanted to spend their last days with their families and loved ones. Basically Australia went out with a whimper.Just remember that this is still possible. Some little county like North Korea or later Iran could start a nuclear war that gets out of control. We may not have to worry about \\"Nuclear Winter\\". The nuclear fallout in the stratosphere could be spread worldwide and if the half life of a cobalt bomb is 5 years we probably could not escape radiation poisoning worldwide from 4000 plus H bombs going off. A frighting book. Read non fiction The Cold and The Dark by Paul R Ehrlich ,Carl Sagan, Donald Kennedy and Walter Orr Roberts about the non survival after a global major nuclear war. An even more chilling \\"true\\" book. There would be no long term survival for mankind. Nevil Shute hit it right on in 1957.On The Beach a good book, with a strong story where the reader develops much empathy and sorrow for the dieing characters. Would of given On The Beach 5 stars but it is depressing and I didn't like dying baby Jennifer called \\"it\\". Gets you to thinking... this could really happen to us in this crazy world. I pray for peace before its too late. 4 stars and recommended."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"I read this book over 10 years ago and it is still one of the few books that I can honestly say left a mark on me. I remember finishing it in my english class and bawling my eyes out. I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"First, the bad news. Both the dialogue and--albeit to a lesser extent--the depth of emotion is a bit stilted. Shute often finds himself relying on the same descriptive words or phrases, sometimes in adjoining paragraphs, no less. In my opinion, this prevents the characters from ever becoming truly three-dimensional, though others may disagree. Also, the language used by one of the protagonists, Commander Dwight Towers, is firmly rooted in the fifties, and becomes monotonous after a while.Having said that, what I admire about this book is the relatively matter-of-fact way in which Shute presents the material. What distinguishes this book from others of its ilk is the lack of any legitimate hope for survival or a happy ending. By making the characters' fate clear from the beginning, Shute frees himself to deal with elements that usually go unadressed in &#34;disaster literature&#34;--the effect of that fate on the players' everyday lives. In fact, Shute goes so far in the direction of incorporating the inevitable outcome into everyday existence that, on more than one occasion, I wanted to grab the characters by the lapels and shake them into reality.On balance, this is a recommended read if for no other reason than for its uniqueness in the way in which it deals with the subject."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"Had been looking for this book for quite some time, without knowing a lot about it, other than the most basic description of the plot. Found it to be a page-turner, and finished the whole thing in two days. Like others have said, it's very emotional and I cried like a baby, which I don't think I ever have before with a book, which says something. Excellent warning of what could be, without being overly preachy, and harrowing to read. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"The transition from night to day begins each morning with a gentle sunrise insidiously piercing through the unwilling blanket of darkness. Eventually the colossal battle becomes fruitless and night gives in to the increasingly unrelenting pressure of sunshine. In relatively little time the seemingly insignificant temperature rise becomes substantial, creeping its way into life, permeating throughout all that doesn't wilt before the sun's potency. The changes are both irrevocable an inevitable.The atrocities and horrors of war, specifically the aftermath, are just as apparent as that sunrise. Similarly, the nuclear fallout and resulting widespread death is agonizingly slow.On the Beach is a tale of the realistic horror that could eventually destroy our planet. For those near the epicenters of full scale nuclear war, death is painless and instant. Those not fortunate enough to suffer a sweet, immediate death, face the realization that death approaches at a snail's pace. As the poison of radiation drifts across the ocean southward towards Australia, a U.S. submarine commander named Dwight Towers has to carry on with his mission, and make sense of the world's military actions.Dwight meets Moira Davidson, a frisky Australian girl with a wild streak, and along with their married friends Peter and Mary, they go about the gut-wrenching final days of their lives. Dwight holds on to the memory of his life, seeking solace in moderate denial, buying gifts for his wife and children who have no doubt already succumbed to the poisonous radiation. Similarly, Peter and Mary plan a garden for future seasons they will never see. Meanwhile, Moira faces death with a slight chip on her shoulder, and a scowl at what could have been. Eventually the four find a dichotomous comfort in knowing that they have no recourse for survival, living their final days with as much vigor, generosity, and soft smiles as possible.The real strength of this novel is the character development. By learning about the characters' lives and insecurities, strengths and flaws, as well as their likes and dislikes, a great deal of empathy is elicited. Following their depressingly mundane last days during humanity's failing health and infrastructure sheds light on that which we all take for granted, like the simple pleasures and beauty that can be gained from a good drink, an exhilarating race, or a relaxing day fishing.Humanity should hope that nothing remotely similar to this novel actually occurs. And, even though I'm sure there would be considerably more chaos than represented in the characters' dignified approach, the slow, somber story development accentuates the truly dreary prospect of a slow helpless death."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"It's impossible to say that I enjoyed this book. How can one enjoy a book about the end of humanity? Most of the people in the world are already dead when the book begins and those remaining in southernmost Australia, South America and South Africa are just waiting for the inevitable fallout to get to them. They know it is coming and there is nothing they can do about it. This is the depressing part. The upbeat part, if you can really call it that, is the way the inhabitants of Melbourne go on with their lives - working at jobs that really don't matter anymore, planting gardens they will never be able to harvest, building fences to keep in livestock that will soon be gone, going to school to learn skills they will never be able to use, etc. They don't just roll over and play dead. They don't go looting all the stores and stealing everything. If fact, merchants more often than not just let people have what they need without payment at all. To me the best part of this book is the grace with which most of the people accepted their fate. Though I still like 'Alas Babylon' better, this is a very good book too."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"Other reviews give a synopsis, so I'll skip that and go straight to an analysis/critique.I first read Nevil Shute's On the Beach when I was a teenager--about the same time as I read Pat Frank's Alas, Babylon--and I've retained a morbid fascination with it ever since. As science fiction it's not all that great, since it isn't really SF at all. Instead, it is more of an allegory with a heavy touch of absurdism thrown in. Think about it: the denizens of a functioning civilization go about their business with near-normality, behaving one minute as if everything is fine while in the next acknowledging (usually with a large degree of detachment) that a sword is hanging over their heads. This description fits both the book and the actual nuclear/Cold War world of the late 1950s. The only difference is that in the book the blade is already, and inescapably, whistling downwards, while in the real world (and this is Shute's point) the danger might be avoided, if people act right away.Indeed, Shute goes to great pains to get his original readers to identify with the characters and civilization in On the Beach. The Australian setting is accessible to the English speaker, as a South American or African setting wouldn't be. Aside from the gasoline shortage, which he mentions cursorily on occasion, the characters seem discommoded almost not at all by the war (Moira has to darn Dwight's socks; Dwight has to drink Australian whiskey), and Shute greatly downplays even the travel problems, making them seem only a modest inconvenience. Government and the market both appear to function normally, only beginning to falter a bit at the very end. In fact, most people behave even in the final days as if everything were going to continue. A clerk insists on giving Peter Holmes a receipt for a purchase even though the store is about to shut down; the admiral discusses in some detail the reimbursement procedure that an admittedly-nuked Washington, D.C. will follow for the Australian upkeep of the U.S. submarine even as radiation sickness forces him to bolt for the bathroom. These people know the end of the world is days, even hours, away; they aren't deluding themselves; but still, they can't let go. This fabric of functionality and forced normality makes the world of On the Beach resonate with the real Cold War world: in each the danger, while quite real, is remote from everyday circumstance, leading to an almost schizophrenic existence. (Think \\"Duck and Cover\\" commercials airing during a \\"Leave it to Beaver\\" episode and you get the idea.)The characters' ultimate, and universal, reaction to the approaching end of the world further strengthen the allegorical nature of the book. British apocalyptic fiction has always been more fatalistic and pessimistic than its American counterpart, and in no case is this more true than in On the Beach, which is perhaps the most devastating work of its kind. Shute's post-holocaust characters--in fact the entire civilization--simply give up. From an American perspective--the sort that produced the contemporary Alas, Babylon--this is frustrating and unrealistic. To paraphrase a statement of Colonel Graff in another famous American SF work, Ender's Game, our genetic heritage simply doesn't allow us to give up without a fight. But that's exactly what Shute's world does, without even any show of resistance. In the entire book there are only two, or perhaps three, real outbursts of emotional reaction to what's happening. No drastic mobilization to prepare a bunker to wait out the twenty year period of radiation, no desperate attempt to continue the species at any and all cost, as in When Worlds Collide (\\"Waste anything but time!\\"); just passive acquiescence and, in the end, mass suicide. This fact--this long, drawn-out, and ultimate loss of hope, which few other works can match--is what makes the book so important. In sum, Shute asked the Cold War reader how s/he will respond to a threat that, unlike the one in On the Beach, was still only potential. Peter Holmes, in his deathbed speech, suggests education. The book's meaning and purpose is best summed up in the closing shot of the original film; the banner proclaiming to an empty Melbourne \\"There is still time, brother.\\"On a literary level the book leaves much to be desired. Particularly grating to this American is the terribly contrived American dialect of Dwight Towers, the American sub commander. But despite this, On the Beach is a classic of the genre--if you can stomach it."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"As a child of the 50s and 60s, I found the book very credible.The most powerful thing in this novel is its immediacy to our own lives.We exist in an age when nuclear warfare is an immediate possibility.I was touched by the captain's insistence on thinking of his family in the present tense, and refusal of the woman, Moira's advances, in deference to his obviously married state (despite his awareness of the reality, the captain continues to think of them as he left them).As a person who, as a child in the 60s, learned to jump under my desk in school, during air-raid drills, I was profoundly affected by this story.Furthermore, I was very moved by this author's vision of how people might hold on to hope, at the same time that they accept, on various levels, the inevitability of destruction.I have read thousands of books in my lifetime, most of which I recall only slightly. I will never forget this book."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"The beach, when one beholds it as such, is the end of the world.Nevil Shute's incredible novel is not about surviving a global nuclear holocaust. The reader will follow the lives of several people, some of whom are related, some who are friends, and some who have been brought to Australia by inevitability. One of these strangers, Dwight Towers, is an American commander for the U.S. Navy who oversees a vital submarine mission to the United States' western shores. And there the servicemen will observe, on the beach, the unsettling lack of human life.When not commissioned, Lieutenant Commander Peter Holmes lives with his brand new family, Mary and his young baby Jennifer. There they spend their days living in labored bliss, on the beach, and frequently visited by family friend Moira Davidson, a young blonde in her 20s whose hobby was once gin, but is now brandy. She consumes more liquor than even Alistair MacLean can wave an empty glass at. Though her disposition is one of genuineness, she begins enticing the submarine captain Dwight into falling in love with her. By the end of the tale, Moira becomes the most beautiful and haunted character and her faithfulness and loyalty brought me to tears more so than any other character.Shute's novel frightened me. We are, all of us, led to believe that much of Fate is in our own hands. Every day we make decisions that affect the rest of our lives, and this we do not need to be reminded of. What we forget, however, is how fragile and ephemeral our lives are, and at any given moment, our lives are not necessarily in the hands of God, but very possibly in the hands of other human beings. It is worthwhile to remember, lest we forget, that all humans err.It is only at the very end of the book that some of the characters, who have been living a life restrained, must finally accept the truth. Peter states, \\"[I]f a couple of hundred million people all decide that their national honour requires them to drop cobalt bombs upon their neighbour, well, there's not much that you or I can do about it\\" (229). The small matter of pride is what tears marriages and friendships apart. Unfortunately, it can also destroy the world.It is so subtle, it is easy to overlook, but Shute's motif with beaches pervades the story and ultimately becomes the one thing that never changes.I read the 1963 Signet edition. My dictionary dash consisted of \\"sedulously\\" (31)."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"A great, simple book very well written and poignant. What's interesting about it is that as we enter the story, the nuclear war that will eventually doom the characters in the story has already occurred and is over. They are simply awaiting the lethal radioactive cloud to move down to the southern hemisphere and begin to kill everyone off. The people carry on their daily lives as if nothing has happened. But we see in several key scenes early in the book how painfully, heartbreakingly aware they really are. And that's the key power to the story. These people know they're doomed but what choice do they have except to continue on with their lives. The most painful scene I found in the book was how the young couple with the baby begin to plan out their garden for the next year knowing full well that they are not going to be around to see it. They're fooling themselves, obviously, but how else to cope with the inevitable.In the end, the book has the same effect as a movie called &quot;Testament&quot; with Jane Alexander.

Leaving &quot;On the Beach&quot; to one side, Nevil Shute is a writer who does a tradesman-like job, and can normally be counted on for a good story with an interesting background to it. This book must have been suggested to him by his publisher or something of the kind. Perhaps he was obliged to write it, for some contractual reason or other. It does not even come close to his other books, some of which are minor classics of mid-twentieth century literature (although usually disdained by the intelligentsia as not being literature of any kind).I suppose the subject matter is such that the book is worth reading anyway. If you are willing to fumble and stumble along with the ups and downs of the writing, the story is not, historically, without interest. Yet I don't think many readers will be terribly convinced by the poor plot and simplistic characters. It's a facile book that I can't imagine Shute himself being very proud of, in spite of its relative success (due no doubt, to the film)."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"I read this about 45 years ago. I was in my late teens. At the time, I thought it was extremely profound. I read it a couple of weeks ago, I'm now 63. I now regard it as so so. The characters were unbelievable. with a years warning they did nothing to prepare for the survival of the species.John Beyerlein 23 Nov 2010Liz & Dick"},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"Nevil Shute started out writing this novel working backwards, knowing what ending he would have, the end if humanity (which you know if read any of the other reviews here), then decided to emphasis that by making it as mournful and utterly morose as possible, then fit the events of the story to them, so it's almost laughable to consider that this is how reality could have played out when it's Shute pulling the puppet strings on the characters to achieve his desired ending the way he wanted to achieve it.Written during the cold war of the 50's, this novel was supposed to highlight the futility of nuclear war. So this was supposed to let those that somehow didn't understand the power of nuclear weapons, that the Soviets, and others, now have the bomb (which they obtained from American citizen spies working with nuclear secrets) and that nuclear war was un-winnable. Now highlighting the horrors of nuclear war and the hideous death toll it would incur on people, let alone the threat to the human race is commendable, but it's the general philosophy of the book that, OK, there are two or three superpowers that have nuclear weapons, making them equal in cruelty, democracy, and liberty so that's it, no point in having a nuclear weapons and that absolutely nothing justifies their use in any way whatsoever. It sidesteps the reality that one of these superpowers, the Soviets, murdered 20 million people, put countless numbers into labor camps, and was an completely oppressive totalitarian society. Put it another way, consider if the novel had the Nazi's winning WWII, that the Nazi's had nuclear weapons and were continuing the huge murders of people, sending people into labor camps, and repressing democracy, would you then have such qualms on the US having a stockpile of nuclear weapons as a deterrant? Would you then think, as the characters in this novel do, that ah well, we all did this to ourselves and thus deserve this outcome? If you answer differently they maybe you should brush up on history. Sure enough one totalitarian society is marketed as more evil by popular culture, but that doesn't change the history books documentation of the horrors by both the Soviets and the Nazi's. One questions if the author would have written the ending different if it had been a nuclear war with the Nazi's as the survivors \\"remarkably\\" fighting for humanity and for the future of mankind rather than accepting going out with a whimper.From reading the other reviews there are two types of basic readers that would find this novel of interest: those that would use it as a political manuscript of how humanity ended (although we're still here) and those that have gone through some traumatic experience in their life. For everyone else, sure you can find something appealing in the story, but it's dated, just reading the first page of the poem by T.S. Eliot gives you the theme, and in this day and age it's just average. If you're an average working person you have a job, busy, have friends, maybe family, and have to parcel your time that you invest in reading a book. You don't have to read this. End of the world novel's are quite compelling, and there's many of them, and more to date, out there. If you want an end of the world novel written around the same time, George R. Stewart's end of the world Earth Abides was a more interesting read, and I would recommend that over this novel."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"The mystery of the broadcast from no-man's-land is solved by page 174. That leaves about 110 more pages of melodramatic romance and a a somewhat shallow description of how the people end their lives as the inevitable radiation poisoning takes hold.

The romantical treatment of the young family might be a culture difference--Shute repeatedly refers to the infant as \\"it.\\"There are some continuity problems, as Shute was evidently unfamiliar with radio terminology despite years developing \\"secret weapons for the British in World War II:\\" in two facing pages, the frequency of the mysterious transmission is either 4.92 megacycles or 4.92 kilocycles.

More curiously are the dead people in the American town whom the deserted sailor found poisoned in their beds but that in that area death would have been very immediate and not as convenient as the slow, anticipated deaths in Melbourne.I rather disliked the bland story of the scientist-turned-race-car-driver that was seemingly bolted into the book about halfway though. I suppose the author wanted to stuff more pages or perhaps an early reading of his manuscript left out some crucial third-party character.Still, I haven't read a book in three days' time in many years.

However, I found it to be quite different than what I expected. The overall premise was pretty good, but the behaviors of the characters and some scientific elements were just plain off. For example, would people really go on chatting about milk and planting flowers when the whole human race is going extinct? In reality, there would be rioting, price gouging, and so on, but this book implies that life goes on as normal until the very end. I was mildly frustrated with the fact that, with this impending cloud of radiation that's on its way, the government wasn't building massive fallout shelters. Come on, if a submarine could stay underwater and be protected, surely a sealed shelter could be built. Granted, they would need to stock 20 years worth of supplies and house a set number of people, but it is not an unreasonable project to undertake, even for the 1960s.Given all these unrealistic elements, I give this book 3 stars.

Eliot's \\"The Hollow Men\\" (used on the title page) is right on the mark:\\"In this last of meeting placesWe grope togetherAnd avoid speechGathered on this beach of the tumid river...\\"\\"This is the way the world ends--This is the way the world ends.This is the way the world endsNot with a bang but a whimper.\\"Powerful stuff. A must-read book."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"In my opinion, this book is, today, wrongly classified as \\"science fiction\\". Being written in 1957, and a product of an incipient Cold War, maybe it was science fiction back in the fifties, but now \\"On the beach\\" is more like \\"apocalyptic fiction\\".The story is about what could have happened if the northern countries decided to strike nuclear attacks on each other in 1961. Two years later, the whole upper part of the globe has fallen under the radioative cloud, ant there's no one left. Because of the wind patterns, this dooming cloud is slowly reaching southern countries like Brazil, Argentina, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.Dwight Towers is the commander of one of the two remaining submarines existent in the US Navy, now based on Melbourne. There, he meets Moira Davidson, a young alcoholic woman, and her two friends, Australian navy-man Peter Holmes and his wife, Mary, and they have to cope with, literally, the end of the world.\\"On the beach\\" is not an action book, and it's not about heroic achievements to save what remains of Earth. This is a book of sorrow and regret. Nevil Shute's characters can be divided between those who have accepted their terrible fate, and those who will deny it until the end. That's what is most interesting, and most depressive too.Not a long book, \\"On the beach\\" seems to drag on for the first three-quarters, only setting a gray but necessary background, but the final chapters are like the water running down the drain in an emptying sink: twisty, fast-paced and hypnotic. Yes, hypnotic is a good word. The reader will keep reading, trying himself to look for ways out, only to discover that sometimes reality is more powerful than imagination.\\"On the beach\\" is sad all the way. In fact, the title alone is very depressive, once the reader understand its meaning, disclosed on a poem in the first page, and in the very last line. But it is also a powerful reading, one that will stick to the reader's mind after the book is finished. And, after all, this surely could have happened; in fact, Nevil Shute could have been a prophet. We all have to be grateful that he wasn't.Grade 8.8/10"},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"Nevil Shute's On the Beach was written in 1957 amidst the Cold War fears of nuclear annihilation. It has been made into two movies, one in 1959 starring Gregory Peck, Ava Gardner, and Fred Astaire and a smaller budget film in 2000. Shute was a bestselling writer in his time. \\"In 2007, Gideon Haigh wrote an article in The Monthly arguing that On the Beach is Australia's most important novel.\\" (From the Wikipedia article on Nevil Shute.)It's now probably categorized as science fiction, but there really is no impossible or futuristic science throughout the book. At the time it was written, it was an expression of the fears of many. Now, it is more of an alternative fiction, which is really what all fiction is anyway, of what the world would have been like if a nuclear war had broken out. To not get into the details too much, the story centers on Australia after a nuclear war had totally destroyed the northern hemispehere. Slowly, the radiation spreads south. Shute focuses on a group of people located in Melbourne who know that they are going to all die soon from radiation poisioning that is spreading south. It sounds bleak and depressing, which it is. The sadness of the book is the only reason I did not give it a perfect rating. It is excruciatingly sad.As for the themes, the book tackles suicide. The government manufactured pills for people to take once they began to show signs of radiation sickness. There would be no possibility of recovery once the radiation started poisoning people; nobody could win this battle with death. Through the story, Shute asks, \\"Would suicide in such a situation be okay?\\"The book made me wonder (not that my little bout with cancer hasn't also done this) if I am doing what I would like to do if I knew that I would die in three months. The people in the book were forced to ask this. In the book, most of the people just kept on doing what they had already been doing. I think I would do the same.In the end, the book really caused me to examine what should be valued in the world we live in. I think I am a better person for having read this book.Entertaining: 4/5Inspiring: 5/5Ethical Thinking: 5/5This book was so depressing that I do not know if I will ever read it again. I will definitely keep this book. It was great to read and challenging to my thoughts. It would also be a great discussion starter."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"I generally avoid books like this because they depress me, but I finally gave in after a family member brought it home. No matter how sad, I never cry over movies and books, but in order to finish this book I had to lock myself in the bathroom; I've never cried so much in my life. I finished it yesterday and I can't stop thinking about it. Regardless of whether or not it was scientifically accurate, it drove home the futility of nations building up nuclear arms against each other. Shute's characters have dignity to the end - and his mention of how newspapers would rather have stories of (I'm paraphrasing) \\"pin up girls and indecent assaults\\" than stories like this was amazingly prescient and ahead of its time. This book broke my heart. Read it, read it, read it -but have a very large box of tissues at your side at the end."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"Nevil Shute offers us a grim picture of nuclear apocalypse - but then again, is there any such thing as a picture of nuclear apocalypse that is not grim? \\"On the Beach\\" was written in the late 1950's (Shute, himself, died in 1960), but the action in the book apparently takes place in the mid-60's, a year after the final war has been fought in the northern hemisphere. The southern hemisphere now waits for the inevitable arrival of lethal fallout, which will complete the eradication of all life on earth.A novel of deep irony, \\"On the Beach\\" deals with the inhabitants of Australia after the war, who are waiting for the radiation sickness to set in and hoping (though not too deeply) for some kind of reprieve. It is ironic, of course, as we discover that the southern hemisphere never joined the fray - however, it is an effective reminder that in nuclear war, what side one is on or whether one wins or loses are irrelevant questions. We are all on one side, and all of us lose in the end. Although I've heard it billed as a tear-jerker, and I myself did shed a few, it was not an overly emotional book. Mainly, it dealt with the reality of the situation in a matter-of-fact manner - in the end I felt mainly dazed and cold.I'm not in any way a scientist, nor do I have any particular education by which I can judge the accuracy or merit of the story that Shute paints. Perhaps \\"modern\\" science has a different prediction of how such a scenario would unfold and end - almost certainly it does. Also, I question whether such an all-out event could likely take place - the events leading up to the war seem contrived and unrealistic. Yet, the point of the novel is not to provide a plausible adventure, but rather to emphasize that we don't know what will happen if the bombs ever fall. At the end of the book, as a father applies a cyanide injection to his child - and as I shed my tears for that - I was reminded that, at the very least, I never want to find out."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"Nevil Shute wrote this novel 50 years ago, and it is as powerful now as it was then. This story of the last people on earth is simply devastating--in every sense of the word. It amazes me that Shute, an aeronautical engineer who helped Britain design and build nuclear weapons, would sit down 10 years later and produce this horrifying account of the possible effects of his own work. His change of heart is our great gift.As I write this, Cormac McCarthy's novel, THE ROAD, is at the top of the bestseller lists. Read both masterpieces and compare Shute's vision then with McCarthy's vision now, half a century later. The basic premise of both novels is the same: nuclear war, if it comes, will have only one outcome. I hope we will continue to have great artists like this to constantly remind us of that fact. As long as we can still read ON THE BEACH and learn its message, there is still hope."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"I enjoyed this book although it was sad. Mankind's swansong if you will. The characters are well written and engaging. I would recommend \\"Alas Babylon\\" to go with this. I think I enjoyed Alas Babylon more because there was a defiance in the characters that said that mankind will continue and the best will rise to the top and ensure our future."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"When he wrote this novel the end of the world in a nuclear holocaust was a very real prospect. Time has passed, and the nuclear threat has receeded. The expectation is that &quot;On the Beach&quot; would become terribly dated as a result.But it is not. The reason may be that Shute concentrated his novel on the people, on how they cope with the end of the world, rather than on the technology, the how and the why.As time goes by the radiation spirals further and further south to threaten the Australians. In response they attempt to go about their business with what normality they can muster. The book raises the interesting questions over how each of us might act when death comes knocking on the door. Do you want to go out in a blaze of glory, vent your anger at fate, or curl up in your own bed and sleep the end away?A great read, it stands the test of time."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"On the Beach is a book about good people caught in an impossible situation. Set in Australia, it tells the story of a diverse group of characters who are waiting to die. The whole Northern hemisphere has been obliterated by nuclear war and the clouds of fallout are drifting slowly southward. While they wait, their characters are gradually revealed, like a painting appearing as years of accumulated grime are carefully wiped away. When this book was written it had an enormous impact. People really believed that a nuclear holocaust was likely, if not inevitable, in their lifetimes. For some years, the threat receded but the events of September 11th 2001 have brought those fears back. The weapons are still in their silos, the submarines are still on their stations. We can but hope that sanity will one day prevail. In any case, this book should be read for its poignancy, its beautiful yet simple plot and its optimism in the face of tragedy."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"Although the movie is also great, this book remains one of my alltime favorites, first read 40 years ago. There's no time gap - it still seems current and still as real and touching. Highly recommended, as are most of his books"},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"This will be the most desolating, tragic novel you'll ever read. There's no happy ending: everyone dies. Hero and heroine, they both die. Supporting characters, they die. Everyone--and that's *everyone*--else, we all die, too. Let's get that out of the way. No extraterrestrial rescue-ships, no juvenile wish-fulfillment Tom Clancy endings, no elegant James Bond saviours, no immaturely puerile left-wing/right-wing nonsense. Just the bleak fact that everyone dies in the end, leaving only human structures to moulder into complete decay--which is going to to take a long time as the radiation from the northern hemisphere thermonuclear war has killed most of the decay bacteria. Sure, you can quibble about the science of the radiation transport-mechanism, but that was the thinking of the day, and the nuclear winter which would ensue would be just as lethal. Because everyone dies, even the sense of tragedy seems sterile and wasteful.Human civilisation isn't replaced by barbarism, but vanishes entirely. This is the story of the last people to exist in the pathetic ordinariness of their last days. And that is where the Shute novel enters greatness: describing their stories. You can make allowances for fifty years' worth of changes in attitude and world politics, but the theme remains current: even if the end is marked six months from now, we each still have to live life one day at a time, filling those days with the familiar and habitual. It is the divergence between the day-to-day and the ever-approaching inescapable doom which gives this novel its main impetus and power, and Shute is unflinching in his regard of it. So, by making the abstract actual and day-to-day, Shute has written perhaps the bravest novel ever written about the possibility of nuclear annihilation. As I said, no Tom Clancy here.Shute's characters are decent, stoic 'stiff-upper-lip' characters because that's what was the Brit ideal of the time, and it wasn't too far off the truth of the time, that to be decent and accepting was more important than an undignified hysteria. That's how most Brits (who had just survived a murderous war) actually *were* then. Second, there's not much action because Shute was a member of the old school of story-tellers which believed in craft rather than jolts (maybe the difference between British and the more excitable American readers). When reading a Shute novel, typically, you can spend the first twenty pages wondering why you're bothering, and the next hundred pages trying, unsuccessfully, to put it down--that's called storytelling, folks, and Shute, for all his potboiler plots, was a master of the innocent-seeming spinning of webs which eventually bound you to the characters in his plots, which almost invariably presented ordinary people with extraordinary circumstance, so closely that you had to finish the book.On The Beach is no exception to Shute's usual subtle entrancement (one reviewer at the time said the novel held 'a cobra fascination' for him); also, I found it fascinating that the greatest book about thermonuclear war was not, as one would expect given the large number of doomsday novels published at the time, a US or Brit science-fiction writer but a 1950's British professional romance-writer. A bleak, desolate masterpiece."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"This book brought me the closest to tears I've been in sooo long. This book...affected me.

I figured that such a good movie must come from agood book.

Nuclear fallout from war or any nuclear accident is not a local event. The effects could touch the entire globe.

I recall this novel as a great emotional, sobering journey made in my middle years. That first read was surely exaggerated by experiences of sticking my head under a school desk during nuclear war drills at grade school. Ok, so you have to be a \\"boomer\\" to remember this but guess what, given the recent political charade what comes next could be the chance of a nuclear winter as Shute describes not in scientific detail but in human frailty and heroism. Existing leaders who only think about increasing the size of their weapons should read this novel and re-read like I just have. Not only is it a well written story full of emotion and surprises but it is also a warning. It was true when written and still seems to be just on the surface of truth because our way of life has been and still is threatened by our way of life! Full of humor in the face of disaster and the common humane nature of men who lean on each other for strength even at the step of final and terrible death makes the reader stay faithful. These characters are endurable, likable, familiar even when inevitably terminable. Shute doesn't leave us much but maybe one or two survived, somehow - one can hope. Remember, this is fiction - yes? Thank you Mr. Author."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"What if the powerful countries of the world waged a nuclear war so catastrophic that all life was destroyed, and you were stuck in southern Australia, watching the deadly radiation move slowly, inexorably your way? That is the question posed by this classic post-apocalyptic novel. The inevitable conclusion is rather dreary. However, the characters seem a bit too 1950s, and therefore not quite realistic. Still, it's an interesting, if bleak, what-if scenario."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"I was searching for fiction similar in tone to McCarthy's 'The Road' and came across this older title. Very haunting read. Showcases believable common people and how they would conduct themselves while facing the impending nuclear doom. A great cautionary tale in our often uncertain times. Schools should make novels like this required reading moreso than some of the removed literary 'classics' in my opinion."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"Nevil Shute's book about the collapse and extermination of civilisation after a nuclear war.

It was a book on life after nuclear bombs were dropped. In this book they were dropped in the northern hemisphere. It was an intense book because you didn't know what was going to happen next. I enjoyed On The Beach because I expected something dull to happen every time I turned the page, but something completely different happened. It was enjoyable not only for it's suspense but also for the love shared between the characters. They cared for each other enough to ask them to kill themselves if the radiation got to bad. If you want to know what life would be like after a nuclear war, read this book. If you support it you will probably change your mind. This book might even improve your vocabulary. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"After nuclear war wipes out the Northern hemisphere, the radiation gradually creeps South, killing everything in its path. In Melbourne (at the time, the world's southernmost city), people realize they have only a few months to live, that there is no escape, and they sit and wait to die. Pretty grim. Of course, everyone is just finding ways to fill in the time and distract themselves. ...'On the beach' has been quoted widely with regards to Australians referring to England as 'home' even though they'd never been there. It's the only time I've ever come across that phenomenon. I actually found that these 1950s Australians quite familiar and interesting: much more British than Australians nowadays, still in that stiff duty mode from the second world war, and facing certain death. I think the listless writing style was very successful in conveying the sense of despair and doom.It's a powerful novel, profound probably, and quite awful."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"I'm re-reading this book because I can still remember the way it stoned me as a junior high kid as the Cold War still lingered. This book, along with Kerouac's On The Road and a couple of Hemingway's masterpieces helped me cross the bridge from impressionable youth to building a life based on character, making my own experiences, and respecting and appreciating the ability to do so for as long as I can. On the Beach is still so very relevant. I won't ever forget the impression it left on me."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"I haven't been able to understand why this book is so popular! Nevil shute is a REALLY great author, and has written books that are much more thought provoking like &quot;In The Wet&quot;, &quot;Round the Bend&quot;, &quot;The Rainbow and the Rose&quot;, &quot;A Old Captivity&quot; and many others I have read and re-read over the years. He writes books about common people, very heartwarming stories, which when you finish, make you think the world might not be in such bad shape after all. Many of his books revolve around aviation, as he was one of the first aeronautical engineers, and one of the original employees of DeHavalland Aircraft. His book &quot;Slide Rule&quot; is basically an autobiography. The period covered by his novels varies from just after WWI - &quot;Marizan&quot;, many of WWII era &quot;Landfall&quot;, to the early 1950's &quot;The Far Country&quot; set, like many of his later novels, in Australia. &quot;On the Beach&quot; is so out of character to the rest of his works, it is almost difficult to realize it is written by the same author. If you have read it, read some of his OTHER books, they're MUCH better!"},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"This novel was a big disappointment to me. I had expected something rather better written, however the characters are cardboard, the dialogue is wooden, and it reminded me of a shooting script for a TV soap. The redeeming feature is not the plot line (which I thought was absurd) but the background scenario, the condition precedent for the story.**SOME SPOILERS** The background is that a nuclear war has taken place, and has engulfed the entire northern hemisphere. Everyone there is dead. The southern hemisphere survivors await the clouds of radioactive and toxic fallout to arrive and kill them too. I find this an intriguing idea.But that is as far as it goes. We are supposed to believe that, in the small Australian town described, people remained well-behaved and civilised, there was no looting rape or assault, people still showed up to work, and property continues to change hands in exchange for money. Well, something tells me it wouldn't be like that. Also, the dialogue is so corny that the characters are never clearly drawn. Overall, it's a thumbs-down from me."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"At first I was surprised to find what seemed to be very little action. About 50 pages in I was wondering when the tension would rise and things would really start. But that never happened. It's poetic in that way. Very \\"Hollow Men\\" - Not with a bang but a whimper. The whole book felt like the dying whimper of humanity, and that made it unique and special and perfectly executed in my opinion. I think Shute accomplished exactly what he intended by keeping things low-key and not melodramatic. It was still a book I got engrossed in, perhaps because it didn't fit any kind of typical survival/action/end of the world scenario. No roving gangs, no shoot 'em up, no real preparedness. Not to say I don't like those types of books. This one was just different, not made to be depressing or moralistic or inspiring or anything, I don't think. Just, here's the end, wrought by humans, nothing anyone can do. And then considering how people might handle that.

I mean, people can't be happy that they're *SPOILER AHEAD* going to die. Like most say, the book does lack depth in a sense that there is no underlying theme. But it is enjoyable read page after page. The more you read through the book, the more suspense you will have the close you get to the end. I was a junior in high school when I read this. I was reading this in class and I got extremely choked up. This book is sad, but its even worse if you consider the characters mindset near the end of the book. It's heartbreaking that some things happen the way they do in the book, however, what makes this book so good is that it is realistic. Their emotions, their actions etc are very realistic. Which only makes the characters feel close to you. Great, realistic, to the core type of book. WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?"},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"I just reread this about 8 years after my first reading. The first time you read it, it leaves you shattered - and the second time you will be effected the same way. But the second reading allows you to focus in on more details and admire Shute's writing style and character development.Needless to say, On The Beach is the epitomie of the End of the World genre. It's thorough and devestating. But what makes this stand out as the champion of the genre is the HEART shown in the book. This is the everyman's version of the end of the world. There are no silly survivalist groups, no hoarding masses, no space ships built to carry away a few lucky survivors. This is the simple story of an American Navy officer who found himself in Australia praying to get home to his family, and an Australian naval lt. balancing his family life with the love of his job.Some reviewers have bashed the book for not aging well. I would strongly disagree. It's amazing to me how relevant this book still is - over 50 years after the book was first published. Have we learned nothing during this time?There is a scene towards the end of the book where one character asks if the disaster could have been prevented, to which another characters states possibly, if the newspapers had made the possibility of disaster known to the masses, BUT:\\"We liked our newspapers with pictures of beach girls and headlines about indecent assault, and no Government was wise enough to stop us having them that way.

Quite depressing. The denialism and fatalism in this story written at the height of the Cold War makes me very very glad that that period of history is over. Our children, of course, have other end-of-the-world worries, but slowly dying of radiation isn't one of them (not that the nuclear weapons are gone.. we just don't think about them which is another form of denialism, I guess).I wonder why the idea of hiding out in radiation proof bunkers (ala Farnham's Freehold by Heinlein) wasn't explored by Shute. Five years was all they needed for the radiation to dissipate... surely SOME people could've survived that long underground. Stoically facing ones doom is a bit more \\"English\\" I suppose.. stiff upper lip and all that...I enjoyed the story, highly recommend it, and suggest that if you like Shute's style, thatA Town Like Aliceis another enjoyable read."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"I have seen the movie based on this book On the Beach starring Gregory Peck, Ava Gardner and Tony Perkins, and the movie was quite faithful to this book, though the book of course had more story to it, and was a very entertaining read. Though a sad story of how a last unaffected city is dealing with the fears of approaching nuclear meltdown, this book is very true to life in how people might react to this situation, the anxieties, and the helplessness of realizing there is nothing to be done to stop the approaching genocide. This book should be required reading in all schools around the world, so young readers can face the realities of living in the atomic age, and try to acquire more fans of nuclear disarmament."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"\`On the Beach' is one of the best books I have read in quite some time. Not only is it exceptionally well written, but it is gripping and moving as well.After a global war and the northern hemisphere being wiped out by nuclear bombs, the people of Australia are waiting as the radiation cloud slowly makes it's way towards them. An American submarine captain is stranded in Australia and makes friends with his Australian naval colleagues and with a young woman who reminds him of his wife who perished back in America. You follow them as they prepare for the worst and how they go about their lives in the last few months.One thing I found especially refreshing about this book is that everyone is remarkably civil to one another and law and order hasn't broken down. The main menace comes from the approaching radiation cloud, rather than the breakdown of society. It is thoughtful without being maudlin and the last fifty pages or so were especially moving and handled with great sensitivity. You finish the book feeling both saddened and satisfied which is truly the mark of excellent writing.I was surprised just how well this was written. Shute writes with rich descriptions that make you conjure the images up in your head instantly and fully engage with the story and characters. It moves at a decent pace and although the chapters are quite long, you can't help but read through them in large chunks until you reach the shattering conclusion. This left me feeling profoundly affected and I'm sure it will stay with me for a long time to come and I will revisit it at some point down the line. It is highly praised for good reason and I happily add my endorsement to this gripping and affecting novel.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"I read this book about 44 years ago when I was a kid and still remember passages.

This book is oriented for people below the age of 12. I believe this because of its dramatic intensity, explicity, and depressing ending. The story involves a navy captain who is attempting to lead a team of scientists through various radioactive plants. Their mission: to discover if in fact, radioactivity will lead to Earth's immineant destruction. The officer's wife begains to dissuade her husband from leading the expedition. However, fate intervenes and the government appoints him for the perilous mission. As they embark, each crew member will have to live in proximity 23 &quot;mates&quot;. The main problem on the mission is that many of the crew members loathe each other even more than the expedition. Shute does an excellent job at forming mini-biographies surrounding each character involved in the expedition. Shute revels facts as: Where they grew up, family, characteristics, and numerous other obscure facts. Every integral character has a dramatic presents in each chapter. Exposition is filled with wonderful discriptions of each character and essence of story. Which leads me to the mext paragraph. The narrative is very atmospheric. Atmospheric in the fact that it highly corresponds to the Cold War confusion that plauged America in the 50's and 60's. Shute chooses a documentary style of writing to explain the mission more explicitly. However, Shute aknowledges that spectacle alone will never suceed, characters will! Shute's unabated intusiasm and boyant persona endorsed the narrative to the fullest. In conclusion, this book is a fascinating novel.

A year ago, I bought the DVD, without questioning whether it would be worth it to own.I have watched it multiple times. It's the kind of movie to fall asleep to in order to avoid loud commercials, except for the end.One cool part is when there is almost no gasoline for driving in cars, you can see old Melbourne (circa 1959) with no combustion-engine vehicles except a very few for the military. So the people of the most southern major city in the world are getting around by: walking; bicycling; horse-back; horse-drawn carriages; and some public transportation.The casting is very good. Gregory Peck and Anthony Perkins are true to their characters in the book. Eva Gardner is in it to broaden audience appeal. Fred Astaire is believable as a scientist. I especially liked the performance of Donna Anderson.This movie is not for everyone. Would you like to ponder what you would do if you were one of the few survivors of radiation, and your time would be up in approximately six months.The plot of the story demonstrates the pleasant life near Melbourne which is made more appealing in light of the impending end, just as death makes our individual lives seem more precious. The crew of the surviving American nuclear submarine go on a mission to explore the American west coast including Alaska to search for any kind of life or hope that the radiation is receding. The story also shows the power of denial in our minds when facing the end.My generation lived in fear of this type of nuclear holocaust. Unlike this story, I believe that some of human kind along with the eco-system would survive a nuclear holocaust. It is ironic that the reduction of carbon emissions caused by a nuclear holocaust could save the humanity and the eco-system in the relative long term. In the absolute long term, the planet, the solar system, and the galaxy are temporary.A similar book and/or movie like this should be made about climate change, only instead of Fred Astaire drunkenly yelling at a party that the radiation is nine times normal background radiation, he should yell that the atmospheric temperature is one and a half times normal."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"Read every Nevil Shute you can get your hands on.

If you're looking for a morbid, anti-climatic story with little plot and way too much superficial description, this is a book for you.On the Beach was written during the cold war, when the specter of a nuclear apocalypse was ever present. The book takes the \\"we're all gonna die\\" mantra to heart. Reading it during the times would have surely resonated, and this is the only real value of the book. It gives a peek into the morbid obsession with nuclear armegeddon.The book flatlines about 1/4th of the way through, and you spend the rest reading about the characters planting gardens, buying items, and other trivial boring crap.

Maybe I went into it with the wrong expectations, but this is just a boring story about boring people who happen to be facing the end of the world. This would be a perfect book for the Oprah book club, because all those stories deal with boring people as well. I personally would have liked to have heard more about the submarine trips and have them gone onto shore and delved into that a bit more. Instead, I got stories about an alcoholic woman, a garden, a playpen, a car race, etc. The only reason this got 3 stars is because I liked the suicide pills, I liked the way everyone kept going on with their lives, like they weren't going to die. That aspect of things was interesting, but nothing about this book was compelling to me, not the writing, nor any of the characters. I found it hard to relate to any of them. Since I seem to be on the opposite end of the spectrum of everyone else, maybe I'm just missing something, so you should probably read it and see for yourself, but I'm sorry, there are many other better books out there about the end of the world (i.e. The Stand, Lucifer's Hammer, etc.)"},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"I found this book to be slightly boring.

On the contrary I have learned what would happen if ever a severe nuclear war occurred."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"On The Beach is the story of the results of a nuclear war and the last days left for those that survived it. The war pretty much has annihilated the Northern Hemisphere, with the remaining population living mostly in Austrailia, where most of the story takes place. We watch as these people, knowing that their time is limited due to the &quot;nuclear cloud&quot; that is slowly drifting towards the southern hemisphere, live their last months to their fullest. We have the Navy, headed by the Austrailians and one American, sailing to the north in search of survivors of this war. We have people like you and I, living in Austrailia, going about their every day lives, living as if there IS a tomorrow, as if there IS a next year. The tension increases as the story heads towards the end, and the reader knows there is no mistaking what that end would be.There is no blood or gore in this post-nuclear war story. If you want that, rent MAD MAX. This book is about people living every day,knowing that their lives are about to be cut short. It's about people dying with dignity. And it's about the devastation of war, and the stupidity that can cause a nuclear war in our own futures.Nevil Shute's ON THE BEACH is a classic. If you want to read a great nuclear war/end of the world book written before the end of the Cold War, this is it."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"&quot;On the Beach&quot; is one of those books that you read for the concept and the story, but not for the quality of the writing. The plot centers around the lives of a few remaining survivors of a nuclear war who live in Australia. Since the was has taken place in the northern hemisphere, Australia has largely escaped unscathed--for the moment. But as prevailing winds approach Australia, they carry lethal doses of radiation with them. The implication of this is that all of the characters in the book--in fact everyone in the world--will inevitably be extinguished.&quot;On the Beach&quot; has a profound psychological impact because it is devoid of the intense action that usually accompanies nuclear apocolypse films. The destruction has already occurred elsewhere and the citizens of Australia are largely going about their business knowing they will soon die. The fact that their infrastructure has not been destroyed and that all of their social aparatus is still intact makes their fate all the more sad and earie.Although this book is set in the Cold War it's outcome is still relevant and feasible today. The nuclear warheads generated by the arms race haven't gone away. The former Soviet Union is a desparate, chaotic place, and as several reviewers pointed out, more small countries are joining the nuclear club. One could say that Nuclear madness has merely transformed itself, but its danger certainly hasn't disappeared.I think everyone should read this book to be reminded of the possible future we all face.I read &quot;On the Beach&quot; in 1989. That same year I had seen &quot;The Day After&quot; and &quot;Testament&quot;. For some reason I had a morbid fascination with the end of the world, and what might happen after.&quot;On the Beach&quot; might seem a bit dated now. The consequences of nuclear war have been speculated upon for several years. In 1983 scientists came up with the nuclear winter theory, where all the dust and fallout from the explosions would block out the sun and cause the world to freeze over. It sounds plausible enough. Once the winter was over the ozone layer would be damaged and the planet saturated with ultaviolet light from the sun. Others argue that people would survive somewhere, not everyone would die from radiation.Whatever the case, &quot;On the Beach&quot; is still a powerful book. It makes you wonder how you would feel, knowing how you were going to die and when. The Australians are fortunate in that they are offered suicide pills for when the pain becomes too much. People aren't so worried about nuclear war any more. But on the news this morning I saw Boris Yeltsin remind Bill Clinton that they still have a nuclear arsenal. This was after Clinton threatened Russia with sanctions if Russian forces attacked Grozny... But we've managed to avoid nuclear war up until now, so there's probably nothing to worry about. Is there?"},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"In _In Search of Wonder_ (1967), Damon Knight devotes a chapter to \\"amphibians\\"-- mainstream authors who write a science fiction novel and then go back to what they were doing before. Some examples of amphibious books are Aldous Huxley's _Brave New World_ (1932), Bernard Wolfe's _Limbo_ (1952), Gore Vidal's _Messiah_ (1954), Pat Frank's _Alas, Babylon_ (1959), Anthony Burgess's _A Clockwork Orange_ (1962), Pierre Boulle's _Planet of the Apes_ (1963), William Burroughs's _Nova Express_ (1964), John Barth's _Giles Goat-Boy_ (1966), and Marge Piercy's _Woman on the Edge of Time_ (1976). Many amphibious novels are in fact more literate and original than a lot of genre science fiction.Is _On the Beach_ (1957) an amphibious novel? Knight argues-- and I concur-- that it is not. There are a few superficial resemblances to science fiction; but unlike the novels listed above, it is not really steeped in science fiction traditions. It is closer to such books as William Golding's _Lord of the Flies_ (1954), B.F. Skinner's _Walden Two_ (1948), Mordecai Roshwald's _Level Seven_ (1959), or Eugene Budrick and Harvey Wheeler's _Fail Safe_ (1962)-- novels that are eccentric but which were conceived and written as some kind of mainstream novel.Is it a good novel? You might think that a novel showing the world ending \\"not with a bang/ But with a whimper\\" is not a very promising proposition. But Shute is a writer who knows how things work. He knows how submarines and sailboats and Ferraris work. He knows what the best tires are for wagons and why cars are sometimes pulled with horses. He knows how to read a Geiger counter. He knows how Navy bureaucracy operates and what hard decisions politicians sometimes make. He knows the routine of running a farm or tending a garden. He knows why suddenly socks must be darned and shirts must be mended. He knows what a postwar church service would be like. He knows what drinks not to mix together, and he knows the best wines to drink from the wine cellar. He knows how the trade winds circle, blowing radiation ever southward. He knows the symptoms of radiation sickness, measles, and cyanide poisoning.He does not know any more than his characters how World War III began, but he-- like the characters-- knows how it _might_ have begun. How there was a Russian plan for a Siberian- Shanghai railroad, and how this plan, incredibly, might have led to a war where split second decisions were made-- a war in which nobody could risk refraining from using kilotons of nuclear weapons. (Shute had been an areonautical engineer who knew a lot about weapons. This section, in spite of its speculative nature, rings very true.)He knows why people do certain things. He knows why some people try to escape into drink, others into the routine of work, and others into family affairs. He appreciates why some people do not want to watch movies except when they are drunk. He understands why some people still think of their dead family as alive, and why others might become morbidly obsessed with death.Shute draws you into the world of these people who desperately want to continue to live normal lives-- but who know that their hopes are futile. But... would things really wind down as quietly as we see it portrayed in _On the Beach_? No rioting in the streets? No breakdown of civil order? Just a few decent people accepting their lot with stiff upper lips? I don't know. Shute writes so well that he makes you _believe_ that it could happen this way, but I Have My Doubts. In any event, _On the Beach_ is certainly a fine book that holds up very well, even after a period of almost 50 years."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"\\"It's not the end of the world at all,\\" he said. \\"it's only the end off us. The world will go on just the same, only we shan't be in it. I dare say it will get along all right without us\\"...I finally brought myself a copy of On The Beach. Since seeing the film (the ending of which still devastates me to this day) there was no way that I was going to bypass the book. Books are usually better than film. I'm not sure that is the case with this one.The story is about so many things- about hope, politics, desire, love and mortality. How would you be if you were faced with the knowledge that in less than a year you and your family would suffer a terrible and excruciating death?The story looks more at the way that people would cope with the situation- the denial, the constant ache of knowing that you would never get to do the things that you always wanted, the boredom of having to wait.The book however elicited less emotion than the film. Not so much the story as the way that it was written. The baby was more often 'it' than 'she', his descriptions were flat and the generational gap was wide. Nowadays men have more liberty to share and show their emotions, though Shute's male characters are all very middle of the century \`men must be men'. The father shows little to no emotion or connection to his family, the child is but a thing.That doesn't mean that it wasn't any good. I was still on the brink of tears and it was a very good story that will stay with me for a very long time, I just wish that I had read it before I watched the movie.I know that I will be passing this book on because someone needs to read it. It's a great book on so many levels. Political stupidity, human nature, reality. Read it. I'd give it 4 and a half stars if I could. Four isn't enough, five is too much."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"I have read this book twice now - with a space of 14 years in between - and I found I got a lot more out of it and remembered quite a lot from the first time. It was and remains the only book I've ever read that caused me to have tears streaming down my face at the end. The realism with which Shute presents his plot and its concept - the immediate after-math of an atomic/hydrogen war and the slow spreading of a radioactive envelope in the earth's atmosphere toward the Southern Hemisphere - is scary. With the approaching radioactivity comes the DOOM of the main characters of the story who live in Melbourne, Australia and who include among them a displaced U.S. submarine captain. What Shute offers us here is the ultimate &quot;what-if&quot;. What if this REALLY happened? How would any human being react if he/she could literally see the End coming and could not stop it? Shute's characters are haunting in that they are so REAL themselves just in the way they lash out in anger and moral injustice or recoil in overwhelming despair or even just succumb to numbing apathy. It is the infinite care and love with which Shute creates and develops them and portrays them to us that makes this not a hysterical sermon but a human story. Then he leaves them to die. As a reader you are devastated because you are left with nothing. Each of the characters in the end has to find their own way to die and the very last one is the one who seemed to have the most life and the most promise and the most vitality. Do I recommend this book? YES. You will never forget it."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"I've never seen this novel in a list of science fiction classics, but that's what it is. Shute, an English writer who moved to Australia, was a popular novelist of genius - he also wrote the famous war romance, A Town Like Alice (1950). In the 1950s there were many stories about global disasters, reflecting the fears roused by the threat of nuclear holocaust. Of all such stories, On the Beach is the most powerful, and the most direct. It's set in Melbourne. Nuclear war has devastated the northern hemisphere, destroying all life; and now, slowly but inevitably, the radiation is creeping southwards. Shute tells the story of the last months, before all life on earth is annihilated. Not only a deeply disturbing prophecy, this is also a triumph of storytelling: to write so gripping a novel, in which the main event has happened before the first page, in which the ending is inevitable, and no heroic action can avert the catastrophe, is a considerable literary achievement."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"In my opinion, this book is, today, wrongly classified as \\"science fiction\\". Being written in 1957, and a product of an incipient Cold War, maybe it was science fiction back in the fifties, but now \\"On the beach\\" is more like \\"apocalyptic fiction\\".The story is about what could have happened if the northern countries decided to strike nuclear attacks on each other in 1961. Two years later, the whole upper part of the globe has fallen under the radioative cloud, ant there's no one left. Because of the wind patterns, this dooming cloud is slowly reaching southern countries like Brazil, Argentina, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.Dwight Towers is the commander of one of the two remaining submarines existent in the US Navy, now based on Melbourne. There, he meets Moira Davidson, a young alcoholic woman, and her two friends, Australian navy-man Peter Holmes and his wife, Mary, and they have to cope with, literally, the end of the world.\\"On the beach\\" is not an action book, and it's not about heroic achievements to save what remains of Earth. This is a book of sorrow and regret. Nevil Shute's characters can be divided between those who have accepted their terrible fate, and those who will deny it until the end. That's what is most interesting, and most depressive too.Not a long book, \\"On the beach\\" seems to drag on for the first three-quarters, only setting a gray but necessary background, but the final chapters are like the water running down the drain in an emptying sink: twisty, fast-paced and hypnotic. Yes, hypnotic is a good word. The reader will keep reading, trying himself to look for ways out, only to discover that sometimes reality is more powerful than imagination.\\"On the beach\\" is sad all the way. In fact, the title alone is very depressive, once the reader understand its meaning, disclosed on a poem in the first page, and in the very last line. But it is also a powerful reading, one that will stick to the reader's mind after the book is finished. And, after all, this surely could have happened; in fact, Nevil Shute could have been a prophet. We all have to be grateful that he wasn't.Grade 8.8/10"},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"If you knew with absolute certainty that you were going to die within a matter of months, how would you spend the rest of your life? Written in 1959, the story depicts the aftermath in Australia of a nuclear war that Nevil Shute describes as taking place in the early 1960's. Neither Australia, nor any other nation south of the equator was the target of a nuclear device, but those in the southern hemisphere are condemned to death by radiation poisoning in the six or so months it takes the fallout to completely blanket the earth.Unlike the movie versions of his novel, Shute does not use his story to overtly condemn nuclear weapons, war, or America. Instead he focuses on the lives of a handful of characters whom he turns into a microcosm of humanity facing what we must all inevitably face.From Shute's description, Australian society was cemented together in such a way that even in the face of annihilation everyone would continue life in its accustomed patterns to the very end. The party animals continue to party. The sportsmen participate in their sports until they are physically unable to continue. Families raise their children and improve their properties to the very last day. Government workers compile and produce reports until there is no one left to read them. The surviving military of non-existent nations follows orders, protocol, and traditions that eternity has rendered meaningless. Students continue their studies to earn pieces of paper to hang on their walls. In short, no one breaks ranks in panic; everyone dies in formation.It's not that the individuals in the story are fearless stoics; each is shaken by the personal horror of death and the pointlessness of this life, but each constructs a fantasy or a purpose sufficient to maintain equilibrium to the end. For Dwight Towers, the CO of the USS Scorpion, finally the last vestige of America, it is upholding the highest traditions of the United States Navy and being absolutely true to his dead wife and children whom he expects to see again very, very shortly. For Moira, who loves him, it is becoming a woman worthy of a great man, a woman who because she truly loves this great man will not do anything to exploit his vulnerability to her considerable appeal. For John Osborne, the scientist, it is doing what he has always wanted but been afraid to do, auto racing. And for Peter and Mary Holmes it is planning and planting their garden and watching and worrying over their baby girl.Today no society anywhere is very well cemented, and there really are no ranks to break or formations to keep. Death is as certain for us as it was for the characters in Nevil Shute's novel. Sadly, we have nothing left to believe in."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"This will be a short review because a long one isn't necessary.If there's a post-apocalyptic novel that my girlfriend like's more than I do, you know you're in for a touch of romanticism, benevolent themes--and realism. As a fan of Bioshock and Fallout 3, the description--even the name On The Beach--spoke to me. Now, the truth of the matter is, it isn't anything like Bioshock or Fallout 3--it's more like the blend of The Notebook and Impact--that one movie with Morgan Freeman and the dude that plays Frodo Baggins--also a bit of Danny Boyle's Sunshine.The story takes place after a nuclear fallout (so you can see why being a fan of Fallout 3 drew me in) and it's about an American naval Captain and a some Australian people in a small town in Australia. The book is about them living their lives, waiting for the end to come. What little plot is in the novel plays around with them hoping that the radiation doesn't hit them.It's a bleak, lonely story; the novel is a decently quick read--the theme is varied, perhaps it's up to the reader to come up with one, as art sometimes does; and if I could boldly say what I got from this novel, it would be this: everyone is going to die sooner or later, but you might as well live your life with morality in mind; it's about doing the right thing regardless of the fact you're going to die. I don't want to go all preachy, so I won't, because On The Beach is never preachy either--it's a subtle sermon of living life to your fullest without being immoral and crazy.This post-apocalyptic is quite the opposite of Cormac McCarthy's The Road, but the themes aren't so different . . . it's just the opposite side of the same coin.It's a 4/5 because it's not the most exciting or best written novel in the world, but what it's trying to say is what's beautiful. I dare say that someday I'll read this book again, after I get through my seemingly endless list of books to read. Don't read it if you're a fan of The Stand, Swan Song, Oryx and Crake, etc... this novel is not meant to excite or make you think.

Unfortunately, this is a choice that some people face on an everyday basis, due to cancer or some other illness. In the case of Shute's novel, the characters find themselves faced with a rather messy, prolonged death by radiation sickness. One of the several post-apocalyptic classics to emerge form the Cold War Era, this is a very humane, compassionate look at a group of people living out their final days in a major Australian city after a series of nuclear wars wipe out all life in the Northern hemisphere.The characters reactions to their impending doom make it a very British book, reminiscent of the old World War II slogan, \\"Keep calm and carry on.\\" While every now and then someone reacts with intense despair, most of the citizens of this Australian town come to accept their fate and instead see it as a blessing that they are able to die together with their families. One character even reasons that it's better to take your own life while in your prime - albeit in unfortunate circumstances - rather than to linger into old age in a nursing home.There are some moments of mild, if sometimes shocking humor. An instance of this humor is Shute's narration of Australia's last Grand Prix race, writing of how people come out to the races to compete in their Bentleys, Ferraris, Jaguars, Maseratis, and Thunderbirds (including a car I've never heard of, called a \\"Gipsy Lotus\\"), only for half of the contestants to die mangled in wrecks. \\"He got it the way he wanted it to be,\\" the wife of one crash victim serenely comments. \\"None of this being sick and all the rest of it\\" (217).The ultimate conclusion of the novel is that if humanity is capable of such atrocity, then perhaps the race isn't worthy of the planet it so eagerly destroys.

Both the negative and positive reviews are accurate in their descriptions of the reasons. It is a challenge to read, especially from a 1950s, Cold War perspective.Nonetheless, I read it as a mid-teen in the late 1970s or early 1980s; very much in the throes of the second cold war. It was absolutely compelling then (read it in a single sitting) and now, as a 46-yr old. I now mostly listen to audiobooks while driving and found myself able to finish sentences, it was so compelling and memorable the first time.Yes, it antiquated, but so is the concept and the consequence. I read fiction not for grammar (one review's principal criticism; what would he say about Joyce?) or for accuracy.

The cast know the radiated dust is circling the planet bound ever further south towards the southern coast of Australia, yet the families still continue their mundane bucolic existence. Each chapter brings the plot and people closer and closer to the inevitable death via emesis and diarrhea. It's not a pretty death but each can choose each owns idiosyncratic death before the Big Death comes along.Families plant gardens ready to bloom next year, the hardware store still charges for items and the farm animals must continue to be fed. Dealing with tragedy is to act as if the inevitable is but a whispered fib, an unlikely conclusion or a passing fad. While the facts of global death from radiation, the radio silence from the northern hemisphere and the absence of life from submariner observation, the families talk lightly of the September death, the slow death, the inevitable death. It's painful to read the passages where the logistics of baby Jennifer must be discussed and when the topic of \`taking the pill' when it becomes too agonizing.Shute writes with a dash good vocabulary, a wide range of commonplace activities, the light conversations dealing with death and the infusion of banal details surrounding auto racing, fly fishing and gardening. Even while knowing that this book was once a serialized publication, I found most of the nine chapters to be very lengthy, devoid of stoppages, section breaks. It's not a very artsy novel, the passages aren't very well structured and it's mostly a flat novel dotted with a sinking depression bringing the reader near tears. For that feat alone, Shute merits a high rating."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"What would you do if you knew the world was ending in a few short weeks? The book looks at several people in Australia and how they deal with the end of the world caused by radiation poisoning after World War III. Even though countries in the southern hemisphere didn't participate in the war, they suffer the consequences of radiation sickness as well. This isn't a book about life after an event de-populates most of the earth and how to go on. In this book EVERYONE will die. The book is actually about coming to terms with the enevitable. Once read On TheBeach, you will still be thinking about it. Although written many years ago, it still seems timely. If you compare the time period (mid 50's) to today, would things be different? Would mankind react differently? That's what keeps you thinking!"},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"I had trouble reading the first fifty or so pages of this book. Shute's cadences are hard to get a handle on, and he has some awkward attributive tags on his dialogue. I initially had no sympathy for half the characters.I had trouble reading the last thirty pages of this book. Once I picked up the rhythm that Shute used to tell his story I became immersed in the world he created. The book changed from a post-apocalyptic science fiction novel to something greater. On the Beach transcends generic boundaries and becomes an elegy for the human race in an extinction that has not happened yet. I had trouble reading because of the tears in my eyes.On the Beach is one of the most emotionally powerful books I have read in a long time. After putting it down, I tried to reflect and determined it had been almost a decade, when I read Lawrence's _Sons and Lovers_ that I was so moved by a book. I have a tender heart, but this book is not emotionally manipulative in a transparent way that cheapens the effect. On the Beach is powerful because it asks and answers fundamental questions about our being in a way that is truthful to what it means t be human.Shute asks: \\"What do we do in the face of death?\\" He shows that we live as much as we can. We love. We make plans for the future. While we face death individually, we move towards it collectively. We are all cosigned to the same fate, but we do not have the certainty of the time that his characters do. On the Beach is an extended metaphor in a way, and as such is both an elegy and a celebration of what it means to be human. Sometimes that is beauty in the face of horror, and both come from the same root."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"on the beach remains the king of PA novels. the movie couldn't even come close to doing it justice. the book has all of the determination in the face of impossible odds that i like about PA except this story doesn't have anything they can do to save themselves. there is only the final days and our final gestures. doom is inescapable. it's very dark and very moving. i applaud the author for his ability to portray the best of western civilization, our resolve, our family values, our technology and the willingness to stand together. this is an excellent novel."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"I was so happy to find this book on Amazon!

I can rightly say that I have never been so emotionally gripped by a novel. I couldn't bear to ever put it down. Now, enough of my gushing, here's the real dirt on why this is one of the most phenomenal novels ever to tackle the subject of Nuclear War:It addresses the topic of a nuclear war not in the context of techno-thriller explosions, but in the context of the horror of is aftermath. Once all the political and military hotheads have finished blowing each other to pieces, all that is left to do is come to terms with the disaster and it implications (a topic made even more timely by the recent nuclear testings by India and Pakistan).The one aspect of &quot;On the Beach&quot; that had a profound emotional impact on me was how the last remaining survivors cope with reality of what has happened. Some panic, while others cling to the unrealistic hope that the disaster is not as bad as they thought. Soon, this all gives way to melancholy emotion of accepting the inevitable. While death is common in everyday life, it is tempered by the knowledge that life will go on. The saddest and most profound emotion Shute creates is the despair in knowing that after death, there will no longer be life."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"Nevil Shute's 'On the Beach' imagines mankind on the very verge of utter apocalypse, with only the population of southern Australia temporarily surviving the effects of a colossal nuclear war that has already extinguished human life in the Northern Hemisphere. Lethal levels of radioactive fall-out are spreading throughout the Southern Hemisphere and the characters have \\"maybe\\" three months to live when we are introduced to them, their life span dependent upon wind patterns and personal choices.Commander Dwight Towers, a U.S. submarine captain is the central character around whom Shute spins the intertwined stories of a ship's officer Peter Holmes and his wife Mary (along with their newborn); Moira Davidson, a pretty young woman; Moira's cousin John Osborne, a scientist/race car enthusiast; and a collection of other related persons in Melbourne (c. 1963) as they anticipate the extinction of man and, necessarily, their own deaths.The novel begins with an epigraph from T.S. Eliot's 'The Hollow Men', in part: \\"We grope together/ And avoid speech/ Gathered on this beach of the tumid river ... This is the way the world ends ...\\" A close reading of the poem will likely cast a distinct interpretation of the novel, different from the \\"facing the end of the world with a stiff upper lip\\" reading.Like the \\"hollow men\\" of Eliot's poem, the characters of Shute's 'On the Beach' confront mortality together, and yet alone. Their stories provide a range of choices (overwhelmingly influenced by deeply ingrained habits): from the path of duty and faithfulness to family, a final fling at a life's goal and the opportunity for grand achievement, or a good-faith effort to properly exhaust the club's supply of port!Published in 1957, 'On the Beach' recalls the immanent danger nuclear holocaust represented then (it continues to exist, its just that we have become inured to it), but also retains a certain civility in its representation of the Armageddon. We are not vividly told the details of horror and destruction, nor does the book dwell on the primitive behaviors modern cinema has conditioned us to expect under the circumstances. Although there is mention of those who abandon themselves to drinking or despondence in their final months, these portrayals are brief and remain on the periphery. Decency ... how quaint!The advantage of such decent characters is that it is easy to empathize with them, and to care about their fates (and to realize they represent the bulk of modern humanity). Shute is an effective storyteller and includes several sub-plots (like the main mission Towers and crew are assigned) that complement the meta-theme of confronting mortality.The quiet decency of the characters also serves to better relate to the \\"hollow men\\" of Eliot's poem. The characters largely occupy themselves with routine activities, while dwelling upon an imagined future that denies the pending end. Their daily activities mask their fundamental passivity. They await their certain death like the \\"hollow men\\" in the poem: \\"We whisper together/ Are quiet and meaningless/ As wind in dry grass/ Or rats' feet over broken glass/ In our dry cellar.\\"These are not persons who, in Dylan Thomas' words, \\"Rage, rage against the dying of the light\\" or, in Eliot's, resemble \\"Those who have crossed with direct eyes.\\" These are ordinary people continuing their ordinary lives, waiting \\"on this beach of the tumid river\\" to be ferried across by Charon, with possibly one exception. Commander Towers sets sail into the mists, seeking to do his duty to the end and to keep a metaphysical appointment with his family, a vaguely articulated reunion in an afterlife (in doing so he retains a sense of a human soul).The book seems like an extended tale based upon Thoreau's words, \\"The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation.\\" Both Eliot's poem and the epigram of Shute's novel end with the words,This is the way the world endsThis is the way the world endsThis is the way the world endsNot with a bang but a whimper.'On the Beach' is an easy read, but difficult to put down and even harder to forget. In many ways its message is more haunting or unnerving than the violent telling of many imagined ends of the world."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"I read this novel as a young teenager, shortly after the Cuban Missile Crisis (when it briefly seemed quite possible a nuclear war with the Soviet Union might start at any moment). I cried a lot while I read it, especially at the end. The Aussies in it seemed more like rather stuffy Brits than like our concept of modern sporty outgoing energetic people.It's all about carrying on as normally and honorably as possible as the world of humanity quietly and slowly ends. I remember wanting them to stop being so passive, to get organized and fight to survive -- go to the deepest caves, stock them with necessities and seal them off for as long as it would take for the radiation levels to fall. But they go on doing their jobs, caring for their families, right to the end. I've seen a movie and a mini-series, and neither seemed to me to have the emotional punch of the book. I'm sure it's dated -- now space might be a possible escape route, and perhaps people just aren't as innocent and noble any more."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"This book gets my vote for the one most likely to make you want to jump off a bridge. The same, amazingly enough, can be said for the movie (starring Gregory Peck) which is a masterpiece in its own right. Don't get me wrong...the book is brilliant. Sol Stein--that great teacher of writers--counsels \\"The reader is looking for an experience.\\" Well, that's exactly what you get here. And it will leave you exhausted and not a bit horrified. I won't rehash the plot. You can get all of that you want from the other reviews and the official descriptions. And not to give any spoilers, but the most harrowing scene for me was the one where the young sailor is explaining to his wife her responsibilities should he not return from his submarine expedition to the poisoned North. As repeated before, the characters are all awaiting an impending and apparently unstoppable death, and the sailor tells his wife that if he doesn't return in time it will be the wife's task to administer the euthanasia drugs to their infant before she herself is overcome by radiation illness and unable to act. She responds hysterically, and refuses to do it. He calmly explains that if she fails she could perish before the infant does, and the child could be left alone, sick, and crying for hours or even days before death comes. She sees the light and agrees. Anyone who can read that scene and not be affected has a heart of stone, particularly if you've ever had a child of your own. The same scene in the movie is equally hard to watch. So if you like apocalyptic fiction, and you're looking for \\"an experience\\" then by all means read this book. It's one of the best. But don't say you weren't warned. I first read this book over thirty years ago and to this day I avoid it like the plague. Same for the movie. I don't know which is a more disturbing experience."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"Futuristic novels dealing with life after man's cruelty to man devastation through nuclear spill out ordinarily depict men as beasts in anarchy and don them names like Mad Max. Such is not this novel.Instead, this novel takes a really different perspective of an awful event. It is a love story amid the tropics of Australia among soldiers and demoiselles, and all in the light of love to which not one scene involves illicit sexual contact, or even context.Written primarily for dialogue, this is more a screenplay than novel. The characters are rich and pure, and the flippant Moira's flirtatious remarks and cunning witticisms make the otherwise stark and droll man-in-her eye, Cmdr. Dwight Towers, acceptable. She carries almost all scenes, and her positive attitudes in life or world measured by months, then weeks, then hours, are true to the end.Although I may have given away the ending, this story is really aTitanicon an epic proportion. Love can grow even in the worst moments in man's history. And, even the little palpitations of certain people's hearts are worth reading about - and are more fun than having someone spew for countless pages about the reasons why man would destroy all humanity. And, to Nevil Shute's credit, he rarely discusses why or never philosophizes about how come. Instead, this is a man meets girl, man \\"kind of\\" gets girl (and vice versa), and man and girl lose each other and selves . . . story.The Australian relaxed atmosphere of enjoying life to the fullest adds to the contrarian view of this seemingly morbid topic. To the end, the people engage in sports and have outings for the simple reason that these events are what men and women live for.Surprised by the novel, except the inevitability of the ending, this book compares to his other great novelA Town Like Alice. Now I need to rent this movie which I can only imagine follows the book which is tailored so well for the wide screen"},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"What would you do if you knew that, in 6 months, everyone you know would be dead? That every human being on this planet would be dead? That every animal on this planet would be dead?Would you go to work? Plan on the birth of a child? Plant a tree that won't produce fruit for five years? Follow the fishing rules? Would you make sure your cows would be fed in the weeks following your death? Worry about marriage? Drink yourself into oblivion? Would your feelings toward religion or nationality change? Would you accept a check for a purchase? Would garbage be collected? Would you start college?Would you decide to end life on your own terms?In On The Beach, by Nevil Shute, these questions and others must be addressed. There was a war. It really doesn't mattered who started it, or why. The result is that many areas in the northern hemisphere were turned into radioactive wastelands, and a planet-wide plume of dangerous radioactive particles is slowing, but surely, covering every square inch of the planet.There is no escape. The fatality rate is 100%. The plume will eventually reach 100% of the human population. As radio signals stop transmitting, survivors can predict the location of the deadly plume and its proximity to them. As certain as the sun rises and sets, the plume continues its journey.This is the story of the humans left alive in one of the last places on Earth untouched by the radioactive plume: Melbourne, Australia. An American submarine captain, an Australian navy commander and his wife, a local woman living with her father on his farm, and a CSIRO scientist with a passion for fast cars have their lives, and deaths, intertwined.This book was written in the 1950s, and the Cold War was in full bloom. Shute mixes the pessimism of any future with the nobility of the human spirit. You will be depressed, and your mind will be pleading for another ending, any kind of miracle, a technological advance, or a safe haven that will allow these kind people to live.There is no escape. The deadly radioactive plume has no intelligence, no soul. No United Federation of Planets appears to save humanity from themselves.Humbling, sobering, and haunting. How would I behave?I hope I never have to know..."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"This book is beautiful, beautiful in a sad and heart wrenching way... like finding a dead butterfly. The world is winding down; an all out nuclear war has ravaged and wiped out the entire northern hemisphere. Those who weren't claimed by the bombs themselves died from the radiation. The southern hemisphere waits patiently for their time, as the radiation sweeps slowly southward, taking with it town after town.In southern Australia the last of the large cities prepares for their demise. One of two remaining American Nuclear Submarines has made it and it's crew reports in to the Australian Armed forces.This book mainly follows two men, Peter Holmes an Australian in the Navy who is a new father, and Dwight Towers, an American Commander of the Submarine \\"Scorpion,\\" a refugee in Australia. Peter is assigned to Dwight's submarine as the Australian Liaison, however the military aspect of this novel is truly nothing but background. This is a book about people, who know that death is swiftly approaching through the air and that there is nothing they can do to stop it. At the start of the book it is December 27th, and the radiation is due to reach them in September. We follow several members of the town as they work to go on with their daily lives all the while knowing that everything will be ending. Some live in a state of denial, planting gardens they will not live to see bloom, others attempt to live out what fantasies they can, racing fast cars with reckless abandon. Still others accept what is coming and live their lives the best they can.This is a story of quiet desperation, terror, acceptance and the decision to die with dignity. The writing style is fine, though not brilliant, perhaps this is because of the time it was written in, or perhaps Shute's idea was grander than his literary ability. Some of the words were awkward, which I simply attributed to my not knowing Australian slang, also many of the male characters can come across as fairly detached while the women verge on a touch of insanity. I contribute this to the fact that it was written in the 1950's when the men were expected to be both strong and reserved, and the women were still considered the \\"weaker sex.\\" There is also a deep rooted sense of morality and duty that courses through the novel, there is no looting, rioting, or mass pandemonium, rather we see a quite resolve, camaraderie and sense of dignity.Many have said this novel brought them to tears, though I can see my mom bawling if she read this, I did not cry, instead I found myself feeling empty, disturbed, and emotionally drained. There is no action in this book, save a car race, so if you are looking for fighting, explosions, and mutilations, look elsewhere. This is instead a powerful study of what those last days could be like. I wish they made books like this required reading in school, the next generation might think a little harder."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"I believe the premise of this book is excellent, but the execution of the idea leaves something to be desired. The novel begins after a worldwide nuclear war has just ended. The bombs hit in the now completely destroyed northern hemisphere. People are still alive in the southern hemisphere but have only a few months left until the fallout makes its way south. So basically, the books asks, what do you do, how do you behave, when you know that everyone left on Earth has only a few months left?The book takes place in a town in Australia. Dwight Towers is an American naval officer who has been blended in with the Australian navy since the American Navy is all but gone from the war. He is given command of a submarine which goes out on missions to find signs of life and measure radiation levels. He becomes friendly with an Aussie officer who introduces him to a local girl. The girl's job is to keep Towers' mind off of his now dead wife and children. The Aussie officer is married with a small child. He and his wife try to keep life as normal as possible from day to day.I love the premise of the book, but it's not all-together fascinating in its style. There are parts that I couldn't stop reading. But other parts dragged on with little happening. It's also true that Shute isn't the greatest writer in the world. Point of view or even location sometimes shifts from one paragraph to another which can be jarring. On the Beach is a great idea, but couldn have been written better."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"How would you live today if you knew, for a cold absolute fact, that you and everyone else was going to die tomorrow? No escape, no chance for escape, what would you do?'Not with a bang, but with a whimper'. The genius of this book, to me, is the description of the small events that make this book such a classic. The pogo stick, the bench for the lawn, the drinking of 6,000 bottles of excellent Port all open a door to these characters' souls,the reasons for continuing to live when there simply is no future to live for. The cross section of humanity in this book face the end, their end, with a majesty and a grace that is both inspiring and humbling as a triumph of the human spirit in the face of overwhelming annihilation.The book was written in the 50's and it has dated a little bit. But in so many ways, its appeal is timeless. Anyone can visualize the absolute horrors (and the folly of 'winning') of a thermonuclear war with the contemplation of the simple act of injecting a radiation sick infant child with poison, especially your own. Kindness is two little pills in a red box. Everybody dies, but the manner of their dying is theirs' to decide. This book is simply a classic."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"Shute's 1957 best seller about the grim danger of nuclear war which stalks man's very existence will shake up the most complacent reader. Written during the Cold War, it is a stirring plea for sanity among governmental superpowers, for they alone have the dreaded capability to actually destroy the world. Yet the plot develops with sincere concern for the Human aspect of this horrific catastrophe. Starkly chilling the story chronicles the last six months of Life on our planet for the people living and stationed in Australia-the southernmost section, near Melbourne. By the time the novel opens, nuclear war has wiped out human life in the entire Northern Hemisphere; it is just a matter of time before global winds shift patterns to carry the radioactive cobalt particles into the Southern Hemisphere. Annihilation by gradual but inexorable Contamination, which is our own fault!.How humanity copes with impending and inevitable death make a sobering tale; each character demonstrates his/her own foibles, suffers denial phases, and invents ways to deal with the end-not only of their own lives, but all human kind on the planet. Readers will mourn not just the character whom we come to care about, but also the needless and painful fate of man. The animals would survive longer, but eventually succumb to the poisoned air, water and vegetation. By the time Earth would again be habitable (20 years hence) there would be no humans alive to enjoy or revive it. Not because of an alien invasion or an act of God, but because of our own arrogant and bellicose stupidity.Dwight Towers is the highest ranking US Naval officer, currently commanding one of the last two submarines; still considering himself married and a family man, he does everything by the book-Navy to the end. Australia has ordered native Peter Holmes to serve as Liaison Officer for Dwight as the ship explores, with great circumspection, the remains of the deserted US and other coastal area which have gone silent. Peter's wife, Mary, is concerned mainly about their little house in the country and their young baby. Her girlfriend, Moira, is invited to a party to help keep Dwight occupied; seems it's difficult for Northern Hemisphere types to keep their cool in Australia, where life still maintains some degree of normalcy. John Osborne is a scientist assigned to check the levels of radiation during the two-month recon cruise, though he would much prefer to enjoy his private pride--a Ferrari--while he sill can. One by one our friends succumb to death by radiation sickness--many opting to take a cyanide pill calmly in their favorite settings. One of which proves to be on the beach.This terrifying cautionary tale reveals man's futile attempts to salvage the future which he unthinkingly destroyed;the dark plot development focuses on the last efforts of humanity to preserve the dignity of the species and its once bright accomplishments."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"I read this book one September years past.

With the setting, they draw You inexorably into their world, Your world, a pending situation so threatening, so real, that ignorance is obviated and altogether impossible. Mr. Shute presents such a credible story of verily apocalyptic proportions on a general, mundane scale, and of cataclysmic complexities on a personal, emotional level, something with which We can all relate. It is an extraordinary novel, not only recommended by me, but advocated, i trow, by human nature and tendencies collectively.

These last survivors know that deadly fallout will come to claim their lives and their only hope is a stranded submarine captain and his crew. While being strikingly original for its time, the book ends up being a dreary exercise in dignity and hopelessness.My biggest complaint is that Shute's characters lack any color and fail to generate any empathy as they fret about their ordinary lives. Much like wooden pop-up targets at a shooting gallery, Shute's characters appear and reappear just to give a few mundane lines and then fade away until they are needed again. They talk about milk, Pogo sticks, playpens, alcohol, gardening, racing, etc. while the End of the World creeps ever closer and closer to them. Thus, the book's inevitable conclusion fails to affect the reader just as it is hard to feel sorry for pieces of cardboard.On a plus note, Shute really knows his technical details when it comes to a submarine lifestyle and nautical navigation. Unfortunately, Shute's maddeningly simplistic writing style fails to paint any atmosphere of, well...anything.Luckily, imitation is the highest form of flattery; several contemporary books expand on Shute's nuclear vision with much more energy, realism and humanism.

I had seen the original movie several years ago. I thought it was a good film and I was excited to read the novel. To say the least, I was disappointed. The premise of the story is a good one with interesting possibilities, however the author could not bring it to life for me. There is no real plot. There is no action, drama or intrigue. Basically it about a group of \\"ordinary\\" people waiting to die from radiation poisoning. So, that makes it a character study, which is fine except that all the characters are poorly drawn and uninteresting. I have not read anything else by Nevil Shute, but his style of drawing characters here is much like a 1930s - 1950s B-movie screenwriter. I have a hard time believing that people really talked like that. I know it is a different country and a different time, but I have read other contemporary novels written during this same era and this novels characters compare very poorly. I could not identify with any of the major characters. The only character who seemed to act with any passion and believable drive was Seaman Ralph Swain, who jumps ship in Seattle. At least he acted like someone who is still alive (ironically) instead of walking around in a daze of denial.I think this is a worthwhile read, however it is not a \\"classic\\".

Cmdr. Peter Holmes being recalled to active duty. Then we learn that there is no oil or gasoline after a short war in the Northern Hemisphere. People travel by horse or bicycle now. Brown coal alone provides electricity. Holmes will be liaison officer on the USS Scorpion, an atomic-powered submarine that discovered lethal radiation at all American naval bases; there is no radio contact with the USA. They're all silent! The Russian-NATO war was followed by a Russian-Chinese war, then by an Israeli-Arab war. Only Australia remained, until the radioactivity arrived there. Holmes visits the submarine and invites Commander Dwight Tower USN to visit his home. The winds carry radioactive dust, and radiation sickness is beginning to appear. Its so unfair.The book tells of their lives. The local church is packed. The Scorpion will travel to check the radiation levels in the northern ports. The empty streets are swarming with people, dancing and drinking like there's no tomorrow. Business is slowing down, people are working less or out of a job. When the submarine visits Port Moresby, Cairns, and Port Darwin they see no people; they're ghost towns. Chapter 3 tells of the surprise attacks and miscalculations that started the war. The ports along the eastern seaboard of America were dangerous to explore because of the sea mines around the harbors. In Chapter 4 the submarine will explore the west coast of America to test if the radioactivity is subsiding. The effects of radioactivity on a body is similar to the effects of cholera. There is no cure. The Government plans to hand out free suicide pills!Shute uses subtle humor to mock Holmes' attitude about women: \\"living in a sentimental dream world\\" (Chapter 5)! The submarine travels to Washington state and visits Edmonds, 15 miles north of Seattle. They're all dead (Chapter 6). Life went on, but fuel for fires and little luxuries became scarce. Now motorcars appeared on deserted roads (Chapter 7). Some have saved petrol, but now the problem is tires. Money decreased in value and importance; it was the goods they bought that was important. (What happened to productivity?) Their Grand Prix for racing cars symbolized the bleak future. Does alcohol increase the tolerance to radioactivity (Chapter 8)? There is a meeting in Melbourne. Holmes notices a number of absences (Chapter 9). This chapter tells about the end of the characters in this novel. They suffer from radiation sickness, then take the suicide pills handed out as the last gift from The Best and The Brightest. Those who say it was a miscalculation never read Machiavelli as to the effects of fortune on human activity.This is all so unfair! You would hope the primitive peoples in North and South America, Europe, Africa, and Asia would somehow survive. The film of this prophetic novel was a justified success, and warned and educated the public about the dangers of radioactivity. A few years later there was a treaty to ban nuclear testing above the ground. The spread of science allowed many countries to create nuclear reactors, as they did with cannon and guns in earlier ages. Will the warning in this novel ever be forgotten?Note on the Comment. The original Amazon Editorial Review on this book mentioned the mass doom of people around the world. \\"They are the last generation, the innocent victims of an accidental war, living out their last days, making do with what they have, hoping for a miracle. As the deadly rain moves ever closer, the world as we know it winds toward an inevitable end....\\""},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"I don't read a lot and i don't like many books but this book is truly amazing! It is very emotional. The end is shocking. I really recommend it."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"The book On The Beach was an exciting and intense book. It was a book on life after nuclear bombs were dropped. In this book they were dropped in the northern hemisphere. It was an intense book because you didn't know what was going to happen next. I enjoyed On The Beach because I expected something dull to happen every time I turned the page, but something completely different happened. It was enjoyable not only for it's suspense but also for the love shared between the characters. They cared for each other enough to ask them to kill themselves if the radiation got to bad. If you want to know what life would be like after a nuclear war, read this book. If you support it you will probably change your mind. This book might even improve your vocabulary. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"This 1950s novel tells a very simple story. After a nuclear war has devastated the Northern Hemisphere (who knows how it started), the people of Australia have seven to eight months to live, while the radioactivity drifts into the Southern Hemisphere. As the radiation slowly advances, they die, either by messy radiation poisoning, or by their own hands. Somewhere in between, the characters try to cope with their own mortality.Why does this book stand out? Certainly not because the characters are believable, but because it broke new ground in the literary world. Written some fifty years ago, during the Cold War, it paints a vivid and bleak picture of humanity's last days from an Australian perspective, where everyone dies. It holds up the specter of what could happen.Given that this book was written in a time when the Civil Defense was prompting civilians to build bomb shelters, &quot;duck and cover,&quot; and to resume a normal life after a nuclear event, this book seems groundbreaking in retrospect."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"This has to be one of the most boring and stupid books i have ever read. The movie wasn't any better either.The people just give up and die. That might be exciting if the characters were developed and the plot was interesting. If you think about reading this, you may want to sit under some nuclear fallout first to lesson the agony of reading this worthless drivel"},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"I recently had to read this book as part of my senior English curriculum, and I must say, it is one of the worst books I have ever read. It is poorly written, with each page filled with mind-numbing drivel that is either part of a huge run of dialogue alone or description alone.I really had high hopes for this book, as the plot seemed intriguing, in that post-nuclear war sort of way. I was completely wrong however, as the nuclear setting actual factors into the book suprisingly little. It is pretty much structured like this: People in Australia generally go about their everyday lives for about 200 pages, and then all of a sudden- everyone starts getting sick! Of course, there are only about 70 pages where this happens, so really it plays a minor role. Of course, that is excusable, as this book is mainly a character study of a variety of people and their different reactions to the end of the world. This might have worked had the reactions been more varied than: A. \\"We're all believe we are going to die, let's do what we want.\\" or B. \\"I don't believe I will actually die. Let's do what we always do.\\"Also, it does not help the book that Nevil Shute is really a terrible writer. Why does each character need like 20 epithetical names? Why is Peter Holmes referred to as Holmes, Peter, the Australian, the liason, the lieutenant (or whatever his rank was), the young man, the young father, and a whole host of other names? Couldn't Shute have just said Holmes and left it at that? Also, the sheer amount of repetition in the language is amazing and the dialogue is terrible, sad, since it makes up so much of the book.Here is a nice phrase: \\"She oughtn't to keep crying like this ought she? Do you think we ought to get in Dr. Halloran?\\"\\"I shouldn't think so,\\" Peter said.At least shute simply used \\"Peter\\" there...While some people may like this book- worship it even- I simply felt that it was WAAAAAY too boring. This is the only book I have EVER read that has literally put me to sleep every time I picked it up. I am not joking, and I read a lot of books. The book simply doesn't feel like what it is- an end-of-the-world drama, weaving the tales of the thoughts and dreams of the survivors of the blast. Instead, the book usually reads like a poorly written Great Gatsby, full of drunken parties and annoying people overstaying their welcome. Avoid this book like radiation sickness, please, for your sake and the sake of others."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"This book is not for seniors in high school. Educators need to find more interesting things to read about."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"Mr. Shute had a wonderful scenerio for the end of the world in his book. Now if only he had given the idea to an author who knew how to write. This novel moved excrusiatingly slow and his repetitve australian dialect added nothing to help; if not hurt it. Out of all the books I have read, I would have to say that this one ranks among the top 10 worst in language usauge and sentence structure."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"Review: I rate On the beach 1 1/2 stars. On the Beach is one of the most boring and repetitious books I have ever read in my entire life. Each successive chapter is much like the one before it, in terms of mood and feeling. The overall feeling is one of such utter hopelessness and depression that it seemed to make me almost regret reading it in the first place. The only reason that allows me to be glad that I wasted my time reading this book, is that I now know never to read it again. If you are interested in reading about hopelessness, read Dante's Inferno, or Slaughter House 5, or The Green Mile, or the first book of The Stand. I promise you that those books will be far more interesting and meaningful than On The Beach. This book is about the end of the world, and yet there is very little symbolism of any kind, religious, philosophical or otherwise. On the whole, this book was very shallow and each chapter left me with little new to think about, much less discuss. On The Beach was meant to be a kind of anti-war warning, but other than that, it is about as puddle on a barely degraded roadway. There is some interesting characterization yes, but many of the characters seemed fairly dull despite how ever much time was spend on them. I would have to be paid 90 dollars to ever want to read this book again. In many ways this book struck me as more boring than The Complete Journals of Lewis and Clark. On The Beach should have been written as a short story, not a full size book. A short version of On the Beach would have spared me of its terrible multi-doses of boredom while still effectively conveying its plot and feeling."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"This is a horrible book. The characters are so preditable and the plot is so boring and uneventful. Nevil Shute has written a lot of good books, but this is definatly not one of them. If this page had a 0 star option, I would've given it that rating."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"This is not well written. It is the slowest moving, one of the most boring post apocalyptic books I have ever read. Very disappointed and definitely will NOT recommend this book to anyone I like.

Will not trust THAT anymore!"},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"ok well how can i start, i go to a private school in SUrrey B.C and im unfortunatly forced to read this book as a novel for our english class. what can i say it [is bad]! the characters just dont do logical things! ok if u knew the world was ending in less then a year would you just pretty much ignore it.. go on a submarine for half the time and forget about everything that was happening and not even try and save yourself? no, of course not. human nature is to survive! not to be willing to die and just deal with it... its human nature to stand up and try and not give up. obviously mr shute didnt know that while writing this book. He is very sexist towards woman and his style of writing is QUITE borring, i did NOT enjoy this book."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"This Book, if you can call t that, was absolutely horrible. It took me over a year to finally get through, and I hated every last minute of it!I have read otehr &quot;End of the Worlld&quot; novels, including Larry Niven's &quot;Lucifer's Hammer&quot; which was grand, but this book was just boring and non-climatic. Sure, while an interesting view of the possible end of the world is shared with us, it was boring, meticulous and just plain rather acking any interesting plot line. If you have been drawn in to reading this book, stop now, don't even consider buying it, it's really not worth it! You can have my copy if you want to read it that bad!"},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"Well, we had to read this book in English class. It is supposedly a classic, but many of the members of my class agree with me that it does not deserve its award winning title. First of all the characters in the book have very odd relationships, not resembling those of real people. Secondly, human nature is to protect oneself and its offspring. All the characters in the novel are taking their death as it comes, but if they were smart they could build underground shelters, stay there for 5-10 years and then return to the surface when the radiation has lessened. All in all it was a bit of a dissapointment, however the movie is very well done and I would recommend that first and foremost before the book."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"After being forced to read this my junior year of high school in English class, one of my friends hated it so much that he wrote a song called \\"Nevil Shute Can Kiss My *#&.\\" And my mother was so scarred after seeing the movie version as a young girl that she gets the creeps whenever she hears the song \\"Waltzing Matilda.\\" Be that as it may, this remains one of my favorite books.Set in Australia, the book opens with a horrific situation--the rest of the world has been wiped out due to nuclear warfare, and Australians, who were completely innocent in the skirmish which touched off the world's destruction, are the last people alive in the last non-radioactive zone in the world. Unfortunately for them, the winds are slowly carrying radioactive particles further and further into the southern hemisphere, and the residents of the continent are simply waiting for the poison to bring certain death. Depressing? Sure. A chilling warning of what could happen to the human race if just one person pushes that proverbial red button? Absolutely.Nevil Shute does a great job developing the characters and making you identify with them, from a young married couple with a new baby and a lonely young single woman to an American officer who just happened to be in his submarine with his crew when the war broke out, thus saving their lives and forcing him and his crew to live with the knowledge that everyone they love is gone and their hometowns are uninhabitable. This story brings the reality of nuclear war home, and is as relevant in this day and age as it ever was."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"I have read this book twice, first when I was twelve years old and then again recently at the age of twenty-seven. After fifteen years of reflection, I remembered this book both fondly and fearfully - fondly for the quality of its writing and the importance of its message and fearfully for the horrible picture it presents of one of many virtually unthinkable scenarios of the nuclear age. So I read it again and experienced a renewal of the same sense of awakening to the frightening world that we live in.Although the specific course of events depicted in this book is unlikely to ever occur in the real world, the story does present characters with the sorts of personal struggles that would likely face millions in the event of a widespread modern use of nuclear weapons. For example, the sense of helplessness experienced by the characters is a particularly moving theme that may inspire readers to greater political participation and interest in international affairs. In short, I think this is an important book, particularly for young adults whose views of the world and of their responsibilities in it are not yet as fixed as those of older generations."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"On the Beach is a marvelous novel it captures one of the greatest fears of the twentieth and the twenty-first century, nuclear war. Nevil Shute has done a great job of describing different ranges of characters. He has used single, married, and divorced characters. The basic theme of the novel was that everyone was going to die and the world as we know it will come to a devastating end. Although the theme has been used before in several novels this time it is written in a different style. Nuclear war in the Northern Hemisphere has caused so much damage (radiation) that it is now slowly moving to the Southern Hemisphere who are going to be innocent victims. Mr. Shute makes sure he gets the point across that that the war has caused many innocent victims. The only flaw in this novel is that it focused too much on the military making it slow at times. On the Beach is a great fiction novel that informs the reader of the possible future."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"On The Beach was a good book, although I thought the characters reaction to the coming radioactive winds was unrealistic. Many just stayed at home on their porches drinking a last drink or lying in bed. I for one would be running for Tasmania and eventually Antartica (if it wasint too cold). Maybe I havent lived in one place long anough to have and regets of leaving a lifetime home. But still, you hear about the thousands of refugees from war zones, it seems unlikeley hardly anyone would run from certain, and painful, death. The story was intruiging anyway and I recommend it for a good reader (some of the English terms and styles of writing are confusing). PS: Look up the definition of a fortnight before you read this :)"},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"I give this book 5 stars even though the writing style is fairly poor and the scientific theory is questionable. That is because the subject matter, and the way the author handled it, was stunning. First of all, writing as he was in a time when everyone thought one of the superpowers would push the button, he was uncannily accurate in his hypothesis that if total destruction ever happens, it will be caused by renegade smaller countries. More importantly, his variation on the theme of everyone living lives of quiet desperation, but here with a terribly fixed time limit, was bone-chilling. And it was the simplicity of the characters that made this book so poignant and thought provoking. One of the top 10 books I've ever read."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"i gave this book 5 stars even though the actual writing style left something to be desired. The subject matter of the book, and the way it is treated, however, make this one of the best books i've ever read. His vision of how the world might end seems uncannily prophetic, since he posits a situation where it was renegade groups in small countries that caused the whole thing, which is what would probably happen if there ever was world destruction. Also, the notion of a whole country going on with life as usual, but knowing its days are numbered and there is nothing that can be done was quite compelling. An unforgettable read."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"Shute's &quot;On The Beach,&quot; while an interesting character study on the aftereffects of nuclear war on a fairly remote population of people, makes for interesting reading, but is not especially outstanding in the realm of post-nuclear literature. The inevitability of the characer's demise leads them to dealing with their situation in many different ways, each of which is realistic and thought-provoking (what would YOU do?) but this book stands more as a study of human psychology in extreme conditions rather than one of the truly great &quot;nuke/mass disaster&quot; novels.Shute's writing, however, is fantastic and his characters fully believable. The fact that the book is rather short on much except conversation and character development sections more or less shows where its interests lie. This book is definately more for the intellectual interested in the effects of impending doom on people rather than the thrill-seeker looking for a graphic description of nuclear war."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"Nevil Shute creates a realistic portrayal of life after nuclear war and the psychological dilema of facing death. I liked the story and the writing was pretty good - save that Shute was not the greatest action writer. The story is classic and though it is pretty depressing, it made me value the little things in every day life. It reminds you to live for today knowing tomorrow may never come."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"I think the reason I was so emotional over this book was because when I read it, the threat of nuclear war was weighing on us every day.

It will happen.But, we face a slightly different end of civilization than Shute envisioned. Solid circuits, computers, banking, automobiles, cash registers, McDonald's, will disappear in the first flash, ElectroMagnetic Pulse, EMP. How far away? In the early 60's, long before today's circuits were envisioned, an H-Bomb test 800 miles from Hawaii blew out gadgets from circuit breakers to street lights. Luckily, we don't know the exact answer.

The end, while vile and disgusting, remains dignified and almost beautiful. That is what makes this such a perfect read. When you put down the book you cannot help but ask yourself what you would do if you had six months to live, and then three months, then a matter of weeks, days and hours. You take comfort in the new understanding in our world about nuclear disaster, and are chilled at what is still out there.This book brings your emotions crashing into a pit of despair, and after reading it you inevitably re-evaluate your life.

As usual, my suggestion would be to read the book first. The latter film takes place in 2006, not in the 1960's.SideBar: Does driven technological development and an unbalanced reliance upon scientific tools lead to an individual or group mindset that playing with Pandora's Box never has irreversible consequences?"},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"We need more books like this one.

But even that is less of a hope than a tour of what is coming to the remainder of civilization huddled in Australia.If you liked this type of book read &quot;Thinning The Herd&quot;, a new book which follows in its footsteps...ISBN 0971303207."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"On the Beach by Nevil Shute is one of many post-apocalyptic novels conceived during the Cold War. The story is not, however, set in one of the countries that was a major figure in the nuclear arms race, but in Australia where, following an atomic armageddon that engulfed most of the rest of the world, a nation awaits the global airstreams to bring upon them the lethal fall-out let loose by massive nuclear detonation. Some turn to alcohol and other vices; some follow their usual routines, denying the inevitable poisoning and some vow to live each remaining moment to its fullest. It is certainly an interesting premise. Sadly, Mr. Shute proves himself unfit to explore it aptly.I was surprised to read that the author had written more than a dozen novels before On the Beach because the book is so amateurish. Unimportant details are given overwhelming emphasis, use of description to color a scene is basically absent, and never is the novel given any noticeable tone. On the Beach would have benefited greatly from a major revision, one that would perhaps add some flavor and depth to it. With so many stronger post-apocalyptic novels still in print (A Canticle for Liebowitz by Walter Miller Jr., Earth Abides by George R. Stuart, The Last Ship by William Brinkley, Alas Babylon by Pat Frank) this monotonous, poorly written book should be disregarded."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"The book was extremely powerful and very haunting. I didn't read it, I heard it on audio book, read with absolute brilliance by Simon Prebble. A couple of very minor irritants were, as another reviewer observes, the peculiarity of strangely switching from Miss - to 'honey', and I thought the grand prix event went on too long. I suppose it had some allegorical significance, but i'm not exactly sure what that was, or maybe Mr Shute just loved Ferraris and auto racing. Minor complaints though. Great book. It will stay with me."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"If you are looking for twists and turns in a wild plot this isn't the book. Go back save yourself. Work in your garden. Live. However if you want a book that has some profound capability to incite empathy, this is the book. I don't know how Nevil Shute did it, but some how this author was able to paint a picture of a world about to end, and how humans react to this. The stoics will feel their eyes shrink-wrapped in tears, the emotional will cry uncontrollably, and paranoia will ensue. The one day I didn't read On the Beach, I had a dream I was in the same situtation as in the book except time had run out. How I reacted, how my loved ones reacted provided an insight in this dream that was truly enlightening. That has to be a good book, rarely does a book infiltrate my dreams. This book is a must read for all people and decesion makers that have the power of nuclear weapons. Shute is trying to teach us a lesson, let us not close our eyes and ears. Be outraged by nuclear policies."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"It's too bad that this book suffers so much from lackluster writing. The story is moving, engaging, and heartbreakingly sad. It really makes you wonder what you'd want to do if you know there were only a few weeks left, and how you would feel as the end approached. I found it very difficult to put this book down once I had begun, and very difficult to put it out of my mind once I had finished. The characters are real and believable - very important to a novel of this sort. While it is unfortunate that the author could have used a grammer manual, this is still a book well worth reading."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"&quot;On the Beach&quot;, in my mind, ranks with &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; and 1984&quot; as one of the truly great novels of the 20th century. Yes, it is a little dated; but world politics aside, this book has a power that is just astounding. I have never felt such empathy for characters in a book, as I do for the poor souls in Shute's Australia.The emotions in this book take my breath away.

Then, the disaster mechanism is pretty messed up, even by what we knew about bomb effects in 1963. Global Thermonuclear War would not end up this way. It might be just as bleak, but not the way Shute describes. But...get past that, and look at it as a group of people facing slow, creeping, inexorable death and you get a gripping story. What would you do if you knew that you would die six months from now? That the only choices were to choose a slow,messy, painful death by radiation poisoning, or a faster death by some other means? Could you give your children poison to spare them a painful death? Would you live your life to the extreme, knowing that a flaming death in a race car was faster and more fun than the alternative? It's a grim story, with an unhappy ending, but it raises some good philosophical questions about how we live -- and how we die."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"This is a must read!!!

Some block the future, others don't believe it can happen, but most simply go about their lives as they wait for the end."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"On The Beach uses the backdrop of the post-nuclear war and the nuclear fallout as a premise but the novel is not about the war or the fallout. It's about the people living their lives with the knowledge of inevitable ending nearing. There isn't any preaching from Shute about social injustice or anti-war statements really. Instead Shute asks questions about how we would live our daily lives given the premise that we are all going to die and that we know the estimated time/day (and others have the same day/time). Of course the writing style and conversations are from the 1950's so it's a throwback to an era before cell phones or other modern electronics and focuses on conventional relationships with actual personal contact. Shute does a great job going into detail on the current lifestyle workarounds of the characters due to lack of gasoline and other necessities as Australia is the last remaining 1st world nation with electricity. Mostly the characters party, eat and drink, and socialize which in an imaginary impending doom scenario I guess we would all do. Pretty classic sci-fi end of the world apocalypse novel with a mid-20th century perspective."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"This is an interesting book, but for some reason, I find it hard to classify, and can't quite pin down why. Please bear with me.When reading this book, keep in mind that it was written almost 50 years ago. Social attitudes change over time, even during brief periods. For this reason, some people may find the character's behaviour odd.The book was also written shortly before the Cuban missile crisis. The tensions which led to the crisis were already in development, and the Cuban missile crisis was the boiling point for those tensions.The author takes those tensions into a world where diplomacy failed. I don't want to re-hash what many other reviewers have already discussed, but the novel is set in Australia about a year after \\"the war\\". Most of the details about the war are sketchy at best, altho the characters do have a general idea of what occured. What does occur is that a few of the characters are suffering from terrible rage against the powers which waged the war, in which they had no part, but for which all of humanity suffers.The novel details the final months of a group of people who are simply waiting for time to run out. Some have commented on the inanity of carrying on with daily life, especially since life (as they know it) will simply cease within a year. I don't think that is too far fetched. Even recent events show that in times of disaster, many people realize that the best thing to do is try to carry on as best as they could.Commerce and goverment are still operating, but as the novel winds to the sad end, so do these institutions, as well as all the rest...It's a sad interpetation of what could have happened. I also think it's a valid book to read, even long after the end of the Cold War. For me, those most haunting images are those of a submarine slowly sailing past cities which survived the blast, but which eventually fell to radiation poisioning."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"Despite its rather benign title, this novel will shock the reader with the opening chapter, outlining the causes and consequences of a global thermonuclear war. \\"Total War\\" is something that hardly crosses our mind as modern Americans these days, but in 1957 it was a very real fear, and a very real possibility. This novel is an extension of those fears and provides a warning as well. The story is set in Melbourne, Australia, and the basic premise is quite grim. The entire Northern hemisphere has been ultimately destroyed in a massive nuclear exchange. Great, well how does this affect the peaceful residents of Melbourne, the southernmost populous city on the continent? As a result of the war nuclear winds, massive storms laden with fallout haven begun to circle the earth and wind their way south. These storms will bring an inevitable end to all human life on earth, presumably all life period. The most touching aspect of this novel is that every character knows their demise is soon to come, but they accept the hand they were dealt (a rather shoddy one considering they had nothing to do with the war) with dignity and await their doom living out their daily lives in peace.This story is a very grim reality check and certainly a worthwhile read. The dialogue has a tendency to be fairly formulaic and contrived at some points; however the climax of the story is quite suspenseful. Overall a very good read, anyone with an affinity for political or global thrillers would enjoy this peek into the absurdity of the of the cold war, as written by one who lived through it."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"The end of the world is coming.The madness of nuclear war has consumed the Northern hemisphere and the ensuing radiation is seeping south to destroy Australia. The population attempt to deal with certain death in a variety of ways. Some deny it,drowning themselves in drink. Others live their lives to the fullest before the end. This book is a chronicle of how it could have been. The threat of total global destruction may be less now that the cold war is &quot;over&quot;, but the threat of nuclear disaster is still present, if only on a smaller scale."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"This definately isn't a light book, by any definition. The subject matter is depressing, but in a good way. It makes you want to jump up and find a hippie peace movement. This book makes you think long and hard about the choices humans have made, and where they might lead us. If, after reading this book, you've slid into a colossal blue funk, may I suggest &quot;The Celestine Prophecy&quot; by James Redfield, which offers a more optimistic view of the fate of humanity."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"This book is not for those of the action-packed \\"post-apocalyptic\\" genre. This is for those of us who like to think \\"what if\\" for more than mere entertainment. You won't find bullet-riddled car chases or fights, and only the barest mention of revelry. There's no sex. No real violence (save some auto racing). Nobody even seems to raise their voice that much.Perhaps that's why this book is so creepy. The ordinary, undramatic drama of living with the knowledge of impending death. People deal with this all the time, but rarely en masse -- cancer victims, AIDS sufferers, etc. In fact, our culture has tried very hard to erase the thought of death from our minds; it is deemed \\"inaccessible\\" to the plebean masses, something relegated to goths and the morbidly depressed.Truth is, we need shots of this in our society like we need polio vaccines. Ironically, our stress-induced illnesses, which bring death sooner, could be greatly alleviated if we stopped running from the idea that we're going to die. In a way, this book is an \\"Ecclesiastes\\" for the layperson and non-believer alike: it's a wake up call, reminding us each \\"you're going to die; so what are you going to do about it till then?\\"The difference is, in this book, they know WHEN it's going to happen. A mixed blessing, to say the least, but one we can benefit from if we will just swallow that bitter pill (no in-joke intended here).As an anxiety-prone perfectionist high-achiever, I *need* books like this to scrub off the worry and preoccupation and guilt over personal failures. I *need* to be reminded that life is about more than achievement - we all live as if our careers, social status, accomplishments, and expectations are the reason for living. But if we knew we were shortly to die, how much would those things matter? How much anxiety would just drop off of us if life became about more than achievement and distraction, about more than frenzied activity and chemical relaxants?Books such as this, while not giving us complete answers, do help to point the way."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"It took me 60 pages to realize this book had been written over forty years ago; and then, only at the casual mention of a date. I found just about every issue in this book to be one of today also. The threat of nuclear weapons, wars in far away countries, and the viewpoints of the people. This book is timeless, and will continue to be so until nuclear weapons are completely lost or we blow ourselves up.The characters seemed very real. Their reactions to the forcasted time when radiation sickness was to strike were varied and extremely interesting. I was especially intrigued by the widespread instinct towards something like conscious denial, i.e. the planting of gardens for the following spring and such. I found the basic tone of this book to be similar to 1984, though not focused on the government, simply civilians in post-nuclear conditions. Anyway, the basic story line is that the northern hemisphere was is mostly void of any live whatsoever from a complicated nuclear war and the south (focusing on Australia here) is slowly catching the radiation. The time left to live is able to be forcasted approximately. Mostly, people tend to stay in their homes and the strict rules of society break down."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"Nevil Shute's classic book 'On the Beach' looks at the end of the world from a different angle--a nuclear war has raged in the Northern Hemisphere, over in a month, but because of the winds the radiation is slowly covering the Southern Hemisphere, none of which were involved in the war. It's the story of the last days on Earth as experienced by the innocent Australians. It is a sad book, down to the core. And you will find tears welling in your eyes as the characters of the novel attempt to deal with their upcoming fate. It's a story of love, hope, redemption, sorrow, and peace. this is one of the greatest books I've ever read. I highly, highly recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"\\"On the Beach\\" is one of the best novels I ever read.

I never read a novel that is so fascinating as \\"on the Beach\\". Although all movies about it are [bad], the book is just great. Especially the end, is extremely horrifying. However, if you like emotional books, you have to read this one."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"Poignant in its depiction of a selected few attempting to come to terms with the inevitable end of everything and everyone they have ever known and ever loved, On the Beach is a moving portrayal of those who have the courage to live those few, numbered days remaining to them as passionately and as fully as possible, even in the face of the end of the world. As they make plans that they know, within their souls, will never come to fruition as the world meets its doom, we become emotionally involved with Shute's characters, and we are reminded of how precious even such a mundane act as planting a garden can be. On the Beach makes you think, but it also makes you feel: this book is one of a small group of items in any medium that has ever made me cry. I can, with conviction, say On the Beach is the best book I have ever read, even being the bibliophile that I am. This book should be required reading for not only every student, but everyone. Period."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"The book, and the movie made from it, is one of my all time favorites. It's so compelling, that you'll probably miss the one line that explains the title. Nevil Shutes anti-war classic shows us how silly we are, running after all kinds of 'things' when, in the end, what we really survive on is each others love. The premise of the book(which I won't spoil by telling you, since he eases you into it indirectly)strips away all the clutter of life in one fell swoop, and shows with crystal clarity that beautiful and simple kindness 's we show to each other are the stuff that make the world go round. Read it, read it, read it. Then rent the video, take the phone off the hook, go to the bathroom first, turn down the lights, and roll-em'!"},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"Nevil Shute wrote &quot;On the Beach&quot; at a time when the world's two superpowers--both in the northern hemisphere--were glaring at each other pugnaciously, waving their &quot;city killer&quot; bombs, and bragging about &quot;Mutually Assured Destruction&quot; as their best insurance against nuclear war.Nevil Shute simply picked up that ball and ran with it. He assumed that the strategy had failed, and that the war had been waged, and the northern hemisphere had been destroyed by a combination of atomic blast and the nuclear clouds that emanated from those blasts.Australia, though, in the southern hemisphere--being a non-combatant--had come out unscathed in the war, and because of Coriolis force, was thus far not affected by the nuclear clouds of death. Coriolis force is that force which is created by the revolution of the earth on its axis which causes water draining in northern hemisphere sinks to circulate clockwise, while that in the southern hemisphere does so counter-clockwise. However, since there is a co-mingling of winds at the equator, the southern hemisphere was predictably doomed, and the folks who lived there knew it.The story is about the reaction of the doomed people in Australia, and their reaction to the awful knowledge of their impending deaths, and how they handled it. The protagonist, Dwight Towers, is a U.S. nuclear submarine commander who, with his crew and boat, are in Australia. There he meets Moira Davidson and they fall in love.Some of the throat-catching moments are when the American sub travels to the United States, and the silent streets on San Francisco are described. In the movie version, it was Seattle, and one of the sailors--a former resident of the Seattle area--leaves the ship to go home, a futile gesture, of course.The story describes the various emotions of those facing certain death from nuclear radiation. The death of the entire human race; inescapable, inexorable death, and how they handled it. Bitterness, of course, and recklessness (What can they do, kill me?) as well as foolhardy acts of courage (What? I might be killed?).This is a thought-provoking book. Only the shallow will describe it as &quot;out of date.&quot; One of the truly memorable reading experiences of my life. The movie is also fascinating.Joseph Pierre, USN (Ret)"},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"Nevil Shute uses no big scare tactics to try to make us wake up to the impending doom of nucuelar warfare in &quot;On the Beach&quot;. Instead he uses quiet characters doing their best to live the life they've always wanted. Most of the characters in this book do not face the reality of impending death which makes it all the more sad when it does come. A fantastic book that should continue to be read even though the cold war is over."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"Nevil Shute's \\"On The Beach\\" is a classic for good reason. Shute takes the most horrific event one can imagine--a worldwide nuclear event--and then turns the microscope on it, focusing in on just a few ordinary people who must wait for death as it drifts over to their hemisphere. We see military personnel, housewives, businessmen, and more. They come alive because they are just like you and me and the people next door.Shute's very great accomplishment here is to examine how each of the characters deals with their certain death. Everyone knows they'll die eventually; these characters have the difficulty of knowing that death will arrive soon, and that it will be slow and agonizing. What do they do? Each reacts differently and the humanity and humility with which some of the characters make their choices is startlingly powerful. Especially in a time when the world seems so uncertain, so cruel, this is an important book to read--or re-read if you picked it up years ago. Prepare yourself for a powerfully moving experience."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"This post-apocalyptic tale from the 1950s is an interesting exploration of the reactions of some Australians who will be among the last human beings hit by the fallout spreading south after nuclear devastation in the Northern Hemisphere.My spouse, who'd read this book when it came out, found it chilling and frightening, which I didn't particularly, perhaps because I've read so much post-apocalyptic science fiction. But also, I found an odd sort of hope in the way some of the characters dealt with living in the face of impending death. I thought there should have been more social chaos and more extreme insanity and despair as the end came near, but the reactions of this bunch of 1960s Australian middle-class white folks did seem plausible.The movie \\"On the Beach,\\" starring Gregory Peck and Ava Gardner, is good too and follows the book closely."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"To begin, I rated this book only 4 stars because it does lack a universal appeal. While I found the book to be mesmerizing, it lacks any direct action, and this tends to turn off readers who have never been weaned from their television sets. Instead, this is a book for readers with true interest in human interaction, and the intellectual maturity to let it reel them in slowly.As far as comments that the characters' reactions to nuclear holocaust are unrealistic, well that is just nonsense. Human beings have never experienced a disaster of this magnitude; to pretend to know how we would react is just a bit arrogant. Additionally (to address another complaint), while this novel does not seem like it follows a traditional plotline, it is actually quite easy to chart it on one; the one difficulty lies in the fact that the climax, as it were, is only one sentence long.What is most compelling about these pages--and a thing many readers just didn't get--is the repetition of the characters' attitudes, most keenly those of Dwight and Mary, two of the major figures. The reader is reminded, through dialogue as opposed to the equivalent of a narrative hammer, that disaster is coming and, as the book progresses, that it is coming faster. The human potential for denial is well documented historically and is demonstrated here through the various characters' reactions to the impending doom. I found myself periodically checking a map of Australia just to chart the progress of the radiation as it neared Melbourne (the last city, not a small town as one reviewer describes it) and cringing. It almost broke my heart.What finished the job was, for me, when acceptance of their fate finally comes to the characters and they spend their final days doing what they love best, or what they think is best, and finally, at the end of things, choosing to leave their world on their terms. The final conversation between Peter and Mary took many rereads for me to get over the blow. Perhaps this is because I am a young married man, and I feel keenly the years that are lost to them."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"One approaches a classic carefully. Rather than a novel experience, the reader brings preconceptions, prejudices, awe and maybe a whiff of resentment to a well-known book that is not entirely new to him.Mr. Shute delivers a slow-starting novel, liturgically paced with an inexorable conclusion that is with us from page one. This is the power of \\"On the Beach.\\" It has the inevitability of a Greek tragedy. The characters and the reader self-deceive, twist, hope, pray and promise-all to no avail.I would not call \\"On the Beach\\" timeless. The behaviors seem quaint and dated fifty years after the writing of the book. I doubt the characters had much believability even in 1957. Moira Davidson goes from dissolute debauchery to saintly status without even a pause for proper redemption. I can see the lovely Ava Gardner as the Jezebel, but it is quite a stretch to imagine her as St. Bernadette. Mr. Shute casts an American as a central character, but unfortunately he has not much an ear for American speech. For some reason, he believes American men, when addressing marriageable aged women leap from \\"Miss Davidson\\" to \\"honey\\" and then never call her anything else. (I don't know, maybe \\"Moira\\" is hard to pronounce.) Also, I fear Mr. Shute had little affinity for our youngest humans. The Holmes' baby girl Jennifer, was always referred to as \\"it\\" by Mr. Shute. These were small irritations, but jarring.Nevertheless, the power of the book is undeniable. There is a certain rightness that the events are larger than the humans involved. The humans respond with an orderliness that is astonishing, but perhaps Mr. Shute was trying to be kind in a very unkind world.

The final battle was set off by a misunderstanding with the bigger nuclear powers shooting first and asking questions later. The result is the northern hemisphere is gone, nuked to oblivion and the southern hemisphere is waiting for the radiation to slowly spread across the entire planet and kills the survivors.It's these survivors that we meet in Australia. And they're all taking it pretty well. There's no chaos here. Everything is running fairly normally, except for the fact that we're all going to die in about six months. And not a pretty death, but a slow, painful one.The big problem with this book is the quiet acceptance every character has of this. Yes, there are some characters deep in denial and some are planning for a world beyond six months from now, but never is there any sense of panic or desparation by anyone. The most panicked we get is they move up an auto race a few months becuase the time it's scheduled to take place will be after the radiation hits.There are some moments of hope in the story that someone might be alive in the northern hemisphere or that the coming end might not come. But these are quickly dashed and then everyone accepts it with quiet resignation.I'm sure when it was written, this book was strangely scary and virtually prophetic. But reading it now, it's a story that seems dated, with characters who fail to spark much interest for the reader. I haven't read a book since \\"Lucifer's Hammer\\" where I actively rooted for the apocolyptic event to happen already just to kill off some of the characters in the story and maybe get things moving. And that's the biggest flaw in \\"On the Beach\\"--nothing happens. We don't get to see the end of the world and nothing seems to make any impact on the characters. It's a hard book to read, not because of the subject matter but because virtually nothing happens and none of the characters are interesting enough to make the investment of time worth it in the end."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"Having been published over fifty years ago (long before Al Gore \\"took the initiative in creating the Internet\\"), On the Beach is a bit dated.

The book begins on December 27, 1962, about a year after the end of the \\"short war,\\" (p 9) \\"the Russian-NATO war, that had in turn been born of the Israeli-Arab war, initiated by Albania,\\" and the \\"use of cobalt bombs by both the Russians and the Chinese...\\" during which (p 61) \\"about four thousand seven hundred\\" nuclear bombs were dropped. Only the inhabitants of Australia (where the story is set) and Antarctica have been spared death by radiation poisoning.Royal Australian Navy LCDR Peter Holmes is posted \\"as liaison officer in U.S.S. Scorpion\\" under the command of thirty-three-year-old Submarine Commander Dwight Lionel Towers, U.S.N. Towers, former resident of Mystic, Connecticut is a bit of a paradoxical character. He believes in doing things by the book, and that \\"One ha[s] to live in the new world and do one's best, forgetting about the old,\\" yet seems certain that he will one day be reunited with his (undoubtedly deceased) wife and two children. The Holmes family (Peter, Mary and baby Jennifer) invites Towers to their place one weekend and asks their neighbor, twenty-four year old Moira Davidson, to \\"Keep him occupied...\\" Of their future (the radiation is expected to arrive less than a year later), she tells him, (p 30) \\"It's like waiting to be hung,\\" and (p 31) \\"It's not that I'm afraid of dying...It's all the things I'm going to have to miss...\\" But her attitude and behavior become more positive as her feelings for Towers become stronger. Holding fast to his idea of a perfect family reunion, Towers struggles a bit in maintaining an appropriate relationship with Davidson. Rounding out the cast is a relative of Moira, civilian scientific officer, John Seymour Osborne, who is hired to go on a submarine cruise to (p 39) \\"make observations and keep records of radioactive levels...\\" during which the actions of one crewmember are especially memorable, the mission being undertaken in part due to (p 29) \\"...radio transmission still coming from someplace near Seattle.\\"Alternately resigned to, and in denial of their fate, the Holmes' create a wonderful garden, Towers readies to see his family, and Osborne, prepares for the race of his life.

The submarine skipper torn between the love of his who perished along with the rest of America and the need for someone to share the final months.Other characters enter this strong drama. It challenges the reader to find his place is this What If drama. It subtly asks the reader, what would you do if you had only months to live and all of those around you would also perish. Would you fight and suffer or would you take the pills? What challenges would you undertake if there were no long term future ? What decisions would you make for your family?In a world where the science of mass death is proliferating rapidly to both states and stateless groups these may be questions which we or our children will need to ponder.It's also one of the few great novels where the movie came close to the book and is also highly recommended.It's a magnificent gift from a golden age of novels.

It could be a speculative fiction or just speculative.The story begins after the war is completed and radiation is now covering the world. Australia is the last place to be covered. You read how different people are about to meat their end, some with hope, others with reckless abandon. Still there are those like the US sub commander Dwight Towers is loyal to his country to the end by not allowing U.S. property in the end to fall into the hands of the Aussies.The book was written in the Cold War Era environment. So many people think that it is about countries and war; others think this story is some anti war story. The reality is that it is a study of people meeting a sure end and how they react. Other readers will balk at the actions of the people in this story; yet when they meet the same situation we will see how realistic the characters are. Still others will balk at the predictability of the characters. Still this is how many people get over a crisis by being predictable. It is these characteristics that make this novel timeless.

I liked it then but I love it now.This novel is about the end of the earth. It shows how we need to cherrish the days that we had and the long term effects of war."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"I read an older edition of Nevil Shute's classic story of the final months of humanity in June of 2007. I still remember the story as both a captivating read and yet a very dark tale. Apparently, a conflict in the Middle East and Balkans led to a domino effect of nuclear war. Shute's future reality (now it would be an alternative reality) has a major difference from our world: many more nations acquired nuclear weapons. Much of the Northern Hemisphere was annilihated as NATO, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China blew one another to pieces. While vast swathes of the Southern Hemisphere survived the fate of artificial dawns, a slower fate was in store as radioactivity inexorably moved south with the winds. This is the geopolitical background to the story.The human side of Shute's work is on the whole very readable. It ranges from the story of an American submarine captain who lost his family in the war to an alcoholic Australian lady who grew close to him to the tragic story of a young Australian navy officer's family to a scientist who's final dream was to win the last Grand Prix the world would ever see. This is a world where technologically powerful navies have reverted some of their few servicible ships to coal power. This is a world where the horse once again begins to replace the automobile. And it is a world coping with the reality of its own demise. A mysterious signal from North America briefly offers a faint gleaming of hope and leads to a desperate submarine mission to find the cause. However, ultimately, it would prove futile. And so the last humans were given a final respite to order their lives as time inexorably ran out. Some like some members at a prestigious club drank heavily while numerous others sought the comfort of God. Some like the scientist chose to drive for their dreams (in his case literally in particularly desperate and dangerous races). Above it all hung the simple question of how a technologically advanced civilization could destroy itself.While I don't agree with all the actions of Shute's characters and realize his specific geopolitical situation is now dated, I still found the novel a worthwhile read. It is well written, disturbing, and at times thought provoking. While not perfect, I recommend it with caution. It is not a tale which ends remotely happily."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"I first read this book in high school English a decade ago. I re-read it in the aftermath of 9/11 and the ensuing wars. It was a haunting read the first time around, but the Soviet threat was a dim memory for me as a child born in the 80s, and On The Beach seemed to illustrate just how lucky we were that the Iron Curtain fell and the Cold War ended. It was even more terrifying reading in the current decade, knowing the possibility of rogue nations or individuals unleashing a dirty bomb. Shute pointed out that when dealing with nuclear armaments, a small decision and mistake can have hugely terrifying consequences.However, the political discussions and implications aside, On The Beach is most touching for the humanity side of the story. What would happen to society, to the concept of right and wrong, if everyone knew that the end was in sight? Incendiary topics such as euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide become hugely important issues. All of the characters understand the terrible end waiting them if they go by radiation poisoning, yet they still struggle with whether to take the pill or not.You'll find yourself doing some self-questioning after you finish this book. What would you do if faced with the certainty that the world was ending? What are the important things in life if you don't have to worry about what future generations will think of you? Money, posessions, rivalries, grudges...I cried myself silly after the first reading. The depth of the characters is sufficiently developed by the end that you feel their deaths strongly.I took an underlying message of hope out of this book. I knew from the outset of the first reading that there was no means of survival for the characters. The characters knew there was no means of survival. But I kept hoping, and they kept making every effort to find hope and a chance for the future. We are stronger than we ever let ourselves imagine as a human race, we just need to ensure that we don't turn against ourselves as happened in On The Beach."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"...well, insofar as a book about the end of life on earth can be enjoyable. Until I got the book, I'd only ever seen the film, during the making of which Ava Gardner was said to have said that Melbourne was the perfect place for making a film about the end of the world, a remark which the inhabitants of great rival Sydney thoroughly enjoyed. (It's now believed that it originated from a reporter for the \\"Sydney Morning Herald\\").To me, Shute's laid-back, almost flat, style seems to add to the tension of the whole thing as Doomsday slowly but inevitably approaches. The thing that surprises and perplexes me is that things are all, well, so stiff upper lip and stoic. Would there not be riots in the streets? Widespread looting? Complete breakdown of all law and order? Would anyone really worry about things such as starting the fishing season early, so that people get a chance to catch a last one? Don't panic, chaps, or in Oz, No worries mate, she'll be right. I know the Aussies are pretty laid back (I'm a a naturalised one), but they're basically like everyone else. However, if you can suspend disbelief and accept that humans can behave with such dignity in the face of impending catastrophe, you may enjoy this. I did, largely because I enjoyed reading about the Melbourne I know so well.I also enjoyed the nice touches of inability to confront the unthinkable, bordering on madness - the naval wife who plans garden improvements that she will never see, the submarine captain who stays faithful to his wife and family and buys presents to take back to them, even though they are in the dead Northern Hemisphere. It raises interesting questions in one's own mind - how would I react to such a situation? When the crunch comes, few of us are heroes, even though we'd like to be. A scenario such as Shute paints is extremely unlikely but we are doing it to ourselves slowly with pollution.

Eliot's \\"The Hollow Men\\" on the title page with the famous lines \\"This is the way the world ends / Not with a bang but a whimper,\\" and indeed the novel is not about surviving the war but awaiting the end of the world. Given what we now know about nuclear winter, Shute's pessimism is actually somewhat understated, but that does not make it any the less disturbing.\\"On the Beach\\" is set in Australia, two years after the war of which all anybody knows is that it put so much radioactive fallout into the atmosphere that there are eight months left before it reaches Down Under, where humanity is making its last stand. Unlike books like \\"Alas, Babylon\\" by Pat Frank in 1959, which deal primarily with how people try to keep on living civilized lives in the wake of an all-out nuclear exchange, \\"On the Beach\\" is about facing the inevitable end. Jonestown was still a couple of decades away and the story of the mass suicides at Massada was a minor historical footnote, so when the book was published there was nothing to color the horror of a continent of human beings choosing to end their lives with pills rather than succumb to the slow death by radiation poisoning (for that matter, there was not an active cultural debate on euthanasia either). There might not be anything more unrealistic in the novel than the idea that the scientific inevitable of the coming radiation is universally accepted. Yet that is a major factor in creating the depressing nature of the novel.The focus of the novel is on a group of characters. Scientist John Osborne provides the necessary scientific details while tuning his racing car for the world's last Grand Prix. Peter and Mary Holmes are spending their final days taking care of their baby daughter and planning a garden they will never live to see. Their friend Moira Davidson chooses to sedate herself by constantly drinking, until she meets Dwight Towers, captain of the U.S.S. Scorpion, which makes him the highest ranking officer in what is left of the U.S. Navy. The two are able to provide some comfort for each other, but Towers still heeds the call to duty. When a mysterious message is received, being transmitted from Seattle where it is assumed every one is dead, Towers takes his submarine back to see if there is still reason to hope as time runs out.Part of the problem with this novel is that most readers come to it after seeing the powerful 1959 film made by director Stanley Kramer, with its haunting use of the song \\"Waltzin' Matilda\\" and its insistent warning that \\"It's Not Too Late, Brother!\\" Shute's characters are much less compelling on the page and the screenwriters were remarkably faithful to many of the key elements of the novel so you do not really get the sense of reading it to get more of the story. There are those who complain that what little Shute has to saw about the war and its weapons of mass destruction does not make sense, but as was the case with the television movie \\"The Day After\\" such concerns are negligible because both narratives need the war to allow them to tell their stories. Paying attention to the details definitely misses the larger picture here.Ultimately, \\"On the Beach\\" is more important historically than it is critically. This is not great literature, but it inspired many of the post-nuclear war novels that followed, such as Peter Bryant's \\"Two Hours to Doom\\" (which later became \\"Dr. Strangelove\\"), Helen Clarkson's \\"The Last Day,\\" and John Brunner's \\"The Brink.\\" If you have to choose between the two, watch the movie rather than read the book. But if you are a student of this genre, then you have to read this book simply because of its impact in this field. It is for that reason that I round up on this one."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"This book sometimes is very interesting, but we think that we can't give the rating 10, because, we in our class didn't read the original version, we only had the school edition available.

It's about us, now, as we seek to find a meaning in life while trying to live it.

Be careful with this author's power over your emotional responses, for he looks into individual souls of his characters (who include his readers) and gives them a post-hypnotic suggestion that what he said is true.

You will never be the same"},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"Nevil Shute gives us the unique opportunity to be a fly on the wall of a community that has the distinction of being the last community left on earth. How or why that community comes to this distinction is nowhere near as important as how it deals with that distinction. On the Beach is a tour de force of emotions and feelings felt by realistic characters as the last six months of human life on earth is played out in a large Australian city; that because of its southern location has managed to survive a worldwide nuclear holocaust. Now it must face what the rest of the world has already experienced. The inescapable radiation that is drifting down from the already dead northern hemisphere. The story, although science fiction, is of the individuals that must come to grips with who they were, who they are now, and what they will do, now that the end is almost inevitable.Mr. Shute is very good at weaving a story even though it was more plausable when it was written over thirty years ago. But his real genius lies in the timeless account of the many individuals we are introduced to, and are slowly dying with. There is no real pain, only that which we each create as we live and eventually face death. This community is a mirror we see ourselves in, and the view may be eye opening indeed, for we are not out from under the nuclear dragon yet. A timeless tale."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"This tidbit of cold-war horror will give you a chill that will not go away. There may not be another book that brought the realities of nuclear annihilation home like this one. The added horror it brings is in an awareness of what \\"collateral damage\\" now means to the world. We would not be ending ourselves but taking everybody with us. The idea of limited nuclear war is ludicrous for readers of this monumental book that defined a generation."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"The premise and tone of the book are unassailable. The possibility and plausibility of a humanity-ending nuclear war, especially in the late 1950s (but still lingering today, I hope none of us forget), is a theme that should and will never grow old, and the stoic \\"not with a bang, but with a whimper\\" approach of this book is extremely powerful. Unfortunately, the author's one-dimensional view of humanity turns what could have been (and I am not exaggerating) the greatest book of the twentieth century into a painful, head-shaking experience.In order for the stoic attitudes of the characters to feel true, we must be given something to contrast it with. It's inconceivable that everyone would react in almost exactly the same way. There are only a handful minor breaks in the ubiquitous stiff upper lip; twice from stereotypically hysterical 1950s women who break down only to 'come to their senses' a page or two later, and a few people who take suicidal risks like gentlemen (this isn't so much a rejection of stoicism as different variant, though.) These exceptions are welcome, but what's really missing from the story isn't the despair; it's the optimism. The story takes place in Melbourne (which is at the southern edge of Australia) with the radiation clouds slowly coming from the north. Town after town falls deathly silent as the cloud overtakes them, but the author actually mentions at one point that very few people bother fleeing to the south (and I don't believe we meet any of them. Maybe some were in the race, I forget), even though they have enough time to make it on horse or foot, even though it becomes clear towards the end of the book that people have been hoarding enough gasoline to make such a last-ditch effort feasible. It might have been a challenge to portray this panicked flight for survival while maintaining the stoic tone, but without it the reader is left struggling with a vast emotional gulf between plausible reality and fatalistic caricature. It doesn't matter if you, personally, would choose the stoic route and die in your home instead of fleeing for another month or two of life; a sizable fraction of the population undoubtedly would. Another sizable fraction of the population would've killed themselves far earlier. But to pretend that the instinct for survival is so universally anemic is just... bad storytelling. I don't even mind that all of the main characters were stoics, but when the entire continent calmly accepts their fate instead of walking south it breaks all suspension of disbelief.The problem gets worse when the reader begins to analyze the situation from a scientific perspective. They had over a year to prepare and no one, NO ONE IN THE ENTIRE FRIGGIN' COUNTRY attempted to construct any sort of shelter to survive the fallout. The author shoots himself in the foot by reminding us, again and again, that the earth will be uninhabitable for only 20 years (this is a roughly accurate estimate of the aftereffects of well-aerosolized \\"salted\\" cobalt bombs.) I'm not arguing that the tone of the book should've been changed; far from it. The author could have invented a fictional deadly isotope with a halflife of hundreds or thousands of years. He could have claimed the bombs' aerosolization techniques were too advanced for the best air filters in the world to cope with. He could have mentioned oxygen generating plants being destroyed, or a famine preventing the stockpiling of nonperishable foods. He could have mentioned a effort to construct a shelter that later fails for some unforeseen reason. But he did not. The best he offers is a single scientist, never encountered by the main characters personally, who believes that heavy rain patterns might cause the fallout to settle earlier than expected. This is the culmination of an entire year of brainstorming! In the history of humanity, what culture would have the fatalism to come up with nothing better than \\"we shouldn't bother to actually try anything, but it might go away on its own\\"?Maybe my suspension of disbelief is what's anemic. I might have managed it, but for the author deciding to prominently feature a nuclear submarine throughout the plot. Apparently, the submarine offers near total immunity to the radiation while it is submerged, and it has the ability to safely check surface radiation levels via its periscope. It also has the capability to generate its own oxygen from seawater, through electrolysis. And again, they have something like a year to modify it, collect extra nuclear fuel for it, create undersea caches of food and fuel and oxygen and supplies safe from the radiation... but does anyone try? Does anyone ever mention that it might be worthwhile trying to save a few members of the human race from a death cloud they know for certain will only remain deadly for 20 years? The final depressing scene in this depressing story was beautifully done, I won't spoil it, except to say that for me it was spoiled by the unavoidable knowledge that one of the main characters is sitting in the instrument of his own salvation, if only a single person from the entire continent would point it out...My other complaint is that, while his tone and scene construction are perfect, the author does not always have the most beautiful prose. And when much of the book is spent describing everyday life, this can turn into a serious problem. As others have noted, he uses the word \\"presently\\" gratuitously, and in a few scenes he utterly fails to instill a sense of wonder or immersion. At one point we're meant to watch people go on one last fishing trip... I had to skip over this part almost entirely. Hemingway he is not, and when 'somewhat prosaic prose' meets 'infuriatingly fatalistic characters' the result is just unbearable.Why three stars then? Because it's extremely important as a historical work, because the science is fairly solid (except for the omissions), because we don't have enough post-apocalyptic stories that fully realize the terrifying truth that humanity could easily not make it through the \\"post-\\", because the tone was hauntingly perfect and *almost* (if we imagine our own optimism-killing sideplots) realistic, and because the allegory that *we are all doomed to death* so we might as well live our lives the best we can is surprisingly and powerfully sobering.But in crafting us this magnificent \\"whimper\\", he sacrificed far too much of basic human nature. In the end, I could not suspend disbelief enough to ignore fatalistic stupidity run rampant over an entire continent. Perhaps you can."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"Normally book reports are the last I want to do, but I picked this book up and could hardly put it down.

One proviso: I have far less faith in human nature than Shute does. Is it likely that people, knowing that their death is inevitable and near, will behave with the good sense and civility Shute depicts? I can't help but think that many would give way to complete excess, degeneracy and violence. It's ironic that Shute thinks man is capable of launching a nuclear holocaust, but will then behave with the utmost decorum when rules no longer apply and when all bets are off."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"I mostly picked up this book because I thought it was science-fiction. I had heard of the movie, but it was a little before my time and besides, I heard it wasn't that good anyway. So, I picked up this book, opened it to read and found myself captured by something more realistic than anything than science-fiction could ever create.I, for one, am far too young to remember the days of the Cold War, when the threat of nuclear disaster hung over our parents' heads like a grim spectre. But upon reading this book, I found a sick feeling beginning to form in my gut, an old fear, perhaps a memory of those gone before. I got the sense that this still could happen, and I read faster, with growing intensity.On the Beach grabs you and never lets go, even beyond the end. The characters, all detailed, could be someone living next door to you, and the way they go through their motions, even as they know the rain is heading nearer and nearer is frightening and all too human. The tone of the novel, the narration, is calm, resigned, as if the narrator has come to grips with his fate, even if the characters haven't yet.There is no hope in this book. As a science-fiction reader, I am accostumed to last second saves and plot twists from nowhere, but even as I got closer and closer to the end I realized with foul certainity that there was no surviving. But the people, they don't struggle, they merely make plans for things that will never be done, not looking for a way out, because there is none.Nevil Shute is not a literary writer like Pynchon or Joyce or Gaddis, and his prose is not lyrical, but it is always calm, uncluttered, the exact meaning never failing to reach you. This was easily the most powerful novel I have ever read and when I closed it, I shut it with a shudder, emerging finally from the dark world of a nuclear winter.Still as true today as forty years ago, everyone should read this book and perhaps learn something from it.

Science Fiction because of its backdrop (nuclear war), it should be placed in a category with literature that defines what it is to be human. The story, as I saw it, was not about humanity facing extinction (atomic or otherwise), but about how each character faced personal extinction with others in the same situation. Duty, hope, fear, anger, mortality, acceptance, all present; all dealt with. Death could have come to the characters in any fashion, from AIDS to old age and the feelings would be the same. What is amazing to me is that Nevil Schute managed to craft a book to deal with these feelings/reactions in such a short amount of actual print. My suggestion is not to read this book as science fiction.

I liked it though"},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"In an interesting choice, Shute portrays an end of the world nuclear war novel with no violence at all. Rather we see the aftermath of a civilized country intact and waiting for inevitable radiation death. This makes it all the more chilling.We see a variety of viewpoints through the characters, some who accept their fate yet continue going on their day to day duties as if the world would go on, mostly to fill their days with something to do and maintain their sanity. Some who hold out hope that the radiation will not reach them or they will not get sick. Some who are in outright denial, and some who are partying their life away.The centerpoint characters are a young Australian couple, and an American submarine commander and a Australian \\"party girl\\" who is quite affected by the demeanor of the commander. Their unconsummated romance is truly heartbreaking as the commander remains faithful to his wife though she is of course dead.The Australian couple are also touching as the wife is more or less in denial and the husband accepting of the reality, though playing along to support her emotional needs.In no way an exciting book, but compelling and affecting. The T.S. Eliot at the beginning is the perfect summation of the ending."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"The question of what one would do if the world were coming to an end is the premise of Nevil Shute's 1957 novel \\"On the Beach.\\" Despite being half a century old, the novel is powerful and timeless in its portrayal of the narrow tightrope we have walked ever since the first nuclear explosion lit up the skies over New Mexico on that morning in July 1945.Two years have passed since an all-out nuclear war destroyed Earth's northern hemisphere, and people remain alive only in the southern hemisphere, particularly in Australia, where the story takes place. But not for long, as global weather patterns are slowly but steadily blowing the lethal fallout southwards and radiation counts are inching higher. As the unavoidable doom grows closer, people react in various ways. One family, the wife in deep denial, goes about planting next year's flowerbeds and charting their infant daughter's future. A young woman finds solace in endless bottles of alcohol. A respected scientist realizes his dream of becoming a racecar driver. An American naval officer whose family was killed during the war takes refuge in military discipline and protocol. And the government quietly manufactures instant-death suicide pills for when the coming radiation sickness becomes too painful to further withstand.When the novel was originally published, the hydrogen bomb was a recent invention and we were told how recovery from an atomic war merely involved putting brick back on top of brick. When I first read it in the early 1980s, the Americans and the Soviets routinely threatened each other with obliteration and films like \\"The Day After\\" and \\"Threads\\" seared our collective consciousness with images of what life could be like after a nuclear war. Today, nations are invaded for allegedly preparing to build nuclear weapons by other nations who then turn around and plan a new generation of nuclear weapons for their own use.But in Shute's vision, there is no rebuilding, no \\"after.\\" There is only the impending human extinction. Plausible? Possibly. Bleak? Certainly. But the book takes such an inexorable approach to its subject that the inevitable moment of The End leaves one shattered and drained.\\"On the Beach\\" is a powerful read, one that should be required for anyone who believes that a nuclear war can be fought and won, that any nation's security depends on the ability to not just defeat but utterly annihilate a real or potential adversary, that our freedom somehow depends on our remaining underneath a sword of Damocles composed of ever more numerous and terrifying weapons."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"If you would like to read a petrifying and breath-taking novel about the world coming to an end after a nuclear war, then read On The Beach by Nevil Shute. In this novel, Nevil Shute clearly expressed how the lives of many people would be, as they knew their time on earth would be short and their plans and dreams would never be carried out. Still they prayed and hoped of a miracle that would never come.On The Beach has no particular level of suspense, no real thrills, and only one foreseeable way to close. The book tells a simple story about a nuclear war that has devastated the Northern Hemisphere. The characters in the story capture our attention on the reality of death. As the toxic rain moves closer and closer to the characters the world slowly comes toward an inevitable end.Shute did an excellent job on this book even though the beginning was kind of slow. The further into the book you get, the deeper and more involved you will be. This book is very emotional and it really makes you think about the things you do in your everyday life and whether or not you are living life to the fullest."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"On The Beach, as others have said, suffers a bit as a product of its era, not so much for the cold war stuff (which I still find chilling) but for the stilted and polite portrayal of its characters, as starched and straightforward as 50's Hollywood. It also seemed not quite believable that an entire community of people would face demise with the same orderly sense of denial and detachment; I am positive that there would be more chaos than dignity under such circumstances. None of this detracts from the building hopelessness toward the inevitable conclusion, which does benefit from the straightforward writing style. It arrives all too soon just as it would, and I found that part of the book at least to be terribly real and sad, and it stayed in my mind long after I finished.

Written in the late 50's, but taking place at any time since then (Moira's Ford LTD was still around in the 80's), Shute's vision of the outcome of a nuclear holocaust, and the war from whence it happened, are frightenly possible. I recommend that everyone read this book. I suggest that it be put into school curricula. This neo-classic is as important a story of modern times as Shakespeare is of yore.

The plot, that the world is going to end and there is nothing and nobody that can stop it, is deeply and profoundly disturbing. One almost wants to stop it, to hope that somehow, in the next paragraph or chapter that some escape route is going to be revealed. The slow and steady progress of the unstoppable radioactive cloud provides a backdrop of very real terror against the apparant normality of everyday existence. What makes this book all the more disturbing is the lack of blind panic, the lack of people losing their heads and the gradual acceptance of what is going to happen. I have read other books on this topic but none that has ever touched me in the way that this one did. It is a book I certainly will never forget."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"I was looking for another book by Nevil Shute when I came across &quot;On the Beach&quot; and I'm glad I did.

This book takes place in southern australia, one of the last places to get the radiation. It's not so much about the end of the world, but how you deal with the knowledge that you are going to die, and you know roughly when and how.

Those who have read ON THE BEACH often complain of the deadening weight of a style that is long on sensory description but short on memorable character interaction. Yet, that is precisely the point that author Nevil Shute wants to make of his apocalyptic view of worldwide nuclear death. By the time the book begins, the plot mechanism has already been set. A nuclear war has broken out, with most of the world's major centers of population put to the torch. The reader does not see this; in fact he hears about it only second hand. The stark impression that Shute draws comes mostly from dialogue with surviving Australians, who have as yet been untouched by the clouds of killing radiation that have swept the rest of the world. Unlike other post-war dramas, this one shows the aftermath, survivors who decide when and how to react in their respective ways. The primary focus is on American submarine commander Dwight Towers, who has successfully landed his sub in an Australian port. He strikes up a relation with a local woman, Moira Davidson, and they are well aware that the nuclear clock is ticking on their lives. The immunity that Australia has had is but temporary. The radiation that has spread worldwide is now slowly infiltrating their air. The dramatic center of the book is not so much human-based, but idea-based. Dwight and Moira, and other couples in the book, carry on as best they can, but the only real choice left to all of them is when to end their lives via suicide pills before the poison cloud does that for them. It is noteworthy what they do before they take the death pills. Most simply do what they have always done, the normal mundane things that marked so much of their pre-war lives. A few do dangerous things like driving in races that produce fatalities for most of the drivers. The unspoken point that Shute makes and many readers miss is the connection between what he says and how he says it. The end of the world and all life is truly a desensitizing concept. Shute's style of excessive detail and lack of human interaction suggest the feelings of the major characters. Dwight, Moira. and the others are both physically and psychologically disconnected from one another. By the end of the novel, they are dead or dying. The gap between a still surviving Dwight and Moira is emphasized by his decision to spend his last day on earth sinking his sub with all hands aboard rather than spend that last day together. ON THE BEACH is truly a depressing novel that shows the physical interactions between the dead and dying as less important than their psychic distancing. Sometimes, the expression of fear and gloom are better understood by focusing on how the characters feel rather than on what they do. No one ever said that a writing style must be perky."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"I am an avid fan of end of the world ANYTHING (ranging from the religious to the ridiculous), and this is one EVERYONE's top apocalyptic lists, but I just didn't feel riveted like many others. THis book was small, but it still felt slow in its story. And depressing? You better believe it! But the point of the story is its realism; nuclear holocaust is supposed to depress the hell out of you! I could've passed on the trashy alchoholic character, but for its time frame (Australia in the post apocalyptic 1950's) and its size (less than 200 pages in my paperback), it is worth an afternoon to read."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"On the Beach was written to give the effect of the world ending.

It was very easy to follow, and the character's were just your everyday people, which helps bring the reality of the story closer to home. The story is about people living in Australia, basically waiting to die. A nuclear war had taken place in the Northern Hemisphere, and now they were waiting for the nuclear cloud from the war that was headed there way, everyone else in the world was gone. They are going to die from the radiation that is carried in the cloud, but because of the air movement, they still have a few months to live. It basically describes these peoples lives and what they do with the little time they have left. On The Beach can be slow, but it is a good book that describes the what could come of a nuclear war."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"While looking for new books on this website, I came upon the reviews of &quot;On the Beach,&quot; which I first read 25 years ago. It amazed me to find several negative reviews as I found it one of the most compelling and memorable novels I've ever read. In the late 70s, I casually picked up the book while visiting my aunt. With no review or introduction in mind, I started reading. The book begins in such a normal fashion with no hint of the coming apocalypse. When I realized what was happening, I was stunned -- almost sick to my stomach. I'm still amazed that Neville Shute also wrote &quot;A Town Like Alice,&quot; which is equally compelling, yet totally different."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"i had read this book around 4-5 yrs. back.and recently got a chance to read it again..its absolutely fantastic the way author had gone deep in the psyches of different people dealing with the coming catastrophe.....it actually makes one realise the horrifying results of a nuclear war if it takes place. i think that all the world leaders should be reading this book ...esp. the leaders of the nuclear countries...i suggest anyone who is in for a good reading should necessarily be reading this book. place."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"The writing was somewhat dull, the bias against women was annoying (two women characters: one was a drunken slut, the other comparable to Rose of Sharon of the Grapes of Wrath, without coming into her own). So why did I enjoy this book? It's just one of those things. Such a classic portrayal of human nature stripped to the core is easily forgivable for any petty flaws. On The Beach was essential for its time. We all cringe to think about what the world would be like if we all knew when we would die, and how. Nevil Shute makes this a reality, bringing to life the unsettling details we've all thought about time and again. Maybe the writing is a little mundane, maybe the ideas are old-fashioned. Look past it. On the Beach is a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"I like this book Xena rule"},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"This book was a amazing read. This was book recommended to me by a PoliSci professor at the University of Alabama and I am so glad I read it. On The Beach presents a very gloomy and sad side to nuclear war. I felt so sorry for everyone in the world that had to survive the war and know that they were going to die either by radiation poisoning or by taking another way out. I think this book serves a good purpose and shows a great fictional lesson learned, about what happens when a war of that magnitude breaks out and the suffering that goes along with it. It never seemed like it occured to anyone that they were going to die until the moment came and everyone they loved dies around them. If only the world leaders with nuclear power could read this and see that nuclear war isn't the answer and should be avoided at all costs."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"After a nuclear war, The world is dying. People are waiting near the beach in australia, for their own inevitable death. Such a story can be viewed in two aspects. One is the global aspect. Demonstrating the horrors of a nuclear war and its consequences. In that sense the story is quite effective and thought provoking, depicting the death of our planet in a realistic understated manner. The other is the personal aspect. How do the people deal with their own inevitable death? In this sense the story is really weak. The people react to their death in a mostly one-dimentional way, on the range of denial/indifference/acceptance. The author sketches the way people react to the situation right in the begining of the book, and doesn't tell us anything new in this aspect throughout the book. And this is the biggest problem of the book. Another problem I had was with the subplots. Some of them were quite boring. However, overall, this is a good book, and worth reading."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"I think most people here have already summed up this book, and there is little I can add to what they've said. I'll try anyway.On the Beach tells the story of the aftermath of an all-out nuclear war. The setting is Australia, one of the few places in the world to escape not only the bombs, put the deadly clouds of radioactive fallout from the war. But they'll only survive for a little while, because the global wind currents are slowly pushing the deadly fallout down to Antarctica. The Aussies only have a short time before they all come down with radiation sickness and die. The whole book is an emotional rollercoaster as the dreaded day of death looms ever closer, with absolutely nothing to prevent doom. Most people are resigned to their fate, and try and stay busy with various daily rituals in an effort to keep their sanity.The two main characters of the book are Dwight Towers, a U.S. submarine commander who has survived the war and is in refuge in Australia, and Moira Davidson, a young Australian girl who is bitter about her fate and seeks consolation with Dwight. Other characters are introduced, such as a young couple with a baby and a scientist who likes racing cars. The reader is quickly drawn into these people's lives, and really comes to care about what happens to them. Needless to say, the ending isn't warm and cheery. I had to stop reading the book several times and take a little break to get rid of the huge lump in my throat. It is a VERY tough read at the end. If you don't get emotional, you just might be dead.There are several small points to make about the book. The author, Nevil Shute, isn't exactly the best writer in terms of grammar. There are awkward sentences and errors, and it sometimes detracts from the story. He also wrote this book in the late 1950's, and he's English, so there are words that don't make much sense today. Despite these flaws, the story is still gut wrenching and compelling. I really appreciated Shute's sense of irony. Moira first meets Dwight because she is enlisted to keep his mind off of his dead family in America. However, Moira ends up being the one who starts to break down. More irony appears when people make plans that they know they won't be alive to keep. The scene when Peter and Mary are planning their garden is is a good example of this irony, and you'll groan in anguish over it. Overall, I haven't been this upset over something since I watched the film &quot;Cutting Moments&quot;.I'm surprised more people haven't heard of this book. I gave it to my Mom to read first, and she bawled like a baby at the end. You may not bawl, but you'll certainly be affected."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"&quot;On the Beach&quot; is one of those books that you read for the concept and the story, but not for the quality of the writing. The plot centers around the lives of a few remaining survivors of a nuclear war who live in Australia. Since the was has taken place in the northern hemisphere, Australia has largely escaped unscathed--for the moment. But as prevailing winds approach Australia, they carry lethal doses of radiation with them. The implication of this is that all of the characters in the book--in fact everyone in the world--will inevitably be extinguished.&quot;On the Beach&quot; has a profound psychological impact because it is devoid of the intense action that usually accompanies nuclear apocolypse films. The destruction has already occurred elsewhere and the citizens of Australia are largely going about their business knowing they will soon die. The fact that their infrastructure has not been destroyed and that all of their social aparatus is still intact makes their fate all the more sad and earie.Although this book is set in the Cold War it's outcome is still relevant and feasible today. The nuclear warheads generated by the arms race haven't gone away. The former Soviet Union is a desparate, chaotic place, and as several reviewers pointed out, more small countries are joining the nuclear club. One could say that Nuclear madness has merely transformed itself, but its danger certainly hasn't disappeared.I think everyone should read this book to be reminded of the possible future we all face."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"After a nuclear war, radiation slowly drifts southwards, gradually killing off humanity there as it has already been killed off in the Northern Hemisphere. The end is less than a year away, yet Australians, and a few American naval refugees seek to maintain their daily lives in the face of doom, and even send an exploratory submarine northwards.The fascination of the book is watching how people react to the inevitable doom. Many just go on plegmatically, a few pretend it will never happen. Most interesting is Moira Dawson, an Australian girl who had dreamed of visiting London and Paris, and now never will, and who seeks to live what little life is left to the fullest. She learns a lesson from a stillborn romance with Dwight Towers, the submarine commander who acts as if his wife and children are alive in Connecticut.Perhaps the limitation of this book is that most of the characters simply accept their doom, presumably having come to terms with it before the start of the book. But more of a range of viewpoints might be welcome. Could you imagine the anger and frustration of teenagers under these circumstances, in the throes of adolescence without the promise of adulthood, knowing they will never have their independence.As in most of Shute's later works, there are no villians. That is welcome when so many books have paper villains for us to vicariously hate."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"As radiation from a nuclear war that destroyed all life in the northern half of the earth gradually spreads southward to deliver its poison to all who live there, a number of Australians and a handful of Americans who reside among them attempt to continue some facet of normal life, even when the time for all things is nearly done. We learn going into this foreboding novel that at most one year remains to even the most fortunate of those yet alive. We read along as the last of humankind pathetically (or is it with dignity?) plant gardens, play with their children, reform from their alcoholism, fall in love, race cars...the list could go on and on. What must it be like to dwell under these horrible circumstances? What must it do, for instance, to the mind of a devout theist when she sees the deity to whom she has maintained lifelong faith is not going to arrive deus ex machina to save her and make everything right again? What must utter and complete moral hopelessness be like? How horrible must it be to be young and rise each morning knowing the despair that would come with so many hopes lying before you, now impossible to ever fulfill? And what must it be like to be a parent and understand that the children you bought into a terrible world reeling in extremis, will die in a matter of weeks?On The Beach is not about exploding cities and geo-political confrontations. The war and the nations who fought it are distant, quiet memories, barely of significance. On The Beach is about people, and how those people carry on in the face of a doom they neither created nor can elude. It is one of the darkest works of fiction ever produced, and also one of the finest. If it impacts a jaded modern reader so startlingly, what must it have been like to read this fifty years ago when the very concept of global extinction after nuclear conflict, was new?A universal, eternal classic of the Cold War era."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"This novel gives a very possible, and frighteningly probable, view of the way things could easily end up, as small and unstable countries enter the growing club of nuclear armament. The most eery (yet unfortunately difficult to swallow) aspect of the book is the refusal by many of the supposedly intelligent characters to truly absorb the reality of the situation. Bit by bit, over the space of a couple of years, radiation is slowly drifting across the equator from the heavily bombed, destroyed, and radioactive northern continents, to invade and kill the southern half of the globe in turn. But people continue to plan for the future, and act as though that future will come.Unfortunately, the characters are so 2-dimensional, and act such trite and ordinary roles, that they failed to come alive for me. I never could quite believe in their reactions, either. That they could so fully split their consciousness of the approaching radiation from the actions of their daily life boggled my mind, and blew my suspension of disbelief.Sorry. Great concept, unconvincingly executed."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"\\"On the Beach\\" was one of the first novels to describe what the aftermath of a nuclear war would be like, although the genre of post-apocalyptic novels goes back at least to Robert Cromie's \\"The Crack of Doom\\" in 1895. Edgar Rice Burroughs's Martians used radium bullets in 1912's \\"A Princess of Mars\\" and Upton Sinclair's 1924 novel \\"The Millennium: A Comedy of the Year 2000\\" involved atomic weapons. J.B. Priestly's \\"The Doomsday Men\\" in 1938 used radioactive material to disrupt the earth's crust. There was a nuclear war in the background of George Orwell's \\"1984,\\" and the same can be said for the Ray Bradbury collection of short stories, \\"The Martian Chronicles.\\"Nevil Shute's \\"On the Beach\\" was published in 1957, which was the same year that the Soviets launched Sputnik and Nikita Khrushchev boasted of a super bomb that could melt the polar icecaps. That might explain why this became the most prominent nuclear war novel of the decade, if not for that entire generation. Shute quotes T.S. Eliot's \\"The Hollow Men\\" on the title page with the famous lines \\"This is the way the world ends / Not with a bang but a whimper,\\" and indeed the novel is not about surviving the war but awaiting the end of the world. Given what we now know about nuclear winter, Shute's pessimism is actually somewhat understated, but that does not make it any the less disturbing.\\"On the Beach\\" is set in Australia, two years after the war of which all anybody knows is that it put so much radioactive fallout into the atmosphere that there are eight months left before it reaches Down Under, where humanity is making its last stand. Unlike books like \\"Alas, Babylon\\" by Pat Frank in 1959, which deal primarily with how people try to keep on living civilized lives in the wake of an all-out nuclear exchange, \\"On the Beach\\" is about facing the inevitable end. Jonestown was still a couple of decades away and the story of the mass suicides at Massada was a minor historical footnote, so when the book was published there was nothing to color the horror of a continent of human beings choosing to end their lives with pills rather than succumb to the slow death by radiation poisoning (for that matter, there was not an active cultural debate on euthanasia either). There might not be anything more unrealistic in the novel than the idea that the scientific inevitable of the coming radiation is universally accepted. Yet that is a major factor in creating the depressing nature of the novel.The focus of the novel is on a group of characters. Scientist John Osborne provides the necessary scientific details while tuning his racing car for the world's last Grand Prix. Peter and Mary Holmes are spending their final days taking care of their baby daughter and planning a garden they will never live to see. Their friend Moira Davidson chooses to sedate herself by constantly drinking, until she meets Dwight Towers, captain of the U.S.S. Scorpion, which makes him the highest ranking officer in what is left of the U.S. Navy. The two are able to provide some comfort for each other, but Towers still heeds the call to duty. When a mysterious message is received, being transmitted from Seattle where it is assumed every one is dead, Towers takes his submarine back to see if there is still reason to hope as time runs out.Part of the problem with this novel is that most readers come to it after seeing the powerful 1959 film made by director Stanley Kramer, with its haunting use of the song \\"Waltzin' Matilda\\" and its insistent warning that \\"It's Not Too Late, Brother!\\" Shute's characters are much less compelling on the page and the screenwriters were remarkably faithful to many of the key elements of the novel so you do not really get the sense of reading it to get more of the story. There are those who complain that what little Shute has to saw about the war and its weapons of mass destruction does not make sense, but as was the case with the television movie \\"The Day After\\" such concerns are negligible because both narratives need the war to allow them to tell their stories. Paying attention to the details definitely misses the larger picture here.Ultimately, \\"On the Beach\\" is more important historically than it is critically. This is not great literature, but it inspired many of the post-nuclear war novels that followed, such as Peter Bryant's \\"Two Hours to Doom\\" (which later became \\"Dr. Strangelove\\"), Helen Clarkson's \\"The Last Day,\\" and John Brunner's \\"The Brink.\\" If you have to choose between the two, watch the movie rather than read the book. But if you are a student of this genre, then you have to read this book simply because of its impact in this field. It is for that reason that I round up on this one."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"&quot;On the Beach&quot; was published in 1957 at the height of the Cold War. Set in the near future (the early 1960's), people in Australia are waiting with dignity for radioactive fallout to kill them. A nuclear war in the northern hemisphere has already destroyed everything there. In a few months the same will happen here.I read &quot;On the Beach&quot; in 1989. That same year I had seen &quot;The Day After&quot; and &quot;Testament&quot;. For some reason I had a morbid fascination with the end of the world, and what might happen after.&quot;On the Beach&quot; might seem a bit dated now. The consequences of nuclear war have been speculated upon for several years. In 1983 scientists came up with the nuclear winter theory, where all the dust and fallout from the explosions would block out the sun and cause the world to freeze over. It sounds plausible enough. Once the winter was over the ozone layer would be damaged and the planet saturated with ultaviolet light from the sun. Others argue that people would survive somewhere, not everyone would die from radiation.Whatever the case, &quot;On the Beach&quot; is still a powerful book. It makes you wonder how you would feel, knowing how you were going to die and when. The Australians are fortunate in that they are offered suicide pills for when the pain becomes too much. People aren't so worried about nuclear war any more. But on the news this morning I saw Boris Yeltsin remind Bill Clinton that they still have a nuclear arsenal. This was after Clinton threatened Russia with sanctions if Russian forces attacked Grozny... But we've managed to avoid nuclear war up until now, so there's probably nothing to worry about. Is there?"},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"I generally post my book reviews within days of finishing them, while they are freshest in my mind. However, in a strange twist of fate, I read &#65533;On The Beach&#65533; during the second weekend in September of 2001, and I don&#65533;t need to remind anyone what happened on the following Tuesday. When I closed the book, I had chills up my spine, but at the same time I was relieved, complacently sure that the events described by Nevil Shute could never happen. After all, the Cold War ended years ago. Then, just days later, the world as I knew it was suddenly changed, and the impossible was possible once again. During those first few surreal days after September 11th, I found my thoughts returning to this book time and time again as I stared at the horrifying images on my TV screen and listened to the chilling speculation about what would happen next. But each time, I consciously pushed it out of my mind, because it was suddenly hitting a little too close to home.Even before the specter of nuclear war became a more tangible threat, this was a frightening book because it&#65533;s so realistic (despite the scientific inaccuracies &#65533; keep in mind, this was written half a century ago). Other reviewers have complained that there&#65533;s not enough action, but think about it &#65533; if you knew you were going to die in a few months and there was nothing you could to do to prevent it, what would you do? I think most of us would find ourselves spending our final days more in the manner of Shute&#65533;s characters than like anyone in a Bruce Willis film. We&#65533;d be the young married couple, tending our prized garden and cherishing our baby daughter. We&#65533;d be the lonely naval commander, dreaming of the wife and children we lost. We&#65533;d be the party girl, cramming in all the good times we could. In other words, we&#65533;d be doing what we knew for as long as we could, until we were forced to face the unknown. Maybe we&#65533;d try something we&#65533;d always dreamed about, like the Grand Prix, if the opportunity came along. Maybe, like Moira, we&#65533;d grow a little, and salvage something out of what remained of our life. But there wouldn&#65533;t be any Hollywood style heroics to save the universe. If you&#65533;re looking for a Die Hard type action adventure story, this is not the book for you. If you want a subtle, thought provoking psychological drama, it is."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"I had feared 'On the Beach' would be a overly macabre post-apocalytical (nuclear war) story since it was written back in the early years of the cold war when folks were scrambling to build their personalized bomb shelters. But in fact Nevil Shute writes a story that is compassionate and largely realistic. Despite being written fifty years ago 'On the Beach' feels very fresh and topical. And the author was clearly a fine writer. The prose and characterizations are uniformly excellent.Now back to the story, we have a small town in southern Australia waiting for the radiation from the nuclear fallout of WW III to arrive and ultimately kill everyone (..the rest of the world has been wiped out, with only the folks in the remote southern hemisphere still unaffected). We have several families trying to get on with normal life knowing their days are numbered. These people are experiencing the width and breadth of life: parents tending to young children, people still desperating wanting love, and those who have recently lost loved ones. Yes, the ending is what you might expect. Yet amongst all the tragedy the author had his characters behaving in a dignified fashion, which is my only quibble with the book. I would have expected more chaos and panic.Bottom line: a sobering yet slightly sugar-coated view of mankind dying off planet Earth. Strongly recommended."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"The beach, when one beholds it as such, is the end of the world.Nevil Shute's incredible novel is not about surviving a global nuclear holocaust. The reader will follow the lives of several people, some of whom are related, some who are friends, and some who have been brought to Australia by inevitability. One of these strangers, Dwight Towers, is an American commander for the U.S. Navy who oversees a vital submarine mission to the United States' western shores. And there the servicemen will observe, on the beach, the unsettling lack of human life.When not commissioned, Lieutenant Commander Peter Holmes lives with his brand new family, Mary and his young baby Jennifer. There they spend their days living in labored bliss, on the beach, and frequently visited by family friend Moira Davidson, a young blonde in her 20s whose hobby was once gin, but is now brandy. She consumes more liquor than even Alistair MacLean can wave an empty glass at. Though her disposition is one of genuineness, she begins enticing the submarine captain Dwight into falling in love with her. By the end of the tale, Moira becomes the most beautiful and haunted character and her faithfulness and loyalty brought me to tears more so than any other character.Shute's novel frightened me. We are, all of us, led to believe that much of Fate is in our own hands. Every day we make decisions that affect the rest of our lives, and this we do not need to be reminded of. What we forget, however, is how fragile and ephemeral our lives are, and at any given moment, our lives are not necessarily in the hands of God, but very possibly in the hands of other human beings. It is worthwhile to remember, lest we forget, that all humans err.It is only at the very end of the book that some of the characters, who have been living a life restrained, must finally accept the truth. Peter states, \\"[I]f a couple of hundred million people all decide that their national honour requires them to drop cobalt bombs upon their neighbour, well, there's not much that you or I can do about it\\" (229). The small matter of pride is what tears marriages and friendships apart. Unfortunately, it can also destroy the world.It is so subtle, it is easy to overlook, but Shute's motif with beaches pervades the story and ultimately becomes the one thing that never changes.I read the 1963 Signet edition.

If you oppose book burning, this book will make you change your mind.I ordered On the Beach for my Kindle after reading the good reviews. Ignore those reviews. If there is one review that you should heed, it is this one. Do not buy this book. Do not read this book. Don't even think about it.I've read many \\"end of the world\\" novels and this is the worst. It may actual be the worst book I've ever read, period. Just think about this for a moment - the world ends in a nuclear war, but the events of the book take place in Australia, which didn't get nuked. It is like reading a book about a football game, but from the perspective of someone sitting in their living room at home... except that person didn't even watching the game on TV. He heard that it was played, but is working on his garden and drinking brandy instead.That being said, I was expecting a book about how the characters prepare for the oncoming radiation in an attempt to survive. Nope... the first 20% of the book is basically about a guy taking a girl out for drinks. Don't believe it? I'm warning you. After getting 50% of the way through the book, the reader is treating with exciting plot details such as people planning their garden, finding old pogo sticks, mending torn socks and sewing buttons on shirts. Don't believe it? I'm warning you. It is the most boring plot in the history of literature. I'm just scratching the surface here... there are pages and pages of gibberish to delight the reader.You want excitement? Let's explore Chapter 5 (because it is short). Chapter 5 starts with a guy delivering a play pen. Not enough action for you? Shortly after that, the reader is treated to a tour of an art museum. Still need more action? Then a guy goes to a store to buy a fishing rod and inquires about a pogo stick and jewelry. Chomping at the bit after all this? Then the author describes two people going out to dinner and a movie. Uhhh... this is the end of the world, right? Uhhh... oh wait... I forgot that I'm a dolt of some sort who probably just doesn't appreciate the unique twist on the \\"genre\\" or some such nonsense.Oh... and do you know what creative and exciting things the people of Australia do to prepare for the oncoming cloud of radiation and certain death? They move up fishing season (about 75% of the way through the book). Then, they move up the date of the Australian Grand Prix so as to get the race in before the radiation hits. No... I'm not making this up. I couldn't make up such a dumb plot on my own - I had to actually read something this ridiculous.To make matters worse, the book seems like it was written by a middle school student. If you were foolish enough to buy this piece of garbage after reading this review, turn to chapter three and read through it counting the number of times the author uses the word \\"they\\". Also, as some other reviewers have noted, don't bother trying to figure out which person the author is talking about most of the time. It is nonsensical. Finally, the chapter breaks make no sense at all. Each chapter is just one series of events stacked on another. The chapter breaks appear to be merely dropped in at random to break up the monotony.If you are a masochist, you may choose to ignore my advice and read this revolting swill anyway. If that is the case, a small part of me thanks you - because you will realize in short order that this book review is the greatest, and most accurate, review ever written. It's the Nostradamus of book reviews - predicting your misery before it happens.If I had purchased a hard copy instead of the kindle version, I would have burned it immediately upon completion.

What exciting dreams would you want to live out before your last days? Who would you want to live them out with? How would you tell everyone you loved goodbye? These are only a few of the questions that are proposed by Nevil Shute&#65533;s On the Beach. On the Beach is a persons depiction of how a society would act if they knew that a radioactive death cloud was coming to consume their lives. It shows the struggles that a group of friends have in dealing with the death of their nearest loved ones along with their own.One of my criticisms is the characters in this book. The characters were remarkably calm and orderly. Shute describes his character in great detail. Shute uses all the methods of indirect characterization. When Peter and Mary are talking about garden plans for next summer despite the fact that they will die in a few months (speech); peter thinking to himself that he should pull the tree out of the ground for next years crops (thought); Peter actually pulling the tree out of the ground (action); Peter getting in his best suit to take the pill that will end his life (appearance); and the fact that everyone assumed that Peter would stay by his Navy ship&#65533;s side because it was the honorable thing to do (reputation) all characterize Peter as a calm and orderly guy. In fact, every character mentioned in this book is calm and orderly. It&#65533;s not how Shute characterized his characters that I dislike but, It&#65533;s what he characterizes them like. There were behind-the-scenes comments on drunkenness and fights in the streets, but this was reported rather than seen, and always in disapproving tones. Perhaps middle-class Australian people (and American Submarine Captains) really did behave like that, but from what I&#65533;ve read of people&#65533;s (especially sexual) during World War Two, I doubt it. Also, I found the lack of any attempt by society as a whole to survive rather strange. Knowing for over a year that the radioactive dust was on its way, there seems to have been no attempt to build a bunker or any other way of surviving.I began reading this book by grabbing it when I was off to my room to go to bed. I would sit there and read until I felt ready to sleep. This worked well because for the first 3/5ths of the book there was no action. I could be rest assured that if I wanted to go to sleep, five minutes of reading this book would do the trick. The problem laid in its plot. A normal plotline has the conflict at the beginning and then a rising action. Just when the rising action conflict is about to be resolved, other conflicts arise and lead to a climax. The climax is the heart of the plot you could say. The story is very downhill after this point and it is mostly a resolution. An extended &#65533;And they lived happily ever after&#65533; if you will. This type of plot line when charted out makes a pyramid shape on paper. Rises to climax and falls to resolution. Imagine for a moment looking at a plot line that is not a pyramid at all but a descending ramp. The highest point at the beginning and as you read on the ramp loses altitude and gets lower and lower with every turn of the page with nothing but a few bumps and divots hardly worth mentioning to slow your descent. Well, that is the plot line of this book. Within the first few pages it tells you that a nuclear war has happened and by the end of the book everyone would be dead. Then you slowly go down the declining plot line watching people scurry and fulfill life long dreams until the inevitable point where life ceases to exist. I find this kind of plot line very boring. You can tell it&#65533;s not a normal plot within the first few pages. This isn&#65533;t necessarily a bad thing but usually when an author makes a book about daring subjects such as death, there is a twist to the plot, you expect something good. To my surprise there were no twists, no surprises besides how physically hard it was to stay interested. All in all the plot was a major disappointment.Despite my criticisms, the novel does have some interesting points, like that of how he predicts what would happen in the aftermath of a nuclear war. Overall, On The Beach is not a bad novel, but it is not a good one as I have shown you with numerous evidence, I wouldn&#65533;t say that Shute is a good author either. The novel has an interesting idea, but its unbelievable character are disappointing. It&#65533;s an easy read, word choice is easy and story line is easy to understand. If you like action, twists, or books that keep you guessing up to the very end then this book probably isn&#65533;t for you. If you are interested in the effects of a nuclear war, or you like romance, then you might enjoy this book."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"The book came in 2 days. It was great not to have to wait."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"I thought that On the Beach was a semi-decent book. One major downfall was that it was dull and boring through a good bit of the main story. Instead of 320 pages, I believe it could have been done in about 200, to make the pace of it better. It ties in nicely with our studies in that it deals with life after a world wide nuclear war. I thought it comical that it depicted the Russians as the one of the \\"bad guys\\", and it didn't even mention America as being part of the war. The ending was a let down, as everyone just kind of died off with no real plot to it, except for maybe the Moira-Dwight ordeal. Basically, it was boring from beginning to end with the occasional interesting plot twist here and there. I do not agree with the quote that \\"Every American should read On the Beach...\\", as it was not that good. I give it a thumbs in the middle, no more."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"I guess I'm just not that much a fan of the classics. I read this book because my friend recommended it to me and raved about it's merits. So i took a break from the series I am reading to give \\"On the Beach\\" a try. What I found was what I saw as a lot of pointless nothing. Don't get me wrong, i understand the meaning of this story, the purpose it was written for, all the ironies, and why it is hailed as a classic. But the bottom line is...the book was darn boring and woefully predictable. Funny thing is, I was in a class at college and had the book out on my desk when the teacher saw it and said \\"Oh I love that book, have you read this part yet? blah blah blah...you'll love the ending...\\" She went on and on. So i figure the best was yet to come...little changed. Right up to the end i told myself, \\"I know a shocker is coming\\". The end was exactly how I predicted it to be, no surprise there at all. Not that this was meant to be a suspenseful book or anything, but since she spoke so highly of the ending i figured something odd or surprising would happen, much to my disappointment, it didn't.This book was also too depressing for me. Can't say I enjoyed that much. I know that is why it was written, and I commend the author for achieving that task of instilling a sense of depression in it's readers, but next time someone requests a book of this sort to me I will do my research. I'm a personal fan of happiness. I'm also a fan of entertainment, something this book didn't do for me.Like I say, I guess classics aren't for me. I will stick to science fiction and fantasy. This may not be true at all for you, but I know what I prefer, and it's not this book. Thank you for your time and always remember this piece of advice, \\"Dont listen to what people say in these reviews, find everything out for yourself!\\" funny I would say that at a time like this but there's no time like the present.

It's not even a very interesting theme.

John is the lifelong geek who finally gets a thrill. Moira falls for Dwight based on a few half-drunk interactions; this kind of quick connection is the kind of poorly-earned romance typically found in bad movies. Mary is the stereotypical housewife of the 50's whose denial of the reality of what faces her borders on stupidity (count how many times she asks if it's really going to happen to them). In fact, as a more enlightened 21st century reader, there's a lot of subtle sexism and chauvinism in the book that I found rather unpalatable. The men are pretty much all stoics and the women are the only ones showing much emotion. Dwight's by-the-book mentality, even right at the end, is a bit difficult to stomach. I also found his method of coping with grief to be a bit too much to buy -- maybe I would have if everyone else didn't have some measure of it as well.On the whole, I found most of the book difficult to accept as genuine. The author wanted denial to be an evocative and reoccurring theme of the book, but I never feel he earned it with what he wrote. Plus, he never really goes into any deeper issues of what coping with the end of humanity would be like. It's mostly kept on a mundane level. Plus, where's the diversity of reaction? Are we really to believe everyone reacts in mostly the same way? The book was emotionally empty.There was little of interest in the plot. I don't need action to keep me interested, but much of the plot seems extraneous in that it didn't really advance the story. A lot of the narration could have been excised without really losing anything.The author's writing was very unimaginative and rote. He overuses words far too much (count how many times you see the word \\"presently\\" and then count how many times it was unnecessary (hint: the numbers will match)). The characters often talk in very formal, stilted language. There was one bit of dialogue, no more than a page's width, that had the word \\"ought\\" three times. Most all of the descriptions are very plain and to the point and never access anything higher. He often introduces knowledge he wants the reader to know (such as why the war started, why there's still electricity, etc) in a forced and obvious way via dialogue through his characters.I definitely would not recommend it."},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","review":"After reading almost half of it, I could not bring myself to finish this book - I will just see the movie to see what the fuss is all about. For some reason this book is highly rated among lovers of apocalyptic fiction, but I fail to see why.The writing is pretty bland, the language sounds stiltedly formal and old, and the characters are not well developed at all. The main premise is also very dated to the early cold war.If you read any other reviews, you know that the novel is about the aftermath of a major nuclear war between the northern powers of Russia, China, and US. The survivors in Australia are waiting for radioactivity to spread slowly to them and kill them. In the mean time they go about their lives as usual (minus imported goods of course), whilst waiting for the bitter end.The dialog, plot, and characters are so dull that I could not bother to care if the apocalyptic premise was actually plausible or interesting.I think the reason why this book is popular is that it captures the cold war psyche of the 1950s and it influenced thinking about nuclear weapons and concern about the survival of humankind.This novel is a dated period piece. Sort of like a pre-renaissance medieval painting, which by modern standards would be ugly and primitive, but played some role in depicting the history of its era and perhaps in the history of art.Do not read this unless you are crazy about 1950s early nuclear cold war history."},{"Title":"Republican Like Me: A Diary of My Presidential Campaign","review":"Hey, I don't really like poetry, and I don't usually enjoy books by republicans, so imagine my shock when I opened this book and was &quot;blown away.&quot; Sparrow is a hippy anarcho-poet type who travelled around to GOP caucuses and tried to get each state's nomination for reublican presidential candidate, by reciting poems about bombs and blowing things up.

If you want to open your mind and stop believing the racist and sexist garbage the media has shoveled out about her (and about any woman who dares be anything but a worshipping dormat for men- especially any Asian woman) this is absolute a must read book. Yoko was the first Asian woman who dared in the West to publically be a Feminist. She has inspired a whole generation of women in Japan to publically stand up for their rights. She is also an inspiration to many women in the West as well, she was an equal partner in her marriage with John, both their careers were of equal weight. She and John inspired people to stand up and protest for peace, and Yoko continues this activism. She is respected by both Israelis and Palestinians for her peace activism, through her art. She also uses her art to speak out in favor of feminism, In the 80's she also began to do art activism in support of Gay and Lesbian rights. The media critics are finally beginning to open their eyes past the racist and sexist stereotypes Yoko has been the victim of. This book goes a long way toward informing readers of the real Yoko Ono and her amazing range of artistic talent, intelligence and humanitarianism. She will someday be called one of the greatest talents and visionaries of our times. Read this book and find out why."},{"Title":"Y E S Yoko Ono","review":"A thousand words are not enough and too many. Of the hundreds of art books I've bought, borrowed or stolen, this is the most elegant and *useful* one I've ever had. Munroe writes with economy and humor in language that crosses over boundaries between academia and the language of the gallery -- and everyone else who has wondered what sort of a book would attempt to encompass this wholly original and much maligned multimedia artist. This is the book to have!And the CD *rocks*. I suspected that was Sean doing some of the background vocals and certainly the bass. There are no credits in the book or on the CD itself. I wonder if that was deliberate.Buy this book. If you want your kids to know about modern art, read it to them like bedtime stories. The essays are wonderful. The photos and other reproductions of Ono's prodigious works of commercial and fine art showcase her innate sensitivity with typography as demonstrated in Grapefruit and even before that. We have treasured stills from her films, with and without her husband. And thrillingly, CLEANING PIECE, first installed in the Jerusalem Museum this year, is beautifully photographed. Yoko has arrived back at herself, and YES is the best autobiography we could have wished for.

This book covers all the avenues in which Ono created and expressed herself. &quot;Yes Yoko Ono&quot; accomplishes in book form what &quot;OnoBox&quot; achieved on disc (an extensive collection of an extraordinary woman and artist.) The reviews, letters and material covered all provide the reader with an insightful and intelligent look at not only Yoko Ono but, also, into the darkly luminous catacombs of the creative force behind this woman. This book is multi-layered with information and photographs that will need to be read and read again and again. This will be a well in which I draw from for years to come. A book I will keep near my bed for late night readings. As Yoko grows older she reminds me more and more of Georgia O'Keeffe, another extraordinary woman and artist. I truly believe that the history books will one day recognize Ono as being as significant as the Beatles and Dylan were to our culture, except that Ono was a more diversified and cutting edge artist and thinker than her contemporaries."},{"Title":"Y E S Yoko Ono","review":"In the early 1960s, Yoko Ono established herself as a challenging and often puzzling artist. She worked across the boundaries of media, making impossible to categorize her work in any field. A pioneer in conceptual art, video, and installation, Ono also crossed the boundaries into design with projects that took the form of advertising and designed artifacts. Alexandra Munroe and Jon Hendricks have surveyed the forty years of Ono's career in a richly illustrated book with essays and contributions by many scholars, including Kevin Concannon, Joan Rothfuss, and Kristine Stiles.

Without this association to Lennon, she'd probably be relegated to the rarified world of conceptual art and never be a household name. But the fame came at a high price; she was villified for her influence on the pop-cult Beatles and blamed for their demise. This is unfair; the Beatles would have evolved and changed without any help from Yoko Ono or Linda Eastman McCartney. And then she suffered the cruelest blow of all, to have her husband murdered by a crazed fan.I became a fan of her art in the 60's when I read about some of her \\"performance\\" art; one favorite; she dressed herself in her best dress,gave scissors to members of an audience, sat down in a chair and encouraged them to take snips out of her dress. At first, people were shy to do so, then as one or another became bolder and snipped bits from the dress, the group became practically frenzied and she felt even worried they would go farther than just snipping a dress with the shears. A wonderful elucidation of human behavior and original; it gave new insight into ourselves and thus was truly a work of art. Other works that impressed me were photos of the bottoms of bare feet, from under a glass surface, and of course the film of buttocks, which I personally never did have a chance to see, but loved the idea of.This book is a tremendous resource of information into Yoko Ono's varied art including her music. (No reason why a CD can't be part of a book, great idea.) This book is a fine retrospective, and I only regret that Yoko Ono will never fully take her place in modern art because of the diluting influence of pop culture on her history, and because conceptual art still has not been given the same validity as other media. (Christo perhaps is the only one to have transcended this barrier, because he sells prints of his monumentally engineered and staged concepts.)"},{"Title":"Y E S Yoko Ono","review":"I was at the SFMOMA to see her YES exhibition, and exactly what I expected, I was overwhelmed with delight...

Had it not been for John Lennon, she would probably be another burnt-out artist whose mind didn't quite survive the 60's.

When Duchamp did it, it was innovative. When Miss Ono did it years later, it a lame, drug-laced imitation of early 20th-century masters.If we must endure widows of rock stars and their art, I sincerely hope the world ends before Courtney Love discovers the Dadaists."},{"Title":"Ablative and Non-ablative Facial Skin Rejuvenation","review":"This book is not worth the cost, the photographs are pretty awful, you can't tell the difference between the before and after photographs, in about 95% of them.It talks about the procedures, but not in enough detail, like pre-op, laser medication and post-op care.This book lacks so much information, that would have been very helpful to a Consumer or MD.It's basically a book with a lot of poor photographs and would put consumers off the laser procedures, because there was hardly any difference between the photographs (only red faces).

As Cleary demonstrates in this excellent collection of translations, Dogen was easily one of most original and important Zen masters, not just in Japan, but in the entire history of Zen.Rational Zen contains of supurb selection from Dogen's two most important records: Shobogenzo (Treasury of the True Dharma-Eye), one of the most important Buddhist texts in the history of Buddhism (as well as the most important philosophical text ever created in Japan); and \\"Eihei Koroku\\" (Dogen's Extensive Record) which is now available in English (see, Leighton & Okumura).In this book, Cleary debunks the widespread misunderstanding of Zen as being irrational, mystical, or anti-intellectual. Rational Zen contains translations by this thirteenth-century Zen master that highlight the intellectual and rational aspects essential to for the authentic practice/realization of Zen.

The readings presented here - selections from the Shobogenzo and Eihei Goroku make a handy Dogen primer. Usually careful with his translations/choice of terms, the present work is no exception to this and for the most part, readers will savour the authentic flavour of Dogen's thought. However, I can't say that Cleary's choice of title struck me as being terribly appropriate. Derived from the term 'do-ri' - which some westerers like to interpret as 'reason of the way' - it thus gives the misleading impression that Zen might somehow fit in with our 'rationalistic' preconceptions. But this is the self-same 'ri' (Chin. li) that we find in the Kegon-kyo and thus synonymous with 'kung' or sunyata. Reading it the other way gives it a literary, if not a literal Confucian connotation, foreign to Dogen's considerations."},{"Title":"Miss-Guided","review":"Misguided, by Renee Flagler, is a contemporary novel that brings us into the world of Miss Kennedy Divine.

Seeing the title, reading the jacket notes, and finding a novel about two nineteenth-century surveryors, I didn't expect this to be anything I would find interesting. Then I remembered this was Thomas Pynchon. Brilliant. Who else could philosophically allude to Hamlet and Star Trek in the same work? Irrespective of how insane some of the characters, events, or combinations thereof seem, somehow he makes you at least believe them possible, or laugh trying. Exceedingly clever. To close, probably my favorite book of 1997."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"After a long wait and the disappointment of Vineland, the real Pynchon is back again, transported and translated into a different century.

In the absence of an author, we've got an entertainment to argue about. Using his fictional front, the Rev. Cherrycoke, Pynchon gives readers yet another wonderful conspiracy! In short, everyone's involved in the struggles between the Society of Jesus and the Chinese, so the reader may join in on the hilarity of paranoia. By trashing history, this narrative is more compelling than &quot;standard&quot; historical accounts, in that it gives equal weight to all players. The danger is that I believe too readily in Ben Franklin's underground elecktrical cabaret, Learned Dogs, and the travelling dog &amp; pony show of Messrs. Mason &amp; Dixon.

The \\"electrick\\" writing on each of the 773 pages is luminous beyond belief. The characters are deeply human \\"comick\\" and \\"mystick\\" figures who consistently extend the wit of their banter well beyond the first or second brilliant repartee of each stretch of dialogue. The \\"vistos\\" of wild American colonial landscape in both city and countryside, on land and \\"oceanick\\", in royal and humble society in Pynchon's Great Chain of Being are breathtaking. The dialogue is intelligent and witty and often hilarious. Meet Franklin, Col. Washington, Penn, Calvert, Boswell and Dr. Johnson -- all in the mileux of their day -- in adventures high and low. \\"Mason & Dixon\\" is an American Human Comedy written in the style of Fielding in \\"Tom Jones\\" or Sterne in \\"Tristram Shandy\\" or Barth in \\"The Sotweed Factor.\\" An intricate and elegantly woven story line awaits those who must have one. High science and political intrigue of the day abound for those who love reading 18th century American history. Most of all, the writing quality is so evenly elegant throughout this opus maximus that its supreme and sustained intelligence is the signature of a writer of Nobel Prize stature. Pynchon's body of work, including \\"V.\\" \\"M&D\\" and \\"Gravity's Rainbow,\\" are sufficient evidence of the breadth of his literary gifts. Only a handful of writers in this era are capable of writing metafiction at this lofty level -- Gaddis, Gass, Theroux, Barth, Donleavy and Bellow. Is Pynchon as brilliant as Nobel Laureate, Bellow? Pynchon is, at least, equally worthy. Few novels have so much going for them on so many levels. \\"Carpe carpum.\\" Do yourself a favor and seize this brilliant, carping novel: someday its cover shall bear the seal of the Nobel Prize for it is a \\"magnetick\\" American Iliad -- a shimmering and timeless Flower of Light."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"Like some kind of OutofControl Top or meandering Mad Man, the Plot of this novel Spins and Cavorts, pell-mell, and Hiddly-Diddly, rendering the Reader unable to ever Know What exactly may Leap at him at each turn of the Page. Coupled with this is the Fact that there is not one Sane character in the whole Novel (all of their Heads' are crammed with Zany Dreams, unknowable, ghastly Landscapes, and Plain Insanity).This Novel certainly tests the Limit of the Reader's credulity, featuring (among other Things) a Robotic Duck (complete with Mechanical Tinkerings and Free Will), a very Educated Dog, an Ear in Cave that serves as on anti-Oracle (using the Information dumped into it for its own Purposes and not caring the help the Hapless Traveller).One would be just as Insane as one of the Characters in the Book to think this &quot;Historical Fiction&quot;. It has more to do (at least in this Reader's Eyes) with the maddening Restlessness of an overactive and Endlessly Creative Brain.The Prose is Amazing and continually Fresh and is bent and Molded to wrap Itself around countless Stories issuing from Sundry Mouths (think Chaucer on LSD or the Bible written by someone with a sense of Humor).The Happy Barbarism of this Our Land is written betimes with Anger and often with Wonder. The Relationship of Mason &amp; Dixon (i miss them Already!) swells and Emerges into a Deep Friendship, the likes of which may cause a Tear or two to Grace the Eyes of a Sentimental Reader. I'd venture to say that the Tone of this Book is grandly (and Insanely, Foolishly, Wonderfully) Comic. And may increase the Appreciation the Reader may already Have for our friends, the Stars and for Romantick Travellers who Boldly pursue terrains Earthly and Supernatural, Calm and Hectick."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"To say Mason & Dixon is a unique read is an understatement. I left the novel feeling as though I'd had an \\"experience\\". Anyone can read an engaging story, but whether it stemmed from the physical heft of the book (773 pages) and the subsequent investment of time needed to finish it, or (more likely) the scope of its content--the Enlightenment, and the tale of two unlikely individuals thrown into an even unlikelier scenario of being contracted to chart a line of latitude in the New World, the novel left...reverberations.No reader can delve into the multi-layered depths of Mason & Dixon unarmed: a basic understanding of the Enlightenment, the advent of scientific thought, the increasingly tense relations between Britain and the colonies, and an appreciation for the impact of civilization on uncharted territory and native communities, are all necessary tools a reader should bring to the reading experience. The novel on its most fundamental level, tells the story of the Englishmen Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon, a baker's son turned astronomer and a Geordie turned surveyor, who in the mid-18th century are contracted by the Royal Society to chart a line of latitude in the colonies to establish the borders of several states--Maryland, Pennsylvania and Delaware. The book's heft accounts for the fact that Pynchon begins the story by delving into the earlier years of the team's success, when they cut their teeth on the Cape of Good Hope, charting and surveying--again for the Society--to potentially assist in helping ships navigate through the Southern Atlantic and Asiatic waters further east. As Dixon surmises, why exactly are we doing this? He then speculates that the Royal Society may be motivated by an \\"arrangement\\" with the East India Company, and that the work of Mason & Dixon is actually playing into the hands of commerce.This example also reflects the strength of these two characters, robbed from centuries of historical heights, as the men who charted the line, and more (in Pynchon's telling) as two contractors with strong skills sets endowed with incredibly human characteristics--a penchant for bickering, fearfulness, and a concern that their work may be playing into the hands of forces they do not appreciate or understand. As Dr. Samuel Johnson tells Charles Mason later in the book--Mason's \\"relative innocence\\" is a sacred asset but a secular liability. Throughout the novel, the politics of the Royal Society intervene. Charles Mason is incensed that a less-worthy astronomer, Maskelyne, receives the post of Royal Astronomer after the former R.A., Mason's mentor, Bradley, dies leaving the post open. Maskelyne, it seems, has a powerful contact in India.The novel weaves from past to present to anecdote to whatever Pynchon decides is relevant for the moment. The narrative offers few guideposts for the readers--helpful guidance is absent, making for a tough and unforgiving reading experience. One must come armed with all one's cognitive abilities to Mason & Dixon, to understand the subtlety, the nuance and the context of the story to avoid becoming hopelessly frustrated with the reading experience.Mason and Dixon are at once humorous and serious characters. They argue endlessly with each other in an endearing, Odd Couple kind of way while wondering entertainingly about the intentions of their employer. During their initial trip to the Cape of Good Hope for their first adventure, their trip is waylaid by a French warship. After an alarming battle, Mason writes to the Royal Society stating that this was NOT what he signed on for, and is there some other manner in which they may serve. His evident cowardice does not go over well with the R.S. The reader can only smile at his humanness. Yet both also struggle (on the serious side) with past trauma--the early death of Mason's wife, Rebecca, haunts his character and endows within him a melancholic disposition, while Dixon's more cheerful and buoyant personality is offset by the challenge of reconciling his Quaker roots to a harsh, bitter and violent realities of the New World. Dixon's staunch philosophy of peacefulness (influenced by the social justice roots of the Jesuits) reaches a pinnacle when he observes a slave driver urging his \\"merchandise\\" down the streets of Philadelphia. Incensed, Dixon grabs his whip and threatens to kill him for treating other humans so badly. Throughout the novel, Mason and Dixon (and the reader) run up against the human exploitation of others by powerful bodies--slaves in South Africa and the colonies and, indeed, the two men starring in this novel speculate aloud about the impact of their geometric line on the more natural lives and homes of the American Indians into whose lands they must travel. Is this Pynchon dealing a heavy hand of irony? Is he pointing out how the proud men of science, so self-satisfied with the ability to harness the laws of nature in the 18th century, are nevertheless blind to their own devastating influence on the lives of others?The Mason and Dixon Line, which generations of high schoolers have read about, and which has forever instilled in the minds of Americans the names of the two men who charted it, is a bit player in the novel, though a heavy symbol of all it represents. Since Icarus built wings of wax and sought to fly up to the great heights of the gods, but who then toppled to his death when the heat of the sun melted the wax, tales abound of mankind's attempt to harness and control nature and his own natural world, often to devastating effect on himself or those around him. Mason & Dixon is such a tale, relegating the historical protagonists to the world of gentle men (despite their significant achievement) and the men of the Enlightenment to the benighted world of those who have wrought pain as well as social good with their hubris and lack of human sensitivity."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"Much like Pynchon's preceding and following large works, \\"Gravity's Rainbow\\" and \\"Against the Day\\", this is a very large, dense novel that sometimes requires a bit more perseverance than one wishes to bring to the casual reading experience. Yet, as most other reviews on Pynchon's work will tell you, the experience justifies the effort.\\"Mason & Dixon\\" is thematically and topically immense, ranging from suspicion toward the efforts of the Jesuits to existential questions posed through the tales of an all-powerful automaton duck. While I would not say that the work follows a discernible plot, it does have a consistent momentum throughout. And this is why the structure of \\"Mason & Dixon\\" is so appropriate to the subject matter. Mason and Dixon, at least concerning the American project, are on a mission of westward expansion. Heading ever away from civilized London, the pair continue further into large and beautiful spaces, unbounded and bountiful, where anything is possible and everything is novel. Thus the idea of expansion into the unknown is well-served by Pynchon's eclectic and often puzzling choices as a writer.But we are also bogged down by the technicalities. There is a great deal of the hard sciences, primarily astronomy and engineering, and Pynchon does not treat them casually. As readers we are left to pour over paragraphs and pages, dedicated to antiquated surveying techniques, simply trying to root out a few truffles of comprehension. While it can be troublesome at times, it is certainly enlightening, and, more importantly, apt to the story. Mason and Dixon, as they traveled the world encountered great beauty and wonders, but they were also bound inextricably with the technical requirements of their mission. As such, I feel that it gives the reader a fuller experience of what the true nature of their lives might be.Additionally, \\"Mason & Dixon\\" offers something that \\"Gravity's Rainbow\\" and \\"Against the Day\\" do not --a satisfying resolution. While Pynchon often expand and simply unravels in other works, here he actually tapers the story back to something that one might call a \\"conclusion.\\" I do not mean to say that potential readers can look forward to a cathartic peripety, but at least the story has a feel of winding down rather than disappearing in a fog of confusion.The characters were absolutely wonderful as well, particularly the eponymous duo, and in my opinion, \\"Mason & Dixon\\" contains some of Pynchon's greatest jokes, the best of which is a brilliantly executed Popeye reference. If you have the time and patience, grab a dictionary, keep an encyclopedia nearby, and read the book. It is hilarious, intriguing, inadvertently educational, and it is, without a doubt, one of the best novels I have ever read."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"Not much is said about Mason &amp; Dixon. The book is usually overshadowed by Gravity's Rainbow, by far Pynchon's most famous and \`impressive' novel. Yet, Mason &amp; Dixon resonates deeply, for many readers including myself, as his most heartfelt and mature work. Pynchon came on the literary scene as a lightning bolt, publishing \`V.' in his early twenties. Then came \`Lot 49' and \`GR', and the rest was history... For critics and some readers, M&amp;D seemed like a redundancy, for what possibly could Pynchon add to his literary oeuvre? Having been blown away by GR, I was hesitant to dive into M&amp;D, for fear of being disappointed, for being told the same story, some twenty-five years later.M&amp;D is a historical novel that correlates with journal entries written by the actual Mason and Dixon, two men who traversed and demarcated the line that separates the north and south. Like all his novels, M&amp;D, flew by like a strange and warm dream...something about talking robot ducks and pretty girls on rooftops and dancing bathtubs and falling through calendars into a missing 11 days colonized by pygmies and Chinese guys swinging from vines in the amazon...However, unlike GR- and perhaps more worthwhile- Pynchon manages to create characters (specifically the melancholy and austere Mason) who are filled with so much soul and who are impossible not to love, similar to Tolstoy or Dickens, which is a huge departure. In the past, Pynchon's characters all tended to be laced with irony or word puns, which contained readers at a distance from them. It seems that, with M&amp;D, Pynchon is trying to go backwards, after having crushed so many literary and aesthetic boundaries. Pynchon seems more sad, more distant as ever, yet so close with each word. Dixon is reminiscent of Slothrop (GR) and Benny Profane (V.): happy-go-lucky guys unaware of \\"Them\\" (an anchoring theme). Mason is new, more evolved. One is almost brought to tears being with him on a boat, in the middle of the Atlantic, looking at the stars.M&amp;D, classic Pynchon-like showiness aside, is simply a novel about two men trying to make a straight like, and continuously losing their way. With each detour, concepts like \`fate' or \`historical truth' re-write themselves, and readers learn (with Pynchon, you always learn) that there may be many calendars and many lines and many clocks all going on at once, and that history is merely one version of a greater whole. Pynchon's mind is a kaleidoscope, look inside and see all the colors."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"I first read Pynchon about 30 years ago. Unlike some friends who can remember every character and situation of Gravity's Rainbow or V., it was not specific characters or events which most intrigued me in Pynchon's writing, but the sense of place he invokes. The place is not geographic, but experiential. To read Pynchon seriously (and this requires a certain suspension of disbelief), to follow his logic through(it is there, though sometimes difficult)is to experience a paradigm shift. One cannot read Pynchon and fail to experience the world a bit differently afterward. With Mason &amp; Dixon, not only does Pynchon more clearly develop the significance of his theory of Entropy as it applies to human society (the obliteration of the mythic, the homogenization of culture, the blanding of the imagination), but he demonstrates that he has become wordsmith without equal in (at least)current English literature. The meaning of this work aside, it must be read by everyone who writes or wishes to write for the sheer beuty of its prose.This novel represents a synthesis of historic and scientific knowledge, social analysis, wit, insight and sheer mastery of description unequalled by anything I have seen in Twentieth Century literature. Don't be afraid of this book. Be afraid to be afraid of it."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"With 'Mason &amp; Dixon', Punchon brings a post-modernperspective to the 18th Century novel. This has been called a pastichebut it's much more than that. It's a delightfully comic adventure story, telling the tale of the astronomer Charles Mason and his surveyor partner, Jeremiah Dixon, who were commissioned to establish the boundary between the states of Maryland and Pennsylvania in the 1760s. Pynchon charts their professional partnership from their first journey together to South Africa to Mason's final return to America, following Dixon's premature death in England, and along the way he introduces a variety of fantastical elements, including a robot duck searching for an amorous companion, an erudite but contemptuous talking dog, an exiled Chinese feng shui practitioner, a Swedish logger who may in fact be the reincarnation of a Norse God and a number of real life characters such as Benjamin Franklin and George Washington. As usual with Pynchon, the cast of characters seems to run into the hundreds, but he masters their destinies with skill and panache, giving us object lessons along the way in tasks as diverse as surveying, astronomy, haute cuisine, feng shui, hanging, fishing, parenting, undertaking and whoring. And yet he never loses sight of his two main characters, for the dour and melancholy Mason and the unpredictable and randy Dixon remain at the heart of this raunchy, wild and surreal take on the enlightenment. Forget the Booker drivel - this is what novel-writing at its most inventive and ambitious can come up with; a book that places demands on its readers, one that repays the effort you put into it. Mike O'Driscoll"},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"Don't fear the size of this book -- the chapters are many, but short and varied so as to encourage a quick reading pace. The dialect is pretty easy to get used to; by around 100 pages it becomes quite charming. But the main reason to read Pynchon's latest is that it captures a time when America represented exhuberant hope and the promise of unbounded opportunity to those who let their spirits soar. Much of this book is quite funny; the anachronistic telling of the story by the narrator (Revd. Cherrycoke)takes many unexpected turns. He embellishes his yarn shamelessly, and obviously much of this simply could not have happened (though much of it could).On another level, this story leaves you with the sad realization of how stifled the American spirit has become in contemporary times. So you laugh, but then discover the gnawing pain behind the humor -- we no longer see the grand horizons, no longer feel the elation in discovering things wondrous. Oh to return to the America, where as Pynchon writes at the end, &quot;You won't need a telescope to see the stars.&quot; and &quot;The Indians know Magick.&quot;"},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"Well, Pynchon's back in form and inciting the same amount of praise and a little bit of angry criticism from the folks who don't get him. Well, go figure. I don't like/get Vonnegut but I'm not gonna slag him off just because he's not my cup of tea. However, it's hard to read the naysayers and not offer a response. Pynchon's 18th century vernacular is &quot;full of anachronisms?&quot; Well, of course it is! And they're hellaciously witty: the passage where slave song rhythms and the sound of the ocean, described as &quot;rocking&quot; and &quot;rolling&quot; is not only a great convoluted bad pun but an accurate pre-figuration of rock and roll and surf music (African and British folk styles coming together). It's deliberately anachronistic! Every serious reader of Pynchon knows that rock and roll and jazz play significant roles in all of his works--supposedly &quot;low&quot; forms of art which actually galvanize and humanize and offer transcendence in the face of the entropic forces of &quot;Truth&quot; and competing order(s) and ideologies. Pynchon's historical contexts have everything to do with the here and now. Pynchon uses &quot;further&quot; for &quot;farther&quot; so he doesn't deserve to be read? Who's being pretentious now? Critics are missing the dead seriousness with which humor is employed, and the humor--not &quot;ha-ha,&quot; but the deep sense of play--involved in constructing the serious details. I admit at first I thought this was another Pynchonian phone-in performance ala Vineland (still a great book), but the overlay of farce and foible masks a brilliant and serious creation which examines, in very erudite fashion, the forces which have led America, and mankind itself, to its present state. Critics! If you don't understand Pynchon, it doesn't mean you're dumb! It's just not your thing! You may not share his humor and his countercultural irreverence, but you can't deny his importance in American letters just because you don't get him."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"With Pynchon you never know what is real and what is imagined. I found myself searching websites for the &quot;Pennsylvaniad&quot; by Timothy Tox. I was swept away by this all-encompassing story. &quot;Mason and Dixon&quot; had the narrative flow of Whitman, teeming with beautiful passages, wonderful word plays and an epic sense of history and mythology. A very rewarding experience for those willing to succumb to Pynchon's magic."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"I must confess my bias towards this book before I start. My name is Richard Dixon-Teasdale, my Grandmother was MH Dixon of Cockfield, County Durham. Yes you guessed it I am a relative of Jeremiah Dixon, he was my great, great, great grandfathers (I still get this wrong how many greats there are)brother. My interest in this book originated from my childhood after hearing all the family stories of the Dixon clan from my Grandmother and following her death in 1984 inheriting some family heirlooms relating to the Dixons, i.e. we have the original compass that was used to draw the line between north and south America. We even had the stained glass window presented to Jeremiah from Captain Cook on his return to the North East of England after completing the line. Jeremiah Dixon was not the only famous Dixon however and many of his successors have a prestigious heritage, for example Cleopatras Needle which now stands on the banks of the Thames in London, England was transported by boat in a watertight capsule by a Dixon, which was quite a feat in those days. Other achievements included the invention of gas lighting in a house, even though this particular Dixon never officially became recognised as the inventor as the history books credit someone else many years later. This invention is imprinted in the history books of Cockfield as the experiments were considered too dangerous as this particular Dixon ended up blowing up his house! The first inland railway line was modeled on the original plans by another Dixon who wanted to build a canal. The list is endless and I digress. Anyway my Great Grandfather started to write a book on the history of the Dixon family but died before he could finish it. I have decided to finish the book that he started, this has involved me trawling through many graveyards looking for family members and trawling through many public libraries. So if any publishers read this I am open to offers. Anyway back to the review I found the book to be incredibly well researched and provided you have some patience as I did find it pretty heavy going at the start you will be rewarded with a modern masterpiece. I found it fascinating and has been an invaluable source for my own book. Read it you wont regret it!"},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"I received this book as a gift from my (then) wife. She knows that, as an engineer, I am very interested in the famous and not-so-famous engineers and technicians who helped build our modern world. Mason and Dixon were two such, so a book about them should have been of interest to me.In that respect, the gift was a failure. The author has, to paraphrase Mark Twain, thrown so much darkness on the subject that we shall soon know nothing about it. If there is good, accurate and cogent information about the historical Mason and Dixon in this book, you'd need another ten books to tease it out. I'm not sure I'd ever recognize the real Mason and Dixon if presented them, after this introduction.But if you put aside any hope of discerning fact from fiction, the book has its own fascinating charm. Mason and Dixon are not as important as the world they inhabit. It isn't a world you'll recognize, not unless you learned your history from reading The National Enquirer. But it at least gives you an insight into what the pre-Revolutionary world may have been like before the historians cleaned it up, edited it, and corrected its grammar. Our modern lunacies and misconceptions have their antecedents. Boy do they ever.I doubt I'll ever read another book by Thomas Pynchon. For one thing, I don't think I'll ever want to spend that much time again. But I'm glad to have read it once and read it through to the end.

Not to be discouraged by the novel's 18th century setting, Pynchon introduces images of entropy, allowing him to once again ask: which paradigm is better -- modern or classical science? His solution is brilliant: Pynchon provides an abundance of images of bluriness, haze, and vertigo to suggest that reality cannot ultimately be compartmentalized. So the notion of a paradigmatic dichotomy in science is undermined through notions of myopia -- the very thing that so debilitates the practice of science!"},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"More than 20 years after Thomas Pynchon redefined the nature of the modern American novel with his publication of Gravity's Rainbow, and more than half a decade since his ruminations on the state of the hippie in postmodern America, the elusive master of the twentieth-century style has done it again, this time with an epic appropriation of the eighteenth century's wackiest pair of errant scientists, Mason and Dixon.Pynchon's novel carves its own critical space at the forefront of Historical Fiction as it follows the two rogues across the high seas of eighteenth-century rationalism. With a trajectory that travels from the Nabobs of the Subcontinent to the Natives of the Allegheny Mountains, Pynchon puts forth Messrs Mason and Dixon as the ultimate foils of early-modern philosophy and thought. Combining historical fact with supernatural fiction, humorous hijinx with deep morality, Pynchon asks the big questions: As Americans, how do we find the balance between our present and our past? How do we juggle the grandeur of science with the uncanniness of the supernatural?With Mason &amp; Dixon, a novel just as important as Gravity's Rainbow, yet in its own right more approachable, Thomas Pynchon shows us that the questions of the contemporary condition can only be answered by an awareness of the past. His style remains true, his focus ever relevant. And with the currents of apocalypse defining our postmodernity, it's good to have someone like Pynchon who maintains a rock-solid understanding of the world, tempered only with an appreciation for the awesome"},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"Every reader of Thomas Pynchon, like the long distance walker, will encounter one or more &quot;walls&quot;--barriers to deal with if the book is to be finished and a measure of satisfaction achieved. Although it is 773 pages long, length is not really a major &quot;wall&quot; in this novel. The first wall is language, words and their meanings. Long recognized as a master of techno-babble, this author of a 1000 voices situates his narrative in the 18th century, and (inevitably) chooses to render it in rhetoric that &quot;seems&quot; authentic, down to the slang and capitalized Nouns. Those who can read through or &quot;flow&quot; with this language will have that rare treat of entering a whole world created by language. This world becomes more and more familiar, especially when the scene shifts to America, where one recognizes more of the names, events, and places. The second barrier is one of knowledge: Pynchon builds a laybrinth of facts and pseudo-facts that can delight or irritate one to no end. Did George Washington smoke hemp? Did too many cups of coffee, plus sweets, plus tobacco in crowded coffee houses help propel the American colonists toward Revolution? If you're the sort who has to know &quot;the truth,&quot; this novel could take over parts of your life!

And I'm just not getting it with this book. I've started and finished about thirty-five books since I started M&amp;D in July when it came out last year. And I'm still not even close to being done!

The whole book reads like a prank on the reader: &quot;I want to make the most insanely difficult-to-read book with the most obtuse literary references, and people will buy it and read it because there's a mystique about me.&quot; You wouldn't buy Harrison's Textbook of Internal Medicine and read that from cover to cover. I'm tired of having art (paintings, music, literature) challenge my conception of what is good or bad. There's a lot of &quot;it's so bad it's good&quot; in our art these days (it all started with Marcel Duchamp and the bicycle wheel he welded onto a barstool and pronounced, &quot;art&quot;)."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"Pynchon slips you a cocktail of pseudo-historical verse. Playful--his use of language is particularly impressive, even charming--but by the time they get to America far too many pages have passed and you begin to tire of the main characters' flattened personalities."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"The book I received did not look new at all. The sides had something on them, I was not 100% satisfied with my purchase. But now I know for next time."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"For years Pynchon has intrigued me as being one of the \\"bosses\\" of modern literature. I've often considered taking up one of his works, always driven by nagging curiosity, I've read reviews and articles, researched the man, read summaries of his different books. It was with a sense of duty I approached Pynchon, a sense of obligation of having to read someone who, by all accounts, is one of the greatest authors to ever walk the Earth. After some consideration I decided to take the plunge with Mason & Dixon, my gut was telling me to avoid Gravity's Rainbow and on paper M&D; sounds like a great book. Supposedly it's a literary adventure through the 18th century, a story constantly switching style as its narrator attempts to appeal to a changing audience. Really that sounds like a premise that's as entertaining as it is edifying, but make no mistake, Pynchon is simply messing around without capitalizing on the possibilities of his concept.In what way was this an homage, parody, or imitation of 18th century literature? Pynchon has no feeling for that material, and I could scarcely recognize anything of the 18th century here. I love sentimental literature but I couldn't for the life of me see much connection between Pynchon's writings and the major works of the 18th century, Diderot; Sterne; Goldsmith; Goethe are all missing entirely from this book. Whereas the titan of the age, Goethe, was a true human scientist drawing deep and vibrant characters and treating them with what he called \\"high benevolent irony\\", that is as a lover or close friend, sometimes teasingly but always sympathetically, Pynchon just forgets to even include characters. Whereas Goethe meticulously and diligently developed his themes, motifs, and symbolism to their logical conclusions, Pynchon is all over the map willy nilly throwing out anything that diverts his attention. For all the scribblings in this book's 800 some pages, 90% of it just feels like hot air lacking any real message or content. What is all this supposed to mean? How do these tie into the book's overall program? Reading a book by Goethe is like walking through a treasure vault while Pynchon is like strolling through a garbage dump full of meaningless, forgotten pop culture relics. Pynchon seems to think 18th century simply means lots of archaic spellings, and boy does he run that gimmick into the ground quick. The reader will be ready to give up after the thousandth time \\"Reverend\\" is written as \\"Rev[superscript d]\\". Real clever Pynchon...The overall scheme of the novel is stupid and amateurish. I would like to stress that you won't really pick up on this from reading the book because it's all nonsense, but it has some weak message about balance or moderation or something. \\"Drawing the line in the middle\\" type thing. But seriously, is that really insightful to anyone? It's a lame idea that is pretty objectionable. F. Schlegel, one of the fantastic 18th century literary stylists that Pynchon obviously didn't read, once wrote \\"moderation is the spirit of castrated narrow mindedness\\", and Goethe himself rejected this stupid notion of compromise by saying that the solution did not lie between binaries, rather the middle is where the *problem* is to be found. Seriously, Goethe did a whole book on this, it's called Wilhelm Meister's Journeyman Years. Not only does he avoid Pynchon's trite views on the matter in favor of an infinitely more insightful approach, but he also parodies all his contemporaries in the form of brilliant metafictional novellas that tie the novel together, hitting on Sterne; Goldsmith; Rousseau and others. Of course Pynchon does not even come close to achieving Goethe's level of intellectual power.Honestly, this book is just annoying. I was not able to finish it as it does in 100 pages what better books do in 10. There are plenty of novels requiring 50 or even 100 pages from the reader before really taking off, and I won't discount the possibility that M&D; doesn't begin to hit its stride until later on, but judging by the first 300-400 pages I suspect the back half offered little of interest. The characters were just weak and were always in the background to Pynchon's ramblings, and the major theme of the work was uninteresting and naive. Really Pynchon was just showing off his \\"imagination\\" with endless derails, whimsical characters that didn't figure into the story at all, and stupid jokes bathed in obscure jargon. In an 18th century novel you might find deep relatable characters having intelligent, interesting discussions about important issues, in this book you'll find a couple of lines of throwaway dialogue and page after page of meaningless nonsense. Avoid this book. Avoid Pynchon. Read a good book by a good author instead. The works of Goethe are of little concern to modern readers and major works of his are almost totally unread in the english speaking world, do yourself a favor and pick up one of his novels instead of wasting time on an author as pretentious and vain as Thomas Pynchon."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"If you like rambling verbiage that not only obstructs but obliterates the point, you'll love this author, whose neurotic word dribblings are gnosticed by critics to be visionary insights.I bought two Pynchon books, Mason & Dixon and Gravity's Rainbow, based on a favorable review by Tom Robbins, an author I have greatly enjoyed. Robbins says Pynchon is a wordsmith. True, but I seek to read words that convey, not convolute or contort, meaning.I made a mistake. I did not read the Mason & Dixon excerpt provided by Amazon, which clearly records the author's quixotic style. Had I looked before I leapt, I would have never purchased any books by this author. Clearly, the fault is mine.I am a reader who enjoys being bluntly told what the author thinks, being led into imagination and interpretation, and a reader who is most appreciative of learning a new point of view. However, I feel deceived if led into nothingness. It's like viewing a \`painting' of a blank canvas titled Untitled. Critics tell me I'm unsophisticated to not get-it. I know - I'm being duped.The one positive fact I can report is that the book Gravity's Rainbow is made of heavier paper, weighing more pounds than books the same size.

For anyone interested in historical fiction, American studies, or plain old great literature this is a MUST read. As in his other novels Pynchon again brings into focus how the ideal of America contrasts with its reality and displays it in all of its beauty and horror, its greatest potential and most terrible failure. From its narrative style, to its cast of characters, to its profound examination of science and religion, this is a tour de force that is as near perfect as a book can be. Both extraordinarily funny and complex, I dare any serious reader to hate this book."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"Some years ago, after plodding through Gravity's Rainbow, I thought that Pynchon was not for me. Mason &amp; Dixon confirms this. After reading reviews about this historical novel, I bought the book, looking forward to some good reading. Instead I found Pynchon's usual games: talking dogs, mechanical ducks, etc. I'm sorry but I don't use the same drugs as the author. When he does write along a storyline, Pynchon's writing is wonderful. Too bad he can't keep it up"},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"Thomas Pynchon keeps demanding that we answer a few simple questions. What is it to be Human? And what have we made of our Humanity? With great invention, he kneads, teases, and probes the social, political and historical structures we have erected; carefully marking their interactions with what we might still wish to call &quot;the imagination.&quot;The results of Pynchon's mapping, which is always also an un-mapping, is Mason &amp; Dixon; funny and sad and beautiful as hell. It is also a potent provocation to sustained political &amp; social thought. Pynchon's opus may ultimately prove our most cogent meditation in American literature on the real meaning and possibility of freedom; the ways we have installed it progressively as a troupe of Power, while destroying any scope for an earthly topos or communitas in which it might exist.Mason &amp; Dixon, by bringing us back to the era of British Colonial America, charts the European importation of Death-Structures across the world, and asks the strange and important question: Did the American Revolution Ever Happen? Questions as strange as this lead to strange answers, not just about history and land, but about the sort of folks who claim it, inscribe it, use and abuse it.Some readers have thought of Pynchon as a paranoid novelist, but this is not quite right. He is, rather, a novelist concerned with paranoia, its effects and affects. He has long been carrying out a richer-than-systematic investigation---a querying into---the social, historical, economic, philosophical, logical, psychological and biological roots of the paranoid mind-set. In Gravity's Rainbow, Pynchon formulated a critique of paranoia, anti-paranoia, and the too-often excluded middle of thinking between the binary oppositions of 0's and 1's. But we are very far from Gravity's Rainbow, masterpiece though that was, now. There is no need to repeat the investigation. The critique has modulated. That our post cold-war moment in history may have made this possible is no doubt quite true. Mason &amp; Dixon is able to approach these questions from other places, and in part, in order to further other ends.In Mason &amp; Dixon, we see in the remarkable parade of characters and events a spectrum of thought and behaviour from Paranoia through Anti-Paranoia. Yet the emphasis is now on our difficult and sometimes failed attempts to live within excluded middles. Many of these modulations are in the service of a continuing concern with the possibility of communication between people, and within societies. As Tomas Alexander has said of communication within participatory Democracy, &quot;Communication is the process of creating participation, of making common what has been isolating and singular.&quot; The act of achieving expression requires making human the territory between paranoid and anti-paranoid thinking, which are mirrors of equivalent solipsism. Pynchon is interested is the possibility, if it is a possibility, of realising the task of community. And to do this, solipsism must be overcome. Each of us must encounter The Other in a spirit of constructive engagement, and spiritual openness. And this is what Pynchon achieves in Mason &amp; Dixon.Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon, two of the best wrought and most affecting characters in recent fiction, cross the threshold from solipsism into friendship. In learning to understand something of each other, they learn also to understand something more of themselves, and to ask better questions of their world. Yet their rendering is not merely in the service of Pynchon's philosophical yearnings: these are characters whose insistent quirky presences resonate palpably from the page. Their humanity refuses to be bound by any mere fictional or historical record, but insists on life; their Being will except no substitute. Mason &amp; Dixon's myriad voices from the possible past cry to us from &quot;the other side&quot; of both fiction and history, to listen well and remember. After 773 pages, you will know that our humanity depends on it.A community founded on creative expression, which is to say the kind of community Pynchon's texts yearn for but rarely find, must be made and re-made. It faces the creative possibilities and precariousness of our world. Dewey called a society which interacted and understood itself in this matter a &quot;democracy.&quot; The term for him meant something much closer to the &quot;D&quot; in the &quot;SDS&quot; than to anything our political leaders might spout out of their dissembling cake-holes.Some very fine readers of Pynchon have thought of Mason &amp; Dixon's wild fertility of telling as constituting a kind of farewell to narrative. But Mason &amp; Dixon has assuredly not abandoned narrative. Rather, as great novels do, it has re-invented it. Moreover, it has done so with a keen eye on the history of telling stories; from the American tall tale, to Scheherazade, to Tristram Shandy and Moby Dick. Moreover there is that within this novel which transmutes influence into something quite original: a magical, rich and strange quality which has never been anywhere except Mason &amp; Dixon.Mason &amp; Dixon is not so much loosely plotted as subtlety formed; a rich complex of interlocking tales across and among narrative levels. This allows for the richest unfolding of spiritual history during the early British Empire and 'revolutionary' America attempted in our century. If Mason &amp; Dixon is at fault, it may be in that only readers as well equipped as Shakespeare or Cervantes may be able to appreciate this on a first reading. For this reason it has been an impossible book to review quickly. And for this reason it shall be read hereafter as long as our language lives in the mouths of those who might wish to dream themselves out of the nightmare of History."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"I purchased this book 4 months ago and have tried to read it three times now.

Maybe I am not *smart* enough or 'hip' enough to tackle a great piece of literature, but WHO CARES!"},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"Set in the 18th century and told in the novel style of that period Pynchon's latest work manages more than any of his others to speak to the reader from today's world. Pynchon's language, poetic and prosaic at the same time, carries us back to the beginning of America while his references to popular culture and transposition of modern crisis remind us painfully of where we are. Looking back on the partnership of Mason and Dixon, Pynchon encourages us to reflect back on America. The coupling of the astronomers and the surveying of an endless line West serve to recall for us the days when we ourselves were ever seeking and never finding the next boundary. When new discoveries were over the next rise and there was nothing that could not eventually be encompassed by a line drawn by the stars.And yet the wrenching irony of it all is Pynchon telling us, or asking us, why we choose to explore. Do we explore for the sake of discovery, for the challenges, for the lifting of spirit, or do we explore as a means of running away from our past of finding new lands where the evils of the old may be forgotten without being cured?We see, as Mason and Dixon see, that we were never at our best as we were when we sought the newness over the horizon and yet we wonder if we can ever regain that moment. Filling this longing is always Pynchon. From moments of delight at the characters being themselves and remarking on the absurdity of the world around them, to pop culture references (Star Trek, Popeye), historical figures (Washington, Franklin), reprises on himself (yet another member in the Bodine family heritage), or classical allusions there is never a moment when Pynchon is not in control, asking us where we stand, how we feel and where we are going.Throughout the whole book we are forced to ask ourselves not only what was, what could have been, but what might still be. The magical possibilities of Pynchon are at their best. We see through him but feel for ourselves when we talk to the Learned English Dog, visit with a mechanichal duck, live under giant vegetables or meet to catch a carriage with a ghost. All of it bringing us with Mason and Dixon to the point when we know it was real but wonder if it really could have been, then long to do it over again."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"I must confess my bias towards this book before I start. My name is Richard Dixon-Teasdale, my Grandmother was MH Dixon of Cockfield, County Durham. Yes you guessed it I am a relative of Jeremiah Dixon, he was my great, great, great grandfathers (I still get this wrong how many greats there are)brother. My interest in this book originated from my childhood after hearing all the family stories of the Dixon clan from my Grandmother and following her death in 1984 inheriting some family heirlooms relating to the Dixons, i.e. we have the original compass that was used to draw the line between north and south America. We even had the stained glass window presented to Jeremiah from Captain Cook on his return to the North East of England after completing the line. Jeremiah Dixon was not the only famous Dixon however and many of his successors have a prestigious heritage, for example Cleopatras Needle which now stands on the banks of the Thames in London, England was transported by boat in a watertight capsule by a Dixon, which was quite a feat in those days. Other achievements included the invention of gas lighting in a house, even though this particular Dixon never officially became recognised as the inventor as the history books credit someone else many years later. This invention is imprinted in the history books of Cockfield as the experiments were considered too dangerous as this particular Dixon ended up blowing up his house! The first inland railway line was modeled on the original plans by another Dixon who wanted to build a canal. The list is endless and I digress. Anyway my Great Grandfather started to write a book on the history of the Dixon family but died before he could finish it. I have decided to finish the book that he started, this has involved me trawling through many graveyards looking for family members and trawling through many public libraries. So if any publishers read this I am open to offers. Anyway back to the review I found the book to be incredibly well researched and provided you have some patience as I did find it pretty heavy going at the start you will be rewarded with a modern masterpiece.

If not, you will find much of this book incomprehensible, as a great deal of it consists of Pynchon's pages long 'dialogues' purporting to show the mental activities of his characters about these issues.

Then we're off--A huge ball of cheese, a talking dog, a robotic duck without a mate (French, no less), a floating ear, a glowing indian . . .Then we have the &quot;digression&quot; (without warning of course), into a text read by one of the text's characters. We, two chapters later, come out of the tunnel and are basking once again in the M and D text once again.Thus far we are par for the Pynchon course. The text is arguably the most complex work of this master (he spent more time on this text than any to date). As with all of his works, I can't pass judgement, not having the slightest clue as to what to say about something I'm not sure occurred or not . . . but I, once again, enjoyed the ride!Oh, this is by and far his most humorous book to date.Still, stay away from the audio reading which has some diviations, though minor, from the text, and are read in a monotone voice that does no justice to the characters.

Eventually we realized our disconnect; for him a well-turned lyric makes a great song, while for me the emotional content of the music is most important.I am sure my friend would recommend Mason and Dixon; it is full of well-turned phrases, quirky allusions, and imaginative set pieces.For me, the literary equivalent of music is a fresh perspective on the physical world or human existence. Mason and Dixon has none that I could find. A well-turned phrase that makes me think about the world differently is a masterpiece; a well-turned phrase that is just a cute allusion to pop culture leaves me with nothing.If I want to spend a few hours entertained, but left with no insights, I can watch sit-coms. Just because the gags are about the hollow earth theory does not make them any more than just gags.I challenge any fan to give even one insight about life or the universe that they gleaned from Mason and Dixon.

Here are my remarks so far:For a non-native speaker (I am Dutch) the English Pynchon employs, although seemingly authentic, is rather difficult. But once you're in the style, it's ok. And I have read weirder English anyway (Canterbury Tales in 'Old English' and Finnegan's Wake - some pages at least).I like the tale, and I like all those bizarre anecdotes, that, like rumours or crazy stories, hang around for a while and are then forgotten..And, although it is fiction, this book, I like it's historical plot with seemingly authentic behaviour of 18th century Englishmen."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"It's sort of a given at this point, that if you're not a devoted Pynchon fanatic, you'll never make it very far beyond &quot;Lot 49&quot; -- it's almost gastronomic in nature: if you have a weak stomach, don't gorge on blowfish liver...That said, MASON &amp; DIXON may be TP's most rewarding novel, and after his silence these past years, it finds him returning to form with a new sort-of tongue-in-cheek self-consciousness -- what is the sound of Thomas-Pynchon-writing-a-Thomas-Pynchon? Rather like a Road Runner cartoon with an IQ of 180, funny as hell, the humor black as espresso, and entirely too aware of its own cleverness. But he does, in fact, step subtly beyond his own previously established boundaries here, at the end (deaths) especially, and there are certain passages where he outdoes himself prosewise, notably the Quebecoise Jesuits/Wolf of Jesus episode -- the language reaches a denser, more fantasmically playful-lyrical pitch than ever before...Otherwise, it's a Pynchon book, for sure: as frustrating as it is rewarding.

My interest in this book originated from my childhood after hearing all the family stories of the Dixon clan from my Grandmother and following her death in 1984 inheriting some family heirlooms relating to the Dixons, i.e. we have the original compass that was used to draw the line between north and south America. We even had the stained glass window presented to Jeremiah from Captain Cook on his return to the North East of England after completing the line. Jeremiah Dixon was not the only famous Dixon however and many of his successors have a prestigious heritage, for example Cleopatras Needle which now stands on the banks of the Thames in London, England was transported by boat in a watertight capsule by a Dixon, which was quite a feat in those days. Other achievements included the invention of gas lighting in a house, even though this particular Dixon never officially became recognised as the inventor as the history books credit someone else many years later. This invention is imprinted in the history books of Cockfield as the experiments were considered too dangerous as this particular Dixon ended up blowing up his house! The first inland railway line was modeled on the original plans by another Dixon who wanted to build a canal. The list is endless and I digress. Anyway my Great Grandfather started to write a book on the history of the Dixon family but died before he could finish it. I have decided to finish the book that he started, this has involved me trawling through many graveyards looking for family members and trawling through many public libraries. So if any publishers read this I am open to offers. Anyway back to the review I found the book to be incredibly well researched and provided you have some patience as I did find it pretty heavy going at the start you will be rewarded with a modern masterpiece. I found it fascinating and has been an invaluable source for my own book. Read it you wont regret it!"},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"This book read like a textbook. I spent about 30-60 minutes each reading session reading only about 20 pages and yet realizing that I could only concentrate hard enough to understand perhaps 50% of what I read, I came away with the distinct feeling that I had read one of the greatest books ever written by a mortal!! Several passages and stories were positively devilish...his critique of America was ultimately devastating, paritcularly his views on slavery. His incredibly thick prose was an intellectual challange to absorb and I enjoyed every minute trying to do so!!! All in all an awesome read and a true project for the mind. It ain't Oprah!"},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"I am only halfway through Mason &amp; Dixon; a too-busy teaching schedule prevents me from reading much at a sitting. And yet, that's perfect for me, because I have an opportunity to savor the language and the artistry of the writing. I confess that Pynchon is my favorite author, one whom I would long dreamed of meeting (or meet in the afterlife, along with Shakespeare, Goethe, Chekhov and all of the Greek tragedians and comedians). This most recent novel continues to give me what I expect as a reader (postmodern or otherwise) of his work. As for talking dogs and English pizza, are they any less likely than the presence of Pig Bodine or Tyrone Slothrop in Pynchon's world? How perfect that Martha Washington serves munchies, or Ben Franklin leads an electrified Dance of Death. When any author sets a novel or play in a past era, he or she is commenting, not only on that era, but his or her own. And so there are no anachronistic elements in the narrative, woven with delicious turns of phrase and deadly (and hilarious) puns. At times I stop and laugh aloud at Pynchon's stlyistic choices, while never leaving the narrative behind. If only we had more writers of this ability in a world over-populated with romance novelists with multiple nom de plumes!"},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"The author who is able to convey the humanity within galaxies and electrons alike, is now just being cute."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"I've not reviewed a book in about 30 years, but I thought it was time to say something about Pynchon's latest effort: It's great! Pynchon, perhaps the loopiest modern fictioneer we have since Alfred Bester, and whose style he mirrors effortlessly, has gone back to his roots where Thurn &amp; Taxis battles Tristereo and the Herrero Division of the SS trundles V-2s around the shattered German countryside. He takes the reader on a grand jaunt(e) from Capetown to St. Helena to the New World, and introduces him to as delightful a cast of characters as ever Umberto Ecco could have assembled. Pynchon has the ability to explicate and to confound all at once, and he does it in this volume with much wit. It's a pleasure to see the man back in his old haunts again. Mark Schulzinger"},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"Pynchon serves up one of his best and most accessible; he requires a lot of attention and delivers in kind. I particularly enjoyed, and appreciated, his heroes, probably the most endearing, and poignant I can recollect. In typical excellent form he is unafraid of marching the big themes across the page: whither history, the insanity of progress, the madness of grand designs, the wonder of America. Also, he is screamingly funny; I'd forgotten how good he is. I just wish he'd write more...often. I love that he's part of my generation and times, and was reminded of this in particular when I sprinted through his warm remembrance of Richard Farina in a prefatory note to a new edition of BEEN DOWN SO LONG IT LOOKS UP TO ME., which coincidentally has a great Ben Franklin quote in it's opening, \\"I must soon quit the scene..\\""},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"Mason &amp; Dixon is Thomas Pynchon's most mature and compassionate work. Unlike in his other works where the characters are used as pretexts for his themes or jokes, in Mason &amp; Dixon, Pynchon actually cares about the characters. They are people you actually care about by the time you reach the back cover. The normal Pynchon wit are on display here, but, this time around Pynchon finds the time to imbue the characters with some humanity. And we realize that the master is also a master at characterization. Both characters are real people with flaws -- things you can admire and things you can laugh at. Mason, the anemic wine drinker, as opposed to Dixon, the fun-loving beer drinker. Pynchon proves he is the best living writer in English literature."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"Thomas Pynchon's Mason &amp; Dixon is a huge, tough book. It is not beach reading. It is, however, very clearly a masterpiece. Without a single throw away line or phrase, this is a book that requires a lot of attention and, perhaps, some preparation to read. A somewhat satirical novel, written in the peculiar style of 18th novelists such as Fielding, the book presents the reader with a number of challenges: conventions of physical presentation (overuse of capitalization, strange abbreviations and variant spellings), sentence complexity (each sentence can contain such a number of clauses and phrases that one can reach the end and have to reread to figure out what modifies what), density of line (each sentence is packed with allusions, puns, jokes as well as whatever it is ostinsibly about), and subject matter (the plot is pretty straight forward but many of the situations and digressions require the reader to have a knowledge of 18th century literature, science, politics and conventions in order to make sense of what is happening).The story is 'told' by the Rev. Cherrycoke to his twin nephews (named Pitt and Pliney - so they could be called either 'the Elder' or 'the Younger' as one chose) and the narrative's 'point of view' shifts dramatically (and with no warning) so that at times one is 'in' the story and then abruptly back in a room in Philadelphia where the story is being told. You have to pay attention.The book is full of sly humor and outrageous wordplay. Anachronisms abound. In one scene a character is enjoined to avoid the 'hemp' on his travels, but if he must smoke to not inhale. There are strange scenes that seem to defy any reasonable convention. For example, the L.E.D (the 'Learned English Dog'), a dog who can speak, do complex mathematics instantly and figures in a pivotal and unforgetable scene. There are whole sections of the book based on facts of history or aspects of convention that are not explained and require the reader to provide the context. A good example is the section on 'The Ear'. The ear in question was a pretext for Britain going to war on the high seas, but without the correct historical context, the entire surreal section makes no sense.This book, therefore, requires careful attention and, if one has no knowledge of 18th century history and culture, some preparation before starting it. It is one of those books that need to be read slowly - perhaps aloud, almost like an epic poem, so that the resonance between all the allusions and themes can be appreciated. The more one puts into this book the more one will get out of it, but perhaps never get to exhaust all the meanings. I suspect there are doctoral dissertations for decades to be made from this book.Still, despite the complexity and even allowing for sections that might mean nothing if one doesn't have the 'key' to unlocking them, the book works as a travel tale, a 'buddy' story, a revisionist, picaresque, historical novel in which famous characters (Ben Franklin, for instance) make comic or bizarre appearances. Witty, intelligent, sexy, exciting and thought provoking by turns, the book is a pleasure to sink into."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"Mason and Dixon is another epic Pynchonian tale. As many other reviewers have said, it isn't that easy to read. It takes time and patience and a lot of perserverance, but it is definitely worth it. The basic philosophy of the novel is dualism. There are opposing twins of everything - Mason and Dixon themselves; the stories of Mason and Dixon within that told by Rev Cherrycoke; Cherrycoke's relations, Pliny and Pitt, either Elder or Younger; Northern and Southern states of America; the differing philosophies of the Western world and the Eastern world; the differing attitudes of Art and Science (very much of importance in the 18th century); the Romantic and Gothic; the straight man and the comedian; Johnson and Boswell (who appear at the end and who are foreshadowed by Cherrycoke in the Boswellian role); Britain and America; European philosophy versus Native American philosophy; war and peace - the list goes on. A very good article to read on this is Ken Rosenbaum's in the New York Book Review. He saw this dualism as a metaphor of the zeroes and ones that obsess Pynchon: the hot and cold atoms as sorted by the Maxwell's Demon of CL49, the hot and cold states of America divided by Mason and Dixon. And through it they create the perfect &quot;line&quot; that is neither one nor the other, that exists but doesn't really. Pynchon is interested in the difference between the extremes of life, such as noise and silence, light and dark, being and nothingness. Mason and Dixon has apparently been on Pynchon's mind since the 70s, and it is very much a culmination of his life's obsession.We have to search the novel for references and echoes. Look at the cover of the book. I'm sure it cannot be a coincidence that the &quot;&amp;&quot; is the main symbol. Mason and Dixon is about the things that join us and divide us, the &quot;&amp;&quot; between us all. And surely there is an echo in the fact that &quot;Mason&quot;, &quot;Dixon&quot; and &quot;Pynchon&quot; all end in &quot;-on&quot;, and that they line up on the book's spine. Pynchon, with his curious eye for detail and coincidence, could not have ignored that.Like in his other works, Pynchon manages to create a link between his books. They form a great bustling world. Pig Bodine (from V) has an ancestor who appears in Mason and Dixon, and Cherrycoke's descendent appears in Gravity's Rainbow. Characters link in again, forming a total corpus of Pynchonian achievement.Another thing that Rosenbaum's article mentions is the Transit of Venus that takes up a large chunk of the novel (the line-making seems to take ages to come along). Rosenbaum sees this as the Transit of V-ness, as if Pynchon is having another joke on us. He gives it connations that are too detailed to mention here, but should be read by interested readers.I must reiterate that this is not a simple book. It requires work. It took me over a month to read. It is as long as GR. And it is written in an 18th century style, so it is often confusing and distracting. However, it is very funny and up to the usual standard of Pynchonian research. It is highly accurate (you can do your own checking)in the ideas, events and speech (including Mason and Dixon's differing dialects); and the mysterious fact that we know only the date of Dixon's birth allows Pynchon's mind to run riot - he has him flying over Durham with his teacher, walking into bizarre cave structures where everything is upside down, and so on.This is a challenging but highly rewarding philosophical novel, bawdy, 18th century in many ways. It is one of Pynchon's greatest works, and although people are always wary to classify a work so soon, I believe it can be located quite happily next to GR."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"This thing sat on my shelf, half-read for the longest time. Only the notice of the upcoming release this November of Pynchon's next got me motivated enough to dig into it again. It's not that it isn't brilliant. No one else around can dazzle you with so much wit and wonder. The first encounter with the talking dog is as magical as anything you'll ever read.And it's not like this is the only Pynchon novel that takes some effort to get into. There are plenty of folks who have had to to take a couple cracks at V or Gravity's Rainbow before catching the wave.But Mason and Dixon is a lot of work, if for no other reason than the effort it takes dealing with the mid-18th century prose style. (Can you imagine the effort it took to produce it?) John Barth's Sotweed Factor is similar, and yet somehow infinitely more accessible (and highly recommended!). Pynchon's gift for rapid exposition is not necessarily suited to the constraint on verbal glibness. Especially in a work this voluminous.And yet the darn thing is consistently challenging, if one has the patience and energy to put into it. It seemed to me that the beginning and ending were the best parts, but this could very well have everything to do to the enthusiasm one brings to a new book, and the emotional satisfaction one gain's when reaching towards the conclusion. One thing for sure, for once Pynchon truly has plotted out and delivers a conclusion worthy of the whole work, as opposed to suddenly rushing out a trap door and leaving the reader in a state of suspension (which of course is also one of the many delights of his first three novels). This time one gets the sense that the author has a good deal of affection for his featured players.This book is a great as you want it to be, if you're willing to work at it. I'm just looking forward to the next one being a little more nimble. (Meanwhile, I've got a couple months to see if I can make more of a dent into The Recognitions.)"},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"People are always making Pynchon out ot be difficult, as if they won a medal for finishing each of his books. Yes, you have to be willing to think to read Pynchon's stuff, and yes, it is worth the effort, if you enjoy being challenged when you read. If you want light fair, don't bother.This book is a quest, you need to come armed with patience, a sense of humor and a good memory. The reward is that you will a have a hundred, maybe a thousand wonderful questions to ponder other than what you are going to have for dinner.The Mason Dixon line is more than a boundary. It asks you about what happens when you throw a diverse group of people into a wilderness and what they make and are making out of it. Don't get caught up in the historical stuff, Pynchon's themes go beyond their setting. Although there is much to laugh at in the more human portrayal of some of our forefathers. They are simply a jumping off point.If the size scares, just look at it as two or three books together. Don't be afraid, break it down and enjoy."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"I have mixed feelings about Thomas Pynchon and, more specifically, \\"Mason & Dixon.\\" There's simply no argument that Pynchon is excessively erudite; he's a master stylist and a creative storyteller--although the \\"plot\\" of any of his novels seems almost beside the point.In \\"Mason & Dixon,\\" Pynchon follows our two heroes as they travel the seas to observe the transit of Venus and then inland through the American colonies to establish the border between Pennsylvania and Maryland. On the cusp bridging the Era of Phantoms and the Age of Reason, they meet historical figures (Benjamin Franklin, George Washington) and fanciful ones, including a robotic duck that jealously (and invisibly) pursues a French chef.Mason and Dixon themselves are probably the most fully realized characters Pynchon has ever presented--and nowhere are their contrasting and complementary personalities more apparent than in various set pieces when they, say, argue over tea (\\"Well, it's disgusting, isn't it?\\") and coffee (\\"How is it that of each Pot of Coffee, only the first cup is ever worth drinking,--and that, by the time I get to it, someone else has already drunk it?\\"). Many of the famous historical figures, too, are sweetly buffoonish or loutish, but most of the supporting characters are often hard to distinguish from each other--particularly the vast riffraff that accompany the astronomers on their journeys through American soil. (The most notable exception is the domineering and certainly deranged Nevil Maskelyne, with whom Mason is stuck on an island for one of my favorite sections in the book.)There are also some funny Terry Gilliam-style bits scattered throughout the book, such as a recurring gag referencing Pope Gregory XIII's calendar reform of 1752 (\\"Stealing eleven days? Can that be done?\\") and a conversation between two clocks over the tricks--and the ticks--of their trade (\\"They share a Tremolo of amusement\\"). I'll concede that there is much pleasure in unexpectedly laughing out loud while wrestling with the book's arcane allusions and hidden meanings, yet I often suspected that if you were to strip away the veneer of historical references, literary allusions, and faux-eighteenth-century prose, then you would be left with the kind of daft humor available most late nights on Nickelodeon.During the nearly three months I spent on \\"Mason & Dixon,\\" I never once was able to sit down and actually read it. I labored through it and struggled with it, looked up unexplained (and sometimes inexplicable) historical and astronomical references, thumbed backwards to find bits I'd either missed or forgotten. And this isn't a book you can read unaccompanied by background materials. I spent a good couple of hours brushing up on the lineage of the various British Astronomers Royal, the history of the boundary dispute, the Paxton Boys and the Conestoga Massacre, and the creation of the cartographic curiosity known as the Wedge (don't ask). The work-to-pleasure ratio for this volume would not make good betting odds.And now, several months later, I'm surprised by how little I remember. It's the same letdown I experience after completing the Sunday Times crossword puzzle: I won't recall many of the clues or the answers several days hence. In sum, there are 750 pages of dense, difficult material to be found here--an astounding parlor exercise gone mad. I was (and am) daunted and awed by the achievement, by the cleverness, by the consistency in tone. While I don't regret any of the time I spent with the book, when all is said and done I can't say I ever cared enough about Mason, Dixon, or any of their friends to make the book itself as memorable as the euphoria of actually finishing it."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"'Tis with great Pleasure I recommend this thoroughly diverting volume to the subscribers to this Electronick Notice-board. The Author is Mr Tho. Pynchon, esq., responsible for such Well Known and Esteem'd works as, Gravity's Rainbow & The Crying of Lot 49 - with which, along with the book in question, this Philosophickally-minded scribe has attempt'd to compose a sort of Alternative History of the American continent; a History comprising events of a simultaneously edifying and pleasing nature, that serves as an Interrogation of the commonly-held Assumptions regarding the course of Events through which we, be we agents or mere puppets, hurtle thro' towards our fates, as 'twere, backwards. Mr P's themes are myriad - yet, mindful of the Convenience of the bustling would-be purchaser, hecktored at from all sides in this ethereal Tropickal Marketplace, the humble Reviewer will attempt to delineate some of the more prominent among 'em - viz. the growing friendship of the Odd Couple, Mason and Dixon (or, Dixon and Mason) - a prototype, as 'twere, of the sundry comedic duos that will grace the Cinematograph in Modern Times; the arbitrary formation of boundary-lines, National and provincial (the chief personages being employ'd as Surveyors); the observance of divers Astronomickal Phenomena - or, the dance of the Stars; the birth of the Republic - Liberty, the Pursuit of Happiness, Conspickuous Consumption &c.; Sea-voyages and engagements; a sojourn in Cape-Town (where, it must be admitted, the reprehensible Nature of the practices of the Dutch settlers puts a certain set to one's jaw); a remarkably articulate Prophetick canine; an Automatick Duck of Gallic origin, who amorously pursues a noted - yet now unfortunate and harried - Parisian Gastronome to the wilds of Pennsylvania; the capacity of the dearly departed - or even the violently dispatch'd - to haunt our Oneiric Hours; the inhalation of Narcotick substances - being Hemp, provided gratis by one Geo. Washington, of Virginia - and the subsequent development of a voracious appetite for any consumables Whatsoe'er; and the excess consumption of beverages, snuff, and News in riotous coffee-houses. With such variety of Life spread out before the Reader, what excuse will he make for not ordering this item immediately, on Credit?"},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"Mason & Dixon is a book about conflict--between man and nature, master and slave, science and religion, quaker and presbyterian, and, of course, between Mason (running away from tragedy and worried about life) and Dixon (ever seeking new adventures and hopelessly cheerful). The conflicts Pynchon draws out bisect populations, just as borders are drawn between states. The enlightenment--the application of science broadly to all areas of life--made accurate border drawing possible, and I think what we see here is the germ of contemporary enlightenment bashing, which is, I think, the origin of the current political climate in the U.S., popularly termed \\"Red vs. Blue\\" by pundits.Those individuals who hate the surveyors for their work still exist today, but Pynchon makes it clear that this is not just about \\"Red\\" vs. \\"Blue\\" America. The conflicts are much deeper and cannot be neatly categorized into two armed camps. We have all of the groups today that claim allegiance to Red and Blue--gun owners, religious fanatics, scientists, politicians, businessmen, and the underclass--but Pynchon's gift is that he weaves these groups into one America, not two, that have more in common with each other than not, and whose differences make a dizzyling wonderful tapestry possible. There is almost too much conflict to make a neat border drawing possible. Is that why everyone hates the line they're drawing?As a book, M&D; is probably the best piece of fiction written in the 1990s. It is ironic that Cold Mountain, which won the NBA in 1999, is a book about the same kind of journey--east to west through a conflicted land--but takes place 100 years later. Cold Mountain was a romantic novel, far more accessible to readers, one which Dixon might have enjoyed but Mason most definitely would have scorned.Give this book your time, and read it with the aid of Google on a nearby computer and maps of South Africa, Pennsylvania and Maryland. If you give it your diligence and passion, it will return in a hundred fold."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"There is no longer any point in being defensive about Pynchon. I personally don't have any doubt that, on the strengths of &quot;Gravity's Rainbow&quot; and to a slightly lesser extent &quot;The Crying of Lot 49&quot;, he is the greatest living novelist working in the English language, for what that's worth. These books are no more demanding than the average Jacobean tragedy. Which, really, isn't very much.The rewards of Pynchon have always outweighed the difficulties, anyway. &quot;Mason &amp; Dixon&quot; is perhaps the foundling child of the rumour, current in the 80s, that Pynchon was writing a novel about the Civil War. He ended up giving us &quot;Vineland&quot;, his frothiest work, which isn't to say that it's not haunted by malevolent spectres of Nixon and Reagan. &quot;Mason &amp; Dixon&quot; probably demands some vague acquaintance with 18th century fiction, in order to see what Pynchon is getting at stylistically, but really, guys, they're on the shelf at bargain prices, and if you haven't read 'em by now ... Gawd help you.I use the word &quot;mellow&quot; because this seems to me to be a sadder and more tolerant Pynchon at work. (It may only seem that way cause he's older, and we expect this kind of thing from a Late Style, but nevertheless...I'll get back to you on it when I've read it again.) He manages to combine a mischievous sense of the contemporary with a feel for the America-before-America that seems somehow right, even if I don't know how. A good example is the episode where the stuffy Mason and the goofy Dixon pay a call on Colonel George Washington, who happens to be smoking a pipe filled with some substance or other; the three of them promptly get the munchies, and call upon the servants for some eats. Or the bit when a blue-bespectacled Benjamin Franklin plays a glass harmonica in a chophouse, thereby presaging the phenomenon of the DJ. Or the scene where the pizza is invented. And so on.What's surprising and new about the book is Pynchon's (apparent) uncomplicated fondness for his two heroes. Mason, pious, middle-class, respectable and socially ambitious - southern English to a T - is forever being embarrassed by the blunt, wide-eyed, Northern Dixon. It's almost as though he sees future silent comedy duos in this unlikely partnership. The book is endlessly cheeky, but it has a beating heart, and the heart is in the relationship of the eponymous surveyors. The closing pages are amongst the most haunting and straightforwardly moving that he has ever written - and yet, in them, there is still a tragic awareness of how American history is going to turn out...Yes, it's &quot;picaresque&quot;, which is to say that it doesn't exactly have a swift, economical plot and isn't exactly unencumbered by digressions. But these are part of the pleasures of literature, or at least they were until the recent craze for the novel that you read in order to be able to say that you've read it. &quot;Mason &amp; Dixon&quot; does not yield all its splendours in one go. Few good novels do. Hang on - make that _no_ good novels. Nabokov always said that you never really read a novel, you only reread it - meaning that if you get it all in the first reading, it probably wasn't worth writing. Pynchon took classes from Nabokov, and this lesson sunk in.The man is still the greatest, at least in my mother tongue. (Though I'll wave a small flag with John Berger's name on it, just because I can.) I just finished this book, and I look forward to a time when I've forgotten what it's like, so that I can read it again."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"This book is the best &quot;historical fiction&quot; I have ever read, and one of the most &quot;accurate&quot; accounts of the American colonial effort as well. But it's neither &quot;historical fiction&quot; in the conventional sense, nor is it even remotely accurate in any sense.But the nut of the matter is there. The overarching themes of the novel play off competing sets of human beliefs-- feng shui versus astronomy, the conceits of Enlightenment reason versus pre-Renaissance superstition and naturalism (animism... etc...). Together, according to Pynchon, these forces shaped Early America the Grand Enterprise.The big bad brilliant part is that, although obviously taking considerable license with anything he wants, Pynchon has leveled a dead-on critique of the history of that early America. Just look at what he keeps returning to regarding the tense, fraught situations that Mason and Dixon repeatedly encounter sparked by race and slavery, &quot;indians,&quot; the Paxton Boys, and the chicanery and plagarism apparently favored by the Founding Fathers.This mix has Pynchon angrier than I've ever seen him at the pettiness and evil that people do (see the episode at the slave auction, the rising menace that accompanies the drawing of the West Line), and funnier too (Benny Franklin and his cheap parlor tricks).(C'mon! I've always gotten the sense that Ben Franklin wrote most of his Autobiography with tongue in cheek, that he knew most of what he was saying was demonstrably no good, and it's gratifying to my ego to see Pynchon pursue a similar thread here.)Popeye!! The munchies!! The Corner of Delaware and Maryland and New Jersey as Nowhere!! Yes!!!

On a basic level, MASON & DIXON is about the experiences of these surveyors before, during, and after this plum professional assignment.In a way, this linear activity is the trunk of this novel's narrative tree. Meanwhile, the offshoot branches are the chapters (there are 78 in all). These are whatever Pnychon wants them to be. For example:o Chapter 33 shows Mason, Dixon, and their crew on the job. This is a whistle-while-we work interval and captures Mason and Dixon as hard working professionalso Chapter 35 has hilarious moments with pre-revolutionary Americans, just like their descendants, in impassioned discussion about real estate.o Chapter 45 is a meditation on a mechanical duck (introduced in chapter 37), to which people attribute the inexplicable.o Chapter 54 is a caricature of a romance novel, which turns disturbing and dark and then circles back to illuminate the melancholy Mason, who mourns his deceased wife.Like every chapter in MASON & DIXON, each of these is very well done, with the Pynch often reaching out or doubling back to some narrative point that pulls everything together in the chapter's final lines. This is no-net fiction with no wasted words, even with the novel's quasi-eighteenth century style.At the same time, this structure doesn't generate much narrative momentum. Instead, I read MASON & DIXON as interlocked stories, with certain chapters (those featuring Benjamin Franklin and George Washington, for example) adding very little--except wackiness--to the flow.As a result, I'd say this book is more about the ingenuity and narrative skills of Pynchon than it is about his characters. Indeed, I was constantly aware of the Pynch, ringmaster extraordinaire, as he introduces the clowns, the lion tamer, the human cannonball, and so on. In MASON & DIXON, Pynchon is in the middle of everything.

It was Heraclitus who argued that opposites are one in reality; Pynchon's fiction seeks out the 'excluded middle', those zones of ambiguity which our world flattens out and levels down into blank facticity. Mason & Dixon bursts with energy, wit, fecundity of imagination and linguistic mastery. It may lack the despair and anger of Pynchon's masterpiece, Gravity's Rainbow, yet there is a warmth and tenderness, a genuine lyricism to this book.

You don't wander into Pynchon casually, and so it was with all motors on that I approached this reworking of the Mason Dixon line. In the end, it isn't my favourite Pynchon story, and somehow, Mark Knopfler got the story across better in the 5 minute &quot;Sailing to Philadelphia&quot; than Pynchon does in this sprawling, somewhat messy and incongruous book.Maybe it was the odd-ball juxtapositions of robotics, animated talking dogs, just stuff that sometimes felt like distractions for the sake of distractions. There is quite a story at work here, as the human mind comes face to face that something other always eludes its analysis. I've always thought of Pynchon as a novelist exploring the phenomenology of Heidegger and the mysticism of both the ancient Greeks as well as the East. That surfaces at times, particulalrly when the friendship between Charlie Mason and Jeremiah Dixon strains under the pressures of their commissions.But where GRAVITY'S RAINBOW dealt explicitly with the topics of BEING AND TIME, and VINELAND delivered the passion of THE QUESTION CONCERNING TECHNOLOGY, there seems a mess of all sorts of ideas here in this book that just don't seem to hold my attention.GRAVITY and VINELAND were absolute page turners for me. I failed to show up for work once I began those stories. This one was an effort. It might be me. Perhaps I've gone past this particular style. Or perhaps, more tragically, this is just style. This too has fallen to the pull of whatever literary gravity comes with being Thomas Pynchon.LOT 49 and V and SLOW LEARNER all seemed to be benchmarks on the way. And in all honesty, LOT 49 might well be the story of Neil Young and Crazy Horse, but whatever, they were the vapor trails of a spirit in trajectory. This one has fallen like a Scud in western Pennsylvania. The human factor got lost in the gizmos and Deus ex machinas crowding the background for screen time, like so many Catherine Zeta Jones.Maybe the next one will........ well, who knows, better to just see what happens......."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"As a fan of Pynchon's previous^M books such as GRAVITY'sRAINBOW, I was disappointed in this book. I saw no need for thearchaistic language, with the capitalization of every noun--why strive for this sort of &quot;accuracy&quot; when on the other hand you have such obviously parodic, postmodern devices such as the narrator being called Wicks Cherrycoke and George Washington speaking in Yiddish? There is an inconsistency here which suggests that Pynchon, once so footlose in the Sixties and Seventies, has become dutiful and academic, wanting to do the &quot;rifght thing.&quot; Pynchon's speculations about surveying and the relationship between &quot; the Line&quot; and Enlgihtenment scientific mastery are interesting, but more in a &quot;learned&quot; way than in a way that would appeal to your typical reader of fiction. Pynchon is as good a writer as any alive today, but this book, though obviously well-researched and admirably serious, lacks greatness."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"I've never read Pynchon before, and after wading through this monstrosity, I don't plan on reading him again any time soon. I absolutely despise this attempt at an 18th century novel. The language, spellings, and vocabulary are fairly true to time, but as any author who attempts to write a book in the style of another era is often just off the mark, so is Pynchon. It reads as pretentious rather than authentic. What could be a great tale is completely convoluted with talking dogs and other anachronistic happenings. I know Pynchon fans everywhere will want to lynch me, but if you are not a Pynchon fan, don't bother reading this. It's too long. Even if you are a fan of 18th c novels, as I am, you will probably find it difficult to get into."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"liked it some more, and then it kept going. It has passages that are hilarious and moving, and then well, something else happens: something bizarre that's described for a few pages - a glowing Indian, a talking dog - and then disappears, never to be mentioned again. What holds the book together is the wonderfully engaging personalities of Mason and Dixon, but they don't hold it together enough. It's just a stitched together collection of anecdotes, many of them brilliant set pieces but some of them just tiresome, because there's only so many mechanical ducks that can fall from the sky before I start losing my patience. Actually, the duck is great, but still, over 700 pages, not everything can hold one's attention. A picaresque only works if the adventures seem to be building towards something, for example if they keep showing new sides of the characters involved, or have a logic that ties them together that I can't see in Mason & Dixon - like the second half of Don Quixote where all the characters have read the first part, and so on. This book just kept going."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"If this guy is not absolutely brilliant. Holy smaokes, I can't believe this literature exists - it is so exquisite, the fact a publisher could get past it's surface to see GENIUS is awesome.

Or rather, a child who falls asleep on Christmas Eve wishing for a Unicorn, only to wake up with a Horned Aequs in her living room, a big ribbon and bow atop the twisted opalecent ornament.I am not a fraction of Him That Is Pynchon. That type of Dickensian imagery fills every paragraph. You gotta like that kind of stuff to enjoy it. It is work trying to read it, but worth every moment. If you spend 5 minutes understanding a paragraph, you will love the Moment Of Comprehension. The fact that the book is a whopping 700+ pages is daunting - but if you love this type of lit, you'll view it as a lifetime of enjoyment. Savor each page.

I am going through all of Pynchon's novels chronologically right now, and this was my least favorite of the bunch.Pynchon seems to have 2 stylistic forms: a straightforward narrative (Crying of Lot 49, Vineland) and a multi-layered, semi-rambling complex of plots and sub-plots with numerous characters (V, Gravity's Rainbow). Mason & Dixon obviously falls in the latter category, but falls short IMHO. You don't really care about the characters. It's not as funny. And while he usually ties up just a few loose ends, here almost all the plots and sub-plots are left without endings. Plus the motives for the characters were not as captivating. You care about Tyrone Slothrop and Oedipa Maas because they were put into situations that compelled them (and you) to find out what was going on. Here, Mason & Dixon were assigned a job, so they did it and then went home. I could've seen the same plot on Bob the Builder.The writing style was, surprisingly, not a problem for me. Neither was the countless historical references. My love for Pynchon's other books makes me feel I'm missing something, so any comments would be greatly appreciated. I'd suggest getting Crying of Lot 49 first, then Gravity's Rainbow to experience Pynchon at his best."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"You don't read this book, you live it. Perfectly laid out in his post-modern style, it was emminently refreshing to see the 1700's infused with the postmodern. By far his best work. Although thick of width, and thick in word, it is by far his most emotional and heart felt novel, while at the same time having that edge of his humor present. It makes you think. It makes you wonder. What more can I say?"},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"At best, Pynchon is difficult reading. Sometimes I think that he prides himself on literay obfuscation. That notwithstanding, this is a truly wonderful book, totally alive, incredibly humerous (when one is able to get it) and rich with the cultural manifestations of a facscinating historical era. The characters, particularly the protagonists are portrayed in lifelike detail, and the odd philosophical ramblings are infused with insight. Fully worth the effort of deciphering."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"Mason &amp; Dixon is one of the most magnificent novels I have read in years, for this reason: it awed me that prose so powerfully rapturous could be created by a particular arrangement of a few thousand words of the English language. So I read this book mainly for the simple beauty of the text--Pynchon outdid himself in that regard.While I am not denying the importance of Gravity's Rainbow on modern American literature, Mason &amp; Dixon is just more FUN to read. It has all that is cerebrally Pynchon--I don't mean to downplay those aspects at all--but you don't need a BA in Literature to love it. It's the desert island book for me!"},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"Pynchon has returned to his earlier form in terms of syntax and structure, forcing his reader to focus on every sentence instead of on, as he did in VINELAND, the more general aspects of plot and character. The result is a classical engagement with his prose, a deep attention to every word. This is demanding and rewarding work, but the story itself, and its manifold subplots, are often hilarious. Pynchon remains one of the great writers of our time."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"Perhaps the best book I have ever read: funny, poignant, cerebral, touching, delaing with the full gamut of human emotion. A work of genius."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"Mason &amp; Dixon, Thomas Pynchon's latest dive into the complexities of literature, shows that the old Pynchon from the Gravity's Rainbow days is back in full force with that &quot;nervous anarchist&quot; energy that he is so well known for. If you enjoy reading books like &quot;Slaughterhouse 5&quot; by Kurt Vonnegut or &quot;Next: A Poetic Odyssey&quot; by Lee Frank, you will also enjoy this new novel by Pynchon."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"A good follow up after Gravity's Rainbow. An almost conventional like novel, an answer to those who think Pynchon doesn't know what he's writing about, ie, to be 'normal' he has to go back into a pastiche of an 18th century novel! An intelligent, funny and warm read. Don't miss it."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"This book, while as erudite amd complex as all his others, I enjoyed greatly in part because I understood most of the jokes this time around (but then I probably still missed a fair amount). Familiar as I am with his other works, I was able to stick with this massive tome and glean a lot from it. I wouldn't recommend it as a person's introduction to Pynchon by any means but I do think it's very good. Maybe not as playful as &quot;Gravity's Rainbow&quot; but that's OK. As far as the &quot;old English&quot; style it's narrated in, it doesn't matter whether it's historically accurate but rather that he imitated it, parodied it, if you will. &quot;Mason &amp; Dixon&quot; took me a considerable time to get through (mainly because I'm also a student) but I'm glad I stuck with it. A good feeling of accomplishment and rewarding in the end."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"I disliked this book a lot at first; in fact, I almost wrote an ugly review here. But then I sat and thought about it for a while, and did some critical reading and decided to undertake the whole thing again. It's a lot easier the second time around (although that's not saying very much, I guess). More importantly, with a clearer understanding of what (I think) he was trying to do, the book was both more understandable and more enjoyable. Still, I wonder at times if he isn't just being difficult for the sake of being difficult.But then, why SHOULD things always be easy?Anyway, the essay on &quot;Mason &amp; Dixon&quot; in the New York Review of Books really helped me to clarify my thoughts about the novel. I would recommend reading it, perhaps even before you go at the book itself."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"Mason &amp; Dixon is a difficult novel, but well worth the effort. The old English style takes a little while to get used to, but after 75 or 100 pages you realize that you wouldn't want it any other way. It is funny, and clever, and it has a real heart. I enjoyed Gravity's Rainbow and The Crying of Lot 49, but this was the first time I felt emotionally touched by a Pynchon novel. The friendship that slowly develops between the two main characters is a beautiful thing.Perhaps the best compliment I can pay is that, upon reading the last line, I very nearly flipped back to page one and started over again.Wonderful."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"I loved it. The relationship between Mason &amp; Dixon is one of those classic Captian Kirk/Mr. Spock or Aubery/Materin type mismatched friendships. There is a serious and profound underlying theme about the effects of slavery on the psyche of the slave owners. But most of all I just loved reading the blend of imaginary and real, the mix of slapstick and seriousness, the made-up language a la &quot;Clockwork Orange&quot;. The whole concoction is amazing and wonderful."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"I had almost given up on Pynchon. The early promise of V. and The Crying of Lot 49 seemed to get shipwrecked with Gravity's Rainbow (excessively wierd and confusing), and Vineland (ditto, with nary a likeable character). Mason &amp; Dixon solves all the problems of Pynchon's earlier work, while retaining, even distilling, all the goofy genius that makes him lovable.What sets Mason &amp; Dixon apart from its predecessors is Pynchon's deep, kindly sympathy for his characters, especially the two protagonists, while not sparing them any of his rapier wit. This new-found ability of Pynchon's puts him in the select company of novelists like Jane Austen, Dickens, or Proust. With this latest novel, Pynchon finally deserves inclusion in such rarefied ranks.In fact, I'll go out on a limb and just say it: Mason &amp; Dixon may be the finest novel ever written by an American of any period. Read it, not because you should, but because you will be very glad you did."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"Pynchon is never easy to read...but the deeper you dig into his prose, the more you come away with. Mason & Dixon is no exception, but I was looking for something with the intensity and poetry of earlier works, notably Gravity's Rainbow , V, and (even) Vineland.If you haven't read any Thomas Pynchon, Gravity's Rainbow is definitely the Pynchon book to start with...it's generally recognized as a 20th century masterpiece...and it's more rewarding than Mason & Dixon in my view.In this age of synthetic Block Buster Krap, greedy agents, movie deals, et.alia, it is wonderful to see that a gifted author can still get published. Thomas Pynchon is a unique force in American Literature and his prose is unrivaled in depth and quality. You will find long passages equal to his earlier works, but not so much of the profound moral outrage, power, and brilliant characterizations that are in Gravity's Rainbow and V.If you love Pynchon you will enjoy Mason & Dixon but don't expect the heartbreaking color and fire of his earlier works.That being said..Mason & Dixon is still a better novel than 99.9% of the garbage out there. Lose youself in the quirky eighteenth century argot and the weird, uncanny world of Pynchon and (slowly, painstakingly) enjoy a great work by a serious artist."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"As huge as this book is, I remember everything and still chuckle over what I remember. Don't try to read it all at once though. Take a few months and keep returning to it. It is the novel of a wiser, older Pynchon - where the aggressive experimentation of Gravity's Rainbow has given way to a deeper, subtler, immensely more subversive style that does not however, appear so at first glance.In the first place, the novel is MADLY funny! What makes it so hilarious I think, is the combination of 18th c. prose and a very NON-18th c. awareness of the contradictions inherent in the white supremacist project of colonizing, enslaving, segregating, cataloguing, naming and dominating the world and its peoples. Mason and Dixon stop at various colonial outposts - South Africa, Sumatra et al, and everywhere, Pynchon is commenting on precisely these themes.This novel offers all the pleasures of the 18th c. picaresque novel - ribald humour, a tendency to linger among docks, ports, sailor's 'establishments', seedy pubs and other very non-bourgeois places, a great big rambling voyage with all manner of interesting adventures along the way, and that wonderful Tristam Shandian and also utterly Pynchonesque prose style - full of dashes and exclamations and free associating sentences running into pages.This novel is sort of like a great big feast where whatever your tastes are, you can have your pick and go away with something that pleases."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"I am an English reader who hasn't read any of Pynchon's previous works, and am an occasional visitor to North Eastern USA. For me this was a rewarding book: rambling, yes, but enjoyable for the ride. As an avid collector of obscure facts, historical and scientific, I found plenty of intellectual treats along the way. As for problems with talking dogs, ducks and golems, perhaps more sceptical readers can take comfort in the assurance that the whole story is an (imperfect) narration. The narrator (Rev. Cherrycoke)sometimes displays signs of the mania attributed to the characters of his narration. My main criticism is that changes of scene and perspectives are often seemless and may confuse the unwary reader. I certainly don't think the book would ever have been published if it were a a first novel, so I'm glad Pynchon is 'establishhed' enough to be able to write such entertaining, complex and imaginative material. After Pynchon's (fictional) gloss I won't be able to think of George and Martha Washington and of Benjamin Franklin in quite the same way!"},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"If you're a Pynchon fanatic, you bought this whenit was released. If you're not, you might as well start here. Part of the beauty of the book is figuring out the anachronisms and mentally translating the period colloquialisms throughout the novel. Another part of the beauty is trying not to piss in your pants when reading the burlesque sections. Pynchon has written some wonderful slapstick, both pedestrian and complex, in the past, but this book has some of the funniest scenes ever written by anyone. And those scenes are sidelines to the main story.Get a good atlas, some history references (i.e. early colonial American history and British colonial history, e.g. &quot;The Rise and Fall of the British Empire&quot; by Lawrence James), a really comfortable chair, and take a few days off work to fully enjoy. It also helps to not care if people see you cry. I started sniffling about 100 pages from the end since I knew I was close to finishing the book. Then, it got REALLY sad, and I bawled. &quot;Gravity's Rainbow&quot; exhausts you and exhilirates you from its sweeping concordance of conspiracy theories and history; &quot;Mason &amp; Dixon&quot; exhausts you from its sheer beauty, and throws in a little conspiracy and history just to keep you on your toes.For those who've rated the book here and complained about it's complexity, I can only say you need to work on your attention spans. Like all the other Pynchon books (with the exception of &quot;Vineland&quot; and maybe &quot;Lot 49&quot;), you should expect this book to become the central part of your free time for a few days. There are no wasted words or throw-away scenes here. There are sentences so finely constructed that they'll force you to re-read them several times, and there are chapters so dense that you'll wish you'd majored in history. Even the page numbers seem steeped in meaning after about 1/3 of the book."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"I just finished reading this book and think it's extraordinary. There is a New York Times review that includes the phrase\\"...the author shows a magical ability to dwell effortlessly in the past...\\"This statement, to me, perfectly sums up the overall effect of the novel.As with any Pynchon novel, there are a lot of details - technical, historical, manners of speech, etc. Additionally, the author must stick to the main story, so the digressions are not as severe as I've seen before, or at least they are not so profuse as to prevent the reader from making it back to the main story (I believe it's the Line that forces Pynchon to adhere to some measure of linearity). However, the digressions are one of the things that makes Pynchon such an incredible author. As the quote points out, I am sure that I've never had a novel transport me to a place/time quite the way this novel does. Even the prose is reminiscent of 18th century writings (I will admit that I have not come across this type of writing in its exact form when reading old books, so I am making a guess that Pynchon created this type of writing, albeit with a heavy influence from 18th century literature).As far as the lingo in this book goes, I won't try to pretend like I understood every word, every reference or even every detail. But the writing is rich enough to allow me to understand almost every scene in the book. I'm sure there are a lot of small pieces, here and there, that I didn't get. It's a complex masterpiece that can probably only be fully understood in a college class devoted to just this one book. It should be stated that, after every chunk of the book I read, I went on the internet to look up a bevy of strange words, unknown places and people, and events. As a history lesson, I've never read a book that has given me more information, or demanded from me more study. I learned a great deal of history that is not found in school textbooks.A brief synopsis of the novel...The first portion of the book deals with the transit of Venus, where Mason and Dixon take down the times when Venus starts to move into the path of the sun (the ingress) and then exits (the egress). The scene takes place mostly in Cape Town, South Africa. Besides the actual measurements of the transit, we are treated to a story that describes Mason and Dixon's time there, the people of the Cape, slavery and details of that area - as well as the beliefs and ways of thought of both Mason and Dixon. It's here that we get a general overview of how the two men are - Mason a melancholic and Dixon a more enjoyable and lighthearted person. Dixon's overall way about himself somehow allows him to connect more readily with the native which inhabit the region, and this also works for him later in the novel when dealing with the Indians in America. We find that Mason, the astronomer, takes some offense when he is referred to as a surveyor (Dixon was a surveyor), but Dixon takes it in stride - maybe at the expense of Mason (like when Dixon is referred to as an astronomer by some folks who consider the two to be the same). Further explored are the feelings that Mason has about his eventual boss Maskelyne. This section takes about 1/5 of the book.Next, the surveyors (well, one was a surveyor) are off to America. This portion of the book probably takes up about 7/10 of the book. Besides the actual construction of the line, a lot of period detail is given. There are an incredible number of side stories here, as well as some interesting embellishments (these I ascribe to the narrator who allows for some Paul Bunyon-like tall tales - but I will admit that there may be purposes in these stories that I don't fully comprehend - and the narrator does mention that history can be fabricated to an extent). For instance, you'll learn about a golem, a robotic duck that poops (the duck was true, but what it does in this novel is embellished), giant vegetables grown by who knows, and a variety of other assorted astonishments. Additionally, Pynchon points out the brutality of America - the slavery, the Indian massacres (and a sad story of a school house massacred by Indians, and another sad story where Indians suffer massacre but with the added humiliation of having no one understand their last words). The Line, as it says, separates evil from good - except for Philadelphia. The Line also has a certain fuzziness in that it does not separate perfectly and indeed, some have moved certain markers for their own use. In all, though, I'm guessing that the Line itself represents a version of Pynchon's idea of entropy - that which grows as time goes by - and even considers going West as into the future, with East the past.The level of complications during the American time are many - political, social, scientific, religious, world views, and more. The discussions between Mason and Dixon are many, and they highlight what each man's views of the real world are about, as well as their own religious and political views. Their differences show the dualism that Pynchon loves so much - these characters are not entirely different, but they are definitely different enough to have radically different ways of viewing the world, religion and politics. Mason and Dixon don't always disagree and, as the novel goes on, the characters start to feel affection, as true friends, for each other.I would say that Mason is a deeper thinker, though not necessarily smarter, than Dixon. Mason's growing-up years are sadder than Dixon's, and I think that points to how they behaved as adults. Dixon seems more pragmatic than Mason, and he has a better sense of humor. Mason seems to blame himself for a lot of things, or at least feel saddened, at both his wife's death and his relationship with his father.The last portion of the book deals with Mason and Dixon's time after America. There is another Venus transit, but the details are not as great as the first transit (Mason's heart is not into this transit and Dixon doesn't seem to have a lot invested either - but Dixon does get a job with the Royal Society from his time with Mason). I'd say that this part of the book more appropriately deals with how Mason and Dixon come to see each other, and cements their friendship.The end of the book works pretty much as I had thought - I'll reveal nothing here except to say that in the past few days my feeling for the book tended towards \\"this book is about their friendship\\", and I was right about that. Heavy meaning is everywhere in the book, and the details provided have no peer in any other author working today, but still, the whole story boils down to a pretty simple idea of friendship.In the end, I will say that I actually felt sad as I read the last page. I spent 2 months reading this book, and I hated the idea of being done with it. I lived with these characters and I came to know them - like no other book I've read before.It's been a long time since I've read \\"Gravity's Rainbow\\", but nonetheless, I'd have to say that I took away more about these characters, and really liked them, than I can remember in \\"Gravity's Rainbow\\". Not to sound heretical or anything like that, but I think this is Pynchon's best work as an author.As I told my girlfriend this evening, now I have to go back to reading \\"ordinary\\" books (although I still have \\"Against the Day\\" and \\"V\\" to read). This level of writing is just not found in books that you read nowadays. It's a difficult book, but the prose is wonderful, and if you do some outside reading, you'll learn a lot.It's an impossible task for me to completely describe this book, but try I have. I would not recommend it as an introduction to someone reading Pynchon (I'd say to read \\"Vineland\\" or \\"Inherent Vice\\" for that), unless that person has read some challenging books in the past. If you are a Pynchon fan, then this book is waiting for you - it's great, complicated, and has more than you'd expect from even Mr. Pynchon."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"Yes, please. Mason and Dixon are probably the most realistic characters Pynchon will ever make. He takes a couple of so-called \\"great men\\" and makes them real. We see the evolution of their ambitions and the tragedy of their actions in their worlds. They come up fast and flash out quickly in their vacillations over what they have done and what they must do. Some of the most memorable passages in all of literature to me are written in this book. The scene with the council working behind the closed doors of the bar was very emotionally distressing in that I read this when the violence of the elections built up to what I saw as as close to a peak as would happen. Death threats against both Obama and McCain wer building up, and as I heard this I was forced to picture the cold, emotionless forces working behind the scenes in inhuman conditions, all meant to put someone's will into the world as reality. This book makes one see the results of one's actions past the simple present. Mason and Dixon both suffer for the rest of their lives under beneath the memories of the separation that they created in the US, corrupting the country in the state's intrusion and oppression of the unknown chaos that had been for a safe, common order. It's a very touching novel, and I will definitely read it again. And again...etc."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"Pynchon's my all-time favorite, but this big paperback has sat on my shelf for years. I am so glad to have finally gotten around to tackling this jaw-dropping masterwork. Perhaps I should wait until I've actually finished it (presently about 3/4 through), but I am enjoying the Ride so much I had to enthuse. Pynchon is a freakin genius. Other reviewers have mentioned some of the comic set-pieces--getting stoned with Col. Washington, the talking English Dog, Felipe the elecric eel and his backup marimba band, etc., but every little detail is sheer delight. The beverage-themed goofy names (Cherrycoke, Redzinger), the historical detail (thanks, 'kipedia!), the stories within stories within stories...wow. One of my favorite little touches: the black-clad young woman from Brooklyn who uses \\"as\\" in the way her counterparts in the present day use \\"like.\\" This is a feast of language, so much fun I almost don't care about its deeper meaning. Which, I do not doubt, lurks there for future \\"smoaking.\\""},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"Thomas Pynchon is not for everyone, and that's certainly fine: his work is literary and inaccessible at that, and Pynchon is by no means worried about carrying a linear plot or depicting accurately the kinds of historical characters that are evoked in this novel--for this not only mocks the &quot;American&quot; novel, the historical novel, and the picaresque, it is essentially a tour-de-force examination of the archetypes that America has based its identity upon. More than that, though, the characters of Mason and Dixon are the most fully-realized characters Pynchon has ever created. By the end of the story they truly live and breathe; I felt in some ways as if I had even known them.Come to think of it, this novel contains the kinds of multitudes that I can't begin to tackle properly in a review; what I will say briefly is that &quot;Mason &amp; Dixon&quot; is a brilliant, funny, lyrical, bawdy, irreverent tale that only re-establishes in my mind any doubt that Pynchon is the best writer in the English language alive. I read that Harold Bloom said that Pynchon was this era's Shakespeare, and if you know anything about Bloom, he puts Shakespeare flat in the center of the canon as we know it. Yes, Pynchon is *that* good."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"I found this to be Pynchon's most entertaining novel, as well as the most accessible. Though it may take readers a couple pages to get used to the narrative style, it soon becomes very smooth. What really amazes is that despite the historical setting everything here seems so modern. Its hows that people are much the same despite the era in which they live. And though the events chronicled are not always based on literal fact, they have a Kafkaesque ability to convey a higher truth."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"This is one book I'll never re-read. Which is not to say I'm not glad I read it. Probably not the best choice as one's first Pynchon (but what is?), at times more a test of the reader's stubbornness rather than a reward for his or her patience. Funny, educational, confusion, elusive, silly, erudite. Parts merit five stars, others one, hence my three. I agree with virtually everything every other reviewer has written, pro and con. Go for it if you dare!"},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"After reading all of Pynchon's prior novels.Coming at this initially with a quivering unsure attitude.Prepared for quite a long tough deep thorough slog of a read.At first, blanching at the funny affectedold-fashioned language.But fulfilled, and more, all expectations.Also rewarded, brilliantly with Infinitely Fine Wondersin many places at many Moments.Even for the few parts I did skip over as boring, I ended jumping back to and re-reading, after realizing that they contained the seeds, of some significant event that blossomed pages later.(the only example I can think of is the reaching of the crossroads in the north-south and east-west Indian pathways; somehow I'd sleep-read, through the trekking from the river up to the crossroads)As with all his books, there is a pure joy in the moment to moment advancing through the actual reading for the first time of the text. Yet afterwards, there is a glow of memories, which spread like ripples in some tropical sunset panorama, and diffuse among the other memories of my life.... until I can no longer (nor do I want to) disentangle them -- some memories from the book (as with all his other books) are woven into \\"who I am\\" now, and are just as cherished, as fond, as some from the most \\"real\\" events of my childhood.Thus the memory of their first venture overseas when their ship is attacked by the French, as it diffuses on through the book and is re-recollected by the characters, seems to be a memory of my own, that I share with them, from my own life. Like the crazy riverboat ride of Gravity's Rainbow, or the sunny southern California scenes of the Crying of Lot 49, or the northern California scenes of Vineland, or cruddy hotel rooms of V., ....By some quirk of fate (or was it? did not realize this till I was well into the reading), I was actually reading the book, during the time of the next \\"transit of Venus\\" in 2004, after the pair of them that they pursue in the book.After a while I could really get a kick out of how the Author manipulated his Almost Constant, yet Not Quite Ubiquitous, use of Capitalization .... some very funny Things even embedded at that Layer, e.g. where he chose to capitalize something but NOT another thing ....And the duck, the duck! worthy of a series of Monty Python sketches in itself and its re-occurrences.And you know, I actually did see mention of the duck, somewhere else in some other discussion of something involving the same timespan, so it is one more thing the author did NOT entirely make up out of whole cloth ....And, the drift back and forth between narrators, points of view, timeframes, sometimes the Rev. Cherrycoke, sometimes not, sometimes a quote within a quote within a quote within a whole paragraph within a whole chapter, ...Of course the obligatory (I knew there had to be some mention of this, just from knowing the time frame of the book, even before reading it!) smoking weed with Colonel (not General yet) Washington, his wife Martha, and their comedian servant, who might be Eddie Murphy's 6-times-great-grandfather."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"I figured that one either loves or hates Mr. Pynchon's works. So I feel quite out of place saying that I think Gravity's Rainbow is one of the most important books of the century and that Mason and Dixon is an excruitingly boring, sloppy, overblown, piece of unedited nonsense. Pynchon is a literary icon to me, but nobody should pretend that this book is as important or even as entertaining as his other works. Even when you can't easily find the Emperor, it's still possible he wears no clothes."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"Pynchon is perhaps the greatest living author in the English language and this work even surpasses Gravity's Rainbow in its depth and maturity. Although some first time readers find Pynchon impenetrable the book is well worth adjusting to the author's sometimes quirky style. The man who made paranoia a virtue, for those who have never read Pynchon before it is almost impossible to describe his writing style -surreal, pedantic, comic, absurd, deconstructionistic, poetic it is all of those things and yet those words fall far short. To read Pynchon is an experience. Despite its length readers should find Mason & Dixon enjoyable and will find themselves craving for more at the book's end.Both cosmic and comic the book makes use of historical reference many of which seem unbelievable but are true (such as the duck automaton which Pynchon turns into an avenging killer),as was done in Gravity's Rainbow, add to the slightly surreal quality of Pynchon's writing in his blurring the boundaries between historical fact and fiction.As Gravity's Rainbow was a modern day Iliad set in W.W.II, Mason & Dixon is set in the years of the formation of AmericaTaking on opposing ideologies which continue in America to this date (such as his tale of the battles between Jesuits and martial arts masters) Pynchon's writing though comic is philosophical and social commentary.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"one of my favorite novels. of all time. read this if you have the hankering to tackle big, ambitious books like moby dick or ulysses. this mind-boggling book is fit to take its place among those contemporarily misunderstood masterpieces. there is not a word out of place here, as with all of Pynchon's virtuoso-istic previous works; however there is also here a mellowed, humane chord -- perhaps brought on by age, the zoroastrian/laurel and hardy characterization of the main characters, or simply the novel's historic setting -- which makes this book a classic. For God's sake, buy it."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"Love it or hate it. No one will be ambivalent about this book. My suggestion: do not try to read it in your spare time. Lock yourself up with a few cases of ale and lots to eat. Put on your answering machine. Savour the English language in the hands of a craftsman at the top of his form. Adjectives fail me. This book is a gift for the mind willing to let go. It has one added, counter-intuitive benefit. Because of its sheer size and heft, it seems to be a remarkably effective way to cause strange, attractive, intelligent women approach you while reading it. Proof again, if proof was needed, that size does matter."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"Having loved the flow and imagination of Gravity's Rainbow and the simplicity of The Crying of Lot 49, this was a disappointment.Granted, I know the point is not about surveying per se, but after the first 200 pages I was losing my attention span. Pynchon devotees may love this but except for being able to say I've read most everything of his in print, I'm hard pressed to say more than: he can still craft long, grammatically-correct sentences and shows a real depth in writing.If you can make it to the New World, it gets easier but better reads are out there."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"Words cannot describe how much I enjoyed reading this book. I think you would need to be Mr Pynchon to have the scope and erudition to do it justice."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"when I saw CATS on Broadway, I thought &#34;what if TS Elliot wrote novels instead of poetry?&#34;. Now that I've read this book, I'm glad he didn't bother!"},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"I was hooked on the first sentence--for my money, one of the best ever. Talk about dropping you into the scene! Brilliant piece of work. As the other reviews make clear, it's a HUGE book and it takes effort. And I still don't get the duck. I don't care, it was worth it. I may take it ice fishing and reread it every January.For those who've read it:I'll admit it and embarrass my lit professors. This is one of the few books I really like that I'd also like to see made into a movie. I'd love to see the amazing historic scene settings, the hilarious situations, \\"The Octuple Gloucester\\". Maybe a cable mini-series, I don't know. But it would be a joy to consume just the most accessible parts of this monster without the intense labor of the literature. Call me what you will, this thing could be fantastic on film. Just think if a script had been around in time for Jim Broadbent in his prime to play Dixon? Ha!"},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"Technically and intellectually speaking, Thomas Pynchon is a very skilled writer. His prose is deep, detailed, wry, and encyclopedic all in the same vein. The problem is, he also happens to be a very boring and lackluster storyteller. In 'Mason &amp; Dixon' there is a lot of the wry humor Pynchon has founded his long and eccentric career on. The downside is, for every great page of writing, you have to encounter a hundred other pages which drag on with trite and seemingly unneccessary filler. Pynchon is alot like James Joyce in the sense that you either get him or you don't and you either enjoy his often difficult stream-of-conciousness style or you don't. There's no in-between when it comes to any of his few books. If you're looking for something to read by him because you've heard that he's one of the most famous literary eccentrics since J.D. Salinger, I recommend reading 'The Crying of Lot 49' which is much shorter, more entertaining and probably the most accessible of his works."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"I once saw filmmaker Stan Brakhage speak. He mentioned that his big project one year was to read all of &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot; out loud. I thought &quot;what a great idea--read an entire book out loud. Take your time. Savor the language and listen to the words...&quot; All I needed was the right book. Mason &amp; Dixon was the right book. I feel I got much more out of this great novel by reading it aloud. Mind you, I didn't &quot;perform&quot; it, but I did pay close attention to the novel's language, characters, events, and jokes. It forced me to concentrate on the words, and the barrier of the 18th Century pastiche dissolved. It forced me to set aside time at home to read the book, since I was not going to read out loud in public. The book is as funny, heartbreaking, and fascinating as its diehard fans say. Next, I will try reading &quot;V&quot; (my least favorite Pynchon novel) out loud."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"I can best describe the genius of this book by answering questions posed by a earlier reviewer: You think a talking dog is funny? George Washington getting stoned?A talking dog isn't funny by itself, although the dog is drawn as a comic character. The dog isn't there just for a gag. Much of the book is a critique of the Enlightenment and the dominance of reason in Western thought, often contrasted (improbably) with Eastern ideas. The Learned English Dog is, in my opinion, a Western embodiment of the Koan of Mu, which is one of the most significant Koans, and concerns a meditation over whether a dog has a Buddha-nature. The Koan illustrates the different approaches to reason, the mind, the soul, and nature in the Western and Eastern tradition. (These ideas surely can't escape the reader, as the entire book is the story of two men drawing a straight line across wilderness). In case you aren't familiar with the Koan or don't see the connection, the Learned English Dog helpfully recites it in its entirety to Mason (Pynchon really isn't obscure, he just asks you to look things up).The &quot;gag&quot; is the Learned English Dog reciting the Koan to an Enlightenment intellectual and Mason repeating &quot;Mu&quot; &quot;thoughtfully.&quot; If you understand the Koan and something about the Enlightenment, I cant see how you could fail to find this a memorable, brilliant comic image.Is Col. Washington getting the munchies funny? Not a great gag, but it's odd it is singled out, as it occupies maybe three pages. The theme of the use of stimulants as an engine of the Enlightenment, democracy, and commerce is prominent in the book - this &quot;gag&quot; is one small expression of it.Pynchon isn't for everyone. His books are as much strings of parables as anything else, some great, some merely good, served in a contrarian style that pays no heed to conventional rules. The faux archaric style is a distraction at first, but listen to the sound of the words, and the distraction will drop away and you will be treated to some magnificent and original prose. If you are ready to work - really work - at understanding, you will find its treasures. A Great Book."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"Pynchon is a great writer and this book is very approachable and enjoyable. His style can be somewhat difficult at times but once you get used to it, it's not a problem. I've found the best approach is to just read and enjoy and don't get bogged down trying to catch every nuance or understand the philosophical significance of every passage. When I get a little lost I just back up a few pages and read it again or refresh my memory by refering back to an earlier passage. You don't need to study the background or get everything Pynchon might or might not be saying to enjoy the novel because it is above all else a well written story. If you want to go back and study it, fine but I think there is an undeserved aura of unapproachability surrounding Pynchon. He is deep but I think anyone can read and enjoy his books and for me that is the main point of a novel. The academic commentary can be interesting but not nearly as interesting as reading the book. Another reviewer said that this isn't a beach read, but for the record that's exactly where I read most of this one.For a shorter introduction to Pynchon, try Crying of Lot 49 to get used to his style. I would recommend Mason & Dixon over Vineland. I'm still working on Gravity's Rainbow."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"\\"Mason & Dixon\\" is Thomas Pynchon's best work: less impenetrable than \\"Gravity's Rainbow\\", warmer than \\"V.\\" & the lamentable \\"Vineland\\". It takes a little effort, but one easily becomes accustomed to the 18th-century mannerisms of type and syntax with which Pynchon chose to clothe this story. And what a story it is...The birth of America from an uneasy brew of Enlightenment principles and nagging superstitions, fueled with coffee & tobacco & other smokables, urban sophistication butting up against rural individualism. After observing the Transit of Venus across the sun in Dutch Sumatra, the grieving widower Mason and caffeine-addled Quaker Dixon take another assignment laying lines for the Penns in the New World, vaguely suspecting their glasses and measuring devices are going to divide more than just the landscape before them. And so begins the big adventure into America. \\"Mason & Dixon\\" is a travelogue, an encyclopedia of the science and politics of the Revolutionary era, always with a focus on Pynchon's perennial preterite everyday man who has been passed over by fortune.As with his other fiction, the esoteric historical minutiae is seamlessly woven into conversation and the narrative (Pynchon must have camped out at the Royal Observatory in England and poured over its documents and M & D's letters and diaries to spice this one so richly). A classic for which we'll probably have to do some popular catching up, like \\"Moby-Dick\\" and \\"Ulysses\\" and any encyclopedic masterpiece which went partially unrecognized at its inaugural appearance."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"I was disappointed by Pynchon's latest, 'Against the Day', but decided it stronger to reinforce my support for this mature masterpiece than add to the noise around the later juvenile epic.Pynchon's usual weakness is to treat his secondary characters to more sympathy than his leads, which are loaded like ordnance to be lobbed, both with vicious parody and with thematic gravity, at the author's favorite targets: the fortress walls of contemporary political culture cast in the material of his historical fantasies, and the residents behind those walls, the duelling spirits that make their project of civic modernity. in this mix, the comical subplots often flourish and resolve satisfiably with folks putting down their cooking utensils, making babies and finally saying what they really mean. the tragic in Pynchon, meanwhile, tends to run out of air.Mason & Dixon avoids these problems. The author invests in Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon, developing them more personably than he's achieved elsewhere. The kernel of this vivid novel is their accidental friendship, and despite the novel's sedimentary layers (imaginary 18th century idiom, conspiracies of colony, state and corporation, the paradigmatic turnings on technology's turf, a disturbance of terrestrial forces not capturable by lexical scope, etc.), this seed takes root and sustains throughout. Laurel & Hardy they are indeed (or Wilder & Pryor), but the personae of Mason & Dixon are thorough such that they transcend comparison to other duets, stepping into the literary tradition as their own precedent.To folks unfamiliar with Pynchon, I can recommend this or Gravity's Rainbow as good cherry poppers. To those exercised Pynchon readers who have dismissed Mason & Dixon, perhaps for its uncharacteristic restraint, or the tidiness of its denouement, I urge you pick it up again; I believe this is the one that will be remembered in three generations."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"What a wild, exuberant, complex, richly worded, comic, tragic novel is this gargantuan book by the noted Thomas Pynchon(born in New York State in 1937). Pynchon's novels are nearly as complex as James Joyce's Ulysses. They are also funnier and closer to the American experience as this book looks at the survey undertaken in the 1760s by English astronomer/surveyers from the Royal Society: Charles Mason and his companion Jeremiah Dixon.In the first 200 pages of this 800 pound Goliath of a book we see the two meet; travel to South Africa and St. Helens on astronomical observation jaunts; be chased at sea by a French man-o-war; deal withfamily matters as they travel, argue and do science in a spirt of comradeship and inquiry characteristic of the Age of Reason. Pynchon satirically throws mud at the Age of Reason which such ludicrous characters as a mechanical duck; a huge worm and a talking dog! (the Learned English Dog!). Along the way we meet characters who are eccentric, verbose, cruel and hilarioius. It is obvioius Pynchon is a learned scholar of eighteenth century life, science as well as being a master of the English language.This was my first encounter with the difficult Mr. Pynchon. I confess that there are sections of the book which leave me nonplussed, confused and downright bored! Pynchon is concerned with \\"Time\\" (as witness a conversation between two clocks!) and readily switches tenses, times and situations. It can be as confusing as adjusting to the writing of a William Faulkner. It would require several readings guided by a great English professor to aid the layperson in understanding such a tangled web of a shaggy dog tome! The book is written in faux eighteenth century prose reminiscent of the wild hijinks of Laurence Sterne's classic of absurdity and word play \\"Tristam Shandy.\\"I pity the poor wretch who picks up this book in the local bookstore or buys it on Amazon hoping to have a standard historical novel on Mason and Dixon in his/her hands. The two men surveyed the line between Penn.and Maryland in the days prior to the American Revolution. Pynchon's book deals with slavery and the nascent movement in the colonies to revolt against Great Britain.Famous figures of the age appear. George Washington and Mary share some \\"weed\\" with the surveyors as a slave joins them for a fun filled hour! Dr. Johnson and James Boswell converse with Mason and Dixonas well as Benjamin Franklin The doings of historical personages is strictly fictional and usually for laughs.The narrative shows the friendship between Mason and Dixon from their first teaming until their deaths. Pynchon is considered to be one of our best novelist by such a literary guru as the esteemed Harold Bloom of Yale. While not my cup of tea I agree with Bloom. The language, complexity, imagination and storytelling ability of the genius that is Pynchon is peerless in our nation's prose. A daunting but rewarding read not for those looking for beach reading or mindless thinking. Pynchon will keep the persevering reader on his/her toes for hours!"},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"I was inspired to read this book by a Mark Knofler song, Sailing to Philadelphia. Although I am a veracious reader this was my first journey into the world of Thomas Pynchon and I had to completely readjust my reading style. Normally accustomed to reading a book in a day or two, I have been savoring Mason and Dixon for several months, reading a short passage, thinking about it, rereading it and moving on. It is a book unlike any I have ever read. To review it is impossible. The reading of it is a unique literary experience."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"How can I possibly summarise and explain a Pynchon novel and give it any true justice? I can't, but I'll try. Mason & Dixon is about two guys making a line separating Pennsylvania from Maryland. Of course, that description is about as apt as saying that Moby Dick is about a man searching for a whale. Simply put, the fun is in the journey, the minutiae of their adventures, and the beautifully crafted sentences and paragraphs.Mason & Dixon is constructed in a style that was apparently all the rage in the late 18th century - the time which this novel is set. Here is a taste: 'Found this down at that Market near the Gallows, -'tis a Fiji Islander's Guitar, first introduc'd there two hundred years ago by Portuguese Jesuits, according to the Malay that sold me it.' Random (to my knowledge) capitalisation of words and strange contractions run rampant, but once you get used to the rhythm, it really works, and sets a distinct voice for this story that many other novels lack.Plot-wise, it is about Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon plotting the Line that separates two states: Maryland and Pennsylvania. Naturally they don't even begin doing this until about page 350, but that is beside the point. Along the way, they get into many crazy adventures, a lot of them happening in or around taverns and pubs. For example: A mechanical duck that becomes sentient and, angry about years of organic ducks being cooked in France, takes out his revenge on the premier cook at the time, but eventually falls into an obsessive love with him. Getting stoned with George Washington and having good ol' Martha help out when the munchies arrive. Inventing pizza. Visiting a travelling freak show where the prime attraction is a pickled ear that listens to wishes and sometimes grants them. A man swallows a clock, which turns into an immortal, vegetable-clock that drives everyone nearby but him insane with its tick-tocking. A worm thrown into a well soon grows so huge it makes its nest around a castle. A man who turns into a beaver at every full moon.Pynchon writes exquisite sentences, some of which run on and on, and it can be a real challenge to decipher their true meaning. Some, I'm sure, serve only to show just how obtuse and elegant the English language can be, and as with Gravity's Rainbow, Pynchon is rather fond of using mathematical descriptions to get his point across.Of particular note is the ending, when Mason and Dixon are older, their adventures over, the only events remaining in their lives being reminiscing. These conversations, between two men who shared years over several continents, is poignant and truly touching. Which was especially odd considering that, during the novel, I didn't really feel much of a connection to either of them, though that can perhaps be attributed to the difficulties of their language.The greatest problem with Mason & Dixon is that it doesn't compare to Gravity's Rainbow. And while a book should be evaluated in its own, in the face of such a behemoth, it simply wasn't possible. For all intents and purposes, Mason & Dixon is a very straight-forward novel with a mostly pre-determined plot: that being the lives of Mason and Dixon. The only room for deviation lies in the adventures of others, or the recollections around a bar table, while enjoyable, unfortunately don't hold a candle to Gravity's Rainbow's frantic change of time, scenery, characters, narrative voice, and so on.So is Mason & Dixon a disappointment? Certainly not. If you've got the patience and the will, there is a fantastic adventure, laden with magick and mathematicks (the k is purposely included), and the book is dense, running at 772 pages. But is Mason & Dixon a disappointment in light of what the author has done before? Unfortunately, the answer is yes."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"mason and dixon, a pair of fellows with related professions (surveyor/astronomer) and unrelated personalities. pynchon's overwhelming creativity in fictionally reconstructing their travals together is utterly remarkable. less dense (and less demanding) than &quot;gravity's rainbow,&quot; mason and dixon is as enjoyable as reading gets. pynchon is, as always, exceedingly humourous, and his nifty fact(i assume)oids are as entertaining as one would expect (chickens and straight lines, is it true?) the characters (in the most piercing sense of the word) they come across are extremely entertaining, and the interactions they share (particularly when their interactions (privately and individually) with mason and dixon come at different times) with our (dare i say?) heros are brilliant (and, at times, doubled-over-with-laughter-enjoyable). pynchon's relaxed exploration of the scientific world are, more often than not, so very light hearted that they ended up striking me as nearly lacakdaisical (this is a good thing; it is the difference betwen describing tensor products (or non-euclidean metrics) and saying &quot;relativity is, in essence, the concept that space and time are unified in an object called 'spacetime' and that they warp in the presense of mass,&quot; the latter catching the awe and 'wow' of science in a way that the former fails to) [i.e. lackadaisical in the 'dreamy' sense, y'know?].so, basically, i highly recommend this book. yes, it's long, but so are three smaller books, and with the variety present in mason and dixon, i think you'll not find yourself looking for other books to occupy yourself with. it really is a quick read, it's just that it is an extended quick read."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"M&amp;D is Pynchon's most approachable and readable work, with a beginning, middle and end mostly linearly connected.

A revisionist version of pre-Revolutionary War history. All narrated by one Wickes Cherrycoke, the presumed ancestor of one of Pynchon's minor (almost non-existant) characters from Gravity's RainbowIf you haven't read Pynchon before, this is a good starting point.

It inspired me to go out and buy a coffee table just to nonchalantly display the thing on.

The gorgeous dust-jacket (among other things) will ensure that your copy will last for generations to come. I am anxiously awaiting his book tour, although I am not sure I want my pristine copy of this masterpiece defiled by even the author's signature.

To me, this was an economic decision. The printed version is available either as an encyclopedia costing thousdands of dollars, or a merely absurd condensed version that comes with a necessary magnifying glass. The online OED gives you, basically, a search engine that lets you in on what word meant at a given time. Without the $29/mo subscription, I never would have made it through M&D;, which is written, especially in diaogue, in period language.Ben Franklin in tinted specs playing his glass harmonica in a coffee house?

I am amazed to see so many raves among the comments here, so I can only conclude that I missed much that has stimulated and satisfied more sensitive readers. I would like to assert, however, as one who has read quite deeply in English prose of the last 400 years, that the much-praised &quot;18th-century English&quot; is nothing like, being full of anachronisms and lapses of decorum. To my ears (and I listened to an unabridged recording) Pynchon's style is clotted, mannered, meretricious and UNpoetic in the extreme. Indeed, I think much of the book, in word and matter, is a stale exercise in collecting academic trivia and faddish modern-day truisms about the period. To be sure, there is some real history reported, but there is also much nonsense and fakery--the first pizza, golems--and interminable, leaden dialogues that could never have taken place. Since most readers, including me, cannot always tell what is real and what is made up, the whole thing misses the virtue of of even as a good historical novel to render a lively and accurate picture of a bygone age.In the end, perhaps Pynchon has a profound vision of the themes his admirers attribute to this book: it may be good as philosophy (I have not the patience or wit to find out, but as fiction Mason &amp; Dixon fails in its first duties, to tell an arresting story, to present believable characters, to draw the reader's emotions along with his rational faculty into the author's imaginative world."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"I'd never read anything by Thomas Pynchon before, so thought I'd try it. My conclusion? He falls into the category of testosterone-driven geniuses of style, incident and recondite subject matter who nonetheless seem to be devoid of conclusion and affect. He may even be the best of the bunch, if you exclude O'Toole's Confederacy of Dunces, which we must because that book is not ultimately chilly and pointless, as this one is. I enjoyed every minute of it, but have difficulty recalling most of those minutes, and couldn't tell you why any one minute comes in the book before any other minute. Some incidents are vivid and memorable -- I learned a lot of amusing matter about cheese-rolling and the Transit of Venus -- others were lost on me, like some episode about a mechanical duck. The pastiche quality of it makes it, ultimately, a splendid failure, as the author's omission to choose carefully among incidents and make them mean something ultimately exposes it as an exercise that fails to be a novel."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"A great source to buy a book. An excellent transaction all around - as described and very quick. Thanks."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"Nothing much to add to what's already been said except this: If this book attempts to replicate 18th Century prose and orthography, how come Pychon spells color color?"},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"Okay, theres a point when an effort to create impressive prose and style actually becomes an obsticle to the story. Mind you, there is nothing wrong with having a richness of text, but fiction is about storytelling, and Pynchon gives of an air of &quot;Look mom, I'm a writer!&quot;. He needs to spend more time telling a story and less time into trying to be James Joyce. If I want Joyce, I'll read Joyce."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"I survived this book, if only just. I'm not sure if it's the best book I ever read, or perhaps the worst (or maybe both). Let's face it--this book is outstanding, but has a very limited audience. Don't feel like you have to be one of those precocious few who can follow the clever ramblings and tricksy references to 18th century culture."},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","review":"Amazing to read people criticising M &amp; D's lack of plot.

I recommend this book to anyone with an interest in 20th century intellectual history."},{"Title":"King, Priest, and Prophet: A Trinitarian Theology of Atonement (Theology for the 21st Century)","review":"If you're a theological student wanting a pretty informative book on the atonement than this book should be very helpful. Though Sherman comes from the postliberal school of thought he is quite Reformed and traditional on how he approaches the atonement. Readers will also appreciate Sherman's heavy reliance on Scripture to defend his viewpoint rather than giving into modern ideaologies and fads. In fact, one can say that Sherman has a very high view of Scripture compared to others who belong in his school of thought.Another positive aspect of the book is that it is not exclusively academic. It is meant to aid pastors on how to preach the atonement in a faithful manner to believers. It seems that preaching the atonement - whether in liberal or conservative churches - is not a high priority these days. Hopefully, this book will dismiss the ridiculous idea that atonement theology and the life of the church are not integrally related.Sherman's work revolves around the three offices of Christ: king, priest, and prophet. He devotes a chapter to each of these offices and explains why all the offices of Christ cannot be disconnected from each other. He also explains, related to the above point, that all the members of the Trinity are involved in Christ's work. This corrects the common belief among Christians that only Christ is involved in the atonement. As a result of this, the atonement, according to Sherman, cannot be tied down to one single view. In fact, due to the Trinitarian nature of the atonement, all the major views of the atonement in church history (Christus Victor, Abelardian, and Anselmian) are valid. In this sense, Christ's kingship involves the victory over the powers of sin and death, Christ's priestly role as involved in the penal satisfaction for humanity's sin, and Christ's prophetic role as involved in the transformation of believers from the old life to the new. One may not agree with Sherman's eclectic model of the atonement (as this reviewer does) but he does make an almost convincing case for it (traditionalists will also appreciate Sherman's defense of Anselm [pp. 188-192] considering that Anselm has been a target of ridicule among many modern Christians).Considering the amount of nonsense that is being published on the atonement these days it is refreshing to see a work like Sherman's. When one reads the pages one will recognize that Sherman's priorities lie with God's kingdom, the gospel, the church, and individual Christians. He is not some liberal, marxist, socialist, radical that wants to deconstruct the Christian tradition so that pagans, disgruntled immoralists, and anti-Christian philosophers will feel all nice and cuddly. This work makes no compromises with modern ideas and values. Though there are points where traditionalists will disagree with, it is still a work that is nonetheless useful for the church and academia."},{"Title":"Tropico 2: Pirate Cove Official Strategy Guide","review":"While there was some good information in this book, I was hoping for more behind-the-scenes info.

After deciding to buy a trailer I wanted to do a little research. This book is full of incredible detail about all the possible mishaps your horse could get into and the various design flaws that most trailers have to contribute to those mishaps. It gives detailed explanations of each part of the trailer and is full of opinions about the best design of trailers. The authors do not cite any specific manufacturers but after reading this book I had completely changed my mind about what I wanted. The problem is so much of the information was so scary that I designed my perfect trailer around it, only to learn it would cost me almost $10,000.00 (for a 2-horse). The book is incredibly detailed, well written in layman's terms and has good illustrations and photographs. I learned a lot more about a horse trailer than I ever thought I needed to. It gives you a lot to think about. Mostly I thought about never trailering my horse in someone elses's trailer again."},{"Title":"The Complete Guide to Buying, Maintaining, and Servicing a Horse Trailer (Howell Reference Books)","review":"As a novice in the horse world I had no idea where to start looking for a safe and reasonably priced horse trailer. This book was a wealth of information covering all the main topics (slant load or straight load, gooseneck or tag-a-long; steel or aluminum construction)and offered lot's of details I would not have considered (hay bags, nets or mangers; ramp or step up's; windows open or closed). I completely changed my mind about what to look for in a trailer and believe I have now have the information necessary to buy the safest trailer available and the most appropriate tow vehicle for my choice of trailer. The authors are very knowledgeable and have written from experience. The only problem I had with the book is that it is almost too much information but it will continue to be a resource for any questions that arise in the future. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Complete Guide to Buying, Maintaining, and Servicing a Horse Trailer (Howell Reference Books)","review":"Imagine trying to buy a car with no consumer reviews (or even trade reviews), and in a world where only a handful of people you know even own cars. You can ask their opinion, but their vehicle is several years old and a totally different type from the one you need. And for every time you hear someone say, &quot;Acme Brand Trailers are the greatest,&quot; you'll also hear, &quot;I wouldn't have an Acme Brand Trailer ever again.&quot;This is what it's like to shop for a horse trailer. Actually, it's even worse: most horse trailers are practically custom made, so there's a huge variety of options to select. Dealers often only have one brand and are typically far apart - perhaps a hundred miles in every direction. And they may only have a few samples available at any one time.Though no brands are mentioned, the book does a good job of taking one through the many possible features in a trailer, discussing what is available and what is especially convenient, horse-friendly, or inconvenient. Even little details, like door latches, or avoiding high sills on dressing room doors, so that the dressing room can be swept out easily, are covered - precisely the sort of thing that is easy to miss when looking at bright shiny new trailers.I did not agree with all of her recommendations and preferences, but they are generally well presented and reasoned. I would like to see a little more discussion about expected hauling conditions, and how your needs for a trailer and tow vehicle change based on whether you do mostly short local hauling or long-distance hauling, and in warm or cold weather.However, this is an excellent book on an obscure topic, and well worth the money for anyone looking to know more about selecting or maintaining a horse trailer."},{"Title":"The Complete Guide to Buying, Maintaining, and Servicing a Horse Trailer (Howell Reference Books)","review":"Very thorough and easy to read.

Heaps of researches have made their debuts since then that seriously outdates this book... by 12 years.For example, the author's list of ADD symptoms only covers the hyperactivity element and neglects the symptoms of a child with inattentive type ADD (without hyperactivity). An inattentive type wouldn't necessarily have a hard time sitting down. Contrary to many of the items on the list, a child with inattentive type ADD would more likely be day-dreaming (similar to being hyperactive in one's own mind.. as I'd like to think of it).Try to stay away from this one..

Barbara talks about the effects rejections from her family members had in her life and the bad fruits of self rejection, fear, anger, bitterness... that grew up from the roots of rejection in her life (listed on page 93). To that list I added drunkeness, rebellion, shame, suicide, great sadness, deep pain, pornography and self hatred. Barbara talked about how God specially selected our parents and brothers and sisters, and that those who are closest to us that we love the most, also hurt us the deepest. Forgiveness, undeserved, is an absolute necessity to break the chains that hold us. I cried my heart out for several days as I chose to forgive those people in my life that hurt me so deeply.

A dazed Mrs. Jerningham, a newlywed and heiress, has stumbled onto the possibility that her husband, Dale, might be seeking to kill her. It's a fantastical notion -- too fantastical to be true. Or is it?But the novel, the fourth in the Miss Silver series, doesn't live up to that auspicious beginning. Miss Silver barely plays a role in solving the crime, and Lisle Jerningham proves to be such a fatalistic milquetoast that one hardly cares about her fate. After all, why should we care more about whether she lives or dies than she apparently does?A bad Patricia Wentworth novel is better than a lot of other authors' best effort, but The Danger Point is definitely not up to the usual standard of a Wentworth mystery.

The only reason I finished this wretched work was because I paid full retail for it (and then only succeeded by skipping large tracts, which did not diminish from the story one wit.) Admiral Mack may be good with fictional accounts of modern destroyer operations, but in a genre dominated by the late (lamentably) and superb Patrick O'Brian, Mack has no place. His story is plodding. To call his characters &quot;cardboard cutouts&quot; is to insult cardboard. He has absolutely no feel whatsoever for the Age of Fighting Sail and has concocted some of the lamest, modern colloquilism-laden dialogue I have ever read. He handles nautical details with the aplomb of a third grade textbook. The book jacket says (warns!) that the author is working on a sequel. The admiral would be better advised not to waste his time. The US Naval Institute, his publisher, should spare the trees which a sequel will needlessly consume. An utter disappointment -- stick with Aubrey and Maturin, Horatio Hornblower or even Ramage, if you must, but don't waste your money on Kilburnie."},{"Title":"Captain Kilburnie","review":"The author had a good plot and enough basic knowledge of sailing ships to write a decent book. Unfortunately, he apparently lacked a strong editor to send the book back for a second draft. The vapid dialog needed re-writing and his characters could use a little more depth. In addition, there were several places in the book that read like a paragraph or more was accidently left out. For example, Kilburnie is suddently a captain, but the book doesn't tell us how he found out about his promotion. Finally, Mack's description of how the British Navy operated (for example, how Captains were assigned to ships) is very different from how every other author I've read has descripted it. Overall, there are many better choices to choose from if you want to read about 18th &amp; early 19th Century sailing ships."},{"Title":"Captain Kilburnie","review":"This book is similar in style to the great books of Captain Frederick Marryat. The writing is simple in style and straight forward. The main character starts low and ends high. Not one of the greatest of this genre that I have read, but I loved this book. Angus Kilburnie is a young Scotsman that is caught with the daughter of an Irish lord and banished. He decides to make his life at sea as did his Grandfather. With the aid of his naval veteran Uncle, he is assigned to a \\"good ship\\" and does well. He is promoted from the ranks to midshipman and through good service to lieutenant. As lieutenant on a new ship, he has a foul captain and is pawned off by the bad captain to serve as First Lieutenant on a transport (a converted 74). He goes on to do great deeds on this ship and beyond. To disclose more would spoil the fun. Filled with good characters and sharp actions. If you love books about the British Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Wars, this one is not to be missed. I anxiously await the sequel. Be sure to check out the excellent WWII Destroyer books by Adm. Mack. Especially don't miss \\"South to Java\\", one of the greatest works of fiction I have ever read in any category!"},{"Title":"Captain Kilburnie","review":"A very thinly fleshed out novel, with a bare minimum of the details needed to make it a novel worth reading. Mack's attempt to cover a period of Kilburnie career from before the mast to Post Captain didn't allow room to develope the book properly, making the book read more as a synopsis or outline instead of a stand a lone novel. Mack needs to do much more research about the Royal Navy of that period. His ending was a prime example of the lack of a serious attempt to write a seafaring novel worthy of O'brien and his peers. Capt. Kilburnie has his command sunk and he merrily goes to Scotland with no effort to get to the Admiralty or stand trial for the lost of his ship, which was standing proceedure for the time if all the other top authors of the gernre are to be believed. I suggest that Adm. Mack stick to novels of the 20th century Navy, with which he is more aquainted, also a new publicist couldn't hurt."},{"Title":"Captain Kilburnie","review":"This sea story is suitable for youth or adults new to the &quot;Fighting Sail&quot; genre. W.P. Mack, a retired U.S. Admiral, writes of an impetuous Scot lad who advances to command through unusual maritime situations during the War of the French Revolution. Amid typical shot, storm, and stupidity, Kilburnie wins through to command and love, but fails to charm me. This book is notable for including family, social, and hospital scenes, and is particularly good at showing how political &quot;interest&quot; (patronage) could work to advance a young man's naval career, despite his alleged handicap of Scottish ancestry. At several points Mack helpfully instructs in basic seamanship and jargon, but by and large sail handling is not critical to the story, which is shaped more as a biography of Kilburnie. Withal, Kilburnie rises rather easily in the author's hands and is on the way to achieving his goals with less sweat and conflict than usually depicted in novels of this type. He is always loved by his men (without convincingus us), and gets on with garrulous subordinates as if they were buddies. These contemporary American values are expressed in prose that is best described as &quot;in ordinary:&quot; flat, a bit simplistic, emotionally sanitized, and lacking dialogue in British dialects. Thus Mack also misses the flavour of the better historical novels of English naval warfare two centuries ago. Only if your appetite is whetted here and you thirst for more naval cant, lore, adventure, and atmosphere should you try that paragon of obscure and inexplicable prose and period, Patrick O'Brian, by way of C.S. Forester's Hornblower saga.While Mack disappoints me in his shallow characterization and awkward style, this could be a good start for beginners in the genre--a quick overview--and is a quality large paperback. Although this will have a sequel, I am much more excited about the hugely promising new KYDD series by Julian Stockwin, a true British captain."},{"Title":"Captain Kilburnie","review":"I have a collection of hundreds of tall ship volumes, and have read all the greats, but this one stands alone. It reeks like rotten seaweed! This author demonstrates for us a virtually encyclopedic lack of knowledge of the tall ships era. He also treats us to an overlayment of the modern American navy ethos and personnel relationships onto the tall ships British navy. This lends the same verisimilitude as would cast-iron sails. The critic who called this utter dreck was too kind by half, and I felt constrained by a system that apparently has no rating below one star."},{"Title":"Captain Kilburnie","review":"The writing here might win first prize at a high school's annual creative writing contest, but it certainly does not merit serious publishing. The plot is sketchy. In some ways it is barely plausible. Some specific problems: The captain spends way too much time away from his ship. After his ship is sunk, he skips, la-dee-da up to his estate in Scotland, leaving his crew to God knows what end. One of the main characters tells her husband of an affair she has had, and the whole matter is settled, amicably, in the course of a two-minute conversation.The dialogue is terrible. Everyone speaks the same proper English and the language is drab and stilted. There is no hint of idiom, folk sayings, or even much naval jargon.The character's relationships with each other are unlikely. With few exceptions, everyone likes and gets along with each other. All of the tars are happy with their work. All of the officers are fair, honorable and intelligent. The captains and admirals are jovial mentors, quick to promote and give credit. There is one exception, but even this is not resolved and quickly forgotten.I think the author, William Mack's, biggest problem is that he fell in love with his main character. Fergus Kilburnie must be the luckiest man alive. There are no cliff-hangers in this book, and very little conflict. When there is a problem, Kilburnie side-steps it or overcomes it as easily as crossing the street. Mack seems to loathe putting his character, his &quot;child&quot; if you will, into harm's way. As a consequence, by the end of the book, instead of sympathizing with the main character, I hated him. If Captain Kilburnie had been my commanding officer, I would have fragged him."},{"Title":"Captain Kilburnie","review":"Captain Kilburnie is the tale of a young man of great ability and ambition. Fergus Kilburnie is a younger son and knows there will not be a place for him on the family estate in Scotland, so he decides to go to sea. Although he enlists as a seaman, he already knows seamanship and navigation and quickly masters gunnery, for which he will always retain a passion. He is quickly promoted to lieutenant and is posted to a captaincy at a young age. There are issues with this book -- the dialogue is a bit flat and Fergus is larger than life, quickly mastering every new skill he turns to -- but it is an engaging, action-filled read. Mack was a career naval officer and his love of the service and the sea is evident in his book. If anything, he waxes a little pedantic as he tries to share his knowledge. There is no suspense here; this is a straightforward tale of the career of an exceptional young man who pursues a naval career and the woman he loves. Still, it is chock full of the stuff that makes historic naval fiction fun to read."},{"Title":"Captain Kilburnie","review":"After reading Patrick O'Brien, Richard Woodman, and the Bothlio series, don't think Vice Admiral Mack cuts the mustard. Wondering if author did any research into the period. The relationships between master and servant are totally skewed, the conversations could be taking place during the 20th century, and VERY few women would tottle off to their gynecologist, much less even know one existed. All in all I felt the book totally lacking in character, and not well written - even boring."},{"Title":"Captain Kilburnie","review":"Discovered Mack's Captain Kilburnie after C.S.

Following the career of Fergus Kilburnie from lowly sailor to Post Captain in one book forces a faster pace and fewer details than is normally encountered. While I prefer the normal format of one ship, one major battle or event per book - which allows for better character development, this was a fun read.

I have bought a lot of Thomas Guides, but this has proven to be a very expensive hobby. I think Thomas Guides should be posted on the internet, not only to fuel my hobby, but for safety reasons too. For instance let's say a couple of girls want to go to a NSync concert in Devore, but they don't know how to get there. IF I were the author of the Thomas Guide Maps: San Bernadino, I would feel responsible for those girls, and if I were their parents I would let them go to the concert, because Syretta. . . I mean the eldest of the two girls is probably a very responsible driver, and the two of them love NSync so much that it would be a sin to try to delay a love like that, especially if the concert were just days before the youngest's eighteenth birthday. Thank you."},{"Title":"Love On The Line","review":"I have read several books by Laura DeHart Young, and was really looking forward to this one. In fact, I bought it because I already owned the sequel (Forever and the Night) and I hate to start in the middle of a storyline. I must say, I was a little disappointed by this one and hope the sequel is better.The book started with Kay Westmore, a late 30-something US National Park Service Ranger in Alaska, dealing with a bad breakup and a fledgling relationship with Stef, an early 20-something college co-ed. It seems Kay's estranged ex was stalking and threatening her, and that the co-ed was ready to start a relationship while Kay was not. This was the first few chapters.The next chapters (i.e., most of the book) were about Kay's assignment to provide a tour of the Alaskan pipeline to Grace Perry, an ambitious goverment official. Unbeknownst to Kay, Grace is investigating the malicious tampering of the pipeline. Grace is difficult, demanding, and obnoxious, but Kay stays true to herself and keeps Grace safe during an extreme snowstorm and cold spell.The romance was only a very minor portion of this book. From this reader's viewpoint, this was merely a mystery book with a lesbian as a main character. Even after reading the back cover, I wasn't prepared for that. I'm hoping the sequel will focus more on the relationship between Kay and Stef, and will be more in line with Young's other published titles."},{"Title":"Love On The Line","review":"This is my favorite book by Laura DeHart Young so far.

In this one section of his 5 or 6 adventure publications, he brings you along with him with wonderful descriptions and much imagination. However, if you are sensitive about racial profiling or racism, bear in mind he was a product of his times (1930's) and seems to think himself clever for cheating or mistreating the \\"native\\" peoples he ran across.

Bishop Ware's approach covers virtually all aspects of the Eastern Church -- history, theology, sacramentality, church organization, and the Orthodox diaspora with a special emphasis on rendering Orthodoxy comprehensible to Western Christian readers. Ware's approach is very ecumenical, and he frankly and even-handedly addresses the issues that unite and divide the Christian East and West. Because of his own dual background as a Westerner (he teaches at Oxford) who chose to become Orthodox, Ware is particularly well-situated to explain the wondrous and beautiful mysteries of Eastern Christianity to Westerners. While the book is in the nature of a broad overview, it actually covers the issues addressed in an impressive level of depth. The bibliography is also a great starting point for further reading and research, broken down helpfully by topic. This book is a must-read for anyone wishing to acqaint themselves with the riches of the Eastern Christian tradition."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"As a Non-Orthodox Christian, I found Timothy Ware's edition of the &quot;Orthodox Church&quot; very helpful in coming to glimpse with the historical and doctrinal aspects of the church.Part One of this book displays a well-defined and compact discourse concerning the Early Church, the Church of the Seven Councils, and the struggling Church in a state of siege and persecution.Part Two makes evident the faith and worship of the Orthodox Church. In this section, Timothy Ware discusses the principles behind Orthodox Liturgy, the Sacraments, and God's relations with the individuals that constitute the invisible body of the Church. As a reader I discovered the the little things that engendered big friction between the East and the West. Also I found valuable information about the rise of communist Russia, the internal and external dissent between Orthodox Churches during this period, and the prevalence of a faith that has remained nearly unchanged throughout the ups and downs of its long history.So I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in Church History, or for someone who simply wishes to look at the Orthodox Church from the pen of an Orthodox writter."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"&quot;The Orthodox Church,&quot; by Timothy (Bishop Kallistos) Ware, is (and has been for decades) the number one book in the English language on the Eastern Orthodox Christian faith. It appears on virtually all recommended reading lists and bibliographies. (Not surprisingly, the number two book is &quot;The Orthodox Way,&quot; by the same author.)The cover states that this title is &quot;a clear, detailed introduction to the Orthodox Church written for the non-Orthodox as well as for Orthodox Christians who wish to know more about their own tradition.&quot; I couldn't have said it better myself.This volume is divided into two sections. Part one covers the history of the Church from the beginnings at Pentecost through Byzantium (the Seven Councils and the Great Schism), then the conversion of the Slavs, the Church under Islam, the Russian Church, and on into the twentieth century. Especially sobering is the author's summary of events surrounding the eastern European Orthodox Churches under communism. Coverage of the growth of the Orthodox Church in North America helps explain the current state of things.Part two discusses faith and worship and covers such important topics as: Holy Tradition, God and humankind, the theology and structure of the Church, and detailed explanations of various components of Orthodox worship (including sacraments, feasts, fasts and private prayer). The final chapter, entitled &quot;The Orthodox Church and the Reunion of Christians,&quot; explains various views within the Church concerning the ecumenical movement and the World Council of Churches, and highlights dialogues with various church bodies including Roman Catholics, Old Catholics, Anglicans, and other Eastern Christian bodies such as the Coptic Church and the Armenian Orthodox Church.An extensive, annotated list of further reading, organized by topics, such as &quot;The Early Church and Byzantium,&quot; &quot;Orthodox Theology,&quot; and &quot;Liturgical Worship,&quot; will be extremely helpful for those who wish to dig more deeply into specific areas of interest.While this may indeed be the definitive introductory book on Eastern Orthodoxy, it would certainly be more accessible to readers with some background in the Bible, Church history, or with some experience in liturgical churches. As the author suggests at one point, there is no better introduction to Orthodoxy than to actually attend an Orthodox Divine Liturgy. Those who have attended Orthodox services (or who have been members of the Church for a while) are likely to be those who are most drawn to this excellent book."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"If you are interested in a foundational understanding of the Orthodox Christian faith, start here. Father Ware does an excellent job in tracing the history of the Orthodox religion from the beginning days to the post-Berlin wall times. While some of the history is difficult to follow, it establishes an underpinning of why the Orthodox religion has endured virtually unchanged from the days of Acts.While the first half of the book deals with history, the second the the real meal here: Father Ware discusses the major tenants of what it means to be Orthodox. While his book didn't touch me as personally as Frederica Matthewes-Green's, it convinced me that there's much more to the Orthodox faith than I ever imagined."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"There has been a great surge of interest in Eastern Orthodoxy in recent years. Partly owing to the turn towards liturgical worship and historic Christianity by disenchanted Evangelicals, many have explored this great Christian tradition with a sizable number swelling its ranks. Almost without exception, one of the starting points on any such journey is The Orthodox Church by Timothy Ware (now Bishop Kallistos Ware). Books listed as entry points for conversion are often polemical works but this is not the case here. Instead, Ware calmly states the position of Orthodoxy on issues facing the Church without any hint of rancor towards other Christian traditions. It is a mature understanding of the Faith of the Church that is Ware's greatest strength.The irenic approach should not lead one to believe Ware is indifferent towards ecclesial affiliations. It is quite apparent he holds Orthodoxy as the one true Christian Faith. However, this does not lead him to wholesale condemnations of Christians in other traditions, but rather a clear contrast of the Orthodox position to those of the Western Churches.Originally written when Orthodoxy had few converts in the West, Ware (who became Orthodox in 1958) gives an overview of Orthodox Christianity for those in the West who might find its beliefs and practices alien.Intertwining theological and historical developments in the Church, Ware gives a highly readable analysis of the development of Orthodox doctrine and spirituality. The book is divided into two parts. The first of these presents an Orthodox view of Church history. Beginning with the early Church and working his way through the Ecumenical Councils, the spread of Christianity throughout Europe, the Islamic conquests, the Great Schism, the witness of the Russian Church, and the tumultuous events of the twentieth century, he presents an enlightening view of the development of doctrine and worship that is free from the vindictiveness that plagues many treatments.The second part of the book is an overview of faith and worship in the Orthodox Church. Covering all the important aspects of the Orthodox faith, Ware gives clear expositions of Orthodox doctrine and points out the contrasts with Western Christianity - both Protestant and Roman Catholic. Included are such controversial topics as the role of tradition, salvation, and ecumenism. Ware never displays any animosity towards other Christians but insists that any union must be based upon truth and he believes this is held in its fullness by Orthodoxy.One criticism leveled at this book is Ware's supposedly superficial treatment of Orthodoxy. However, this charge is quite unfair considering the intended audience. The Orthodox Church was written for a Western audience with no prior historical connection to the Orthodox faith. Yes, there are works with more depth (including some by Ware himself), but these are likely to confuse Western Christians. This book may thus be considered as a prologomena for future studies in Orthodoxy. Coming from a Western Christian upbringing and now an Orthodox bishop, Ware has a firm grasp of how to communicate the Orthodox faith to a Western audience. The fact that so many prominent converts cite The Orthodox Church as a turning point in their spiritual journey is evidence to its effectiveness. As an introduction to the riches of Orthodoxy, Ware's The Orthodox Church is unsurpassed."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"Bishop Ware has written an excellent text on the Orthodox Church. It is a solid primer as he deals with the history and the faith and worship of the church.The historical setting is solid and for the most part entertaining and interesting. He touches on the major highlights without overburdening the laity or reader who many are probably reading about this subject for the first time. After all, that seems to be the audience he is targeting.The second part, on faith and worship, is concise and simple. He throws in the major doctines of Orthodox beliefs in which they have in common with the rest of Christianity as well as some of the beliefs particular for this Eastern expression of the religion:i.e. essence and energies, apopthatic (negative theology), image and likeness. Further, he shows that this is not a monolithic movement in areas such as what makes up the Church.All the churches are mentioned and briefly discussed. Many saints are also mentioned and one comes away with a great appreciation of this historic Body of Christ."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"In his book, Bishop Ware offers not only a historical look at the Eastern Orthodox Church (singular), but a spiritual one as well. As a Melkite Greek Catholic I must confess a certain penchant for Orthodox writings (as most uniates do), and regard his grace as the foremost authority on the Orthodox Church living today. For any one who still may be confused in their association with the Eastern Church as nothing more than a relic of the past, I would recommend that they read this book. I would pass that admonition on to any lay Orthodox Christian who wants to supplement their knowledge of their church; as well as to any Roman Catholic who assumes that after Christ's Ascension, there was the papcy. There was, in fact, a pentarchy. An ecclesial fraternity of bishops existed. Such books are a wonderful reminder that our religion needs to be not only a witness to our theology--but to history as well.Read this book!!!"},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"Timothy (now Bishop Kallistos) Ware's book, The Orthodox Church, is a comprehensive, detailed, yet easy-to-read analysis of the history of Christianity, and in particular of the Eastern Orthodox Church. Having read the book more than 5 years ago for the first time, it was instrumental in my understanding of Christianity from its roots and in my eventual entrance into the Orthodox Church. But more than that, I find it an invaluable resource for use in Christian education (Sunday school and adult catechetical classes). Of particular interest is the thematic approach which anlayzes the periods of persecution faced by the Church throughout history, from ancient Rome to the Ottoman Empire to Soviet Russia. The book is balanced in its treatment of many of the historical issues between the churches of East and West, and in general presents the reader with a robust fact base and insightful historical analysis from which to draw his/her own conclusions about the relationship between the various churches in modern Christendom. A highly recommendable book for anyone looking for a serious yet not too heavy journey through the history of the Church, whether Orthodox or heterodox."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"When Bishop Ware first wrote this book, which was around 1970, it was truly a useful introduction to the Orthodox Church for those who know nothing about the subject. Since then, it suffers the sad fate of familiarity. Most educated Orthodox that I have met have read it, including probably almost all Orthodox clergy that are literate in English, and it has been criticized considerably in some quarters since then, particularly the sections on Orthodox eschatology, the sacraments and ecumenism. Sometimes these complaints are unfortunately and unfairly leveled based on the fact that Bishop Ware is an Anglican convert.Given that Orthodoxy, by its nature, has no infallible living authority on what it teaches, there is going to be dispute over what is &quot;correct.&quot; I believe that Bishop Ware wrote this book mainly to explain his faith to other Christians, and it should be appreciated on that basis; it was meant to be a starting point, not a definitive explanation of Orthodoxy. It is a good place to start on the subject, rather than with the spate of books on Orthodox spirituality that have been in vogue in the last ten years or so. If that's what you want, I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"In most Christian circles, the Orthodox Church is known as the forgotten church because many Christians do not even know of it's existence. Coming from an evangelical background I was in the same situation, until I attended college and was able to learn about this mysterious Church. Because of this sparked interest, I decided to pick up Bishop Ware's book and read it to discover more about the history and beliefs of the Orthodox Church.Basically, this book is a beginner's guide to the Orthodox Church. Ware begins by discussing the history and and events surrounding this 2,000 year old Christian institution. I believe that Ware's appraisal and handling of history was fair and accurate. When it came to discussing the various schisms that erupted between East and West he was, I believe, very fair and accurate. When discussing the root and causes of the permanent schism of 1054, he did not try to blame the Pope as some do, but instead showed that it was a tragic misunderstanding and lack of thorough communication that led to these events.In the second part of the book, Ware discussed Orthodox theology and beliefs. Everything from the nature of the Trinity, the Saints and Mary, the Sacraments, the Word of God, and spiritual life are examined. I liked how he handled the whole filioque controversy because it really shows that the Orthodox Church believes that dual procession is not the correct view. I never really understood on what basis they formulated their objections until I read this book. Also, Ware's discussion of sin and the fall was intriguing because I never knew the East avoided the Augustinian/Pelagian controversy.Finally, in the last part Ware attempts to show how the Orthodox Church views the other church bodies around her. Without a doubt, the church the Orthodox share the closest heritage with is the Catholic Church. Ware states that the East is willing to grant the Pope the position of primacy and honor that he deserves, but they are not willing to sacrifice the integrity of the other great Patriarchal sees at the expense of Roman jurisdictional claims. Also, Ware shows that the Orthodox Church has much in common with Anglicans, Lutherans, and other Protestant groups. Although there are many barriers which separate them, there is also hope for healing and reunification.All in all, an excellent introduction to the Orthodox Church. The only downside is that this book leaves you desiring more, but I guess that's why Bishop Ware has written other books which examine Orthodoxy on a deeper level."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"Metropolitan Kallistos Ware does an excellent job of laying out the Orthodox Church in a way that is easily understandable to Western Christians, yet there is enough depth to the book, so that even experienced Orthodox Christians can learn from it. Ware's treatment of the Church in this book answers most questions that people curious about the faith would have, and gives the inquirers a good foundation upon which to continue exploring Holy Orthodoxy. This book helps ease readers into the world of Orthodoxy, and rather than making it seem exotic and foreign, Ware helps the reader see the Church as something understandable, relatable, and above all, accessible.I would heartily recommend this to anyone who is researching the Eastern Orthodox Church, and especially those who are considering conversion; you will not be disappointed, and will come away with a better understanding of what 250 million+ Orthodox Christians believe."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"If you're new to the Orthodox Church, or you want to know all about the Orthodox Church, then this book is a must. It gives a good overview of what the Orthodox Church is about. It is detailed, but then not to the point that it will give you information overload. It is rather up to date (at least for its time of publication; the book doesn't delve much to post-Soviet Russia or Orthodoxy's recent presence in such places as The Philippines)--maybe Bishop Kallistos Ware should make an updated edition of it to include these things. Overall though, this is one of those highly-recommended books for anyone who wants to know more about the Orthodox Church."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"Having been educated in the West, Ware's historical and theological overview of Orthodoxy has become a widely used introduction to Orthodox Christianity in Western schools and is written with western sensitivities in mind. This makes his book an excellent starting point for the exploration of Orthodoxy for Christians in the West.All in all, Ware's book is perhaps the most engaging and helpful introduction to Orthodoxy available for the Western world. His enthusiastic tone and apologetical stance, far from making the book less commendable, will actually help the reader better sympathize with his Orthodox perspective. Ware's occasional explicit criticisms of his own tradition, sensitivity to Western concerns, summaries of why the Filioque could be considered heresy, frequent contrasts between Orthodox positions and Protestant or Catholic positions, all add to the value of his book and give it a delightful pungency. Although his treatment is terse by design, his last chapter, entitled \\"Further Readings,\\" conveniently lists numerous sources in topical order for those who wish to do further study. While his introduction to Orthodoxy is enlightening and elegant, much of his analysis is now outdated. One can only hope that soon, following Ware's example, a more up-to-date treatment of Orthodoxy will replace his now classical introduction."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"This is an informative book about the history and practices of the Eastern Orthodox church."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"\\"The Orthodox Church\\" by Timothy Ware (also known as Kallistos Ware) is probably the best introduction to the history and faith of the Eastern Orthodox churches.The author is an Orthodox bishop of British nationality, and his aim is to explain Orthodoxy to a Western audience. He succeeds relatively well in this. Of course, the book is partisan but some Orthodox believers nevertheless believe that Ware is too \\"soft\\". Another book by the same author, \\"The Orthodox Way\\", explains his view of Orthodox spirituality in more detail. That book is also quite easy to read.It should be noted that the historical chapters mostly deal with the Byzantine Empire and Russia. Relatively little is said about other Orthodox nations such as Serbia, Romania or Bulgaria. Apart from the historical chapters, there is also an extensive section on liturgy, the sacraments and Church organization.\\"The Orthodox Church\\" is recommended reading for the general reader who wants to know more about Eastern Orthodoxy in general and the Russian Orthodox Church in particular."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"Overall this is a good book.

He covers everything well, from church history to doctrine to liturgics to organization.It's no wonder that this book has made so many converts. I had already made the decision to become Orthodox (a decision I made 20 years ago and have never regretted), but this volume spurred me on my way with its lucid portrayal of the True Faith."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"This was the first book I read on a subject totally dedicated to describing the Orthodox Church. It was a good read in some ways, but I have to admit that Ware lost me in the second half of the book when he begins describing Orthodox theology. I am interested in Orthodox theology, but somehow Ware's book didn't do it for me. A better book in my opinion isThe Way: What Every Protestant Should Know about the Orthodox Churchby Clark Carlton, and alsoBecoming Orthodoxby Peter Gilquist. If you're Catholic there isThe Truth: What Every Roman Catholic Should Know about the Orthodox Churchalso by Carlton."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"This book is a good primer for the beliefs and history of the Orthodox Church. However, I think that to the layman, this book gets a bit bogged down in religious jargon, making it a little tough to get through."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"I was lent a copy of this by a student that noted the similarity of a presentation I gave in class of the ontological argument and a short discussion of the via negativa, since she recalled the word apophatic as being used in discussion at her Orthodox Church. I was not able to find the word for some reason and she lent me the book. (Sorry, my Greek is so very poor). For some reason with the book in hand I had no problems finding the word in my Liddell and Scott. I am most familiar with the Latin expression via negativa which is mentioned in the book. It was also interesting getting an overview of the Orthodox perspective via Timothy Ware.I also found reading the various reviews in amazon.com on the book interesting to see how different readers reacted to different parts of the book! There are some that give what I suppose are negative critiques from a certain point of view but positive from others. Considering the ecumenism towards which Churches are heading it seems merely silly to use negative critiques, but then some of those that are negative are from the view that the book is negative in light of the same movement towards ecumenism! How wonderfully enlightening to see so many sides of this issue all aroused by the book. This kind of interaction between readers is one of the most intriguing and useful things the Internet (and Amazon of course) has done for us. Thank you all for sharing your views!"},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"Orthodoxy is broken into 2 parts: history & dogma. Orthodox Christianity is the largest U.S. religion and America's best-kept secret. It's the \\"one true religion\\", because from it grew all other Christian religions; also it's never changed doctrine. Seemingly a cult, in its strictness: fasts, holiday observences, etc. Not so--Orthodox pray to God, not to a man; it's their choice, not a forced issue. Bishop Ware details the devil's 3 chief weapons: 1) delay in nearing Christ/a spirit of sloth, \\"put off church till next week\\" or \\"tell them you love them later\\", or \\"do this or that in 15 minutes\\", but unfortunately most of us never follow through with our good intentions; 2) that there's no hell--too late, too many of us are already living in it; 3) that God does not exist (that's harder to effect--too many of us know him personally). The trinity is true diversity: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, 3 distinct personalities, in a constant movement of love."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"I gave this book 3 Stars, since it does do a decent job of what it set out to do -- describe the history and basic theology of the Orthodox Church.But I had to knock it a couple of stars because of the author's sometimes extreme ignorance of the rest of Christendom. He frequently makes false or foolish assertions about what he calls \\"the West\\" which is quite surprising for a Bishop of any church.He frequently presents false \\"East vs West\\" arguments, when what he really means by \\"West\\" is actually Roman Catholicism or, at most RC and Lutheranism. With the exception of sparse references to \\"Calvinists\\" in discussions of free will, and some bare mention of mainline protestants in his discussion of ecumenism, Kallistos Ware seems oblivious to the bulk of protestant and evangelical groups.One example is when he talks about the \\"West\\" being focused on the Cross and Christ's death, whereas the \\"East\\" is focused on the Resurrection. This is very funny, considering this is one of Protestants' standard accusations towards the Roman Catholic church.With the exception of the Anglican/Episcopal church (which actually has a good balance), most Protestants don't celebrate Good Friday or Holy Saturday, but only focus on Easter. However, Ware lumps them in with Roman Catholicism as \\"The West.\\"He also claims that the East has more focus on the Holy Spirit. He might actually have a point here... again, at least against traditional RC and mainline Protestantism.However, he does not go into any details supporting this, while at the same time ignoring RC/Anglican Charismatic movements and Evangelical Pentecostalism. This might have been a very interesting discussion, comparing and contrasting Eastern vs Charismatics/Pentecostal views of how the Holy Spirit interacts and works through believers. But he does not even mention these non-Orthodox Holy Spirit focused movements.I bought this book to understand Orthodox better, and this book does do that -- thus the three stars. But there are too many flaws in the book to give it an above average rating."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"As a recent convert to Orthodoxy I found this book valuable as a general overview of the One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church that the Lord said \\"shall not perish.\\" \\"All Protestants ARE crypto-paptist,\\" as it says on the first page. Any Protestant that disagrees, refuses to acknowlegde the fact that the Reformation didn't put an end to the RCC it simply democratized it and made everyone Pope. Now we all can run around and interpret scripture anyway we please. I like being a member of the Eastern Orthodox Church because the Roman Catholics are alwas adding to Christianity and the Protestants are alwas taking away. The Eastern Orthodox Church (the Church that gave the world the Bible)has never felt or seen the need for such heresy because they have alwas maintained the original true doctine of christ, \\"that he is the same yesterday, today and forever.\\" It must be noted that in the the schism of 1054a.d. the Roman Catholic Church choose to leave the Church founded by Christ himself and Luther seriously mis-interpreted what Paul said and ment when he(Martin Luther) created the tradition of faith alone (Sola Fide)as many Protestant biblical theologians have concluded see: [Paul and Palestinian Judaism by E.P. Sanders] and [Paul among Jews and Gentiles by K. StendahlWhat did the Lord tell the \\"certain ruler\\" when he asked him \\"what must I do to inhereit eternal life?\\" Luke 18:18-20. Also Matt 17:27 For the Son of Man will come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and then He will reward each according to his works. John 5:29 and come fourth-those who have done good, to the resurrection of life. 2 Corinthians 5:10. Romans 2:6 righteous judgment of God who will render to each one according to his deeds. In short, if anyone tries telling you that salvation is somehow easy, simple and cheap, run! don't walk in the other direction...."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"Overall, this is an excellent introduction to modern Eastern Orthodoxy. However, I think that there are some serious flaws in it. As a Latin-rite Catholic myself, I was struck by the method by which Timothy Ware constantly picks out the most minute differences between Eastern Orthodoxy and Roman Catholicism, and then gives detailed criticisms of the Western tradition (although he may be slightly vindicated by the fact that he is often just reporting many of the attitudes of modern Orthodoxy). To the reader, (and sadly this is the case in a lot of Orthodox circles) it seems that that Western theological positions or modes of worship are either scorned or condemned for simply not being Eastern. This attitude is exemplified in the content of the book's Introduction. One gets the impression that the writer is concerned to define Orthodoxy, not by what it is, but by what it is not."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"Most Roman Catholics or individuals who are members of other christian denominations, for the most part, know very little about the Orthodox Church. This can be said for many Orthodox faithful themselves, too, especially in the todays secular society. And those who are interested in educating themselves about the Orthodox Church, considering the view held by themajority of the other reviews, would presume that this book is an excellent choice in providing an introduction to the history and beliefs of the Orthodox Church. Unfortunately that is not the really the case, since Timothy Ware, particularily in his re-telling of the history and to a lesser degree in his explanation of theological matters, has a tendecy to gloss-over, misrepresent, and erroniously define and explain, important events and subjects.This is quite evident as soon as one begins to read the opening pages of the book. Firstly he quotes the anti-papist Othodox theologian Alexis Khomiakov (quoted throughout the book) describing the Pope (ie., the successor of St. Peter) as \\"the first Protestant\\" and the \\"father of German rationalism.\\" Quotes, to be sure, not grounded on any historical or theological facts, but based upon the opinion and belief that any idea, custom, person, dogma or article of faith whose origin is western in nature, especially since the Great Schism, is contrary to that of the True Faith, held of course, by the Orthodox church. While it would be unfair to say that Timothy Ware holds steadfast to this view, since he professes to be an ecuminist, he nevertheless endlessly quotes and cites historians and theologians who adamently do.A telling example of how he glosses over important historical events that are crucial to understanding the nature of the Church are noticable in Chapter One. After just six pages describing the beginning of the Church, the reader is instantly brought forth with the topic of \\"The Church of the Seven Councils.\\" There is virtually no mention whatsoever of the importance of Apostic Succession in determaning Patriarchates, since, undoubtably, this would later put in question the position of Constantinople-originally subject to the metropolitan authority of Heraclea-amongst Rome, Antioch, and Alexandria. That being said, throughout this book evidence that does not fall in line with the typical and current view held by the Orthodox Church in similar instances is simply ignored.His chapter on the Great Schism is the most telling in the entire book. It is intellectually dishonest and many of the facts are distored, if not unmentioned. Initially the five grievances -fasting on Saturday, not beginning Lent till Ash Wednesday (instead of three days earlier as in the East), not allowing priests to be married, not allowing priests to administer confirmation, and the addition of the Filioque to the creed-brought forth by Photius are minimized to two:the Papacy (not included in the original five) and the Filioque. So much for consistancy.These are just some of the examples one can cite in defending the fact that Timothy Ware's book is neither a viable or worthy introduction into such a topic. Rather, the book entitled \\"The Eastern Orthodox Church\\" written by Adrian Fortescue is a much more intellectually consistant and historically accurate presentation-if one is seriously considering learning more about this subject instead of just reaffirming previously held convictions."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"Any non Greek Orthodox person should take great caution in reading this book as it is in no way a definitive book on The Orthodox Church. Where Ware excels in explaining a very condensed history of The Orthodox Church he loses all credibility by throwing in Greek Orthodox propaganda. Please note, The Philokalia and The Jesus Prayer which are mentioned multiple times in this book are not widely used in the Russian Orthodox Church. Somehow he exemplifies the troubles of the Russian Orthodox Church under communist rule but barely discuses the widespread corruption in the Greek Orthodox Church. He almost goes to the point of saying that the \`locum tenens' aren't part of the \`real' Orthodox Church. Many would argue that these are the \\"True Orthodox Church.\\" Chapter 16 \\"The Orthodox Church and the Reunion of Christians\\" is nothing more than an editorial. His support of the Anglican Church and his distaste for the Roman Church is nothing more than ecumenism. The truly sad aspect of this book is that it is one of the only English written Orthodox books on the market. Hopefully a less biased book will be available in the future."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"Timothy, now Bishop Ware, has some errors in this narrative: namely that the Eastern Orthodox Church does not have a purgatory. We most certainly do, in the idea of the 'Bosom of Abraham' from the gospel of Luke, where the righteous are separated out from the wicked (in the advent of the WTC massacre we prayed today on Rememberance Friday for those dead to be safe 'in the Bosom of Abraham').In this same section, he says we do not allow a working off of evil deeds in (this non-existent) purgatory; again this is wrong, we do have the notion of penintential work for the evil but whether this does any good at the Final Judgement of the Second Coming we do not speculate.This is the largest of several errors that mar this book; otherwise it is largely well done but unfortunately not a very inspired text; I think it needs a revision &amp; could only recommend it with reservations because they unknowing may think that this book is an accurate portrayal of the Eastern Orthodox faith."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"For anybody, who wish to learn about the Orthodox Church, and Christianity in general for that matter, this book is \\"must-read\\".."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"This book is an excellent introduction to Orthodoxy for western Chrisitians. Bishop Ware gives a very good survey of the history of the Orthodox Church including the theological problems which separate Orthodoxy from Catholicism. This book was one of the first stepping stones to my own coversion to Orthodoxy. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"His Grace's introduction to Orthodoxy has become a classic for all those looking into the Orthodox Faith. It was my first volume, and I have now been Orthodox for almost two years. He does well in most areas of the book, but the chapter concerning \\"the reunion of Christians\\" which was not in earlier editions, is rife with a spirit of theological relativism. He expresses his hopes that the Orthodox and the monophysites would re-establish communion with one another, praising the initial meetings held in Addis Ababa in the 60s. What he failed to mention, however, was that those theological conferences were denounced and decried by Orthodox all over the world, including the monks of Mt. Athos.I would like to have read the real Orthodox position, highlighting our eagerness for all to join our communion, but NOT through compromise, but through their acceptance of Orthodox faith. The dogmas laid down by the holy fathers of the Ecumenical Councils are not up for discussion."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"!!!The book and what I found inside!!!This book intends to be an introduction and quick survey of Eastern Orthodoxy. It surpasses these goals magnificently!Being a novice . . . No, that is too polite. Being blasted ignorant of Eastern Orthodoxy, I decided to pick up this book to help open my eyes and my mind to this great religious tradition. This book has absolutely blown me out of the water. I was surprised to see similarities with my denomination (The Church of Jesus Christy of Latter-day Saints), and the Eastern Orthodox tradition.Some tidbits: The Orthodox Church baptizes children by immersion three times: once in the name of the Father, once in the name of the Son, and once in the name of the Holy Ghost. They method of confirming children is similar to \\"Last Rites,\\" where they anoint and bless the forehead, eyes, ears, mouth, hands and feet individually as part of the ceremony. Also in their wedding ceremonies, the Orthodox Church literally crowns the couple, symbolic of man's triumph in marriage.What was most appealing was the idea of Theosis, or for man's ability to become God. We do not partake of His essence; we just partake of his power. This idea has roots in the Old Testament (Ps. 82:10), and early Christianity (2 Peter 1:4). St. Athanasius said that God became man, so that men might be god (On the Incarnation, 54), and Anglican C. S. Lewis has also elaborated on this idea in Mere Christianity (Book IV, ch. 9 \\"Counting the Cost), and also his address called \\"Weight of Glory\\" in the book by the same name. There is an old idea here that the Western traditions of Protestantism and Roman Catholicism have lost, but have survived in the Eastern Orthodox sanctuary, and have been heartily embraced.There is so much common ground here, I wonder why we bicker so much and have such nasty civil wars among ourselves. I hope this book can serves as bridge of understanding and appreciation among the different traditions of Christianity!The book has several historical chapters, staring with the early councils, up until the time of the Reformation. Other sections deal with Eastern Orthodox belief and practice, and there is large \\"For further reading\\" section in the end. I bought this book on several recommendations here on Amazon.com, and I was not let down!"},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"this book i s exactly what one would expect of a Penguin book written by a british author. Frighteningly erudite but also a bit dry and unlively. Only two real criticisms can I list that i also think would be of interest to a potential buyer. One: the author does not really explain in a SIMPLE, PLAIN way how the orthodox church is governed. It is not called byzantine for nothing and you will see why after you have read the book. There must be some way of making the subject simpler and this book did not do it. Two: the history, level, and extent of corruption of the byzantine church along with the horrendous anti-semitism that the church has been accused of is just barely covered in this book and hardly noticeable. One scarcely knows whether to believe the accusations or not. Overall a fine piece of work. But the reader should be aware that if he wants to find a primer on church government or an in depth history this is certainly not the book nor i suppose was it intended to be."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"A little bit dated now, but still the standard and best introduction to the Orthodox Church for English-speakers. I hope Metropolitan Kallistos issues a third edition of the book."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"This book offers a great overview of the Orthodox Church. From the beginning of the Christian faith and the formation of the Christian Church, this book details the unchanging history and doctrine of the true Christian Church.This book is great for people just interested in the faith, to the Orthodox faithful who want to deepen their understanding."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"I throughly enjoyed Ware's book on Orthodoxy. It has helped me to see that there is a true ancient option to the western scholastic tradition. As a Pentecostal I have found that the parallels between Pentecostal practice and Orthodox theology are much closer than with reformed protestantism and the Roman Church. Ware's work is one I reference often and refer others to for a starting point of understanding the mystical and experience based theologies of Christendom."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"When any inquirer asks me about books to read on the Orthodox Church, this is one of the two books that I always recommend.

Read this!"},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"This book is certainly a good reference for learning about this denomination. It gives a lot of history, and tells how Eastern Orthodox Christians view Protestants and Roman Catholics. It also gives good insights as to HOW this denominatation came up with their beliefs, which has a different methodology from other branches of Christianity. As a native American, I found the names of cities, people, and countries to make the reading tedious at times. Readers who are more familiar with the history of Eastern Europe would undoubtedly find it easier reading than I did."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"This title provides a captivating look at the Orthodox Church, past, present, and future. While not written as such, the first few chapters indeed present themselves quite excitingly. One can tell that the early and Byzantine church was a period of which the author is very proud.However, when relating the history of the church in the early 20th century, the author tends to become a bit confusing, which is somewhat understandable considering the times in which the book was written.Most of the text is still relevant, but as the Iron Curtain fell, the position of the church in former Soviet republics changed. For historians of Eastern Europe during the Cold War Era, this presents a captivating viewpoint of a theologian struggling to advocate for a faith tradition that is long, proud, and storied, but for general readers this section may indeed be useless, because much of that information is now anachronistic."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"A friend of the family gave me a copy of 'Journey' by Peter France which tells the story of how he discovered Orthodoxy after many years of being an atheist. A true cynic, France was left cold by many of the religions he read about. But finally he was so inspired by Orthodoxy that he had himself baptised on the island of Pathos.That book inspired me and in it France mentions 'The Orthodox Church', so I decided to buy a copy.It is an excellent introduction to Orthodoxy. The historical background is both essential and fascinating. The explanation of faith and worship is relatively easy to understand and what struck me the most is how much religion has been intellectualised. But that this is essential to the practice of the faith.If Orthodoxy is of interest you, look no further than this book."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"As concise a meaningful history of the church you can get, along with a doctrinal overview of ancient Christianity. A great book for inquirers (I can't speak otherwise &lt;grin>). This book played a meaningful role in my discovery of authentic Christianity - the true ancient Church.Bishop Kallistos (Timothy) Ware is Greek Orthodox and a Brit, so you will understandably read his tendency to gravitate in those particular directions. It's still a great book for those of us in other jurisdictions and locales.After this book, make SURE to take your reading to the next level and read The Law of God, by Father Seraphim Slobodsky."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"If you are interested in the Orthodox Church or want to know what they believe and why, then this is the book for you.

It is a scholarly account of the history and faith of the Orthodox Church which should be read by all Christians. As a Byzantine Rite Catholic (in communion with Rome) I also appreciate the nonpolemical tone of the book and the willingness to honestly discuss the issues that divide the Western and Eastern Churches."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"As a Reformed Christian, I enjoyed this book immensely. It really helped me feel that I understand the Orthodox Church and many of its beliefs. The theological section was interesting and deep, though understandable. The history section is absolutely superb and led me to want to study more about the history of Byzantium. Top notch for anyone looking into this rich tradition and heritage."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"I just bought the book to get some kind of understanding of the Orthodox faith, and this book gave me that and a lot more.The book for me personally was somewhat of a journey into learning about a faith I knew almost nothing about. I truly got into reading this book in Oct. 2003, and ended up getting Baptized in the Orthodox Church in Jan. 2004. That alone kind of speaks volumes about the book's impact on my life."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"If you want to know about the history of the Eastern Orthodox Church, this is the book you need to read.

There is a helpful bibliography in back as well."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"As someone who has lived in countries in which the Orthodox Church is the dominant form of Christianity (my background is Protestant), I have always been curious and wanted an easily accessible and comprehensive introduction. Well, this book is it! It might be dated by a few years, but given the several millennia that are involved, what is a decade or so?! Read it if you have an interest in the subject, want something clear and accessible, and keeps your interest about as well as something like this can."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"If you know little of the history or theology of the Orthodox Church but desire to learn more, this is a good place to start. I suspect that many Orthodox believers will find this book of interest as well. The author, an Orthodox bishop, wrote this book primarily to explain the Orthodox faith to the (non-Orthodox) English speaking world. The first half of the book summarizes the history of the Church, the second half doctrinal and theological issues. The Orthodox tradition is much more closely linked to the cultural and national identities (e.g. Greek and Russian Orthodox) of its adherents than either the Catholic or Protestant traditions, so Church history and national history of traditionally Orthodox people are intertwined. Bishop Ware discusses the early development of the Church, the first Ecumenical Councils, the Great Schism with the Catholic Church, and the Church under the Ottoman Empire and under the Communists. The second part of this book is the most interesting in my opinion. Bishop Ware presents the Orthodox view on the most important theological issues including the nature of God, God's relationship with man, and the organization and functioning of God's church on Earth. He writes with a concise, readable prose and avoids getting side tracked on narrow points of theological or philosophical discussion that are probably not of interest to a general audience. It is a clear, direct exposition of Orthodox faith and beliefs. Throughout the book, theological differences with other Christian traditions are highlighted. If you want to understand the basics of Orthodox theology, this is an excellent starting point. This is a well-written, informative book and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"Encountering Eastern Orthodoxy:Since 1935, when Bulgakov's, 'The Orthodox Church' was made available in English, two key books were written, both in 1963, one by Dr. Ernst Benz, an expert on Orthodoxy, a Russian speaker and professor of Church history, bridging the East / West gap in tradition, culture, and political ideas. The other book was written by Dr. Timothy Ware, later consecrated an Orthodox Greek Bishop, in 1982. While Bulgakov intended his book to introduce E. O. to Western Christians, mainly in Tradition, Hierarchy, and Doctrine, Ware's presentation was as History, Faith and Worship. Since then John Binns, Anthony Coniaris, John Chryssavgis, Daniel Clendenin and others wrote good introductions for the same subject. One authoritative study was written by late Dr. Aziz Atiya on the Oriental Churches (History of Eastern Christianity), in addition to many books on Coptic Christianity by the Late Coptologist Dr. Meinardus.Eastern Orthodox Church:The Eastern Orthodox claim to be the Church founded originally by Lord Jesus Christ, and maintained by His disciples, the Apostles, upon whom the Holy Spirit descended and through whom orthodox tradition is handed through Apostolic succession from one generation to the next, right up to the present, and until the end of all ages.The body of those contemporary traditional churches, include the Greek and Russian Orthodox, with the remnants of the Byzantine ecclesiastics, adhering to the Byzantine rite, who acknowledge the honorary primacy of the patriarch of Constantinople. The Eastern Christian churches, have a membership of over 250 million worldwide, mainly concentrated in the Middle East and Eastern Europe. All Orthodox generally agree doctrinally, accepting the first seven councils as ecumenical, regarding the bishop of Rome as the first between Equals (Primus intra Paris) rejecting his jurisdiction as Pope (Supreme father). The Ancient Oriental Churches (Armenians, Coptic, Ethiopian, and Syrian) who follow Cyril of Alexandria (one united nature of the incarnate Word) separated, after Chalcedon, from the Easterners who agreed on Leo's Tome of the dual nature of Christ.Orthodox Church History:The scope of 'Part One of this book' as defined by the author (pp.40), \\"makes no claim to cover the Christian east in its full complexity, will not be concerned directly with these 'Oriental Orthodox,...\\" The reader should be reminded that those Orientals consist of the two leading churches during the first six centuries of Christianity, the Church of Alexandria, ardent defender of true Orthodoxy, and of Antioch where the faithful were first called Christians. Theological dialogues between the two have established orthodox doctrine, while newcomer Constantinople and its Caesar-papist Byzantine Church was the corrupters of Orthodoxy. Ware proceeds from Byzantium, expounding the seven councils of the Church, to the great schism, with an overview of the conversion of the Slavs. The Church under Islam tells the story of the Christian east under siege, where ecclesiastic leadership traveled to Moscow, the third Rome. The last three chapters on History expose the Orthodox Church, in the twentieth century, in three essays; Greeks & Arabs, the Communist assault, and Orthodoxy in Diaspora.Faith and Worship:Part Two is evidently the jewel of this book, elaborating on faith and worship, the center of gravity of the Orthodox Church life. Dr. Timothy Ware discusses the inner meaning of tradition in Orthodoxy, as the source of the orthodox faith. In the following chapters, the orthodox scholar produces one of the best concise systematic orthodox theology essays, with a genuine patristic flavor; God in Trinity, Anthropological theology, articulating orthodox positions on Image and liking, original sin, grace and free will. Now, introducing Lossky's mystical theology, he concludes with the goal of Christian life: Theosis, or partaking of Divine nature. His orthodox methodology is so graceful, and his knowledge of Alexandrine Orthodoxy and the desert fathers mysticism is great. He keeps flowing, while exposing unorthodox concepts, starting with the Roman Church's Filioque, up to the schismatic Papal infallibility. The peak of orthodox teachings is the Church, the mystical body of Christ, its unity in space and time, and its infallibility in ecumenicity. Orthodox Mariology, the Theotokos, Panagia Tiparthena Maria, was started in Alexandria, defended by Cyril is being contrasted with the immaculate Conception. Intercession and the Last things, the Parousia. Khomiakov has a prominence in Ware's conception of orthodoxy. In the last chapters, he presents orthodox worship, as described to Vladimir, in 'the Earthly Heaven'. The seven sacraments are explored, and followed with feasts, fasts and private prayer.Ware's Graceful Approach:Ware's approach proved very valuable, in making Eastern Orthodoxy comprehensible to Western Christians, elaborating on common doctrines that unite, and addressing issues that divide Christians of East and West, since 1054 AD. Due to his background as a Briton, who read Classics and theology at Oxford, and at a relatively early age chose to embrace Eastern Orthodoxy, Ware is particularly well-situated to explain the wonders and mysteries of Eastern Christianity that fascinated him, he compares his experience with that of St. Vladimir's conversion."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"For any Western reader lacking prior contact with Orthodoxy, this book is the single best one-volume introduction to the history and theology of the Eastern Orthodox Church. Ware, himself an Orthodox Bishop, divides his discussion into two parts: an outline of the Church's history followed by an overview of Orthodox faith and worship. Given the scope of its topic, the book is quite brief, and in places finer details (especially regarding Church history) are skimmed over. Even so, this brevity generally makes the work more readable for people unfamiliar with Orthodoxy who are seeking to understand the most basic elements of the Church's history and practice. For readers desiring more in-depth explorations of specific historical periods or theological issues, the provided bibliography is an excellent starting point. I highly recommend this book to anyone beginning an inquiry into Orthodoxy.One more thing: Ware unapologetically writes from the perspective of a committed Orthodox Christian, so it should be no surprise that this work is not \\"unbiased.\\" If you are looking for an objective or forensic reconstruction of facts and events (which is arguably impossible even when an author intends it), this is not the book for you. This book attempts, rather, to explain history and theology as the Orthodox Church understands it, an understanding that is itself necessarily filtered through the author's subjective experience within the Church. I (obviously) found this to be a positive aspect of Ware's approach."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"Timothy Ware has written an excellent but brief history of the development of the Eastern Orthodox Church from the Apostolic period of Christianity to the present state. It is a MUST for anyone who is contemplating converting to Eastern Orthodox Christianity, renewing your Orthodox Christian Faith and for those who are curious about the Orthodox Church. I for my part, who am contemplating converting from Roman Catholicism to Eastern Orthodoxy have found it so rewarding and enlightening. It was a good start for me on my quest/journey to the ancient Church of the Apostles."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"An Orthodox archpriest told me the tale of a meeting a few years ago with Bishop Kallistos (Tim Ware). The priest, a convert, told the Bishop how this book, \\"The Orthodox Church,\\" had brought him to Orthodoxy and then added \\"but I suppose you hear that all time time.\\" Bishop Kallistos, with great British mirth replied, \\"Well, yes, but tell me again, anyway!\\"Maybe we all need to be told again, anyway, about the Orthodox faith--the original church of the Apostles, still there and waiting. Many have described it as \\"America's best-kept secret.\\" If so, then this book, still in print after 40 years and becoming a real classic, is perhaps the decoder for that secret. Clearly written by an Oxford Don, the book falls into two halves-- a short history of the eastern Church and a modest recapitulation of Orthodox doctrine. Both parts are worth reading, but you could read either half alone!One star off the top because when the book was written, the USSR was ascendant and Orthodoxy in Russia was close to its nadir. Despite a quick update some years back, the old grudge against the godless regime still echoes a bit too strongly.Despite this, \\"The Orthodox Church\\" is a fabulous overview and worth reading, whether you are seeking or not. Maybe you are an Inquirer and like Prince Vladimir are a \\"merchant in search of fine pearls.\\" Maybe you also will \\"send servants to Constantinople for the Orthodox Faith\\" and \\"find Christ the Priceless Pearl.\\"On the other hand, maybe you are just interested in studying a bit about Orthodox history and doctrine. Either way, it's hard to beat this book.And, reviewers from outside the Orthodox Faith should please remember that the Orthodox Way is to love one another as we love God and that we should respect and love each and every person as a unique and loved creation of God. Play nice!"},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"This book clearly outlines the history, though, and practices of Eastern Orthodox Christians, and has become the standard introductory text (both for private and classroom use) when learning about Orthodox Christianity. There are some valid critiques of the book, and some of the changes that have been made over the years, and these critiques are easily found online. But whatever the case, despite certain changes, this book remains in the minds of most the most important first text for a person interested in learning about Orthodoxy to read. Read in conjunction with His Grace's other book, The Orthodox Way, a person begins to catch a glimpse of what Orthodoxy is about, once you get past all the ethnicity and other secondary elements."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"Clearly written, balanced, factual explanation of the history and practices of the Orthodox Church.

An excellent resource."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"I echo the sentiment of many readers that this must be the best intro to Eastern Orthodoxy to date - its history and beliefs - in an honest, even-handed and concise one-volume work, striking a delicate balance between depth and breadth for people new to this fascinating branch of Christianity.While this book makes for insightful and enjoyable reading, one cannot help but feel the pain for what the Body of Christ had to be dragged through over fine points of doctrines and nuances in terminology(eg monophysitism, the filioque clause, etc )and personal viewpoints (Possessors vs Non-possessors). When the contention for political power and control entered the mix, it became an even sorrier mess. Ironically, the Eastern Christians received a relatively more humane treatment from the Islamic powers that be during the Turkish rule than brothers of their own kind when they disagreed. Alexander Solzenitsyn must take the cake for his poignant remark that 'the line between good and evil runs right through the middle of each of us,...that deep within even the best of men, there is still a small corner of evil.'Still, Kallistos Ware offers a glimmer of hope when he points to promising signs of reconciliation in recent dialogues with the non-Chalcedonian brothers, the Catholic Church and the Anglicans. This is the sort of movement that the world longs to see - a visible, concrete manifestation of Christian charity among Christ's followers. Reading this book is itself a good start in reclaiming our common heritage, owning both the good and bad chapters of our common history and embracing a faith that allows for a rich diversity of faith languages and expressions and recognising that at the foot of the cross, we are all sinners in need of grace."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"This is an absolute must read for any person either interested or already Orthodox and wanting more information. This is the book which helped me decide I wanted to become Orthodox. I was looking for the original church built by the Apostles on Christ and this revealed to me the Orthodox Church was what I had been looking for. It is well written and explains many things in a way Protestants can easily understand. Even if you are not interested in becoming an Orthodox Christian, this is a great over view of the church in a historical sense."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"I knew virtually nothing about this Church, despite the fact it dates from the time of Jesus Christ.I've read a few customer reviews, and like them, this book was recommended as a way of introduction to Orthodoxy.If you'd like to know about this very old, but very much living Church, this is it.On a negative note however, most of the book deals with the historical development of the Orthodox Church(es). Some of this involves dogma, but it's only at the end that we get into the nitty gritty of the faith.Having come from a Catholic background, I find Orthodoxy a lot more gentler... less authoritarian."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"For anyone wanting to know more about Orthodoxy, or for those who know little to nothing this book is an essential addition to your reading list. So much information packed into this small book. Come away with confident knowledge of Orthodox worship and history, along with customs."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"This is the definitive work on Orthodoxy in English. It is the book I recommend to anyone who wants to know more about the Orthodox Church. It helps to explain the different national heritages the church embraces and, foremost, the is the history of the Christian church from its beginning."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"The book is divided into 2 parts. First is a detailed history of the Orthodox church which naturally includes world history as well. It can get rather &#34;heady&#34; in this section. The 2nd part is much more geared to theology and the praxis of the Orthodoxy. Much more readable for the layman.I would not recommend this book for an inquirer just beginning to investigate Orthodoxy unless they had a degree in theology. However, for someone who has been around the faith it is a comprehensive review of its history and practice."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"A lucid, well written, non-polemic introduction to the Orthodox faith for both the inquirer and life long member of the church. This short book attempts to cover the history and beliefs ot this ancient tradition and does so remarkably well. A great starting point for the layperson and student of the faith; or, for that matter, anyone who wonders what goes on inside that &quot;little church on the corner with the funny roof&quot;."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"Ware provides a good description of the Orthodox Church with its history and current practices in a way that does not confuse or overly confound."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"Bishop Kallistos' book is brilliant, concise yet thorough. He covers history (in relation to the West as well), theology, worship--the essence of Orthodoxy--and so much more. If one could memorize every word (and every word in this book is like a paragraph in others), one would know the essence of everything Orthodox. Probably no other book on Orthodoxy as been as read as this one. I have used it in classes for many years. [N.B. The reviewer, Mr. Harding, appears to have an ax to grind. Since his was the only negative review on the initial page, I think it a bit disingenuous of Amazon.Com to feature it first.]"},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"Very clear and understandable book about Orthodox Christianity: its history, dogmas, and struggles with Turkish occupation and Western Christianity."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"This book was exactly what I was looking for -- an introduction into the beliefs of the Orthodox Church and how it differs from the Roman Catholic Church. Concise and precise. I enjoyed reading it and it is a good research book."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"As a person who recently converted to Orthodox Christianity, I am continually amazed at how invisible the \\"Eastern\\" Church is to those in the \\"West.\\" Fortunately we have in the person of Timothy or Bp. Kallistos Ware, a bold, eloquent, and scholarly apologist, who is able to present a great deal of material, which might otherwise be dry, in a clear-headed and thought provoking manner.For anyone who is interested in the history of the Great Schism and the theological matters surrounding it, or the beliefs and practices of the Orthodox Church, this book is simply the finest guide available. I read it first several years ago and I find myself going back to it again and again for clarification and insight."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"As one who has searched long and hard for a respectable, comprehensive overview of the Orthodox Church, I can recommend this little volume quite highly. I was somewhat disappointed by its brevity, but it is the most thorough treatment of the subject available. No significant aspect of Orthodox history, tradition, or institutions is left unaddresed."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"This was the first book that I read about Orthodoxy, and with the benefit of hindsight I must say that I couldn't have done any better. Bishop Ware is himself a convert to Orthodoxy, so he is keenly aware of what the novice to Orthodoxy needs to learn. He is one of the world's foremost scholars on the Orthodox Church, yet his writing is lucid and approachable.Like all of the world's faiths, Orthodoxy is practiced and understood, at least a little differently, from person to person and nation to nation. One of the many things that Bishop Ware does so brilliantly in this book, is to transcend these issues and to introduce the reader to the core values of Orthodox spirituality.The Orthodox Church is filled with wonderful surprises for the uninitiated. It is the closest thing we have to the earliest, familiar expressions of Christianity, while possessing a decidedly \\" Eastern \\" outlook that is refreshing and unique. Bishop Ware is able to express this quality in a compelling and enjoyable fashion."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"A must read for anyone even remotely interested in religion. Written with love for the orthodox church and compassion for other christian churches. Provides a refreshing investigation into the mystical aspects of Faith in contrast with the bookish literalism of recent fundamentalists and the scholastic dogmatism of Roman Catholocism, (of whom I am one). A great, insightful contribution aimed for the 20th century reader."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"This is an excellent work which provides the reader a very good history of Orthodox Christianity. If one is a searcher, by that looking to find a new church home after becoming disenchanted with the various demoninations in the Western Church, then this should be on one's reading list.Bishop Ware does not push any of the various Orthodox jursidictions in his work. What he has done is given a very solid history of Orthodox Christianity along with the basic tenents of Orthodox faith."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"Always a benchmark, Timothy Ware's new edition retains the best of the original, which is most of it, while dealing thoughtfully with changes that have occurred since its introduction over 40 years ago, such as the fall of the Soviet Union, the growing importance of the Orthodox diaspora, and the evolution of the ecumenical movement."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"I used this as a text for university Russian Culture course for a quarter century, and thirteen years after retirement I had to order the book a fourth time, having loaned it out to three other American Episcopalians who neglected to return it. I only hope they keep consulting it, as I do. It's first-rate: beautifully written and organized, equally good for theology and cultural history. I have never read theology so lucidly and impartially explained. I reread it with undiminished pleasure."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"I think Timothy Ware (Bishop Kallistos) presents a good concise history of Eastern Orthodoxy, as well as a balanced view of the \\"The Great Schism.\\" Timothy's sentiments go beyond a mere intellectual appeal for Christian unity and suggest that we have both, East and West, been \\"grievously impoverished\\" by our separation. As he states (p.61),\\"The Greek east and the Latin west still need one another. For both parties the great schism has proved to be a great tragedy.\\""},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"I think this is an excellent book for those like me who want to know more about the Orthodox Church. I became orthodox myself some time ago but always wanted to undestand many things of the history of our Church so I think this is THE book.I specially recomend it to those who consider the Orthodox Church a great mistery, something distant and very different of the western Church. You'll find out that exist a lot of differences between both churches but you will also realize there is so much in common.If you are considering a book to learn more about the Orthodox Church, this your book."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"Metropolitan Kallistos Ware's The Orthodox Church is a thorough explanation on the often complicated subject of the Eastern Orthodox faith. This edition makes the Orthodox Church a relatively simple read and understandable both to Orthodox Christians and non Orthodox alike."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"Bishop KALLISTOS Ware is very open minded and an eloquent writer. Studying Orthodoxy, this book is invaluable.If you are studying Orthodoxy (in general), this is a must have. He does not focus, or side, with one cultural group or the other (Greek vs. Antiochian vs. Russian, etc...) but gives information pertaining to Orthodoxy as a whole, since truly, it does not matter which cultural form of Orthodoxy you practice, the end result is still Orthodoxy.While not a long and involved book, I still find myself going back to it time and again.Definitely one to share and/or add to your own collection."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"This book is a must read for anyone considering Orthodoxy. This book gives a nice historical overview of the Orthodox Church, including keeping doctrines in the context of the Church's movement across the centuries."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"This book is a very concise yet detailed history of the Eastern Church from its beginnings until the late 20th century. In addition to covering the seven ecumenical councils it provides a fascinating overview of why the Eastern and Western churches divided irreconcilably by the middle of the eleventh century."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"This delightful book will serve anyone interested in Orthodoxy uniquely well. The first part offers a concise, though thorough, history of Orthodoxy over the last 2000 years. The second part covers the theology of the Church with breathtaking clarity. Overall, this is a must read for anyone interested in understanding the differences between Eastern and Western Christianity. I especially recommend this book for Western Christians who have vague ideas of what &quot;Eastern Orthodoxy&quot; is all about."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"This is an excellent book. When I was a kid, I read my dad's version from the 1960's or so, but this new, updated version takes into account post-communist Russia and the history and impact of Orthodoxy there. Recommended strongly for any Orthodox Christian wanting to know more about their faith, as well as for anyone interested in Christian Orthodoxy in general."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"_The Orthodox Church_ by Timothy/KALLISTOS Ware is a history of the Orthodox Church first published in 1963. The first part of the book traces the Church's history from the First Ecumenical Council under the Emperor Constantine until the recent Communist regime in Russia and the ecumenical movement in which Orthodox churches have participated in. The main focus is on the Russian and Greek churches, and the account of the Russian Orthodox Church under Communism was particularly disturbing. The story of how the three Romes rose and fell was truly great: Rome fell apart and was overrun by barbarians, and Constantinople was ordained the new capital of the Roman Empire by Constantine, and Christianity became the official religion of the Empire. Constantinople in turn was taken by the Turks in the 1400s and became incoperated in the Ottoman Empire, which was officially Muslim but protected Christians. The Slavs and other peoples of Eastern Europe in the meantime were Christians at this time, and Moscow, the capital of Russia became the new &quot;Rome&quot; with the Grand Duke adopting the title &quot;Czar&quot; or &quot;Caesar&quot; in Russian. The second part of _The Orthodox Church_ outlines the doctrines, worship and positions of Orthodoxy and compares both their similarity and differences to Western Catholicism and Protestantism. The only shortcoming of this book was that it did not discuss the Nestorians and Mononphysites enough, as these ancient Christian sects broke off from the Church before the East-West schism of 1054 and remain very similar to Orthodoxy."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"This book is a treasure to introduce one to this long standing yet little known branch of Christianity. Bibliography is well organized to lead one into specific areas of interest. So important that we understand where each is coming from before critiquing. Ware's fine work is commendable to open up the eastern church for those of us in the west."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"A Must read for anyone willing to find the true Christianity. Reveals and explains the Orthodox Church the true and holy one settled by Christ and continued by the apostles and having no modern changes of faith or trends. The same true and holy faith as in the first centuries worshiped by the apostles."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"After its latest revision, Bishop Kallistos (Timothy Ware)'s book no longer provides a good starting point for those generally unfamiliar with the original Christian Church, its history, and its doctrines. This revised edition shows signs of compromise with the general melt-down of bygone Christianity going on in Great Britain. For example, His Grace says that the question of female priests is seen by the Orthodox as an open question; one wonders what in the world he can be talking about, since there isn't a hint of this development in any of the sources of authority the Church understands as binding. (Can you say &quot;when Gehenna freezes over&quot;?) Here, he must be trying to appeal to the culture around him. Additionally, his approach to the lamentable ecumenical efforts in which the Ecumenical Patriarchate is engaged is deplorable: it is simply inconsistent with the Church's history for its hierarchs to participate in WCC events that include pagan prayers, etc., even if only as observers. A non-Orthodox who read this edition at my suggestion came back to me with the notion that Bishop Kallistos' teaching regarding the relationship among the various &quot;Christian&quot; bodies differed from what I had previously explained. That was true, since I had repeated the Church's nearly 2,000-year-old insistence that it is the one, true Way. In this regard, Bishop Kallistos' attempts to be &quot;understanding&quot; are simply going to mislead the heterodox regarding what they are missing (i.e., the New Testament fellowship of Christ). The unbroken witness of the Church disagrees strongly with his &quot;friendly&quot; opinions. (If it didn't, the decision of the New Romans in the fifteenth century that they would rather remain Orthodox and suffer conquest by the Muslims than apostatize to Papism in exchange for military assistance would make no sense.) In sum, this is not a good place to start someone who might be interested in joining &quot;the One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic&quot; (that is, the Orthodox) Church; as to anyone else, well, why do they need to know about the Church, anyway? This revision is a great disappointment. Get an earlier edition."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"This book does a rather good job of presenting the faith and practice of the Orthodox Church. One good thing about this church is that it has not abandoned the biblical Gospel and emphasizes the importance of both faith and works in our relationship with God. It is unique that it empahsizes the importance of theosis or deification which is very biblical. See the second letter of St. Peter in the first chapter. St. Peter discusses that Christians are enabled to be partakers of the divine nature and to add virtue and goodness and self-control(and other good virtues) to their lives and in doing so will reap a great welcoming into the kingdom of God.(2nd Peter 1:3-11) St. Paul and St. James also emphasized this. St. Paul says in Romans 2 that those who seek immortality and glory and persist in doing good will be rewarded eternal life. St. James in his 2nd chapter emphasied that faith alone without works is dead and will not bring justification. Many people of other Christian traditions(primarily Fundamentalist/Protestant) will isolate scriptures to try to disprove what the Orthodox Church teaches but if you compare Jesus, Paul, and the other Scriptures you will see that the Orthodox Church has not erred on what is essential in our relationship with God. God invites us to repent and confess sin and be forgiven in Jesus Christ, overcome evil with good and to persue peace and holiness. He has provided the way for us to be saved and to partake of the divine nature. This is not done on our own, but by the grace and power of God in us who believe."},{"Title":"Man of Two Tribes","review":"When a friend suggested Aurthur J Upfield's Napoleon Bonapart mystery series written in the 40's & 50's I thought naaa. But she pressed and I found a delightful Austraila based series as relevent today as it was 60 years ago. Great character development, detailed and entertaining data about Aboriginies and the landscape and a mystery I couldn't figure the answer to by page 50. A great summer series, easy to do a book a weekend. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Man of Two Tribes","review":"So far, this is my favorite of the \\"Bony\\" mysteries. (I've read 15 of them.) As always, Upfield's description of the Australian outback is beyond compare. You really feel the heat of the Nullarbor Plain, its intense isolation. And, of course, the skills that Napoleon Bonaparte, Upfield's memorable half-aborigine detective, utilizes to survive in it are remarkable. The plot of this tale is quite unusual, as the murder does not occur until nearly half the book is over. The real mystery is not whodunit (although, that is the puzzle Bony must solve), but why a group of released murderers is being held captive in a hole in the middle of the desert. The answer to that question, and the strange predicament in which Bony finds himself while \\"stuck in the hole\\" are what make this book stand out.But what really captivated me was not just the absorbing plot, or the undeniable charisma of Upfield's protagonist. It was the eloquence with which Upfield reveals his true feelings about Australia. About three-quarters of the way through the story, Bony sets out to rescue one of the members of the group who has foolishly wandered off into the barren waste. Bony finds the man nearly dead of heat exhaustion. What Bony says to him at that moment is what lies at the heart of all Upfield's novels.\\"You will come to love Australia, as I do,\\" says Bony. \\"You have to get down on your stomach, press your face into the sand and against the hot gibbers, smell the land and feel through your empty belly its closeness to you, woo it with a voice clogged by the lack of saliva. And then, as with many men, this naked fair Australia will become the great love of your life ... You lucky, lucky man.\\"We are all lucky to have the stories of Arthur Upfield.

He said the book was a lot better and even had a different ending. I was intrigued. I loved the descriptive nature of the book. I need that to stay interested in books. I need to feel as if I am a member of the group in the story. It was one tragedy after another and you just wished there would be a pot of gold at the end of their rainbow. But you knew if there was one, you would be disappointed. At first I was disappointed in the way the story ended. When I told this to my husband he said, that was the best part. They gave and gave all they could. The only thing they had left to give was life and so they did. After he said that it made me appreciate the story even more so I read it again.I don't understand people who find the book boring.

It begins when Tom Joad, the protagonist of the story, comes home early from prison. What he returns to, however, is not what he left. Because of the droughts, many farmers have gone bankrupt and have been forced off their land by the banks who then plow over the land to plant more crops. Tom comes up on a retired preacher, Jim Casy, and they go together in search of Tom's family who has been relocated to their uncle's house. As soon as Tom gets to his family, he then learns of their quest to go to California, from where they have received handbills promising work and pay, of which the Joads are in desperate need. From there, they begin on their long journey in an old truck, piled high with mattresses and people. Tom's grandfather dies, and then his grandmother dies, right before reaching California. His mother, the matriarch apparent of the family, is worried about how they had to give both her parents a pauper's grave and lose all their money doing so in the process. Also, being misled by the stories the handbills told about the riches in California believes that when they get there, everyone will live in a nice house and everything will be all right. However, that proves not to be the case when she and the rest of the family get a rude awakening at reaching California. They are hit with poverty and injustice, the police wanting to take them in for the smallest deed. Work is scarce, and even if there is work to be had, it is for pennies an hour. The family has no control over anything, something that is new to them, and increasingly frustrating to Ma. On top of things, they are not longer welcome and not very liked, just because they are newcomers, something new to the usually hospitable Joads who had come from Oklahoma. They stay for a little while in a camp, and when Casy and Connie, Tom's brother-in-law runs off, the family goes on the move. They come upon a government camp for the migrants and stay there for about a month until they have to move on north to find work as strike busters.

It took a while to finish the book because I just couldn't read the book, I had to take the time to analyze what I just read. This book is full of adventure every chapter had a new ride to bring me on. It's like one of those movies that leave you on the edge of your seat waiting to see what happens next. That's what this book did for me there were times when I just couldn't put the book down because I was excited to see what was going to happen next. Plus Steinbeck was so good at putting words together, that it made it easy for me to picture what something was like and look like, which made the book even more exciting to read. There were some chapters that when the character were feeling sad I felt sad, and when they were excited I felt excited too. It was just the way he worded it. It made me feel like it was happening to me too. I just have to say that it you are looking for a book that has surprising events everytime you turn the page then this is the book for you. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"ADAPTED CLASSICS GRAPES OF WRATH SE 96C. (Globe Adapted Classics)","review":"Just like most of the other readers, I was required to read this book in high school about a decade ago. I still remember the vivid images this great piece of literary work painted of a farming family forced to move out for a better chance at life - and thus fall short in the very end. It is very, very descriptive - quite enough to give you the realistic illusion of being there all the way back to the dolorous, down-trodden days of The Great Depression and its ruthless, irrational injustice on the innocent, undeserving Americans. In fact, the very idea of whole mountains of oranges being doused with kersone to make them unedible simply because the prices went overboard really did hit me. And it was also very hard to see once-proud people being savagely reduced bit by bit to utterly Stone-Age plight, where they simply stuggled on and on even after they all lost in the very end. In short, though it can be a good way to introduce young people to this kind of literature, it may not be recommanded for everyone. For instance, it has a great deal of very repulvise parts, like a rabbit being skinned and cooked over fire, a used-car salesman sporting an eyeless socket, and the young mother who lost her infant finally baring her milk-engorged breast to a hungry derelict in the very end. Not to mention the very fact this ending still leaves you hanging."},{"Title":"ADAPTED CLASSICS GRAPES OF WRATH SE 96C.

(Globe Adapted Classics)","review":"The Grapes of Wrath is an excellent doorway to the times of the Great Depression and an account that gives a realistic impression of the Dust Bowl and migration. It ranges from corrupt car salesmen, to experienced but accomodating waitresses like Mae, from scared and angry Californians, to ruthless and (at times) greedy farm owners. At the center of all this are the Joads. Like many farmers escaping the Dust Bowl, they travel to Califonia with hopes of prospering through their own hard work. Instead they are greeted with contempt by most Californians and are considered lucky if they find enough work just to eat on a daily basis. This book describes in a way what a history textbook rarely can encompass: the many and very personal experiences of the Great Depression. However, if you are uncomfortable with long and detailed stories, I suggest you find a comfortable sitting position before opening The Grapes of Wrath."},{"Title":"ADAPTED CLASSICS GRAPES OF WRATH SE 96C. (Globe Adapted Classics)","review":"The Grapes of Wrath is one of the greatest novels of this century, and there's one simple reason for it. When you read this novel you feel like you are living it; the images it brings forth are so vivid. John Steinbeck's style of writing is not one that you can learn, it is more a feeling than an art. He puts you in the shoes of the Joad family, and also paints vivid pictures of how the depression affects others: the used car salesman, the land turtle, and many others. You cannot help but feel the emotions of the characters, and feel the tone of a conversation.The Grapes of Wrath is about a family that gets kicked off their land in Oklahoma during the depression. The Joads borrowed too much money while it was dry, and the bank took possession of their land. Their only hope: a handbill stating that there was lots of work in California. So they, along with thousands of other families, sell off what the have left, and set off to the land where everyone lives in white houses and fruit trees are growing everywhere.The book follows their arduous trip across the desert and over the mountains, and what they encounter when they get to California. In their ancient Hudson, with the rear cut off to make it look like a truck, loaded with 12 people and all their belongings, they set out on the journey of their lives. One gets the sense, however, that this book isn't about one family's journey but man's struggle throughout history. Steinbeck's imagery captures our emotions, and we often think of times when we are helpless, lost in our misery. People sold their whole lives to try and get to California: &quot; 'It ain't the people's fault' [Casy] said \`How would you like to sell the bed you sleep on for a tankful of gas?' &quot;(p. 137). It makes us think of times when joy comes from unexpected places, a joy that brings tears to our eyes. Ma Joad said &quot;I'm learnin' one thing good...if you're in trouble or hurt or need - go to poor people. They're the only ones that'll help&quot;(p. 415).Steinbeck's analysis of the human spirit leaves one looking in. While talking about the greedy landowners in California, he says &quot;The great companies did not know that the line between hunger and anger is a thin line.&quot;(p. 313) Seemingly simple statements like these are scattered throughout the novel, and are explanations of many of the problems in the world today. To be this descriptive and dead on, it would be hard to write about something you were not part of. Steinbeck experienced much of what the Joads experienced, another asset for him.The lessons learned by the Joads are ones that we need to learn as well; lessons about compassion, perseverance, and the human spirit. This book will make you laugh, it will make you cry, but most of all it will make you think. It will make you analyze the world around you, and yourself. That's what makes The Grapes of Wrath one of the greatest novels of our time."},{"Title":"ADAPTED CLASSICS GRAPES OF WRATH SE 96C. (Globe Adapted Classics)","review":"Steinbeck's \`Grapes of Wrath' is one of the most moving, poignant and relevant literary works of the modern era. In some instances (depending on the publisher), the full work runs to over 700 pages - although most books are approx. 500. Anything less and far too much has be removed from the original classic and the message is lost.Some authors have published their own stage play versions and others have produced works where they discuss Steinbeck and his book. In addition, there are the educational examples which are for students and cover a small part of the book. Finally, at least as far as I am aware, there are also those who have also written entirely different works altogether but have used the same title.I am particularly concerned by this version of the book because it is advertised as having only 103 pages and yet has still attracted 45 reviews - most, if not all, appear to believe they are reviewing the full size version of the bookI can thoroughly recommend the complete Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath (who couldn't?), but PLEASE ensure you are purchasing exactly what you are expecting to receive.

The book was released in 1939 during the Great Depression and it details the journey The large Joad family takes from Oklahoma to California. The family at one time had a burgeoning farm, but the land dried up and became barren. They are told that California is the land of milk and honey and jobs would be waiting for them. They face hardships and discrimination along the way. They are looked down upon as dirty Okies and life isn't so sweet. Life is bleak and Mr. Steinbeck's vivid description of the camps that the Joad's set up in are heartbreakingly depressing. The heart of the book is Ma &amp; Pa Joad's oldest son Tom. Tom is Mr. Steinbeck embodiment of the struggle of the little guy in America at the time. He has committed crimes, but he doesn't do them because he is bad, but he is forced to out of desperation. The Grapes Of Wrath is not an uplifting story, but it is an incredible, real, believable American tale and a true literary classic."},{"Title":"ADAPTED CLASSICS GRAPES OF WRATH SE 96C.

When something in this magnitude happens to you and your family I hope there isn't one person who says the issue is stupid or boring.On a lighter note I've never read a book with so many untied ends but that's OK I guess - art mirrors life successfully in that regard sometimes. I found myself thinking &quot;How can I be reading dialogue about two children bickering over a flower when so much has yet to happen and we have only a couple of pages to go?&quot;.I found myself trying to distance myself from the family at times because I could see the direction things were going. The late passages where they get work and are suddenly &quot;flush&quot; for a while are glossed over and so incidental that I did wonder whether the relentless beating my concience was being given was perhaps being overdone.A message of hope about the human spirit after all that and many beautiful passages."},{"Title":"ADAPTED CLASSICS GRAPES OF WRATH SE 96C.

It is shown through the eyes of a farm family from Oklahoma, the Joads. This family suffers through the dust bowl and looses everything. They are forced to compete for slave-wages, a place to sleep each night, and are painfully discriminated against. John Steinbeck has retold the story of this nation and taught me the reality and feelings of those who suffered in our society in the thirties. This family faced great hardships while migrating to California and while struggling they failed in society. Their goal was to keep the family together and survive, but the depression got the best of them. The Joad family were outsiders and lived with a constant fear of being beaten or run out of town. In the end they did not find what they were looking for and had no other choice but to live each day trying desperately to survive. In my opinion this novel was extremely realistic and well written. It gave the reader a very clear description of the Great Depression, and made them actually feel the pain and suffering of the Joad family.

It covers in easily understood language everything one should know about Abyssinian Cats and how to care for them. It is simply enough written to be understood by children though not boring to adults. It could be used as a teaching tool for children in the home where kitty will live. The author starts at the beginning: How to buy the cat, acclimation, caring for it &quot;Forever After,&quot; etc. She discusses controversial issues such as declawing (I'm personally opposed), grooming, showing, etc. The general care information would apply to most cats. But Abyssinians are very intelligent, loyal, inquisitive and active. If you want a cat that will NOT sit on the refrigerator, then perhaps this book would give the reader some understanding of the personality of the Abyssinian and guide the propsective cat owner toward making a good decision about whether or not to select this particular breed or another, less active, breed.

Gelernter, in a work that is more anessay than full-blown book, does a wonderful job ofdrawing the reader into exploring that question. Heasks, &quot;...could a mathematical proof, scientific theory,or piece of software be 'beautiful' in the real, literalway that a painting or symphony or rose can be beautiful?&quot;The answer, according to Gelernter, is a resounding &quot;Yes&quot;.Machine beauty, a simple elegance that resonates in itsobserver, is the subject of the work. But, how might onesense this? Gelernter offers this: &quot;You might experiencesomething resembling machine beauty, even if you are noscientist or engineer, when you drive a nail into aboard with one clean, graceful hammer stroke.&quot; Precisely!&quot;Deep beauty, 'resonant beauty' in which many types ofloveliness reinforce one another, is a principal topicof this book&quot; according to the author. He then exploresthe following two claims: (1) &quot;...machine beauty isthe driving force behind technology and science&quot;, and(2) &quot;... machine beauty bothers us. We act as a societyas if our goal were not to nurture or celebrate it butto stamp it out.&quot;Gelernter, a computer scientist and sometimes artist,applies his many observations to the sad state of today'scomputer software. &quot;The hell with mathematics; let'steach of our programmers about beauty&quot; he exclaims!There are long running comparisons between the WinTelPC and Apple Macintosh in the work. It isn't a &quot;salespitch&quot; for one or the other; just a set of observationson how the emphasis (or deemphasis) of beauty andelegance drove both efforts.The work is easy to read yet fully researched. A &quot;Notes&quot;section appears at the end of the 144 pages of prose toprovide all of the references to the other works Gelernterdrew upon. I thought the effort made to keep the meat ofthe book uncluttered was well worthwhile.This book is an excellent companion to Gelernter otherwork &quot;Mirror Worlds&quot;.

I'd recommend the book to anyone interested in design, maybe it will change a few people."},{"Title":"Machine Beauty: Elegance And The Heart Of Technology (Master Minds Series)","review":"Modern engineering systems are very complex and must be designed to meet conflicting constraints. The major hurdle facing an engineering designer is to find a way to meet these many competeing contraints in an affordable amount of time at an affordable price. Much work has gone on in computer science on the analysis of systems by formal methods. The hope of these technques is that the entire operation and requirements of a system can be captured in a mathematical model which would allow the 'correctness' of the sytem to its requirements to be proved.This is the major ideas of such distingushed researchers as Hoare and Parnas. Unfortunately these methods have never been found to work in practice. For anything but a toy system the complexity of the formal model becomes intractable. But there is a more important reason for the failure. How can 'correctness' be defined fro a real world system which must work in a filed of changing requirements.Gelernter identifies this problem but notes that it is solved everyday by real world engineers who must face real world requirements. These engineers are not deterred by the failure of formal methods. Instead they rely on a sense of beauty which is a sense gained from experience in how a system can meet its requiremtns. It is this abilty to see though the complexity to see the structure and pattern in the design that will dictate its degree of success that enable a human designer to function where strictly mathematical and logical techniques fail. Only techniques which use holistic thinking can succeed in in the real world.It is often thought that human reaoning pales beside the clarity of logic and mathematics in understanding the world and how devices function. Gelernter rightly points out that this common attitude is precisely worng. Formal mathematical technqiues have failed where they have been claimed to be paramount. The human understanding of beauty is an ability to function in the world by identifying what is most suited to an issue.Gelernter seems to be saying that the quest of many people to reduce the world to mathematics can only result in failure. It is confusing certainty with knowledge. Experience has shown that these technqiues cannot cope with real world complextity. The proponents of such techniques often portray themsleves as realisitc pragmatists who confront the problem which others try to avoid. Gelernter shows that these people are blind to the real problem and exhibit an unjustified faith in cold specific logic. Only techniques which can view the problem and proposed solutions holistically can hope to cope with real world complexity. It are these technqiues which supposed pragmatists heap scorn on which are most practical. It is poetry and not mathematics which bests describes the world.This book is worth reading."},{"Title":"Machine Beauty: Elegance And The Heart Of Technology (Master Minds Series)","review":"Gelernter knows his stuff.

My wife is a designer and I am in computers. We have had many long conversations about the false division drawn between art and science. So I thought I might have found a new soulmate when I picked up this little (176 pages) book. Too bad it wasn't so. Oh, Gelernter seems to be going the same way initially, even if I found the prose, and especially the examples, a little rough. But he just couldn't hold me. I found him spending too much time defending from his soapbox rather than illuminating. He seemed to be trying to write the textbook for a college course he wants to teach instead of reaching out to the reader.

He loves beauty in design and thinks that much of our modern artifacts or machines are needlessly ugly. He likes his old 1938 Emerson radio as a work of art. He likes the MacIntosh desktop as a thing of beauty, contrasted with the ugliness of DOS. He will not go further than to once mention Microsoft's Windows. He thinks that really good software is beautiful; in fact it is good because it is beautiful. He has an idea for what he calls \\"Streamlines,\\" a way of interfacing with computer and the Internet that he finds elegant. He puts a high value on elegance in technology.Gelernter also has a sharp and incisive mind. Consider this quote on the nature of consciousness found on page 23. He is talking about computers and brains, debunking the notion that a brain is an \\"information processor\\" like a computer. He writes: \\"...the brain is no mere information processor, it is a meaning creator-and meaning creation is a trick no computer can accomplish. The brain is a lump of hardware artfully arranged so as to produce an I-to create the illusion that some entity inside you is observing the world that your senses conjure up. That rose over there merely triggered, when you saw it, a barrage of neuron firings in your brain. But you have the sensation that some entity-namely, you, not to put too fine a point on it-actually saw the rose. Computers, so far as we can tell, are capable of no such trick.\\" Nicely put!This is an original and delightful book that might be compared favorably to the work of Henry Petroski who wrote the much admired The Pencil: a History of Design and Circumstance (1990)."},{"Title":"Machine Beauty: Elegance And The Heart Of Technology (Master Minds Series)","review":"I am reading Gelernter in backwards order, also recommend Muse in the Machine"},{"Title":"Machine Beauty: Elegance And The Heart Of Technology (Master Minds Series)","review":"I've just read this book (at least I think I've just read it -- the book I just read by David Gelernter was called &quot;The Aesthetics of Computing&quot; and was bought in the UK).

It attempts to show how beauty 'drives the computer revolution' \\"how lust for beauty and elegance underpinned the most important discoveries in computational history and continues to push research onward today.\\" As Gelertner defines it beauty comes of the combination of 'simplicity and power'. And the experience of it can be found even if one is not an engineer . He gives examples like hitting 'with one graceful hammer stroke ' a nail into a board, or making a beautiful catch in baseball, with ease and grace. He says that in such beautiful actions there is no 'superflous motion'. He gives examples from a wide variety of fields to illustrate this principle. \\"Vigorous writing is concise\\" he says quoting William Strunk\\".If I understand him 'beauty' is a kind of rightness in the way a thing is done or designed .This seems to me an interesting definition though of course far from an all- encompassing one of 'beauty'.However when Gelertner began actually comparing computer programs and designs, Apple vs. Microsoft for instance. I did not really get what was going on. I did not have the knowledge and experience to really understand or evaluate this."},{"Title":"Machine Beauty: Elegance And The Heart Of Technology (Master Minds Series)","review":"As David Gelertner points out, most of us implicitly hold that scientists and artists are radically different by craft and by the very nature of their work. In fact, the scientific and artistic personalities seem to overlap more than they differ. Beauty and simplicity are the ultimate defense against complexity, and all the greatest discoveries are usually both simple and powerful - they are beautiful. Whether it is software, or product design, or even theoretical physics, best solutions have an aura of elegance and beauty that is often overlooked by our schools and colleges; as David Gelernter points out, our sole focus on analytical reasoning is leading us down the wrong path, and we need to address this issue on an emergency basis."},{"Title":"Machine Beauty: Elegance And The Heart Of Technology (Master Minds Series)","review":"The book by Gelernter starts out very strongly. In the first few chapters, his arguments and facts are astounding and sometimes positively surprising. His line of thought in some spots is just as elegant as some of the subjects he describes in this paper.Somehow, he lost his very own beauty in the fourth chapter. He ventures into one of the most un-elegant discussions of Mac History and the long lost fight against rival Microsoft.To make things worse, he continues into a boring discussion and promotion of his own software products. These are described to the most annoying detail, which moves Gelernter into the ranks of mediocre vacum-clearner-salesmanship.I have hardly ever read a book that takes you to the great highs as Gelernter does and then send you into a 50 page free fall. Having proved his aqbility to write most elegant and interesting in the beginning, Gelernter should stop right there and package the last few chapters into a brochure of his company. The book is definitely not worth the $$$ spend on it."},{"Title":"Machine Beauty: Elegance And The Heart Of Technology (Master Minds Series)","review":"I was a bit disappointed by this little book. It starts interesting (the first couple of chapters) but then it looks more like Gelernter wants to showcase his personal ideas about how a computer could be beautyfull (both aestethic and scientifically), that to explain how beauty can be found in science. Maybe that's what should be expected, but I think the topic is much more interesting than just his personal views on it. Anyway, it makes a fun (if short) read."},{"Title":"Machine Beauty: Elegance And The Heart Of Technology (Master Minds Series)","review":"I enjoyed Gelernter's conversational writing style and agree with his hypothesis but I disagree that the MacIntosh represents a paragon of software design, an idea that he returns to again and again. The Mac is a triumph for the &quot;idea&quot; of design but the interface tends to infuriate the adventurous user. He also ignores the fact that many of us go &quot;where the tools are&quot;, and alas that often isn't the Mac.But this is niggling when taking the book as a whole. I enjoyed it thoroughly, esp. the paeans to Allan Turing and circa-1930s radio design."},{"Title":"Machine Beauty: Elegance And The Heart Of Technology (Master Minds Series)","review":"I would agree with many of the statements made by the others who have reviewed the book. The first few chapters are strong, and I felt like it was really going somewhere. But the irksome, constant worshipping of the Macintosh desktop as the paragon of machine beauty really gets on ones nerves.The designs for computer enclosures are somewhat interesting, but they have a very distinct back-of-the-napkin quality to them. They are neither well-thought-out nor particularly well illustrated in the book itself.I am currently reading Interface Culture (Steven Johnson) and more thought has gone into each chapter of that book than all of Machine Beauty combined.If you're looking for a brief and slanted history lesson on the microcomputer revolution, ending in 1984 when the Mac made its debut, then this book is a easy read, but there are much better books out there if you're looking for thought provoking material."},{"Title":"Machine Beauty: Elegance And The Heart Of Technology (Master Minds Series)","review":"This book was horrible. It's a real shame too, because David Gelernter is a fairly competent writer. He has a good idea, but I think his publisher dropped the ball here.Gelernter is talking about elegance in computing. He starts out by discussing old radios, and telephones, and even cars. In the first couple of chapters Gelernter does a wonderful job of stating his point, and starts providing very good arguments in favor.Somewhere towards the end of the first section of the book, Gelernter start with the Apple vs. Microsoft debate. He shows that he is a Mac fan, and spends much of the rest of the whining about the fact that Microsoft seems to have won. Go figure."},{"Title":"Machine Beauty: Elegance And The Heart Of Technology (Master Minds Series)","review":"Caveat is I usually don't read this kind of fluff, but I enjoy it when it's good. The premise of the book set forth in the first 2 chapters is interesting and inspiring - simplicity and power equals beauty - an objective concept when applied to machines. In Chapter 3 Gelertner digresses to a lenghty and naive discussion of the Apple desktop suggesting the reason that Microsoft won is that Americans don't recognize beauty until they are beat over the head with it. He continues to ramble with some unformed ravings on interface and computer cabinet design and peters out from there. Book design and illustrations are appalling considering the subject of the book. Reminds me of the papers I used to write in college on the night before they were due."},{"Title":"Machine Beauty: Elegance And The Heart Of Technology (Master Minds Series)","review":"David Gelernter is a professor at Yale, and I took one of his courses. He is one of the top few minds at one of the world's top universities, and anyone who does not appreciate his work should not criticize Professor Gelernter, but should instead ask himself why he is incapable of appreciating him. I sent Prof G an e-mail midway through the semester and he never responded. This ticked me off. Personally I'm not too fond of the guy. But still I respect his genius and place high value on every word he puts to paper."},{"Title":"The Dueling Machine","review":"Bova comes from out of the past at us like a bright light on a fast moving train. He worked around, beside, with and knew Asimov, RAH, Campbell, and [fill-in-your favorite author here]... Giants all of them, and Bova a work-a-day damn fine writer.In a crowd like THAT even the best and brightest can be unappreciated. THE DUELING MACHINE was one of the early book I cut my S-F teeth on that WASN'T one of the names above and it has stayed with me to this very day. Why? because the people in it, yes I said PEOPLE, had faces and hearts and troubles beyond the framistat finagling in in the raygun fight.. Like RAH you got a sense that these were people you'd like to know and even the bad guys were interesting.Glad to see it back in print even if briefly. Like somebody once said 'when surrounded by giants it pays to be a little quiet.. and carry a razor sharp ax.'."},{"Title":"The Dueling Machine","review":"This novel feels like two separate stories connected by the presence of the dueling machine. The story when the dueling machine is a dueling machine and the story when the Bova decides that the dueling machine is also teleporter and a therapy device and only occasionally used for duels. The first part of the novel deserves five stars while the second (after the machine's use transformation) flounders around at the level of dismal clich&eacute;.(When the Dueling machine is a Dueling machine)This part is simply amazing. It conjures images of Asimov's Foundation series with some forward plot movement. Dueling machines invented by Dr Leoh (one of the main characters) have helped to bring stability to the galaxy since when people get very angry at each other they simply hop into the box and fight in imaginary worlds they have created in their minds: on planetoids with pebbles, on horses with pikes, in deserts with clubs, on glaciers with oxygen bombs, and in a lab that explores the basic rules of physics with physics. This does present the greatest confusion of the story, how in the world can a mind create worlds as complicated as these? Does the machine add stability to an imaginary world? But, Ben Bova raises interesting questions about the effect such a machine would have on society and politics. The plot is simple, a purely evil Kerak Dictator has his assistant infuriate people so that they initiate duels and then somehow (contradictory to the supposed nature of the machine) actually kills them in the imaginary world so that he can gain political advantage and take over neighboring systems. The novel should have ended here. Except....(When the Dueling machine fills in whatever science fiction gimmick he can imagine)Ben Bova decides that 69 pages is not long enough for a novel and embarks on a great mindless adventure using the dregs of Sci-Fi's rehashed ideas. Dueling in cool worlds with unusual weapons is not enough, the machine also has to be a teleporter (since Kerak is initially defeated he has to have another nefarious scheme up his sleeve) etc. The influence of the machine on society is not longer important but rather all the problems that science fiction plots routinely have to deal with (extreme distances between planets, telepathy, etc) are all solved with the dueling machine. The ending is anti-climatic, although Bova does throw in some wacky-sentence structure mind melding, for kick.Overall, this is a fun read. While some parts are laughable, others are positively mind tickling and genuinely entertaining."},{"Title":"The Dueling Machine","review":"Cheaters hopefully never prosper.A machine has been invented that allows complete virtual reality conflicts to take place, private duels betwen citizens. It is not supposed to leave any lasting harm after the duel is complete. Some top duellists get paid to do jobs for others. After one of them keeps winning and bad things happen to his opponents, law enforcement smells a rat.The boss guy chooses a naive young man to try and help him out, because of his particular mental qualities, and a rather less naive woman to assist."},{"Title":"The Dueling Machine","review":"This is a great futuristic science fiction for young adolescents.

Contains a whealth of information about materials, techniques, tricks, that were used to build wooden ships up to a few decades ago, most of it forgotten nowadays. It also contains detailed drawings about rigging, spars, table of offsets of a few major crafts built by Culler."},{"Title":"The Contrary Farmer's Invitation to Gardening","review":"This is the second book of Logsdon's that I have read, and I intend to read the rest of them. In many ways, he reminds me of the old farmers who would sit around the barber shop when I was kid. Mr. Logsdon has opinions on just about everything, and isn't afraid to express them. One gets the distinct impression that he really won't be too bothered by whether his readers are persuaded by his opinions or not.Amidst his (admittedly spot on) diatribes about industrial farming, government meddling, and modern day prohibitionists he does manage to paint a lovely picture of the garden as the embodiment of the urge to simplicity and living close to the land. Further, he makes it clear that the reader can start whereever they already are, even if it means growing a few plants in a window box.There is plenty of practical advice, but it is delivered anecdotally. There aren't any pictures or diagrams, but he describes his compost heated seed starting bed so well that one doesn't need a diagram. Likewise for what he calls mulch-bed gardening (basically lasagna gardening). The topics covered include the reason for gardening, vegetable gardening, small scale livestock husbandry (read: pet chickens, at least until they quit laying and end up in the stew pot), and aquatic gardening (ponds and such).The key thing to keep in mind is that this book is an invitation to gardening, and not a primer or a manual. If you are looking for a how-to guide, this isn't your best book. If you are wondering whether you might enjoy gardening, or if you are already a gardener and you need something to do between the first frost and the last frost, this is an excellent read."},{"Title":"The Contrary Farmer's Invitation to Gardening","review":"Gene Logsdon's thoughts on gardening are jewels of wisdom and humor, as usual.

I read it twice already since I ordered it and it makes me once again long for a breath of fresh country air. :)Heather"},{"Title":"The Contrary Farmer's Invitation to Gardening","review":"The Contrary Farmer's Invitation to Gardening by Gene Logsdon, my new favorite author. Reading what is written by Gene makes me feel like I'm listening to a grandfatherly character talk about his days on the farm. He is a remarkably good storyteller and can make even books about farming and gardening seem like a fun quick read. I have not read any of his novels yet, but I intend to as soon as I can get my hands on one. Our local library only has two of his books, I think he has written thirty or more, so I'll buy them as I can. You can also read his blog post at [...] or Organictobe.org where his post from the first site are posted in conjunction with several other like minded authors.The Contrary Farmer's Invitation to Gardening is about gardening, but not in the same way that most books on gardening approach the subject. He discusses why we need to garden as a nation, not only to provide food for ourselves, but to break our dependance on industrial agriculture (which will eventually fail). Then he discusses his version of deep mulch gardening. He has animals so his approach is slightly different than Lasagna gardening, or gardening without work. He takes one of his pasture paddocks which has had years of manure added and mulches it in the fall, then plants it in the spring with successive plantings till winter. then the next summer he plants corn, his own open pollinated sweet corn, for people food and animal fodder (the whole plant ears, leaves, stalks, and all). Then he plants winter wheat which starts growing in the fall and comes back in the spring to make grain. In the spring he seeds clover in with the wheat. Then when the wheat ripens in early summer he cuts it, and the clover. This provides animal food and wheat for the kitchen or the chickens. After the cutting the clover grows back for either grazing or making clover hay. He has both permanent pastures, the hilly uneven ground, and temporary pastures, the flat ground. The temporary pastures are for grazing, hay making, and gardening. The wheat leads into Flour gardens and Pancake patches. His discussion on how to grow all of your own grain. He has another book that goes into more detail, but I haven't read it yet. The grain discussion leads to husbandry, chickens at a minimum. With animals he also discusses how to grow your own worm farm, either for money, fishing, or just to turn kitchen scraps into compost fast.Now that you have a garden you need to protect it from wild critters that want to eat it as much as you do. This does not mean bugs, on a diversified deep mulch garden this isn't a problem, it means wildlife. Did you know that in 1950 that farmers in the USA lost 7% of their crop to insects while only using 5 million pounds of pesticides. Now we use billions of pounds of pesticides and lose an average of 13% of our crops to insects. Then the conversation turns to water gardening, growing aquatic plants and fish to eat. And finally a great essay by him to close the book.Whether you want to garden, farm, or just enjoy a great read this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The Contrary Farmer's Invitation to Gardening","review":"He not only helps someone new to gardening find their way, but also provides valuable information about how useful it is for one's community and nation. Well written and full of great pointers."},{"Title":"The Contrary Farmer's Invitation to Gardening","review":"I had previously read and enjoyed (I think) two of Logsdon's earlier books, At Nature's Pace and The Contrary Farmer, but I was barely able to get through this more recent contribution. Logsdon is clearly knowledgeable about a wide range of small farming and gardening practices. There is much useful information in this book, particularly on mulching garden beds, growing small grains, and using chickens in movable cages for fertilization and insect control. However, acquiring this information, which is also available elsewhere, is a painful experience. On almost every page the defects in Logsdon's writing and thinking stand out. He makes absurd generalizations and broad pronouncements, on all sorts of topics, based on what is clearly cursory, limited understanding of the subjects. A fine example of the latter is to be found in the last two pages of the book, where he discusses the evolution of monarch and viceroy butterflies, and the mimicry of the former by the latter. His reasoning in the course of making arguments is often nearly incomprehensible, and time after time made me shake my head in disbelief. One example (p. 126): &quot;I do not believe in letting nature take its course all the time. In a world where one ethnic group of Rwandans hacked a million of another ethnic group to death with machetes recently, I don't have the time nor the luxury to debate whether I should kill a feral cat that is endangering a rare species of songbird. To make the point clearly [!], if I were a judge, I could sentence a vicious human criminal to death under the law--with fewer qualms than I feel when killing a poor dumb pest animal, which is merely the victim of a situation that is as much my fault, as a human, as the animal's fault. But in either case I would act, not lie down passively and let someone else make the decision. If this sounds unconscionably brutal to you, try arguing the passive-resistance viewpoint with a brood of termites under or house or a panther eying up your child.&quot; I just can't follow this. Other, shorter instances abound, as Logsdon draws from his misunderstanding and fractional knowledge of history, ecology, evolutionary biology, and other areas to offer up his opinions on government, economics, sociology, religion, and so on. His writing is also marred by pointless and foolish parenthetical asides, and corniness, as when in the space of three pages in the last chapter he refers six times to his wife as &quot;my lovely&quot; (e.g., &quot;My lovely found what appeared...&quot;). Other readers seem to enjoy Logsdon's self-proclaimed stance as &quot;the contrary farmer,&quot; and I am certainly on the same side as he in the struggle against destructive agribusiness and the global hegemony of ruthless corporations, but (obviously) I cannot recommend this book, which is poorly written and seems not to have had the attention of an editor."},{"Title":"The Contrary Farmer's Invitation to Gardening","review":"An exciting book, full of unusual ideas, practical information, and intriguing possibilities.

He died in '04, but his vision will linger.I'm not your typical reader of this kind of stuff. I prefer scifi/fantasy, and how-to books. I write poetry for pleasure, and have been published, but that's also not a common book genre for me either. Generally I prefer more radical, powerful, left-wing writing.I strongly suggest people consider this book, or at least look at his website and read some of the poetry: http://www.mattieonline.com/There are poets who are elaborate, who paint lengthy pictures.

While I had sympathy for conscientious objectors and admiration for peace organizations, none of their positions seemed to really \`fit'. There was a missing link which I never identified until I heard and understood Mattie Stepanek's message. Its simplicity defines its great strength:\\"Peace starts with me. Make Peace an attitude. Make Peace a Habit. Make peace a reality.\\"Furthermore, he makes a very convincing case for the practicality of living this way and of ultimately having an effect on others. President Carter's many contributions to peace, meriting the Nobel Peace Prize, are widely known and appreciated. His collaboration with Mattie adds real substance to the book and validates Mattie's thesis that \\"Peace is possible\\".A very fitting bonus is the collection of e-mails exchanged between Mattie and \\"Jimmy\\" which reveal a closeness that one might never guess would exist between two separated by generations, backgrounds and experience. Jeni Stepanek, Mattie's mom, as Editor, melds the whole package together with amplifying comments in all the appropriate placesIt is difficult to imagine a more compelling presentation. It is so compelling that my conviction is that a person who had never before heard of Mattie, or read any of his previous works, could be just as convinced as I am.

I don't know if any of you had the privilege of encountering young Mattie on his numerous television appearances on Oprah, Good Morning America, Larry King, or the Jerry Lewis M.D. telethon, but if you did, or did not, I invite you to read this book by this best-selling young poet, peacemaker and philosopher. Mattie J.T. Stepanek died in June, 2004, weeks before his 14th birthday. I have all his previous poetry books, but this book goes far beyond his poetry, with brilliant essays, and email correspondence with his hero, President Jimmy Carter. His essays are incredible, filled with wisdom and insights that hardly seem possible coming from such a young mind.Mattie wrote these words: \\"I believe that I am here to reach out and touch the world gently with my thoughts and my experiences, and with my observations and my reactions, to help people more fully appreciate and respect all aspects of life. I believe that I am here, even if only for a few handful of years, to help people consider the important matter of future, during our lifetime, and for eternity.\\"His essays are profound and I find I cannot even put into words the value of his work, except to say it has to be shared. You may think, oh, this is a kid, what can he know. Trust me, his writing is beautiful, his philosophy profound, insightful, and filled with a wisdom far, far, beyond his age. His legacy is a gift for humanity, and those of us who did encounter Mattie will never forget this special angel, a messenger of peace, and those who now read his book, will also rememberMattie J. T. Stepanek lived and died a child, but he had the spirit and wisdom of an old soul. In his short thirteen years, he became a poet, best-selling author, and peace activist, and his words touched millions of our hearts. Before his death in June 2004, his six volumes of \\"Heartsongs\\" poetry have sold more than a million copies.

Mattie envisioned heaven on earth. There was no reason for wars or hate or racism, we are all equal as created in God's eyes. I believe Mattie's cry for peace can be a reality.

This is a part of the reason, I believe, that God sent us a messenger who was on a very tight terrestrial schedule -- Mattie had to do what he was asked to do in a time frame that reflects in an astonishing way the short years of Christ's ministry, and in addition he was held back by his own extremely fragile health. Yet thanks to the opportunities offered by modern technology -- the continued growth of the Noosphere that Pierre Teilhard de Chardin described and predicted so eloquently -- that message continues to reach out to our struggling world. I am profoundly moved by the collaboration of the two peacemakers, Jimmy and Mattie, and the unbelievably courageous efforts of Jeni who, despite her own struggles and challenges, continues to facilitate this incredible effort."},{"Title":"The Independent Schools Guide 2004-2005: A Fully Comprehensive Directory","review":"This guide is on par with the Peterson's Guide to Independent Schools for the United States.

Bando interviewed hundreds of veterans for this book, and I think it's his best work yet. I'm an avid History Channel watcher, and I'd never heard of the battle that Bando researched for this book, despite the fact that it was one of the most terrifying of the war. The book's best attribute is it's anecdotal aspect. Bando does a good job describing the courage displayed by both sides in this confict through the words of men who fought it. The detective work is great, and Bando even catches more well known historians in several errors."},{"Title":"Breakout at Normandy: The 2nd Armored Division in the Land of the Dead","review":"Well written, and probably the most highly researched and documented book I have ever read on actual combat. Bando has captured the personalities and battle actions of the men and officers of the 2nd Armored Division in a little known but one of the most pivotal and successful campaigns on a European battlefield in World War Two. The author brings to light the how and why of the beginning of this campaign and the bloody battles of the 2nd Armored Div. that followed, miles behind enemy lines in &quot;The Land of the Dead.&quot; Studded with rare photos and documented with personal interviews by the author with surviving combatants of both sides. A must book for readers, students and historians who want the truth in history as it happened. Donald R. Burgett, Author of three highly acclaimed books on World War Two."},{"Title":"Breakout at Normandy: The 2nd Armored Division in the Land of the Dead","review":"From start to finish Breakout at Normandy is a solid account of the experiences of Combat Command B of the US 2nd Armoured Division during the COBRA offensive in July 1944, leading up to the cauldron for German SS armour at Roncey &amp; St.Denis le Glast - a forshadowing of what was to come at Falaise.Potential readers should be aware that whilst the actions of Maurice Rose\`s Combat Command A are included, they are glossed over and quite frankly better handled in Martin Bluemson\`s Breakout &amp; Pursuit.From a Combat Command B perspective, there are many personal accounts from both the Americans and Germans who slugged it out in the Normandy hedgerows and dozens of interesting b/w and colour photos which have not been published before to my knowledge.However, the limited scope of the book, and the fact that it doesn\`t include any strategic, operational or tactical maps means that it cannot be read in isolation to gain the full value of Mark Bando\`s research.Despite this handicap, General Bradley\`s strategically important COBRA offensive launched at the end of July 1944, which busted open the German hold on the Normandy bridgehead has been neglected by military authors of late, so Breakout at Normandy is a welcome addition to anyone\`s library."},{"Title":"Breakout at Normandy: The 2nd Armored Division in the Land of the Dead","review":"The author covers a great story about a seldom noted battle in WWII. His research is first rate. I have 2 problems with the book. First, there are no maps at all! In setting up the story of how fate brought these 2 opposing armies together, the author gives detailed verbal accounts of the movements of each side. Without maps, it is difficult to envision these movements. His accounts mention small French cities and roads such as &quot;D39, D610, and D238&quot;. I was lost as to where each side was, but enjoyed the first hand accounts of what happened when they met. Second, I would like to see a chart of each side. The book mentions parts of both armies, but it is hard to envision their place in their armies. A listing of the weapons each side used would have been helpfull too. Overall, I did enjoy this book. The research, photos and story are great. I hope the author revises his book to include maps, charts and weapon listings. If so, I would buy the second edition, even though I have read the first."},{"Title":"Breakout at Normandy: The 2nd Armored Division in the Land of the Dead","review":"Breakout at Normandy: The 2nd Armored Division in the Land of the Dead is a wonderfully crafted and riveting story that fills a nearly complete void in one of the most heralded Allied actions of the post-D-Day period of World War II. While many know of the hard fought battles through the hedgerow-bocage country of western Normandy in June-July of 1944, and the subsequent breakout and sprint to the Seine in August (with most credit generally going to Patton's Third Army), little has been accurately written about the breakthrough that lead to this shift in action. Historian-author Mark Bando has done considerable research to bring this story to the reader. Breakout at Normandy is not the kind of re-hashed history so commonplace with many of today's more \\"popular\\" authors in the genre. Instead of relying on other historians for the majority of his information, Bando engages in the \\"historical ground battles\\" himself, interviewing veterans on both sides (American and German), consulting and researching official military documents (again from both sides), touring the battlegrounds, and collecting photographic support for the story he tells. Too few authors in the WWII genre are also historians in the same sense as Bando. This guy takes his profession seriously!Breakout at Normandy is separated roughly into four major parts: 1) pre-breakthrough background (Chapters 1 and 2); 2) the actions of the 2nd Armored Division to generate the breakthrough (Chapters 3-12); 3) the wildly successful defense of the breakthrough against retreating German forces (Chapters 13-18); and 4) breakout and post-breakout actions (Chapters 19 and 20). The second and third sections make up the bulk of the book and represent a significant piece of research. Components of the first and last sections are more well known but help to place the actions of the 2nd Armored to generate the conditions for the Breakout understandable and historically placed. Bando's research has clarified several points of misinformation that had been previously associated with Operation Cobra - Bradley's First Army (of which 2nd Armored Division was a component) operation to free themselves from the hedgerows. First and foremost, Bando drives home the fact that the breakthough in Normandy was the result of First Army actions not Patton's Third Army (to which so much is often credited), and that without the combat actions of First Army, and notably 2nd Armored, Patton's breakout, which is now legend, would not have occurred. Another example of the author's ability to clarify previous historical inaccuracies can be found in his discussion of the death of SS-Obersturmbannf&uuml;hrer Christian Tychsen. While the not all of the missing time associated with the death of Tychsen has been accounted for, Bando does an admirable job recounting the most likely sequence of events. In fact, as the author states in his Acknowledgements, the strange and confused history of Tychsen's death is what initially drew him to the story of Operation Cobra. Bando weaves this and many other intriguing and profound combat stories into a gripping prose that both holds the readers attention and teaches as well.The only aspect of Breakout at Normandy that is disappointing is the curious lack of maps. This reviewer has learned from the author that in fact several made were generated (hand-drawn by the author himself) and produced for the book but the publisher - in his/her infinite wisdom - told the author \\"they were not necessary\\"!! This is a truly unfortunate thing for Bando since Breakout at Normandy should be required reading for thee serious students of WWII and such a grave omission by his publisher (MBI Publishing Inc) has likely contributed to the book being lost to the masses. Thankfully Bando's recent chronicle of the 101st Airborne, Vanguard of the Crusade, was published by a top-notch outfit, Aberjorna Press, who recognize the value of research and use of various media results from that research (e.g., maps, photographs, etc) and allowed Bando to tell a complete self-standing story.Bando has a unique gift for research and compilation of information, and it is indeed sad that his work is not being read more widely. Fortunately other historians recognize his talents as they use his material (and thus HIS research) to create their own stories. Breakout at Normandy is a 5 star book that will engage the reader, and although currently out of press, those wanting a solid piece of historical literature should seek out a copy! If you see Mark Bando's name cited by other authors recognize that he is one of a group of historian-authors who aren't afraid to get their hands dirty or feet bloodied in pursuit of accurate history - and has done so without popular accolade. We should all give guys like Mr. Bando a nod for their hard work at preserving history not simply writing popular stories."},{"Title":"Breakout at Normandy: The 2nd Armored Division in the Land of the Dead","review":"This highly engaging book is a &quot;must-have&quot; for anyone interested in combat in Normandy. Mr. Bando's research is impeccable. The severity of the fighting and its terrible cost (that extended beyond the war) really comes through. I had never read an account of this particular battle despite reading several good books on Normandy. The photos are great, many I had not seen before. I had served with &quot;Hell on Wheels&quot; during Desert Storm and it was fascinating reading about my Alma Mater. The courage, sacrifice, and terror of the American and German soldiers is superbly conveyed by the author. This book has encouraged me to read even more about Normandy and its participants."},{"Title":"Breakout at Normandy: The 2nd Armored Division in the Land of the Dead","review":"My dad is one of the WWII vets interviewed for, and pictured in, Mr. Bando's book. He called me with such excitement when he heard it had been published! The timing was perfect as his buddy from the service, also interviewed, was coming for a visit after 10 yrs. I ordered each of them a copy, as well as one for my siblings. Hats off to Mark Bando for making two old war buddies proud!! They devoured this book, both with laughter and tears. They marveled at stories that were new to them, and bickered over accounts that they remembered differently. Thanks for making Ed Fogarty and John Ponczynski of the 2nd Armored, 41st Infantry smile!!!"},{"Title":"Breakout at Normandy: The 2nd Armored Division in the Land of the Dead","review":"I won't attempt to retell the engagement told in this outstanding work by Mark Bando, instead I'll try to tell you why you have to own this book.I'm a reader who wants to pick up a book that deals with a particular battle and packs its telling with lots of detail both textual and photograhic. And Bando's book does that and more as it details the frantic attempt of SS Panzergrenadiers trying to escape the closing trap of the Falaise Pocket. These unfortunates find themselves running headlong into the 2nd US Armored Division and the result is catastrophic for the Germans.Bando's prose is informative, factual and exciting as he presents the details of this incredible engagement between US and SS armored forces. I am reminded of the scene in Patton, where George C. Scott walks among the German and American dead of a head-on night battle. This is exactly what you get as you read this book.The personal stories, the event specific pictures (ncluding some great color shots) combined with a compelling mystery concerning the death of SS Lt. Col. Christian Tychsen make this a must read book.A word of caution regarding the pictures. There are a few shots that are not for the faint of heart. They show the true horror of what American G.I.'s and German grenadiers experienced as they fought toe to toe in the Land of the Dead.I believe this book will be a memorable read for you long after you have turned the last page."},{"Title":"Breakout at Normandy: The 2nd Armored Division in the Land of the Dead","review":"A very good book but I am biased. I'm very interested in the Cobra breakout and both of the main divisions discussed- US 2nd Armored Div and 2nd SS Panzer Div. I found much information that I'd been looking for but the lack of maps is a frustrating. I finally went to Google maps and printed off a few, just to follow the narrative. Unfortunate in an otherwise great book."},{"Title":"Breakout at Normandy: The 2nd Armored Division in the Land of the Dead","review":"I take the point of other reviewers that there is a lack of maps in this book, but the stunningly evocative text and great photos more than make up for this. Operation Cobra and the ensuing campaigns have been covered in monster sized volumes in the past, but this book has a delightfully narrow scope - really just one week of fighting and two enemy forces. The American 2nd Armored Divsion and the German Das Reich SS. The author cleverly skirts around the topic of SS atrocities, events that are well covered elsewhere and concentrates on the two combat forces as they almost circled each other like boxers in the \\"ring\\" that was the labyrinth of hedgerowed lanes that typify southern Normandy.It's a hard to find book, but well worth searching out."},{"Title":"Breakout at Normandy: The 2nd Armored Division in the Land of the Dead","review":"This is a great book to read for any WW2 Historian or anyone wanting a glimpse into what war is about real war when from second to second your life hangs in the balance. The U.S. fighting men who served in this war are hero's in the sence they fought for freedom for what our country stands for. For going to battle for generations that came after them. People need to take a good look around an see where we are at in history now for there are many simulations. I recomend this book for the courage alone of men that gave everything for freedom."},{"Title":"Breakout at Normandy: The 2nd Armored Division in the Land of the Dead","review":"This book is a well researched study of a divisional action in Normandy. It addresses one specific action in the campaign; the 2nd Armored Division's meeting engagement with retreating elements of the 2nd SS Panzer Division. It was during this battle that the acting commander of the 2nd SS went missing and was later determined to have been killed in action. However, the listed price is way too expensive. For about $15.00-$20.00 this is a pretty good book, for $69.+ it is outrageous."},{"Title":"Breakout at Normandy: The 2nd Armored Division in the Land of the Dead","review":"The author demonstrates a terrific grasp of detail not often seen by other authors; the &quot;little incidents&quot; are recounted alongside the &quot;big picture&quot; and this is a very good volume dealing with these two particular formations. A format one wishes more authors would take. Some breathtaking colour photography and indepth discussion of souvenirs brought back make this one go the extra mile in drawing the reader in.Only criticism is a lack of maps make the action extremely hard to follow. Someone should string the publisher up by his thumbnails for allowing such a fine book go to press without them."},{"Title":"Breakout at Normandy: The 2nd Armored Division in the Land of the Dead","review":"Mark has done a magnificent job of research on this book.

While I, like many other, enjoyed B-Boy Blues, I thought it was too Terry McMillanish and only hinted at the talent he has. Well, I was right. Instead of giving us more gossipy narrative and lots of sex (hey, I don't mind reading about it but it shouldn't consume the story), he really digs down deep into the psyche of his characters and delivers a tale that, unlike most novels written by Black men, straight or gay, really shows us as human beings trying to name ourselves. I saw myself and the Black and Puerto Rican boyz I know in this book more than I did the first. This sequel isn't sophomoric, nor does it lack tension, as a couple of folks below claim (I suggest they reread the novel with both their eyes and mind opened); it's an original, engaging, insightful, passion-filled story. Hardy proves that sequel doesn't have to mean repeating yourself."},{"Title":"2nd Time Around (A B-Boy Blues Novel #2)","review":"My friend gave me this book to read and said, &quot;You will love it and hate it at the same time.&quot; And he was right. I LOVE this book because it is about me. I am just like this Brutha in the story, Raheim: boy from da hood, grew up with a single mother, has a son (mine is three). We both chocolate drops, six feet, but I'm more muscular, maxin out at 240 pounds. The writer, Hardy, really gives you the low down on Bruthaz on the down low like me, who don't be livin life as punks but kick it with other Bruthaz. It's like Hardy been followin me around all my life -- he got the story, the events, the people, the language we use down.

He and I been tight for like eight months and I guess I love him. But I ain't never been in this spot before, so it's kinda hard to handle, to tuff out.

The author created a unique writing style, firmly anchored in the everyday speech and real people of a special community, and told a story of universal appeal in that style. As with most sequels, 2nd Time Around is 'pastoral' in character. B Boy Blues is, by necessity, character- and plot-driven. In 2nd Time Around, we know the personas of the characters and how they communicate, and there is time to get into their heads more deeply -- who is where on various political and social issues, to say nothing of their own developing identities. In the end -- able craftsman that he is -- the author shows that it is all relevant to a skillfully insinuated plot that ties together like a classic pastoral comedy in the end. I was raised, long before the days of political correctness and the purchase of social status through elevated literary pretentions, on the down-to-earth value of 'dialect' literature. I was, and still am, completely in love with the dialect works of James Whitcomb Riley (&quot;The Bear Story&quot;) and Paul Laurence Dunbar (&quot;Little Brown Baby&quot;). Since then, I've discovered that many languages have masters of the same approach -- Abu Nuas in Arabic comes to mind. The fact is, you can say the most profound things and make the most on-target observations in the spoken language that gets us from rising up to lying down every day. And so can James Earl Hardy. I can't wait to read the third in this series."},{"Title":"2nd Time Around (A B-Boy Blues Novel #2)","review":"I absolutely loved B Boy Blues when it came out.

I guess I'll be expecting that in the next..."},{"Title":"2nd Time Around (A B-Boy Blues Novel #2)","review":"Hardy's second book in the Raheim River's story is a watered down drink compared to the earlier ambrosia of B-Boy Blues. This book, similar to E. Lynn Harris's second novel, is told through two voices--Raheim and Mtichell's. Hardy's split of storytellers destroys the book's flow. What is worst is that Raheim's dialogue is unconvincing. Instead of sounding like a rough street man, his thoughts read exactly like Mitchell's-- only with slang. Unfortunately, this book does not have the same sexy presence of the highly erotic previous novel. Some people argued that B-Boy Blues was too sexy, almost pornographic, and it appears that Hardy didn't want readers to similarly crticize this novel. 2nd Time Around lacks eroticism and tastyness--flavor. Hardy needs to rethink where he wants Raheim and Mitchell to go, and then seriously decide the best method to tell their story."},{"Title":"2nd Time Around (A B-Boy Blues Novel #2)","review":"As I was reading this book I enjoyed what I was taking in. Only problem was that the story never really went anywhere. I thought for sure Raheim would either come out or be found out creating the tension and a chance for some riveting writing. What happens when a B-Boy is discovered being something else other than he is perceived. In the African-American culture, sadly, being gay is catastrophic and tragic. The outcome could be devastating to a person like Raheim who has lived his life a certain way and has to face alienation from, for example, his son's mother and straight friends(home-boys)who have their own ideas of what a man should be. Most importanly, I believe Hardy missed the boat on what could have been a great chapter on a black mother coming to terms with her gay son without falling into stereotypes and a movie-of-the-week ending. Hardy is too good of a writer for that trapping."},{"Title":"2nd Time Around (A B-Boy Blues Novel #2)","review":"If you want a book that's honest, funny and real, buy this one!

There were several times when I wasn't sure what was happening. This was becasue the book lacked a plot or a story line. The relationship between all the characters was so unrealistic that I almost regurgitated.

At first, I thought it was Pooquie's narration that annoyed me, but after reading the 4th novel in the series, I ruled that out.

If you truly love the English language and the skill with which it can be used to amuse and entertain, this book is one that you should not be without."},{"Title":"The Bab Ballads","review":"Bab Ballads contains many of the poems that William Scwenck Gilbert (of Gilbert &amp; Sullivan) wrote for the magazine &quot;Fun.&quot; They are very funny and I suggest you buy this book"},{"Title":"The Bab Ballads","review":"Actually, they practically are read by Gilbert himself, since actor Jim Broadbent will for a long time be associated with that role. His readings are marvelous, especially because he manages to use a different voice for each new character--and there are many, many of them. It is fascinating to catch so many of the concepts Gilbert was to recycle in the later Savoy works. &quot;The Bumboat Woman's Story&quot; is rich in pre-hints of &quot;HMS Pinafore&quot; and was indeed the inspiration for the ballet &quot;Pineapple Poll,&quot; which uses only Sullivan's music for the operettas (with a snatch of his Da Ballo Overture thrown in). Doubtless the funniest of the lot is &quot;Etiquette&quot; on the last side of the second tape in which two men thrown up on a dessert island cannot converse because they had not been properly introduced aboard the ill-fated vessel. Not all the poems are comical-- some are darkly pessimistic--but there is many a laugh that will educed by Broadbent's delivery.&quot;Bab,&quot; by the way, was Gilbert's baby nickname; and his use of it tells us a lot about his personality.Dove Audio, however, has packaged these two cassettes with no table of contents at all; and so there is no way to tell ahead of time exactly what Bab Ballads are recorded, which is really an intolerable situation for an item like this. Also the use of &quot;unabridged&quot; at the top of this Amazon.com page is misleading. While each poem is in fact complete, there are represented here only a very small portion of Gilbert's BB output. What we do have is excellently done, but the 3 hours on these tapes do not hold an &quot;unabridged&quot; collection by any means."},{"Title":"The Bab Ballads","review":"W.S. Gilbert was the master of the perfect phrase, the sly aside, the cutting quip. Jim Broadbent is the actor who portrayed Gilbert to perfection in the film &quot;Topsy-Turvy.&quot; Now Broadbent brings his smooth delivery to these colorful ballads, some of which can be recognized as the inspiration for Gilbert &amp; Sullivan's most popular operas. If you have even the slightest appreciation for G&amp;S, buy this and learn why so many of us love them so. If you're as much of a fan as I am already, you *OWE* it to yourself to get the Broadbent Bab Ballads. Click on BUY NOW and run, don't walk, to the checkout. And be prepared for ecstatic rapture and unmingled joy."},{"Title":"Scratching the Surface","review":"Jeff Greenwald is the kind of traveler most people rightly want to be--insouciant, funny, compassionate and cyncal at the same time. He's seems to have been just about everywhere (I'm sure he'd scoff at that), and seen it all, but most of all one gets from his writing a special sense of hope. He clearly loves the world and all its inhabitants--and in the manner in which the whole wild and poignant panoply of life pains and delights him, he brings the reader to their own natural place of wonder. Even better (I've read three of his other books), I always find myself Greenwalded into an eddy of determination not only to make my own next trip real, but when I'm on it, to be a better observer and a better participant in the magic all about me."},{"Title":"Scratching the Surface","review":"As an aspiring travel writer myself who just returned from 14 months around the world, I skimmed this book to get a sense of Greenwald's style, where he's been, and how he views the world. I found the writing to be really good when he wasn't so busy sharing all the great things he's done and how much he likes himself. There's an air of self-aggrandizement that gets in the way of the stories. If he could just take a more humble approach, I'd be more intrigued and inspired. To be perfectly honest, a part of me is jealous of Greenwald for having visited many of these places in the '90s before they became so overtouristed. Overall I think he does a great job of offering pertinent historical facts and great backgrounds that make the experience so much more real and interesting. He just needs to get off his high horse."},{"Title":"Scratching the Surface","review":"(Planeta Journal) Collection of 31 tales span the globe in this anthology of travel writing at its finest. Insightful, inquisitive and inspiring, Greenwald reminds readers of the transformative potential of exploring areas off the beaten path. Readers accompany the author around the world, and it's hard to sit still after reading this book."},{"Title":"Scratching the Surface","review":"I had not known about Jeff Greenwald prior to getting hold of this book by accident. This book is a selection of his short travel-writing essays over two decades. Most of the essays are about his journeys in Asia - from Thailand, Cambodia, India, Nepal, Iran etc and a few from Mexico and his home San Francisco. They were visits done in the 1980s and 1990s, prior to 9/11.The essays which appealed to me were some of the following:The essay 'Union of the Sun and the Moon' where Greenwald goes to the historic Iranian cities of Esfahan and Shiraz to observe the rare total solar eclipse in 1999. He finds Iran as one of the most hospitable countries on earth and the people welcoming Americans on the Eclipse expedition warmly. He predicts in 1999 there that in five years' time, Iran will be part of the mainstream in the world community. One doesn't know if it would have happened had 9/11 not occurred.In Bhutan, he finds one asian nation where conservation and cultural integrity remaining more important than profit. Still, Bhutan allows high-end organized, controlled tourism for people with money.His meeting with 'Buzz' Aldrin on the 30th anniversary of the Moon landing was a mesmerizing experience for him and he says he was 'drawn into his orbit'. I wish he didn't use such a cliched expression!About the laid-back Laotians, he quotes the French phrase '..the Vietnamese plant rice, the Cambodians watch it grow and the Laotians listen to it grow'.Among the stories from Nepal, I liked the one about young Jitu, a self-taught young naturalist and animal-tracker. Jitu takes him on an exciting outing into the Chitwan National Park to watch a tiger at its kill at very close range.The essay on the traditional Hindu cremation of the dead in Bali being turned into a tourist event was shocking and bizarre to read. The one real adventure story in the collection was a boat trip he takes from Dubai to Karachi with no radio, no flares, no signals and fuel only for 100 hours. The journey takes more than 100 hours and they were running out of fresh water as well. It was hilarious to read that the Pakistani boatman was asking half-naked seamen on fishing stiff for directions to Karachi out in the open sea!Greenwald spends some time in a refugee camp in Thailand for Khmers fleeing Pol Pot. In trying circumstances, he finds the Khmers still with hope, tremendous dignity, vast equanimity and an acceptance of the present moment which he feels is completely unparalleled in western behavior.On Kathmandu, he writes perceptively, '..you go through your life here, dodging cows, smiling at the monks with their new quartz watches, stopping at the stores to buy the latest Elvis Costello cassette, and you forget how thinly the veneer of western influence is pasted over what basically is a very superstitious and pagan society...'He describes the ancient Hindu-Buddhist-Jain Ellora caves in western India poetically as '..it was an ancient harbinger of Michaelangelo's contention that the sculptures are already in the quarries - awaiting release from the stone'.The narratives are not in the same class as that of Paul Theroux or Naipaul. They are not that absorbing to read in one or two sittings. Still, anyone interested in travel would find the exotic nature of his experiences quite fascinating."},{"Title":"Scratching the Surface","review":"if you have read his other books, you will have read about half of these stories already."},{"Title":"Wayang Theatre in Indonesia: An Annotated Bibliography","review":"I can only praise this excellent book on Wayang. Everything about is good. The Introduction is well-written, well-organized, researched, and most informative. The annotated Bibliography includes entries for 560 Books, Pamphlets and other Publications. I did find a few minor ommisions, but all the important books on Wayang are listed. The annotations, though brief, are consistently well-written. Five Indices: Personal Names, Wayang Characters, Wayang Plays and Stories, and Kinds of Wayang and a General Index, make this book easy to use. It is extremely well-organized. The only drawback that I can think of is that it only includes sources to about 1986. It is necccessary to update this book, which would not be too difficult, as there have not been too many new publications in the last fifteen years. This book is a must have for all Wayang Scholars and Wayang Collectors."},{"Title":"CLOUD OF ISLANDS: By Sail to the South Seas.","review":"This is a wonderfully written narrative of a post World War II cruise from Panama to the Galapagos Islands and the South Seas aboard a vintage English trawler, the Arthur Rogers. A young, and somewhat innocent Bill Crealock chronicled this cruise in which he particpated as crew, in the early 50's. Crealock, of course, went on to a career as a noted yacht designer and one cannot help but notice, while reading his account, the influence this trip had on his design philosophy. The story itself is absolutely enchanting. Crealock captures the essence of a world suddenly opened to adventuring by the common man and not yet spoiled by the hoards of tourists and development brought about by modern air travel. His descriptions of Gaugin's Marquesas and the Tuamotos lagoons are sure to light the fires of anyone who has the latent desire to explore under sail. Crealock's easy to read style disguise his considerable command of the English language. If you enjoy the accounts of the Hiscocks or Hal Roth you'll absolutely love this book."},{"Title":"CLOUD OF ISLANDS: By Sail to the South Seas.","review":"I loved this book. It was magical for me for many reasons. It reached down deep inside me and took me to those \\"faraway places, with strange sounding names\\". It was also quite poignant in that my dads name was Arthur Rogers and he was gone by then and I was heavily involved in building my own offhshore sailing vessel and wished he could have shared some of the thrills. I loved the whole story and for anyone who might enjoy hearing about south pacific voyaging in a much more innocent time this is an excellent read."},{"Title":"Guinevere Evermore","review":"I have read numerous book about the Arthurian legend, but my interest has always been Guenevere. She is not always present in the most flattering light by authors, and sometimes she is only a brief mention. This book, however, is extremely well written. It presents the rise and fall of Camelot through Guenevere's perspective, and it also is very careful about presenting both sides of her story. It clearly establishes a platonic love between her and Arthur, and the eternal struggle that she faces with as her forbidden love for Lancelot grows. It also presents the deep friendship and comradery of the Round Table, as well as the anguish of her childless-ness. In this version of the story, Lancelot and her raise Galahad as their own son, even though Elaine is the real mother.This is the final chapter of three books by the author, but the first one is unfortunately out of print. This was an excellent book."},{"Title":"Guinevere Evermore","review":"This book is horribly written, little plot, horrible character development. Similar to a romance novel. So I guess if that's what you're looking for, go for it. It was one of the worst books I\\"ve ever read."},{"Title":"Guinevere Evermore","review":"I struggled to finish this book. I was disappointed in the trilogy to begin with and this book was DIFFICULT to continue. At about page 90, I finally sparked a tidbit of interest and decided to continue. Honestly, I was less interested in the author's conclusion of the Arthurian tale than I was simply curious to see how she wrapped up all of the loose ends she left in the other two books. Well - the answer is that she wrapped them up poorly.Morgan Le Fay reappears from beneath the lake for just long enough to cause trouble and give a way for Arthur to die. Morgause vanishes. Guinevere's brother and his wife along with the other couple out in the woods appear only long enough for a long-lost nephew to arrive at the villa and then not another word is mentioned of them. Merlin and Geraldus make a couple of re-emergences but they are eventless. Guinevere does suddenly have a practically death-bed recollection of the unicorn but that story line is still as ridiculous as it was in book one. The quick disposal of each of the knights in a couple of paragraphs near the end and then the onset of a plague seem only to allow the author to finish the storyline without torturing us through a volume four - for that I am thankful. She culminates by throwing in two or so pages of questionable historical record as if to lend a modicum of credibility to her otherwise juvenile and fantastic tale of unicorns, misty other-worlds and undeveloped ancient religious practices.This trilogy is amaturish, and filled with childish attempts at fantasy which do nothing to perpetuate what is normally a good tale...the ledgend of King Arthur. Weak moments of interesting writing are few and far between and only serve to link toghether the pages full of boring, uninformative blathering. Guinevere is unlikable from the start and remains so until her death. Had Guinevere truly been this boring, she'd have been forgotten long ago. I guess the worst part is that so many aspects that may have been developed and created an interesting twist on this old tale were simply ignored...as this entire trilogy should be ignored by anyone interested in a good Arthurian legend. I won't even try to explain her endless references to Guinevere's unnaturally golden hair and the fact that all three books contain cover art featuring a brunette!! - Power for the course with this series."},{"Title":"Occultism of the Secret Doctrine","review":"this is perhaps the most essential,seminal and intense work of HPB,certainly at the very least in the masterful way in which she elucidates the greatly OVER-mystified connections amongst all nations and epochs of planetary and human nature ,and at the same time sheds much sattvic light of wisdom on the greater cosmological mysteries of truth and universal Law. She is ever ardent and somewhat reckless in her honesty; and purposeful ,yet full of humour and emotion, in her relentless yet open-minded and thorough, pursuit of the Truth(dharma)..especially valuable is the expert summing up and re/iterating of the various schools and doctrines esoteric and theosophical,concerning the 7 >principles&lt; and their corresponding >sheaths&lt; or bodies ,colors,deities,senses,etc.Try to find the Quest book edition(a branch of the Theosophical Publishing House @ Wheaton,Ill. and Madras ,India)which includes several fascinating and edifying charts ,diagrams,and some fine color plates! p.s.this book was originally published as vol.# 5 in the Secret Doctrine."},{"Title":"Occultism of the Secret Doctrine","review":"While I have just begun to read this book and so cannot comment on the content, I have to say I am very disappointed in the quality of the type used. It is not a uniform black type and is very unpleasant to read and cheaply done."},{"Title":"Occultism of the Secret Doctrine","review":"If you have any interest whatsoever in learning the true occult science as taught by the ancient mystery schools, then this is the definitive text. It's serious and erudite. It is not for the casual tarot card thrower. This is for the true mystic who wants to evolve as fully as possible in this lifetime. A rare and invaluable treasure!"},{"Title":"Words I Use When I Write","review":"I was very surprised to see that Amazon had listed this resource book as being appropriate for baby-preschoolers. What this book actually is is a SPELLING DICTIONARY (NOT a picture book, and there is no story!) designed for k-2nd graders to use to aid their writing. It is a tool that I have found enormously useful to my First graders, who quickly learn that rather than raise their hand to ask how to spell simple words like was, they can look them up themselves. This practice aids in alphabetization skills, and aquaints young students with the use of a dictionary in an easier-to-use format. When the student finds the correct page, they must then use phonetic sounding skills to help narrow the search to which word might be the one they are looking for. Spelling dictionaries give students an autonomous feeling that they become proud of. They integrate well into both Whole-language and phonetic-based instruction. This particular dictionary lists words as simple as in and as complicated as kangaroo. There are about 30 words for each letter, and 10-20 additional spaces to add words that pertain to units you are studying or words that the child just wished to use that weren't included. The print is a handwritten style, about size 18 or 20 if you compare it to word processor sizes. I find that large size print to be helpful for First grade, as the students' eyes don't skip to the wrong line as easily. There are some helpful sections in the back, including lists of months and their abbreviations, contractions, days of the week and their abbreviations, ordinal numbers, and places to list the names of classmates, friends, family, and pets. The only fault I find with this dictionary is that the handwriting is a little cramped at times and the letters occasionally touch each other, which can be confusing to children still learning letter formation. But on the whole, it's an important resource for fledgling writers at school or at home. For a spelling dictionary with more advanced words and a larger word listing per letter, look at My Spelling Dictionary by Nancy Shaw, Edupress. Happy writing!"},{"Title":"Words I Use When I Write","review":"This spelling dictionary is a great tool for students I see in my occupational therapy practice. The concise format works well for the average student learning how to read, write and spell. Also comes in handy for students with dyslexia and visual motor challenges. Each letter section also has empty spaces for students to add their own high frequency words, and separate sections for words in categories, such as days of the week and months.

By the time he became an adult, Lee was \\"obsessed with money.\\" However, Lee recognized he had a serious problem and was able to travel the very bumpy road to recovery through the practice of a Twelve Step program.This book is divided into two parts. Part one entitled \\"My drug of choice\\" consists of eleven chapters. Part two entitled \\"The road to recovery\\" consists of seven chapters. There is also an epilogue along with two appendices.This book is very easy to read. Lee includes psychological terms in his main narrative and defines everything quite well so you're never lost. His writing style is straight forward and to the point.In my opinion, the strongest thing about this book is Lee's complete honesty. He tells the reader everything (and I mean everything) about what went on during this turbulent time of his life. The result for me is that I found myself rooting for him.Finally, whom is this book meant for? I would say anybody who is interested in knowing about addictions (like myself). It also should be of benefit to those patients and families who are struggling with gambling problems as well as the therapists who treat them.In conclusion, this is a fascinating book that details the life of a gambling addict and how he gradually overcame his demons. It is a must-read for those who don't want to be sucked into the miserable life of gambling!!(first published 2005; preface; acknowledgements; 2 parts or 18 chapters with epilogue; main narrative 270 pages; 2 appendices)+++++"},{"Title":"Born to Lose: Memoirs of a Compulsive Gambler","review":"This is such an interesting book!

A must read for anyone who suspects they might be a compulsive gambler."},{"Title":"Born to Lose: Memoirs of a Compulsive Gambler","review":"Born to Lose: Memoirs of a Compulsive Gambler is so much more than a story about winning and losing money through gambling. It's a story of a life, and how a life is molded and changed by all experiences.Bill Lee's book is compelling on many levels. It is a fascinating glimpse into growing up in San Francisco's Chinatown; overcoming obstacles; ego-driven behavior; substituting addictions and human frailty.As a compulsive gambler, I wasn't sure what to expect while reading this book. Sometimes reading about other people's gambling exploits can \\"trigger\\" gambling ideation. With \\"Born to Lose\\" it's important for the reader to keep reading to the end of each section on gambling outings to reinforce the inevitable outcome. I started to read this book as a gambler, and finished reading it as a person who can relate to so much of this story.\\"Born to Lose\\" is a title that refers to much more than gambling. Bill Lee's life has been devoted to attempting to overcome his birthright. Through descriptions of love, loss, obsessions, hard work and many attempts at recovery, Mr. Lee provides a myriad of emotions for the reader to share."},{"Title":"Born to Lose: Memoirs of a Compulsive Gambler","review":"I came across this book while doing research on compulsive gambling. I bought the book in hopes that I would have a better understanding of the addiction, and since the author himself is a recovering addict it would give me some insight on how to deal with my loved one who is suffering from the same problem. After reading Bill Lee's \\"Born to Lose\\", I knew that there is hope still and that one can actually overcome an addiction and not feel like it's the end of the world. What I loved most about the book was that he was so open and honest. I began to realize the similarities that Bill and my friend had which gave me a better understanding on how to deal with this situation, but also assured me that with support and proper treatment my friend would battle his addiction one day. His story gives you an idea of what actually runs through a gambler's mind and how their thought process works. This for me was one of the most helpful things I learned.I strongly recommend that not only compulsive gamblers should read this book but also for those who have loved ones who suffer from this illness. If you are one of those people who can't even begin to comprehend why compulsive gamblers do what they do, than this also is a book for you to read. Being ignorant about this addiction will never help your loved one get back on track.I thank you Mr. Lee for opening up your life to the public.

I do, however, wonder about his knowledge of the Traditions which talk about anonymity in the media and the press. I am pretty sure having your pictures and full name on the cover of the book may be a breach of anonymity.Still, I appreciate his total honesty.

I found this book to be an accurate protrayal of the PROCESS of recovery from a serious and potentially deadly mental disorder. Mr. Lee's long path from denial to recovery, back into denial and finally back into recovery is the exact process many people experience in struggling with this disorder. It is my belief that by reading this a person with a gambling disorder might shorten one of their relapse phases or even avoid making the same mistakes as Mr. Lee. I feeling that this is one of the most honest and helpful books out there. I often suggest it to my patients. Although there was some minor issue I had with book, it has been several years now since I read it, and all that I do recall is that it is an essential read for the gambling addict or their family. I do recall that Mr. Lee's relapses were particularly painful and dangerous at times which is a more severe level of disturbance than many people will reach.

As a relationship expert he's lived the playa's life, including giving workshops and writing a bestselling book called The Playa's Handbook. In his efforts to prove that he really didn't need any woman and that Dr. Asia Fowler hadn't really touched his heart, he'd deliberately hurt her. Now Asia is engaged to another man and Lance, having realized his mistake, is waging an all out campaign to win her back. But Asia has already had one bad relationship and she's determined that Lance is not the type of man she needs. Can Lance convince her that he's changed and ready to me more than a playa?No More Playas is the sequel to Brenda Jackson's The Playa's Handbook, which I have read but I did not enjoy half as much as No More Playas. However, although I enjoyed finally seeing Lance and Asia finding their way back together, it wasn't their story that kept me turning pages. Lance's sister Carrie and her relationship with Conner stole this story from their first meeting. Carrie was abused as a child and is being sent pictures by a blackmailer. She's goes to Conner, a private investigator, for help. From that point forward, Lance and Asia fade into the background. I found myself thoroughly engrossed with Conner finally finding the one woman for him, and with Carrie finding the man she could trust enough to overcome the issues from her past. Brenda Jackson's No More Playas was a thoroughly satisfying romance!MelissaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"},{"Title":"No More Playas","review":"I must say that I am lifelong fan of Brenda Jackson, but not of sequels, as most times, they do not measure up to the original story.

This is a MUST READ!"},{"Title":"No More Playas","review":"Psychologist Dr. Lance Montgomery became famous (infamous in some circles) when he wrote the best selling seduction manual THE PLAYAS HANDBOOK. This self help reference book helps males score without commitment. His tome leads him to confrontations with an enemy combatant, psychologist Dr. Asia Fowler. However before he realizes that he is in love, he hurts Asia driving her into the arms of humanitarian relief worker Dr. Sean Crews.Lance misses Asia and now realizes he is ready to do the unthinkable commit to a long term relationship with the woman he loves. However, Asia is now engaged to the nice caring Sean. Though an impediment, Lance begins his moves with a zeal like none he has everfelt before. He obtains her schedule and appears \\"by chance\\" at events she attends. Still he betrayed her once and he is known as the playa's playa so he must find a way to earn her trust because the passion between them could provide a century's worth of energy for a Caribbean island.There are other subplots involving his two pals ready to marry the women they love and his sister caught in the middle of a blackmail scheme, but the prime story line is the second chance at love between the hall of fame playa and the psychologist he cherishes. Lance is terrific as he employs his honed skills in relationships to make it with the one female who scorns him although he swears he is NO MORE PLAYAS since he wants to be a one woman man. Though this tale can stand alone, contemporary romance fans will enjoy reading both delightful tales.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"No More Playas","review":"This book is soooo hot!!! It's the sequal to The Playas Handbook and Brenda Jackson makes the wait for this book so worthwhile! Lance got what he deserved...he suffered for a while and had to prove himself to Asia in order to get her back.

Sometimes love can come in the most unexpected places from the most unexpected well put together folks! Great job in the flow of the book and the characters were believable. I felt as if knew them.

Thank you for this feel-good Ms. Jackson!"},{"Title":"No More Playas","review":"Psychologist Lance Montgomery, playa extraordinaire, literally wrote the handbook for playas. All was well in his world until he fell in love with his colleague Dr. Asia Fowler. Unfortunately, Lance didn't realize how deep his feelings for Asia ran until after she caught him in a compromising position. When he discovers the love of his life is engaged to marry someone else, Lance vows this wedding will not take place. He sets out to prove to Asia that he is reformed and truly in love with her.Every time Lance Montgomery appears, Asia's life goes haywire. Though she knew his claim to fame was his status as the top playa, she couldn't help falling for him. But when she saw him in action with another woman, reality slapped her across the face. The next day she got engaged to a good man and intends on marrying him. Atleast she intended on marrying him until Lance reappears, declaring his love for her. Afraid to trust Lance, she has some tough decisions to make.Carrie Montgomery grew up in a separate household than her brothers. While their household was loving, hers was filled with abuse. Now a blackmailer is threatening to post sexually explicit photos on the Internet of her being molested, unless she coughs up a hundred grand. She hires private investigator Connor Hargrove to find the blackmailer and her estranged mother. Though leery of men, she finds herself attracted to Connor. Afraid of these new feelings yet needing to find answers, she confides in Connor.Connor Hargrove, die-hard bachelor, can't believe he's thinking about turning in his playa card for Carrie. Yes she's beautiful, but there is something special about her. Something he's never felt for a woman. The more she opens emotionally for him, the more he wants her. Scars from her childhood have formed a protective shield around Carrie that he finds himself wanting to penetrate.NO MORE PLAYAS, the sequel to The Playa's Handbook, was a mess (in a good way) from page one until the final page. Ms. Jackson did a marvelous job at bringing the characters to life and penning not one, but two intriguing romantic stories in this novel. I found NO MORE PLAYAS to be a fast paced, enjoyable read, and I hope Ms. Jackson writes novels for the remaining Montgomery siblings in the future.Reviewed by Deatri King-Beyof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"No More Playas","review":"I loved Carrie and Connor's story. The author handled an often swept-under-the-rug issue with a frankness that was effective yet not over the top. Great job Mrs. Jackson!I was however, disappointed in Lance and Asia's conclusion. Lance was not as dynamic in this sequel and (for me) there was a less believable quality, however I would still recommend the purchase of the Playa's Handbook and No Playas to anyone wanting a good read, with characters who make you laugh, shake your head or tick you off ... just like people do in everyday life."},{"Title":"No More Playas","review":"Brenda Jackson Is One Of The BestRead this and Playas Handbook in three days. As usual I'm never disappointed when I read anything by Brenda Jackson. This one was especially entertaning as we journeyed with the self proclaimed \\"Playa Expert\\" who ended up taking a hard fall for love. The male characters in these books were too funny and the situations they found themselves in had me laughing out loud. I enjoyed all of their stories.

That should tell it all, it was most enjoyable and I did not skip ahead but with anticipation read it to find out what was going to happen and if Lance would get Asia back.I can't wait to read the next Brenda Jackson book. As an African American, I am glad that there are books that is written about the love and intimacy shared between African Americans that is not raunchy but something that I can relate too."},{"Title":"No More Playas","review":"No More Playas picks up exactly where Playa's Handbook left off. Lance Montgomery, the consummate playa and author of the controversial Playa's Handbook, has broke the ultimate playa's rule - he's fallen in love. Leary of this new emotion, Lance dug deep into his bag of tricks and sent Asia running. Seeing the error of his ways, he now wants to make amends with Asia and make her his despite her engagement to another man. Is it a too little too late?Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. Asia made the mistake of letting Lance get close to her once, but she won't let that happen again. Besides, she's engaged to a wonderful man that she loves. Or does she?This was not a bad book by any means, but it's not Brenda's best. It's a cute read - nothing more or less. I was hoping for more from Lance in his pursuit of Asia. I also would have liked more from previous characters aside from small cameos. Readers do though get a chance to get to know Carrie, Lance's baby sister as she has her own troubles. Readers of Brenda will enjoy. Can't wait for her next book."},{"Title":"No More Playas","review":"Dr. Lance Montgomery is the ultimate playa. He wrote the book on how to be a playa and avoid the marriage trap. All is good in his life, being a womanizer until he meets Dr. Asia Fowler. After Lance and Asia met, his playa status becomes confused and he finds himself in a tangled mess called Love. No More Playas by Brenda Jackson picks up where the Playas Handbook leaves off. Lance is haunted by the things he wrote about in the Playas Handbook. Asia is unwilling to be another notch on Lance's bedpost, rejects his confession of love and agrees to marry another. Lance refuses to give up on pursuing Asia and proving to her he has changed his way of thinking and is capable of falling in love. Determined to win Asia, Lance manipulates a situation where the two of them are left on a deserted island. What happens on this island seals their fate.Brenda Jackson's MO is that there is always more than one romance in her books. Lance\`s younger sister Carrie Montgomery has an interesting story of her own. When she receives an anonymous mailing that contains a potential damaging photograph, she seeks out the services of Private Investigator and playa, Connor Hargrove. Carrie's entrance into his life has him reconsidering his rule about mixing business and pleasure, because pleasuring Carrie quickly becomes foremost on his agenda. Carrie, never one to be interested in the opposite sex, is attracted to Connor but because of childhood traumas, she may let him get away. A trip to California to search for a blackmailer changes everything.Brenda Jackson is by far one of the best romance writers. She is my favorite. When you are looking for steamy sex scenes and sensual characters, you have to look no further than her latest book. While Lance and Asia's sex scenes fizzled a little, Connor and Carrie's romance heated up the pages. In fact, as secondary characters, I found Connor and Carrie much more interesting than Lance and Asia. This is the first book by Ms Jackson that I could not give a 4 or 5 star review, but I would still recommend it to all romance readers. Personally, having read and owning all of Ms Jackson books, I expected more.JeanetteAPOOO BookClub"},{"Title":"No More Playas","review":"Brenda have done it again.

Even though some of it was hard to take, the whole situation with Carrie was real hard to take. I was glad that she finally decided to share the burden with the family. I was super glad that Conner was such a big shoulder to lay her head on. That was a wonderful silver lining to the book. Then there was Asia and Lance. The whole situation between them was super hot. I loved the way he schemed to be next to Asia. Then the way they interacted on the island was such a blessing that it must have been love. I felt bad about John but it would have never worked, too much all in the family. It was a great book and I look forward to the chance to read about Logan and Lyle."},{"Title":"No More Playas","review":"A great sequel to \\"The Playa's Handbook\\".

The characters are real. At times they make you smile and other times they make you angry. Lance and Asia are my favorite character, I just love their style, personality, and mentality. The only thing I noticed about this book was that Lance was not as bold or should I say confident as he was in the first, but I guess it all fit with the story.

After you read the first one and find out how to be a playa, you pick up this book and find out that there is hope. At first I thought this was going to be one of those books where you know how it will end and it's all nice and dicey. Not!!!! The first book, The Playa's Handbook, started weaving a tale of about 5 men, two who were bona fide playas and three wanabees..... I liked that and the fact that they all thought they had it going on and were never going to fall in love. But they fell first and hard, and then had to convince their women they they were truly in love and admit it and that they were now ready to share a commitment. And in the sequel, No More Playas, we find drama, friction, incest, a tale into someone's forbidden past, and how right and good does triumph over evil every time. I've already recommended both of these books to my book club and two of the sistahs have already gone out and purchased both books and started reading.

My attention was focused on Carrie and Connor. To tell the truth, the whole novel should have been about them. Ms. Jackson should have put Asia and Lance back together in chapter 1 to get their love story out the way, and focused the rest of the novel on Carrie and Connor. Their love was based on trust...pure and simple. They did'nt have to go all out to prove that love, it was there at the very beginning. To me, there's no such thing as being a \\"playa\\" because in the end, even a \\"playa\\" will fall in love eventually...Lance is the proof.

Others have already covered the synopsis, I just wanted to explain why I only gave it 4* instead of 5?Well..., I've been patiently waiting for Lance's second chance which he did get but--Carrie and Connors' story seemed to be more of the plot, then a subplot. I would have liked a lot more pages of Lance & Asia who didn't really get to work on their relationship until the last 80+ pages of the 291 page book and again the subplots take away some of those pages also. The only other reason is there are a few editing errors (a pet peeve of mine.) In spite of these things, the book is still great.By no means do I regret purchasing this book, in fact I strongly recommend it.

Dr. Asia Fowler has had her heart broken one time to many and she finds herself in a relationship of gratitude and not passion when Lance breaks her heart again he doesn't realize he has pushed her further into her relationship with Sean Crews but Lance has admitted to screwing up and has made it known he won't let her go so easily.Connor Hargrove has been known as a player and he never thought that he would fall in love with anyone until he met Carrie Montgomery and had his mind blown away. Carrie and him both realized that their was an attraction between them but with Carrie having some issues to deal with and Connor being a bonfide player he was sure that they would never end up together and that is where fate took control and lead them together.As you continue to read the story you see all that there is that can test a relationship, a family, and fate but the end result landed those players with wives and left two brothers on the side line now the question is what will Brenda do with the last two Montgomery siblings."},{"Title":"No More Playas","review":"If this isn't the worse book I paid 10 DOLLARS.It was boring and I wouldn't advise anyone to read.Please if you value time and money don't read.GARBAGE.

And \\"The Complete Pelican Shakespeare\\" brings together every one of his plays, ranging from harrowing tragedies to airy little puffs of comedy -- and even the lesser plays are still brilliant.The plays basically are divided into comedies, histories and tragedies. The tragedies are pretty much... tragic, the comedies are not always funny but end semi-happily, and the histories... well, dramatizations of history.And everybody has heard of the greats here -- the Scottish lord who murders his way to kingship, young lovers divided by a feud, a Moorish general who is driven mad with jealousy, an elderly king whose arrogance rips his life apart, a very cleaned-up version of Henry VIII's split from his first wife, the goofy Prince Hal and his growth into a great king. There are feuding fairies, bickering lovers, romantic tangles, Julius Caesar's demise, gender-bending, an exiled duke/magician on his island, and the infamous \\"pound of flesh\\" bargain.But Shakespeare also wrote a bunch of lesser-known plays that often can't be so neatly categorized -- a rotten love affair during the siege of Troy, a Roman general attacking his own city, an Athenian gentleman embittered by humanity, Richard III's Machiavellian plot to become king, two sets of twins separated at birth, a corrupt judge obsessed with a lovely nun, Falstaff's doomed efforts to make money, and so on. Some of these (\\"Troilus and Cressida\\") aren't nearly as good as his \\"main\\" body of work, but they're still excellent.For all Shakespeare's plays, it's best to read them AFTER you've seen a good performance. Otherwise, it's like reading a movie script to a movie you haven't seen -- easy to get lost, and the dramatic effects aren't easy to connect to. But if you've seen performances of any/all of Shakespeare's plays, then his vibrant stories and poetry leap off the page.There are long eloquent speeches, puns, clever linguistic twists, and evocative language that soaks the play in atmosphere (\\"With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine/There sleeps Titania sometime of the night/Lull'd in these flowers with dances and delight...\\"). In fact, his plays are diamond mines of quotations -- some are infamous (\\"To be or not to be\\") and some of which have floated into public knowledge without labels (\\"Cowards die many times before their deaths/The valiant never taste of death but once\\").And while some of his plays are basically fluff, he manages to weave in moral questions, criticism and explorations of the human soul. And his characters range as far as his plots -- kings and princes, teenage lovers, proud but doomed men, bratty queens, the witty but combative Beatrice and Benedick, and even the puppet-master mage Prospero.Shakespeare's \\"Complete Works\\" is a must-have for anyone who loves the English language -- his writing was unparalleled, and even his lesser plays are a cut above the rest."},{"Title":"The Complete Works of Shakespeare","review":"This book was excellent- the commentary was extremely useful in interpreting the text, and Shakespeare himself was quite magnificent.

I could never be bombastic enough to voiciferate the magnificence of Shakespeare. Shakespeare perhaps isn't bombastic enough. He is the greatest writer ever to have lived. The race that he gathered in his multifarious tapestries of painful wonder should flood his grave with tears of gratitude. Weep,love,hate,laugh,progenate,and read Shakespeare.

His lectures are very much like the introductions in this edition. It was one of the most rewarding experiences in reading literature that I have ever had and I am an avid reader. Recently I had been looking for the definitive Complete Works of William Shakespeare, and bought Mr. Bevington's edition immediately. I was not disappointed. This is the way Shakespeare should be read by modern audiences. His introductions offer many insights and are a joy to read. No library is complete without Shakespeare, this anthology of the Bard is surely one of the best one out there."},{"Title":"The Complete Works of Shakespeare","review":"Although the product description includes a long section called \\"From the Back Cover\\" which explains in excruciating detail why the Bevington is the best edition, it turns out this text has nothing to do with this item and is not the back cover text. This is not the Bevington edition, and the much praised notes and numbering system are not used in this item.This description should be modified, as it is extremely misleading!"},{"Title":"The Complete Works of Shakespeare","review":"My pick for the best of the Collected Works, edging out the Riverside, and much better than the Oxford and Arden. (Although the Arden individual plays are essential.) Bevington's book has everything you'll need: concise, but informative introductions, emendation notes, and most importantly very good glosserial notes. The pages are not tissue-thin (good for taking notes in pencil, but not really for highlighting) and the type is a good size for my 37 year old eyes.As for Shakespeare's works themselves, too many people don't know where to go after reading the biggies. Check out Cymbeline, Measure For Measure and Troilus and Cressida if you're looking for some vastly underrated plays that aren't performed nearly enough."},{"Title":"The Complete Works of Shakespeare","review":"As I had another version of the complete works of Shakespeare in old-fashioned book format, I hesitated a while before buying the same thing for Kindle. What was the point? I knew most of the plays anyway, being a WS fangirl. I was finally tempted by the apocryphal content. A couple I had heard of, but most of them I didn't know.One of the advantages of the Kindle (and forgive me for stating the obvious) is that no matter what size the material you are reading is, your book format remains the same. And this is no small consideration when you're dealing with a writer as prolific as Will. My paper and ink version is an absolute doorstep and therefore I'm hardly going to pick it up on a whim to re-read Hamlet, however much I love the play. Now, however, it's as simple as clicking on the list in the table of contents.The layout is easy to read, the content doesn't need me to review it, and I'm thoroughly enjoying spending time with old friends. Five stars."},{"Title":"The Complete Works of Shakespeare","review":"The workmanship in this 6th Edition is less than satisfactory. Several of my fellow seminar students had their books split upon opening the front cover of the hardback.

However, it is obvious that there is stress and it is just a matter of time. I hope the appropriate person at Amazon reads this."},{"Title":"The Complete Works of Shakespeare","review":"No table of contents. No way to figure out what play you are reading without going back to start of the play. No indication of how far you have progressed in the play.

An absolutely poor execution of conveting what likely a great book into a less than substandard kindle edition.

And in this case, it is. The formatting on the plays is not good and makes them practically unreadable. The character names appear above the lines they speak but there's no differentiation between the character and the lines so it's very confusing. And unless you're reading with the matching font size the lines end strangely. Sometimes a cheap Kindle version of a classic is worth weird formatting issues but with Shakespeare it can get confusing. If only they had perfected the formatting. I thought having all of Shakespeare's plays, sonnets and poems on my Kindle would be an invaluable way to carry Shakespeare with me everywhere but I'll need to go back to my hard copy versions."},{"Title":"The Complete Works of Shakespeare","review":"I don't have much to write, but I was so thrilled when I got this that I just felt I must say that I think this collection is for every Shakespeare fan out there!

Edited by David Bevington. 2000 pp. New York : Longman, 1997. ISBN 0-321-01254-2 (hbk.)As complete Shakespeares go, the Bevington would seem have everything. Its book-length Introduction covers Life in Shakespeare's England; The Drama Before Shakespeare; London Theaters and Dramatic Companies; Shakespeare's Life and Work; Shakespeare's Language : His Development as Poet and Dramatist; Edition and Editors of Shakespeare; Shakespeare Criticism.The texts follow in groups : Comedies; Histories; Tragedies; Romances (including 'The Two Noble Kinsmen'); Poems. Each play is given a separate Introduction adequate to the needs of a beginner, and the excellent and helpful brief notes at the bottom of each page, besides explaining individual words and lines, provide stage directions to help readers visualize the plays.One extremely useful feature of the layout is that instead of being given the usual style of line numbering - 10, 20, 30, etc. - numbers occur _only_ at the end of lines which have been given footnotes - e.g., 9, 12, 16, 18, 32. Why no-one seems to have thought of doing this before I don't know, but it's a wonderful innovation that does away entirely with the tedious and time-wasting hassle of line counting, and the equally time-wasting frustration of searching through footnotes only to find that no note exists. If the line has a note you will know at once, and the notes are easy for the eye to locate as the keywords preceeding notes are in bold type.The book - which is rounded out with three Appendices, a Royal Genealogy of England, Maps, Bibliography, Suggestions for Reading and Research, Textual Notes, Glossary of common words, and Index - also includes a 16-page section of striking color photographs.The book is excellently printed in a semi-bold font that is exceptionally sharp, clear, and easy to read despite the show-through of its thin paper. It is a large heavy volume of full quarto size, stitched so that it opens flat, and bound, not with cloth, but with a soft decorative paper which wears out quickly at the edges and corners.If it had been printed on a slightly better paper and bound in cloth, the Bevington would have been perfect. As it is, it's a fine piece of book-making nevertheless, and has been edited in such a way as to make the reading of Shakespeare as hassle-free and enjoyable an experience as possible. Strongly recommended for students and the general reader."},{"Title":"The Complete Works of Shakespeare","review":"Students and various e-mail correspondents often ask me which single-volume Shakespeare edition I would recommend, and I never hesitate in naming this one, as I think it has a long lead over its rivals. I have myself used the 1992 printing with amazing frequency both in research and in teaching, and always with advantage.Why is this the best edition for a reader who wants as much as possible within the confines of a single book? First, it should be pointed out that unannotated editions such as the Oxford Complete Works are all in all of comparatively little use as even expert Renaissance scholars - leave alone inexpert readers - cannot read Shakespeare's language unaided; there are simply far too many words, features of grammar, etc., which a modern reader is certain to interpret inaccurately or not to understand at all. So it is essential to have intelligent and well-informed annotation that will help one to understand the text. Bevington's is extraordinarily good: knowledgeable, precise, and helpfully clear.Second, an editor needs to be able to produce a responsible modernised text. Shakespeare cannot be understood by many unless he is read in modern spelling, and the punctuation of his period, too, often leads most modern readers astray. Bevington's modernisation of the text is exemplary. Furthermore, his handling of the many thorny textual problems is also outstanding for the knowledge and the judgement that he brings to bear. For example, the Oxford people unwisely and on poor grounds print two separate versions of *King Lear*, and Bevington has been exceptional in rejecting that approach and producing a persuasively and intelligibly &quot;conflated&quot; text (much better, by the way, than the conflated version in the Arden text edited in 1997 by R.A. Foakes).Most readers of the plays who are not already quite familar with them will want good, perceptive and comprehensive introductions to them, and in this area, too, Bevington excels, demonstrating an awareness of modern approaches and interests without falling victim to trendiness. He offers introductions which are never dull but, however exciting and illuminating, always sensible.The general introductory and accompanying material made available elsewhere in the book is equally useful, revealing, and accurate; and the book is well produced. It is amazingly cheap for the remarkable value it offers.This, then, is not only the best single-volume Shakespeare available, but is by any standard as good an edition as anyone could possibly expect. I add that in my personal view Bevington is probably the only scholar at present alive who could have produced so excellent a single-volume edition. Unreservedly recommended."},{"Title":"The Complete Works of Shakespeare","review":"For beginners or long-time scholars of William Shakespeare's masterful works, one cannot go wrong with David Bevington's THE COMPLETE WORKS OF SHAKESPEARE. Bevington provides a concise but highly informative introduction to Shakespeare's England, engaging critical introductions to each play, and very extensive annotation to help clarify Shakespeare's more challenging archaic passages. Purchase this volume, and you will be purchasing a lifetime of reading enjoyment."},{"Title":"The Complete Works of Shakespeare","review":"Great find!!Let me start this review by saying I am a huge Shakespeare fan as well as being a huge Kindle fan and I was looking for a Kindle collection that had everything in it from him. Now, I already know all his plays and poems and works, or at least I thought I did. I mean, I wasn't aware of these apocryphal plays. I mean, I've always wondered if the plays that we all know were the only ones he ever wrote, but I'd never really gone to find out. When I read the title and description I just had to see what this was about.When I downloaded it, I must say I was so happy with this great find!! These additional plays were the first ones I went to look at and already just paging through all these new ones, written at different times in his career, has been so interesting!! I can't wait to get into them for real. I feel like I've gotten a new toy that I can play with!I highly recommend it!!"},{"Title":"The Complete Works of Shakespeare","review":"I'll say that this is the greatest collection ever, but I would've like that the dialogs would be easier to read because there's no space between them.

This is the book we used in my Shakespeare class in college and I found it extremly helpful in understanding not only Shakespeare, but also Elizabethan England. Bevington includes plenty of pictures to help one see what it looked like in the middle to late 16th Century and early 17th Century. Also, Bevington includes indepth introductions to each of the plays and explanatory notes on words Shakespeare used in a different context from what we use them today. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to start or continue to study the Bard."},{"Title":"The Complete Works of Shakespeare","review":"The Complete Works of Shakespeare edited by David BevingtonBevington's edition of Shakespeare's plays is a popular choice, and not without good reason. But that doesn't make an ideal choice. The introduction to this one volume edition is ample with chapters on life in Shakespeare's England, the drama before Shakespeare, Shakespeare's life and work. These are good, but they tend to rely on older scholarship and they may not be current. For example Bevington repeats Hinman's claim that there were 1200 copies of the 1623 Folio printed. However later scholars think the number was quite a bit lower, around 750. It should be said that we don't know for sure how many copies of the 1623 folio were printed and either number could be correct.Bevington's edition prints the plays by genre. We get a section of Comedies, Histories, Tragedies, Romances and the Poems. He puts &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot; with the comedies, though we know the play was slated to appear with the tragedies in the 1623 folio. The play was never meant to appear with the comedies, and all the surviving Folios that have the play have it at the beginning of the tragedies.Let's get down to brass tacks. You are not going to buy an edition of Shakespeare's works because of good introduction. You're going to buy one because the quality of the editing of the plays. Is it reliable? Is it accurate? For the most part this edition is reliable and accurate, but that does not mean it is accurate and reliable in every instance.Modernized editions of Shakespeare's plays and poems are norm. Since the 18th century (and even before) editors of Shakespeare have modernized and regularized Shakespeare's plays and poems. There are good reasons for this modernization. There is the reader's ease of use and the correcting misprints and mislination. I have no problem with this regularization of spelling or punctuation. But when an editor goes beyond normalizing and modernizing--when an editor interferes with the text then I have a problem.Let me give two examples of the editorial interference that I am writing about:King Lear 2-1-14 (p. 1184)Bevington has:EdmundThe Duke be here tonight? The better! Best!This weaves itself perforce into my business.The Folio has:Bast. The Duke be here to night? The better best,This weaues it selfe perforce into my businesse,Even allowences made for modernization of punctuation and grammar would not account for Bevington's &quot;The better! Best.&quot; Bevington glosses this to mean &quot;so much the better; in fact the best that could happen.&quot; Nice try, but &quot;The better best&quot; of the folio is a double comparative, (which is a regular feature of Early Modern English) and not two separate adjectival phrases. Interestingly, the Quarto printing of Lear prints this scene in prose, and there is no punctuation between &quot;better&quot; and &quot;best&quot; in that version either.A few lines down Lear 2-1-19 Edmund continuesBevington has:Brother, a word. Descend. Brother, I say!Enter EdgarBut Bevington has reversed the order. The Folio has:Enter Edgar.Brother, a word, discend; Brother I say,Bevington does not say why he changed the order, though to be fair other modern editors have done the same thing.These two changes just a few lines apart go beyond regularization or modernization. They interfere with the text as presented in the 1623 Folio. And Bevington does not explain the changes. So next time you pick up this or any other modernized edition you should ask yourself &quot;am I really sure what I'm reading is what Shakespeare wrote?&quot;"},{"Title":"The Complete Works of Shakespeare","review":"David Bevington gives us a well-researched and useful edition of William Shakespeare's complete works. The bard's plays are, of course, indescribably good, and would be in any edition. Thus, an editor's job is to provide annotations to explain archaic vocabulary or 16th Century references which would otherwise escape us, to give the reader the best text available--since Shakespeare's plays were originally not written for publication but only for production on the stage, this is a recurring problem--to write short introductions to plays which guide a reader about certain themes recurring in the play, and to provide other helpful material in a general introduction and in end notes. Bevington succeeds at all these tasks. His annotations are, as a rule, helpful without being intrusive. Bevington seems instinctively to know when a word or phrase needs to be explained and when a description of a phrase not immediately obvious to modern readers would be more harmful than helpful by breaking up the flow of the text. His introductions to each play are insightful. A good example of this is Bevington's introduction to Much Ado About Nothing in which he explains that the Sixteenth Century pronunciation of &quot;Nothing&quot; was the same as the pronunciation of &quot;Noting.&quot; Since the play involves numerous instances of people overhearing other character's conversations, the play's title has a double meaning--i.e., it is both Much Ado About Nothing and Much Ado About Noting. Finally, Bevington's introductory and concluding general remarks are also quite good. For example, Bevington gives brief descriptions of the Elizabethan stage and the history of Shakespearean productions over the last four hundred years in his introduction. He also gives his take on the controversy over whether Shakespeare wrote all his plays himself. After the plays, he gives the sources of the text for the various plays, including how the plays were first published."},{"Title":"The Complete Works of Shakespeare","review":"Perhaps this actually is the complete works of Shakespeare,but with no table of contents, or section headings or anything similar, it is impossible to use.

And \\"The Oxford Shakespeare: The Complete Works\\" brings together every one of his 39 plays, ranging from harrowing tragedies to airy little puffs of comedy -- and even the lesser plays are still brilliant.The plays basically are divided into comedies, histories and tragedies. The tragedies are pretty much... tragic, the comedies are not always funny but end semi-happily, and the histories... well, dramatizations of history.And everybody has heard of the greats here -- the Scottish lord who murders his way to kingship, young lovers divided by a feud, a Moorish general who is driven mad with jealousy, an elderly king whose arrogance rips his life apart, a very cleaned-up version of Henry VIII's split from his first wife, the goofy Prince Hal and his growth into a great king. There are feuding fairies, bickering lovers, romantic tangles, Julius Caesar's demise, gender-bending, an exiled duke/magician on his island, and the infamous \\"pound of flesh\\" bargain.But Shakespeare also wrote a bunch of lesser-known plays that often can't be so neatly categorized -- a rotten love affair during the siege of Troy, a Roman general attacking his own city, an Athenian gentleman embittered by humanity, Richard III's Machiavellian plot to become king, two sets of twins separated at birth, a corrupt judge obsessed with a lovely nun, Falstaff's doomed efforts to make money, and so on. Some of these (\\"Troilus and Cressida\\") aren't nearly as good as his \\"main\\" body of work, but they're still excellent.For all Shakespeare's plays, it's best to read them AFTER you've seen a good performance. Otherwise, it's like reading a movie script to a movie you haven't seen -- easy to get lost, and the dramatic effects aren't easy to connect to. But if you've seen performances of any/all of Shakespeare's plays, then his vibrant stories and poetry leap off the page.There are long eloquent speeches, puns, clever linguistic twists, and evocative language that soaks the play in atmosphere (\\"With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine/There sleeps Titania sometime of the night/Lull'd in these flowers with dances and delight...\\"). In fact, his plays are diamond mines of quotations -- some are infamous (\\"To be or not to be\\") and some of which have floated into public knowledge without labels (\\"Cowards die many times before their deaths/The valiant never taste of death but once\\").And while some of his plays are basically fluff, he manages to weave in moral questions, criticism and explorations of the human soul. And his characters range as far as his plots -- kings and princes, teenage lovers, proud but doomed men, bratty queens, the witty but combative Beatrice and Benedick, and even the puppet-master mage Prospero.Shakespeare's \\"Complete Works\\" is a must-have for anyone who loves the English language -- his writing was unparalleled, and even his lesser plays are a cut above the rest."},{"Title":"The Complete Works of Shakespeare","review":"Really good book, arrived quickly BUT I would have liked to know it was a teacher book.

It arrived as expected."},{"Title":"The Complete Works of Shakespeare","review":"Product was in good condition and arrived promptly. Packaging was starting to tear open, and the package used was very messy when ripped open. Understandable however, because this book is huge so the only other way to ship it would be in a box...the bags just don't quite hold up. Other than that, good price good buying experience, good seller."},{"Title":"The Complete Works of Shakespeare","review":"There are very few books that are essential for one's personal library, but this book qualifies. One can argue the point, but you are pretty safe in saying that Shakespeare is the great writer of all-time. This collection of his works is magnificently edited by David Bevington. If you've never read anything by Shakespeare or read and re-read him a million times, you shouldn't be without this anthology."},{"Title":"The Complete Works of Shakespeare","review":"This is a great collection. I am someone that likes to have a complete collection of things, so this really suited me. All in all, the best part is to be able to walk around with Shakespeare wherever I go. I've read and re-read Shakespeare for a long time. Still, I find him to be wonderful. His poetry has so much nuance that I am always finding something new and his plot devices have been used and re-used for centuries. This is why when I got my Kindle, I wanted to load Shakespeare up as quickly as possible. This collection is great, it has everything, it is easy to navigate, and it's inexpensive. So I'm extremely pleased to have it."},{"Title":"The Complete Works of Shakespeare","review":"I'm relatively new to the world of Kindle, and the thought of keeping all of Shakespeare in my purse seemed really, really cool! All the reviews keep mentioning the awesome table of contents... but I can't find it!! Could someone please help me with this?As far as I can tell, this really is an awesome collection, but I'm deducting a couple of stars because I find it impossible to navigate!!"},{"Title":"The Complete Works of Shakespeare","review":"The Complete Works of Shakespeare / 0-673-99996-3Every play, every sonnet, every scribble is here - and much more. This volume includes useful background on the theater, politics, morality, and social mores of the day. The level of detail here is absolutely stunning; the footnotes are numerous and incredibly helpful, especially to 'translate' obscure sayings or particularly unusual English usage. Each play is prefaced with an introduction containing the complete 'cliffs notes' of the play, providing useful insight into character motivation and development. I highly recommend this volume, both for Shakespeare enthusiasts and for students just wishing for enough information that they can passably demonstrate familiarity with the Bard.~ Ana Mardoll"},{"Title":"The Complete Works of Shakespeare","review":"Book looks great but when I got to King Lear, the whole second act was missing as was the whole first act of Macbeth.

If you are not experienced in reading shakespeare, this is NOT for you. The annotations that it claims to have are there, but there are not at the bottom of the page like they are in a book, you have to go search in the poorly designed appendix for the annotations.NO LINE NUMBERS. If you buy this for a college class, you will be lost. You may be able to search and find, but its hard.Formatting is often off and not always uniform, making it harder to read than necessary."},{"Title":"The Complete Works of Shakespeare","review":"This is the most complete book of Shakespeare I have ever found. I cannot say enough about it. There is more to this man than people realize. A lot of Shakespeares writing is political in nature and fights against the abusive &#34;Tudor&#34; rule in England. In a tumultous period of English history, Wm Shakespeare penned some of his finest work. His sonnets are often dedicated to the son he lost at eleven-years-old. Knowing that, you will gain more from this collection than you could have otherwise. Excellent!"},{"Title":"The Complete Works of Shakespeare","review":"Incredible deal!

Each dialogue is separated by an empty line - a huge waste of space for Kindle owners. Look elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Complete Works of Shakespeare","review":"I find Shakespeare to be really absorbing, almost like a kind of meditation. Sometimes, I just like to zone out and read his flowing words and let them roll over me. It helps me, especially when I'm having a stressed time. I have so many dog-eared copies of his plays at home. So when my sister recently gave me an birthday/early xmas gift of a Kindle and a gift card, I couldn't wait to find Shakespeare.I'm very happy with this collection. It has all the usual plays and poems I know and a few I don't. And I love that! But what really is good for me is that I can take the Kindle with me, with Shakespeare and all the other stuff I've put on and want to put on, wherever I go. So if I'm on the subway or waiting in line somewhere, I can whip out my good old classics and read them and zone out a little. Also, I found the Table of Contents nice and simple coz I can go from one play to the other so easily.Its wonderful!"},{"Title":"The Complete Works of Shakespeare","review":"To my great disappointment, the Kindle edition is simply a Guttenberg Project text, complete with their copyight notices prohibiting commercial distribution. The Kindle publishers did not even bother to add a usable table of contents. How can one locate anything in 50,000+ pages of text without any cross-referencing? I will be informing Guttenberg project about this - they are being ripped off."},{"Title":"The Complete Works of Shakespeare","review":"I am very happy with this collection, especially considering these new plays!

I always loved 'My mistresses eyes are nothing like the sun...' and my favorite plays are Macbeth, Romeo and Juliet, and Midsummer Night's Dream...With this collection, what is really exciting me is that I can't wait to see if any of the new plays are good enough to get into the top favorite positions...We'll see..."},{"Title":"The Complete Works of Shakespeare","review":"When searching for a Kindle edition of the Complete Works of Shakespeare it is less a question of which Folio the text was based on or who the final editor might be, it is all about formatting. This realization dawned on me during the course of the several frustrating hours I spent looking at samples from the first twenty collections listed in the Kindle store. Apparently, the text of plays presents some formidable formatting problems for the electronic readers and this was evident given the generally very poor quality of the editions that are available. Proper formatting makes the play easier to read and may also help in understanding both the action and the interactions among the characters. In many of the Kindle editions, it is difficult to identify the speaker, the transitions between scenes or acts are not distinct; these are problems that cannot be corrected by adjusting the font size on a computer or device. One problem that can be fixed by changing the font size is when the text appears as if written in paragraphs rather than in separate lines of iambic pentameter. Many of the Kindle editions have no table of contents and a majority of those I viewed had no dramatis personae at the beginning of each play. The quality of the formatting seems to be unrelated to cost; many free editions were superior to those costing from several up to twenty dollars. One exception to this general observation is the Oxford Edition which had the most pleasing formatting among those I viewed.The Ultimate Collection suffers from many of the formatting problems mentioned above. Although the speaker is identified clearly, the position on the line at which the speaker's name appears seems to vary almost randomly throughout the text. The transition from one scene to the next is so subtle as to be missed easily. However, the edition does have a dramatis personae.Many may be unmoved by the formatting problems I describe and, if that be the case, then there are a great number of acceptable Kindle editions from which to choose. If one is bothered by poor formatting then one could invest almost thirty dollars in the Oxford edition. Other alternatives would be to use either of two excellent web archives of the collected works [...] but of course one would need to be online. One can download Shakespeare plays from [...] after having registered with the site. Finally, there is an excellent free Shakeaspeare App that gives one full access the complete works, in addition to excellent formatting, on the iPad and iPhone."},{"Title":"The Complete Works of Shakespeare","review":"I looked up the Bevington edition of the complete works of Shakespeare and was astonished to see a Kindle version available for only 99 cents. Following the link to the kindle version, it shows \\"back cover\\" description for the Bevington edition. I bought it, only to find out that it was the Project Gutenberg edition--without Bevington's essays or annotations--in other words a completely different \\"complete works.\\" On top of that, there is no table of contents, so that the 2000-plus pages are impossible to navigate. Customer service refunded my 99 cents, and I explained the problem. Whether the description will ever be changed remains to be seen.

Instead of risking more of the same, I think I'll just forget about the 3.99 and get a different version."},{"Title":"The Complete Works of Shakespeare","review":"I really like this collection. Its everything I was looking for and a bit more. I wanted a complete Shakespeare collection, with all his plays and poetry, so it was great to find this one that had these extra plays as well to make it the most complete collection. Its also easy to read and I found I could read it both holding my Kindle vertical or horizontal. Its also simple to navigate. So nothing more I could ask for :) Really nice collection."},{"Title":"The Complete Works of Shakespeare","review":"What man or woman among you could find fault with forty Shakespeare plays + his sonnets for just over a quid in a highly portable format. Amazing! The Table of Contents is great. You can use it to go to the start of any play or act within the play. I used the \\"Search this Book\\" function in the menu to track down a couple of famous speeches by typing in \\"Band of Brothers\\" and \\"Slings and Arrows\\" (after getting over 100 hits when I typed in \\"To be or not to be\\"). In each case I was taken right to Harry and Hamlet respectively. As the product description advises, the book opens to the first line of the first play and you have to either click menu and \\"go to beginning or the book\\" or hit the \\"previous page\\" button a number of times to get to the start of the index. Methinks it most cooly presents the bard's great output. Address thy gate, gentle reader, to the purchase button."},{"Title":"The Complete Works of Shakespeare","review":"There's not much more I could ask for with this collection. I got my Kindle recently, after a long wait. And I've been waiting, impatiently, to load it up with a lot of the classic literature I love. This has been my first stop and I am very happy with this collection. Besides from the content and the plays, which are already amazing, I found the formatting of this Kindle edition to be real easy to read and move around in. As for the plays themselves, I am so glad I seem to have got more than I originally thought I would get, with these extra plays. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Complete Works of Shakespeare","review":"The formatting and TOC seem relatively good but when you use search this book to find words or phrases a dialogue box pops up to tell you that this item has not yet been indexed and that the search cannot be completed."},{"Title":"The Complete Works of Shakespeare","review":"Every teacher and student of literature should have a copy of this book.

Best you get are categories \\"Comedy's\\", \\"Tragedies\\", etc. From there you have to flip page by page to the play you want to read hoping that you one day find it.

I was encouraged to buy this edition because of the advertised \\"apocryphal\\" or hard-to-find plays, not sure I had them in my grandmother's hardcover edition of Shakespeare.The problems start with the \\"quick-linking table of contents\\", which is, in fact, almost useless. It refers to each play by the words \\"the end\\" which are printed above the title to signify the conclusion of the previous work, and then proceeds to create an index point for any page where a capitalized heading was found. The play's actual title may or may not also have been indexed. For example, one index point is labeled A COURTEZAN, which happens to be a capitalized stand-alone line in the Dramatis Personae for \\"A Comedy of Errors\\". I started to create a key for the table of contents in a Word document for my own use, but it is almost not worth the trouble.There are various places where headings are printed twice in succession in the text of the play, such as PROLOGUE PROLOGUE for the Prologue of the \\"Life of King Henry V\\". These repeats are not in any hardcover text - why are they in this Kindle edition?I have not been able to read the plays yet because I am so distracted and put off by these flaws that many people might consider minor, but which really detract from the readibility of the text. I will look around -- perhaps another publisher has done a better job."},{"Title":"The Complete Works of Shakespeare","review":"Does this kick butt or what? It's not as packed as some of those coffee table books with historical trivia, commentary and criticism but ... it's pretty awesome.Bravo! This eBook has a cover! My excitement was short-lived, however ... the entire book is horribly, horribly formatted - the \\"easy\\" table of contents in particular: EVERYTHING IS IN ALL CAPS MAKING IT ANYTHING BUT EASY TO READ. Not only that, but there are instructions before the TOC stating, \\"click on a title to jump to that work.\\" First of all, you don't click on any e-book reader. Second, if you had the desire and necessary skill to purchase, download and open an e-book and reader, you likely know what a hyperlink is for.I love that \\"easy to use table of contents\\" is part of the title. Not only does it come with the rare, hard-to-get apocryphal plays and the \\"easy to use table of contents\\" but ... you get - for FREE - \\"special bonuses\\"! I'm not quite sure what, exactly, is Newly Enhanced that increases the \\"reading pleasure\\" but it must be good because they even capitalized it!Having said all that, Shakespeare In Your Pocket is a wonderful collection at the bargain price of $1.99"},{"Title":"The Complete Works of Shakespeare","review":"PLEASE don't buy this edition.I just read a few pages of Cymbeline and it's BAD. The spelling is all wrong (come on, it's not olde english when the u's and v's are switched and \\"for\\" is written as \\"forre\\" and \\"he\\" is \\"hee\\") and the formatting is terrible.When I googled a line (just to make sure it wasn't just me) I found an online text and I'm pretty sure the \\"publishers\\" just copied and pasted the text from online to make the book. Let's put it this way... Let's pretend that you paid someone to type out each play and sold the final result. Who cares if you misspell words, leave no periods, and jumble names together. RIGHT? I mean honestly, that's what this \\"book\\" looks like.I deleted it from my Kindle, pretty disgusted with the purchase. I could understand if it was free (*look up Hamlet or the more popular plays individually, they might be free*) but I mean I could have bought at least a McDouble and an apple pie or a cookie with 1.99. I'd rather be eating a McDouble and an apple pie.So I downloaded the OrangeSkyProject team versionThe Complete Works of William Shakespeare [with active TOC] because it's $1.99 as well and it's working much better. Formatting is much better and the spelling seems alright. The only downside is scrolling through the table of contents which is arranged alphabetically but I don't think it matters once you get to the play you want.**Oh and to everyone: you can always get to the table of contents if the book has one, press menu and scroll to \\"go to\\" on your kindle. select table of contents and it will take you there.In conclusion, don't buy, and have a nice day."},{"Title":"The Complete Works of Shakespeare","review":"I purchased this book as a birthday present for a graduating high school student who is a big fan of Shakespeare.This volume has a lot to offer to both students and casual readers. In addition to very readable text of all the plays and sonnets, the fifth edition provides historical and literary context, including drawings and photos, as well as insightful essays on each of the plays. The essays include background, plot summaries and discussion of major themes and would be very useful to anyone seeing a play, especially for the first time. The helpful glossary is extensive, so the reader doesn't have to look up unfamiliar words or feel intimidated by the language. Professor Bevington's fifth edition of the Complete Works is a gem, authoritative and attractive. The birthday girl thinks so, too-- she gives it an A+."},{"Title":"The Complete Works of Shakespeare","review":"This is decent thing to have on kindle if you are reading at your own pace but is difficult for other uses such as school. I am taking a Shakespeare course and it is hard to follow along with class because it doesnt give line numbers, the dialogue is not neatly broken up and you cant just jump from scene to scene with class unless you go through and mark the pages before hand."},{"Title":"The Complete Works of Shakespeare","review":"Bevington's edition is by far the best Complete Works of Shakespeare available today. Why? First and most important, the footnotes give you just what you need to understand the play and no more. They're complete, concise, and accurate. The formatting of the footnotes also facilitates their accessibility. Second, the introductions to individual plays are marvelous--they get right to the most important critical issues that make reading the plays interesting, without being vague and out-of-date or pedantic, overly concerned with trivial minutiae. Third, the background essays are excellent and up-to-date. The essays on &quot;The Drama Before Shakespeare,&quot; &quot;London Theaters and Dramatic Companies,&quot; &quot;Shakespeare's Life and Work,&quot; and &quot;Shakespeare's Language&quot; are among the best available anywhere, complete and concise, giving you exactly the information that is needed for studying and appreciating Shakespeare in the 21st century, without bogging down in unnecessary details. Consider also Bevington's The Necessary Shakespeare, which uses the same footnotes, introductions, and background essays, but includes fewer plays. It's possible to quibble with some of the editorial decisions, but unless you're writing a Ph.D. dissertation on Shakespeare, students and aficionados will want a good &quot;reading edition&quot; like the Bevington that includes the important variants. If you really want a completely &quot;authentic&quot; 17th century version, folio reproductions are now widely available."},{"Title":"The Complete Works of Shakespeare","review":"Let me count the ways, in no particular order: I like the typeface and the typography; it's easy on the eye. I like the paper it's printed on. I like the way notes are incorporated on the page. I like the punctuation. I like the spelling (&quot;murder&quot; over &quot;murther&quot;, etc.). I like the added lines in &quot;Lear&quot; within square brackets. (The Oxford edition printed the play twice, in its two versions. Bevington's way is better.) I like the front matter, and each play's introduction. I like the footnoted scene divisions. I like the inclusion of &quot;The Two Noble Kinsmen.&quot; I have six complete works, and I rank Bevington's edition number 1."},{"Title":"The Complete Works of Shakespeare","review":"I really don't see how anybody can give this half-finished junk more than one star. However, I must confess I haven't read it all. In fact, I have only looked up the end of Julius Caesar to compare with a recent production I went to. I was appalled to see several instances where a stage comment appeared as part of Shakespeare's glorious lines. For example, where Brutus commits suicide:BRUTUS. Farewell, good Strato. Runs on his swordCaesar, now be still;.....Even the stupidest, laziest proof reader should have spotted this and at least introduced bracketed italics for the stage instruction - something to make it clear that it is not part of the prose. This type of thing occurs so often with ebooks based on source that is out of copyright that one can only conclude that proof-reading is regarded as an extra. In addition to this type of error, this Shakespeare is very poorly and amateurishly formatted. They don't even bother to ensure that each play begins on a new page!In short, unless you have no aesthetic appreciation for the greatest of literature, avoid this product - it is utterly without merit. It's time the producers of ebooks realised that it is essential to minimise errors in books - they are regularly used as references in course work, for example, and have to be reliable. Anything less is a confidence trick and should invite legal action."},{"Title":"The Complete Works of Shakespeare","review":"This is the reason I love having Kindle!!! The fact that I can have a huge Shakespeare collection with all of his plays in it and I can carry it around with me and read it anywhere I am is so cool! As for the collection itself, it is Shakespeare of course, so it was going to be great stuff anyway, but its also so amazing that I now have a whole bunch of his plays that I've never even heard of before, and carry them along with me too!

I think this kind of electronic collection in our modern digital age s really making it a great time to be alive!"},{"Title":"The Complete Works of Shakespeare","review":"The language of Shakespeare is so beautiful, and I have always been a fan of it. It has this magical ethereal quality that so awe inspiring and inspirational. So I was very excited to be able to get a complete collection for my Kindle. And when I read about these extra plays that I know nothing about, I was even more excited. I'm really enjoying reading my favorites and these news ones!"},{"Title":"The Complete Works of Shakespeare","review":"As of late I have seen some pretty strong arguments for reading Shakespeare (even if he really didn't write everything attributed to him). Most of my recent reasons have to do with my teaching high school English.For my sophomores, it is Julius Caesar, and for my seniors, it is Hamlet. Having the need to read along with the students from a second text, I always reach for my Bevington Edition. I like having a second text available, but more importantly, I love having such a comprehensive discussion of Shakepeare at hand each time the moment arises(rare as they are) that a question comes up either during the reading or discussion. The Bevington edition serves me well whenever I teach Shakespeare because I can easily find important information quickly.I also like the fact that the text is modernized in spelling, presented in a clean and legible font, while keeping an academic presentation in mind. For me this simply means I can read it for enjoyment as well as for teaching purposes easily and without any real problems.I also like the way that the plays are organized. with many of the other complete editions I have owned throughout the years, chronological order gets to be a bother.Now, I am no real scholar, but I have acted in several college level and other post-educational setting productions of Shakespeare, and from an actor's point of view the Bevington edition scores well again.If you are deep into scholarly persuits I am certain you can find flaws within the Bevington edition, as could be found by any expert in any edited literary text. However, as far as an all-round, readable, and informative version of the complete works of Shakespeare (or whoever REALLY wrote all the plays etc.) the Bevington edition has my vote as the best one I have yet to see."},{"Title":"The Complete Works of Shakespeare","review":"This is a complete set of Shakespeare's works including his sonnets. This version boasts an active table of contents and works great. Using the search feature, I can look up all of Shakespeare's best soliloquies and lines. The only short coming is that the current act and scene does not display at the top of every \\"page\\" though I am not sure this is a feature the Kindle2 actually has in the first place. This is a real economical deal and you can carry the entire collection without throwing out your back."},{"Title":"The Complete Works of Shakespeare","review":"Bevington's edition of the Complete Works of Shakespeare stands apart from all of the other available editions in its biographical notes, summaries, commentary, and footnotes. For any Shakespeare student or scholar, or even those with only a passing interest in the bard, this edition is the absolute creme de la creme of Shakespeare anthologies."},{"Title":"The Complete Works of Shakespeare","review":"This Kindle book is not the $80 David Bevington edition. If in fact you want that edition (with unique notes and a full introduction) don't buy this Kindle edition (in fact one doesn't exist). The Bevington book is only for sale in hard copy."},{"Title":"The Complete Works of Shakespeare","review":"I think Shakespeare is an inspiration. The fact that after so many hundreds of years, people still relish his work and still find amazing beauty, mystery and wonder in his words shows what a amazing genius he was.I often wonder about today's literature and if it can possibly stand the test of time the way Shakespeare's has. And I seriously doubt it.What I think is most amazing is that whenever a new medium tp publish arrives, Shakespeare is still one of the first writers to be showcased. And rightly so!As for the collection, I can't really fault it. My favorites are there and its really nice that the publisher has collected not only the traditional, but these apocryphal plays. It immediately drew me to it. I have already read one of the new plays and it was fascinating from many different perspectives. I can't wait to read the others, although I am trying to pace myself."},{"Title":"Artillery: Guns & Rocket Systems (Greenhill Military Manuals)","review":"This book Published by the Greenhill Military Manuals.

The book gives a good discription, little bit of history and outstanding specifications on each peice of equipment, The book small size &amp; hardcover helps, if you need a good book to identify those peices of equipment in the heat of battle. This book also provides the curious reader enough information to understand, without drowning them in tech talk. I have read the book and use it in my own referance collection. I enjoyed the book and recommend this book to my fellow readers. I should know a good artillery book when I see it. Since, I work on this equipment for the U.S. Army."},{"Title":"The life of Christ","review":"Fulton Sheen's book Life of Christ is a literary masterpiece. Sheen brilliantly navigates through the life of our Lord and highlights some of the more touching moments, while really bringing to life the moments that often get overlooked. Most importantly, this book will help you to nurture and inculcate a deeper and more profound love for Jesus Christ.Sheen's treatment of Jesus' childhood is masterful. His narrations of Jesus' presentation in the Temple is so moving and spectacular that it will almost bring tears to your eyes. Sheen highlights that throughout Jesus' young life the cross was always looming over him and accompanying him wherever our Lord went.Most of the book deals with Jesus' public ministry and Sheen does an excellent job of probing the gospel accounts for deeper spiritual insight. His constant references to the cross are always highlighted by His appeals to His resurrection and glory. Sheen illustrates how the apostles only wanted a bread king or a political Messiah, but never a suffering Messiah who was a sacrifice for our sins. It would be impossible for me to highlight all of the wonderful topics Sheen discusses in this book, but his treatment of Jesus' public ministry and his true reason for becoming a man are always highlighted throughout the book.This book is perfect for anyone wishing to understand Jesus on a more intimate level, but it is also perfect of pastors and church leaders who wish to use this material for future lessons and sermons. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who wished to know more about Jesus because when it comes to our redemption, Jesus is the only thing that truly matters."},{"Title":"The life of Christ","review":"I am not a Catholic and I don't share all the views of this life of Jesus, but I have to say it is a wonderful presentation of the Gospel and of the Divine Jesus. I would recommend highly that everyone read this book. The insight of Bishop Sheen is astounding. It is a wonderful way for laymen to benefit from a man of God who obviously dedicated a large part of his life seeking the Creator, and then presented Him to the rest of us. Please read this book and take the adventure yourself to meet Jesus,the source of life and the way to salvation. You will not regret it and I'm betting it's message will remain forever etched in your being. I just want to say, Please read it! ."},{"Title":"The life of Christ","review":"This book more than any other demonstrates the ability of Bishop Sheen to bring heavenly concepts down to earth. Bishop Sheen reawakens the magic of those familiar gospel stories, which we learned to listen to with half a heart. I found myself reading the sections such as the &quot;the women caught in adultery&quot; over and over again. Each page offers an insight into the mind of Christ. This book is a novel, a theological work and above all a prayer."},{"Title":"The life of Christ","review":"This is the most complete and comprehensive theological study of the life of Jesus that I have ever read! It is undoubtedly one of the best works in a long time on this subject! It is easy to read, compelling and integrates all four cannonical Gospels (Matt, Mark, Luke, John) superbly. It is one of the best interpretations of Christ's life written! A true &quot;Gospel&quot; !"},{"Title":"The life of Christ","review":"I always liked Bishop Sheen but this book in telling all about the life of Christ by quoting scripture and then elaborating on each quote is Bishop Sheen's, in my opinion, best and most important work. It explains the time and circumstances around each quote. This book has helped me realize more fully how much Our Lord suffered for me and how much he loves me. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to get closer to the Lord."},{"Title":"The life of Christ","review":"Fulton Sheen is arguably at his best in his &quot;Life of Christ&quot;, which, as he said in the book's introduction, he wrote &quot;when gall did mix with ink in those dark hours&quot;. Suffused with scriptural references, exegetical insights, and a truly down-to-earth manner of bringing to the reader what is important in each Gospel narrative of this Nazorean called the God-Man, Fulton Sheen conveys to the reader a Person's life that is hard to reject, is hard to spurn once understood. This is a book that must be read a number of times over a period of one's life for a full benefit to indwell in the reader. Combined with Sheen's &quot;The Priest Is Not His Own&quot;, &quot;The World's First Love&quot;, and &quot;Go To Heaven&quot;, the &quot;Life of Christ&quot; emerges with them as the working of a truly gifted and genuinely kind-hearted communicator, a text which marks Sheen as one of the truly inspiring religious writers of the 20th Century.When I met Fulton Sheen at his office in 366 5th Avenue in 1966 I departed thinking to myself &quot;Only one such person comes along every hundred years like this Bishop&quot;. When I read his &quot;Life of Christ&quot; for the first time in 1970 and most recently last year, I knew that what I thought in 1966 was truer than I had ever imagined.I cannot recommend this book highly enough."},{"Title":"The life of Christ","review":"Fulton J. Sheen's Life of Christ is, simply put, an incredible work and the best Christian non-fiction book that I have read to date. It is a book in which you sense the author's sweat, blood, tears, and joy on almost every page, and there's good reason for this. According to the introduction, Sheen experienced a \\"dark night of the soul\\" over a period of several years that threatened to overwhelm him. Instead of falling into despair or unbelief, however, he threw himself into Christ's embrace and used the time to study and draw strength from the life of his master, savior, and lord. The result is astonishing: He left behind a rich, deep, and profoundly moving work that has the potential to draw any Christian, whether Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, or Protestant, into a much deeper relationship with Christ.Sheen takes the Gospel according to John as his launching point and main source; this gospel provides the broad outlines of Jesus' life as covered by Sheen. The synoptic gospels are used to flesh out the story with additional material not found in John's gospel, but even so, Sheen has not provided us with a complete recounting of Jesus' life that could be derived from the four gospels. Sheen evidently intentionally passes over much of Jesus' teaching; he neither discusses the parables, nor does he provide a full examination of the sermon on the mount. Instead, he places his emphasis on events in Jesus' life of great spiritual significance.And it is in such emphases that Sheen really shines. Even if you've been a Christian for many decades, you may well be stunned, as I was, at the connections that Sheen makes between different events in the life of Christ, or between events in the life of Christ and events from the Old Testament. You may be awestruck, as I was, at Sheen's deep mining that unearths truths that you never dreamed of in a million years.Does this sound like an intellectual tour de force? Think again. This book is as much or more heart as head, as much or more feeling as thinking in orientation. Sheen, out of his travails, produces lyrical, poetical passages that leave you heartbroken or overwhelmed with joy. Only someone who faced a great darkness and intentionally if painfully carried his cross into the light of Christ could produce passages such as those found in this book. Some of the writing found here is among the most wonderful you will find in any book.In effect, through this book, Sheen becomes a spiritual director leading other Christians on a journey of love and pain through the life of Christ, showing them just how much their lord did for them and how much he loves them and the church. This journey is a hard one: Sheen over and over again emphasizes how Christ came to die for us, not to live and be a great teacher. While there is much repetition on this point, you can sense just how much Sheen himself learned this experientially through these dark years. And in this book he invites all of us to travel down the same road, one in which we take up our cross to follow Christ wherever he may lead, even \\"through many dangers, toils, and snares\\" (\\"Amazing Grace\\").This journey took me two years; I just finished it a few days before I wrote this review. Life interruptions caused me to put down this book at different periods of time. Still, I'm very glad I did not rush through it. Your journey with this book may well be a quicker one than mine was, but take it slowly and attentively. Sheen packs more meaning into one phrase or clause than many writers do into an entire book, and his emotional passages are worth much rereading so as to let them sink into your soul.This book seems timeless except for Sheen's repeated references to communism. Those sections keep reminding you that the author wrote this book in the middle of the last century, but, overall, they do nothing to detract from the power of the work.If you're a Christian, you should read this book for spiritual nourishment and, particularly, to love your savior and lord more deeply. It's hard to imagine your love for Christ not increasing as you read this book, even if you're a Protestant who disagrees with some of Sheen's theology.If you're not a Christian, know that this book is very traditional and theologically orthodox in its perspective. Sheen apparently had very little respect for the liberal theology of his day. Furthermore, some of his arguments are similar to those made by C.S. Lewis. If your heart is open, you might find this book profoundly moving and even life-changing.As for me, it'll be a long time before I can forget much of Sheen's wonderful prose and imagery: the ox and the ass present to worship at the birth of Christ in repentance for how men had worshipped them throughout the ages; Jesus ascending the pulpit of the cross to deliver his greatest sermon; the beginning of Jesus taking on the sins of the world not on the cross, but in the garden of Gethsemane; the marked contrasts between Peter and John in their reactions to their resurrected Lord; and many other passages too numerous to mention. This book is one of my top three \\"desert island\\" books: I would always want to have it on hand as spiritual sustenance. (The other two books, for the record, are the Bible and The Lord of the Rings.) It has been a life-changing book for me, and it may be for you as well."},{"Title":"The life of Christ","review":"In the pleasure and pure awe of the realizations derived from this beautiful enlightened volume on the death of Christ so that we may live, I am nearly speechless. I am almost driven as much as if I was reading the Bible itself. Bishop Sheen has simplified the explainations of the message and brought out the realizations of the cross overshadowing the stablecrib. &quot;He came to die so that we may live.&quot;I have never felt so secure in the aquisition of news of the faith. I highly, highly recommend it .
