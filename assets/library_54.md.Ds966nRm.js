I am glad to have it and find it inspirational when considering certain artistic projects. It is fun, but dumb and that is the intention I believe. Very Kooky and certainly wacky, it rolls on and on.

He really enjoys the nonsense stories and limericks... He might enjoy it more if he lived in nineteenth century England - some of the language is archaic and the rhymes dont always work, and the cultural context is missing. These dont seem to diminish from his enjoyment of them however.My only warning (other then archaic spelling and situations) is that the modern zeitgeist is so different that some of the limericks might seem a little off color in todays sensitive politically correct world. An example is a limerick which starts out &#34;There was an old man from Jamaica, Who suddenly married a Quaker&#34;...Overall though my boy enjoyed the stories and limericks read to him, and that enthusiasm for the printed word is whats most important at his age.My only complaint about the book itself is that it is printed on thin paper, and the ink has that slightly bloated look to it.

A United State Senator who reluctantly served his state as governor during the Civil War, Vance spent the latter portion of his life serving his state in the national legislature, defending the Confederate cause, and stumping the nation delivering speeches. Today this latter activity would be viewed as the act of a desperate and egotistical man. In the late-nineteenth century, however, listening to a speech was a form of entertainment, much like going to a movie today, and nothing could pack a crowd like an eloquent orator matched with a fascinating topic. Vance too would discuss many of the more common subjects of his day, but one of the most popular among them was a rather unorthodox theme - the history and plight of the Jewish people.So what does the speech contain? Within the course of sixty pages, Vance manages to cover the entire course of Jewish history (from antiquity to what was for him the present), praise the Jewish people for their role in developing foundations of Western civilization such as the Christian religion and democratic government, make impassioned pleas in favor of religious equality and love, and decry what he saw as a dangerously unacknowledged and/or accepted undercurrent of American anti-Semitism. When done in the captivating style of a Southern stemwinder, the speech emerges as a remarkably compassionate, insightful, and meticulously well-informed read, one that makes a reader long to have heard the speech delivered in Vance's own voice.All of these things make \\"The Scattered Nation\\" worthy of five stars. One must be deducted, however, for a single passage in the speech itself, in which Vance decides to further advance Jewish fortunes by making an observation at their racial and intellectual superiority to the one race an overwhelming majority of Southerners couldn't bring themselves to accept - African-Americans. Just as some Northern anti-Semites, like Ulysses S. Grant (http://observer.bard.edu/articles/opinions/173), failed to see the inconsistency between championing African-American rights and persecuting Jews, so too did a Southerner like Vance fail to understand how the very principles he so nobly and eloquently espoused toward the Jewish race were being flagrantly violated when he threw in a reference - however slight - to the inferiority of another group of human beings. With just a little more insight, Vance could have written a practically perfect speech; as it is, the speech retains most of its greatness, but also has a sad little reminder of the tragic limitations of human perspective."},{"Title":"Shooting Caterpillars in Spain: Two Innocents Aboard in Andalucia","review":"This book was interesting enough, but NOT what I expected after reading a review in the NY Times.

In plot and style I would never go for this, but he just does it so damn well! This book flashs by like what should have been an early eighties T.V. show, and yet is full of jems for any fantasy fan. He has some of the best tournamental compitions (jousting, archery, etc)scenes I'v ever read. He pulls it off, though, in a way that never bogs down for a second. Can't reccomend high enough!

I have been searching for replacement copies for about a year now, and am thrilled that they are being re-released.This series has much to teach just about anyone, in my opinion, from quantum physics to history. I found it enthralling, exciting, and insightful. I would recommend this series to any teenager to spark more than just a passing interest in history. Also I would recommend it to anyone interested in more than a passing knowledge of temporal theories.Thanks so much Mr. Hawke, for bringing this series back, and I look forward eagerly to any further works on this subject you deem worthy to write."},{"Title":"The Ivanhoe Gambit","review":"When I first laid eyes on this book, I admit, I judged the book by it's cover. I read this book when it first came out, and I eagerly awaited each subsequent novel to be released, culminating in 13 novels in the series. Mr. Hawke's method of including the reader in the past piques your curiosity into the time period, and wants you to go out and read up on the actual historical events. This book was an easy read for late teens, but the theories are clearly for the adult. Don't be fooled when you THINK you understand temporal mechanics in book #1 - it gets worse...much worse."},{"Title":"The Ivanhoe Gambit","review":"Really enjoyed the entire TimeWars series.

I don't know about the editions people are reporting typos in. I have the originals, and they have very few typos. I tried reading the Wizard series, but it doesn't compare to the Time Wars. Mr Hawke, won't you bring them back? You could write about Zorro, Edmund Dantes, Don Quixote, Alexander the Great, Attllla the Hun, and about a hundred others.The Ivanhoe Gambit, The Dracula Caper, The Cleopatra Crisis, The Timekeeper Conspiracy and The Nautilus Sanction are among my favorites!"},{"Title":"The Ivanhoe Gambit","review":"This is the first of Simon Hawke's \\"Time Wars\\" 12 books about a crack team from the \\"Temporal Intelligence Agency\\".Kicks off a funny and well written series about a group of operatives who have to travel through time to prevent other time travellers causing damage to history.Sometimes their opponents are rogue individual time terrorists: sometimes they come up against operatives from rival versions of history.All 12 books in this series pay humorous homage to a great work of literature or set of historical events, or both. Most of these books go back to the time and events of a classic novel, in this case obviously, \\"Ivanhoe\\" by Sir Walter Scott, and retell the events of that novel, usually with a humorous slant.The books are best read in the correct sequence, as follows (I have put the name of the literary work and/or historical events associated with each book in brackets afterwards)1) The Ivanhoe Gambit (Ivanhoe)2) The Timekeeper Conspiracy (The Three Musketeers)3) The Pimpernel Plot (French Revolution & terror/Scarlet Pimpernel)4) The Zenda Vendetta (The Prisoner of Zenda)5) The Nautilus Sanction (20,000 Leagues Under the Sea)6) The Kyber Connection (works of Rudyard Kipling/early life of Churchill)7) The Argonaut Affair (Jason and the Argonauts)8) The Dracula Caper (Sherlock Holmes meets Bram Stoker's Count Dracula)9) The Lilliput Legion (Gulliver's travels)10) The Hellfire Rebellion (American War of Independence/Hellfire Club)11) The Cleopatra Crisis (Caesar and Cleopatra)12) The Six-gun solution (Gunfight at the OK Corral.)Not terribly serious but very good fun: I can recommend this series, and if you want to read it, start with this one."},{"Title":"The Ivanhoe Gambit","review":"I have had the pleasure of reading this entire series of books, and truly enjoyed them all. What I enjoy the most about the books is the blending of history and scifi in such a seamless storyline, or the blending of two different stories into one storyline. The reserch and skill that this requires is wonderful. I would recommend these books to anyone. Hawke fans should also check out his Wizard series as well. Titles to look for are The Wizard of Whitechaple or The Wizard of Sunset Strip. These stories combine the Pendragon legend of King Arthur and Merlin set in the future. Merlin brings a new source of power to the world MAGIC. Try them, they are very entertaining."},{"Title":"The Ivanhoe Gambit","review":"The Ivanhoe Gambit is an enjoyable, fast-paced adventure series based on the premise that governments, to avoid unplesantness in the present, choose to wage war in the past (which, having 'already happened' is as sure to a safe thing as they can get). Whoops. Turns out they're wrong, and the series unfolds as a team of commandos is called forth to deal with temporal paradoxes and time-hopping terrorists.Hawke throws some curveballs at the reader, but his love of history and the research he has done provide an engaging 'what if' for the rich fabric of time.Not recommended for younger children. Contains some strong language.(While Hawke concluded the series with #12: The Six-Gun Solution, if he were to pick up the series with a future novel, perhaps bringing the team out of retirement ...

As soon as I saw The Ivanhoe Gambit, I pulled it and the next three out, and read them intermittently over the past week and 4th of July Holiday. My opinion? Well, when I was 15 years old, they were definitely 5 star material, but with a few more years on me, I'd have to downgrade it a notch. Even so, it's a guilty pleasure. They're wonderfully readable books, but have a few too many inconsistencies, and rely too much on &quot;willing suspension of disbelief&quot; to be more than a good paperback novel. HOWEVER, I'm sure that when Mr. Hawke wrote 'em, that's just what he intended. The dialogue flies off the page, and the pacing is mighty brisk. Lucas, Finn and Andre - as well as Forrester, Dr. Darkness and the various secondary characters are all distinct personalities, and there's enough intrigue, fun and quasi-historical detail to keep your attention. However, when you're done reading them, you feel like you just ate a box full of ding-dongs - a bit guilty, a little woozy, and kind of unsatisfied. The other &quot;ding-dong&quot; effect also holds - you have a craving for more. Now if I can only find where I put the Nautilus Sanction and that &quot;Dracula&quot; book, not to mention the Golden Fleece story..."},{"Title":"The Ivanhoe Gambit","review":"The Pulpless edition of this book is so riddled with typos that is all but unreadable. The book is spoiled because, it would seem, Pulpless decided to save money on proof-readers and just pass it through a spellchecker instead. This is not a small complaint. Simon Hawke should be made aware of this. A good book can be ruined this way. We want to read the book, get lost in the story, not be constantly yanked back to reality by horrible mistakes in printing, like using the word &quot;ham&quot; for &quot;his.&quot; These mistakes are all through the book and get worse towards the end.Zero stars for Pulpless.com"},{"Title":"The Ivanhoe Gambit","review":"Simon Hawke's debut novel in his short-lived TimeWars series is top-notch entertainment from the first page to the last.

Painstakingly reconstructing it over the following years with the help of her husband, it all starts to come unraveled when the man convicted of that assault, DellaVecchio, is released pending a hearing based on new DNA evidence. The man's voice she hears is no longer the same as the voice whispered in her ear the night of the attack. So she approaches Jim Christensen, a psychologist who testified as an expert on memory at the original trial - and the same man who was now living with the attorney in charge of the defense for DellaVecchio.Tensions mount as the three weeks before the hearing tick off. Clues are revealed through counseling sessions, reviews of testimony, questioning of key characters, and even present-day events. When I thought it was all figured out, there were still a few niggling details that didn't quite fit, and the attacker almost gets away with it... again.Marty Smith pulls us along with the investigation, sometimes piecing together the puzzle only moments before the characters. The stunning climactic scenes left me turning pages faster than I could read them, only to have me turn them back to savor the mounting anticipation. A dazzling good read."},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"Carmen DellaVecchio has been jailed for the last eight years for the alleged rape and attempted murder of police officer Teresa Harnett. It was her testimony that fingered DellaVecchio for the crime and sentenced him to life in prison. His attorney, Brenna Kennedy, sets him free after she finds indisputable DNA evidence proving that Carmen could not have committed the crime. Harnett is shocked by the revelation and begins to question everything that she went through.Psychologist Jim Christensen is hired by Teresa to try to find out the truth in her fractured mind. She has not fully recovered from her injuries and is still suffering from partial amnesia. She is not confident with her memories and wonders if it has been tampered. Christensen is not convinced on her recollections and believes that she is hiding what really happened eight years ago. During the sessions Harnett confesses that for the last few days she has received threatening phone calls from someone who is not DellaVecchio but who knows the most intimate details of her rape. She is scared and afraid that she will be attacked again. It is not until she finds her old journals that the truth is slowly revealed. There is a conspiracy that cannot afford for Harnett to remember what is in her confused mind. They will do whatever it takes to make sure the truth never comes out and to silence her permanently.Smith gives his book an interesting approach. Just when you think the story involves one thing it turns out to be something unrelated to the original situation. The twists and turns will keep the reader guessing until it reaches its satisfying conclusion."},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"The &quot;Memory Series&quot; by Martin Smith just gets better and better. STRAW MEN is the third in the line, and it sucks you in and absorbs you until the last page. At the core of the story is the issue of how reliable are our memories.

A chilling tale that mystery and suspense fans won't want to miss."},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"Jim Christensen is a psychologist who must try to delve into the damaged mind of Teresa Hartnett. Teresa was the victim of a severe beating and brutal rape six years ago. Her head injuries were so severe that her skull was crushed adversely affecting her memory. Now, Carmen DellaVecchio, the man who was convicted based on her testimony is being released when newly discovered DNA evidence tends to exonerate him. Teresa begins to doubt her own memory and seeks Jim's help to discover the truth. The problem is Jim's girlfriend, Brenna Kennedy, is the DellaVecchio's defense attorney and is mainly responsible for his release. However, things turn quite ominous when both Teresa and Brenna begin receiving threatening calls.Martin J. Smith can certainly tell a terrifying tale. The reader is quickly drawn into the captivating plot. Characters, as a whole, appear very much true to life. The author makes good use of the Pittsburgh locale. However, it is a clunky exposition that pulls all the loose threads together. Martin J. Smith is a talented writer who has written a book well worthy of the Edgar award in this category."},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"I've read Straw Men twice now and I think it's Smith's best. I've read all three books and I've seen him growing steadily as a writer and storyteller. In Straw Men he gets down to business early on, establishing a horrific character called the &quot;Scarecrow.&quot; In a few words Smith describes this lost soul in a way that makes him both frightening and pitiful. However, the book belongs to psychologist Jim Christiansen who explores the dark corners of the human mind. Jim is an ordinary man caught in an extraordinary situation. He's burdened with knowledge that threatens to unearth many painful buried secrets. As they come to light again, the Pittsburgh police department, and the city itself, is thrown into chaos. There is a particularly well observed relationship between Christiansen and Teresa Harnett, a cop who was nearly killed, allegedly by the Scarecrow. The interplay in these sections is filled with nuance and emotion. This is a book that will keep you up at night, and will live in your mind for years. Read it."},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"Eight years ago, an assailant attacked Teresa Harnett in her kitchen. The culprit smashed her head with a bottle, rammed her head on the floor several times, raped her, and left a calling card of a broken bottle end inside her vagina. The vicious individual left Teresa for dead, but she was rushed to the hospital and with the help of her loving and caring spouse physically recovers.However, Teresa's nightmare begins anew because the defense lawyer Brenna Kennedy demands a new trail for her convicted client Carmen DellaVechhio. DNA evidence destroys much of the proof the DA used the first time around. The presiding judge releases the incarcerated individual pending final dismissal of all charges. Teresa begins to wonder if she helped place the wrong person behind bars. Neither Brenna nor Teresa realizes what heartache and murders await them as this case moves into the final stages.Martin J. Smith is one the most under-appreciated thriller writers on the market today. He consistently provides chillers that deserve a vast audience. His latest winner, STRAW MEN, is loaded with surprises and revelations mostly frightening because they feel real yet are unexpected. Characters from other books by Mr. Smith have evolved as if they share real time with the reader, which adds to the feel of chilling reality. This novel is a thumbs-up legal thriller.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"Martin Smith's 'Memory Series' continues...and his novels just seem to get better with every new title.

There's a nice plot twist reminiscent of \\"L.A. Confidential\\" (the movie version, not the book), and a subtle but ever-present erotic tension simmering beneath the surface of the story. Jim Christensen is one of the few protagonists in mystery genre who really comes off as an authentic ordinary person. Smart, but not too smart, and far from masterful. He's a genuine soccer dad with coffee stains on his tie who struggles to cope with with the perplexing mysteries of everyday life, as well as the occasional crime."},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"'Straw Men' is a disappointingly simple book. Mr. Smith guides the reader along a predictable and sometimes aggravatingly obvious path throughout the story. The clues in this mystery novel leave nothing for the reader to deduce on their own.There is no reason you'll need your brain for this read. Everything will be throughly explained to you and that is what is so sad about it. You are treated like a obtuse three year-old.If don't think it's suspicious when a beat cop has a $50k Mercedes SUV as a second vehicle, this book might be a good challenge for you. Otherwise stick to James Patterson or James Lee Burke.I give this book two stars for the sole fact that it takes place in Pittsburgh."},{"Title":"Straw Men","review":"i thought this book was great.

It is very romantic, but has a great story to back up the sex scenes. There are some books that you read to get to the sex scenes. This one is so good that you don't care when you get to those or where they are. Now I can't wait for Joseph's Bride to come!"},{"Title":"Wanting Something More (Stepp Sisters, Book 3)","review":"This book had a little bit of everything, drama, laughs, suspense and of course romance. This is the first book I have read by Kathy Love. Very entertaining read."},{"Title":"Wanting Something More (Stepp Sisters, Book 3)","review":"Now that I have read the entire Stepp Sisters Trilogy, I'm utterly in love with what Kathy Love has to offer. The title of this book, &#34;Wanting Something More&#34; fits it perfectly, for two reasons. 1. The characters, Marty and Nate, long for something more from each other. 2. The reader wants something more, needs something more from these characters, and boy do we get it! I can't decide which of the three books is my favorite, but I know this is a new favorite series. I truly enjoyed it and am half tempted to start back from the beginning right now (unfortunately, I have to come back to reality :( haha). The vocabulary still lacked, but it wasn't as bad as &#34;Getting What You Want&#34;, however, it didn't improve from &#34;Wanting What You Get&#34;. Can't really complain, as the book was still great. I made it a habit of reading this book just before bed. Ah, dreamland romance :D"},{"Title":"Wanting Something More (Stepp Sisters, Book 3)","review":"4 out of 5 stars!! This is a fun and sweet novel by a fellow Maineiac (someone born in/from Maine)! Marty and Nate are such a great couple!! I'm sooo happy that Nate had gotten attacked since before he sounded like a royal jerk!! =0P But anyways ....This is a story about two different people who are in the process of finding themselves again, and fall-in-love along the way. I really liked this new twist that the author takes with her main characters ... very creative. I couldn't stop reading till I got to the end!!Reviewed By: From Me to You ... Book Reviews(read more of this review and a teaser on my blog)"},{"Title":"Wanting Something More (Stepp Sisters, Book 3)","review":"This is book 3 of the Stepp sister trilogy. It was just as wonderful as book 1 and 2. I highly reccommend all 3 books. The story and the romance were just great."},{"Title":"Wanting Something More (Stepp Sisters, Book 3)","review":"This is third and final installment about the awkward and unpopular Stepp sisters growing up in smalltown Millbrook Maine. Although each book is very similar in its premise of finding happily ever after in the least likely place, each story has a unique romance. This story focuses on the youngest sister, Marty, her trials growing up, and a second chance at a romance she only dreamed of when she was a child.At the age of 13, Marty was teased incessantly, not only as one of the ugly Stepp sisters, but also because of her freakish 6' height. Taller than almost all of the boys, Marty took her fair share of pranks and cruel jokes. Lured into a heartbreaking deception as a teenager, Nathaniel Peck was dared to get Marty to one of the highschool dances and kiss her in front of everyone. Marty fell hook line and sinker thinking Nathaniel actually liked her, only to learn her lesson of how cruel boys could really be. So what's a freakishly tall and coltish girl to do? Move to New York city after highschool and become one of the world's biggest supermodels of course. Unfortunately, Marty's experiences with men after highschool doesn't get any better and after 15 years of jetsetting, distraight Marty leaves for her hometown to seek solace and support from her endearing sisters, only to find herself in a torrential snowstorm. As she enters the town limits, she realizes she's being followed by none other than Chief of Police, Nathaniel Peck. The last time she saw Nathaniel, he was crashing her sister's wedding and asking her if certain parts of her anatomy were real or airbrushed. There isn't a person she despises more, so while sleeping in her grandmother's empty home, she couldn't be more surprised when an unexpected Nathaniel lets himself in for the night. When Marty discovers that he actually has a key to the place, she becomes disoriented and confused but tolerates the situation with as much grace and dignity as possible. She promptly investigates the circumstances that leave Nathaniel in the good graces of her family only to find that Nathaniel is a new man. He was attacked in his home about a year ago, and the near death experience was life altering for his personality. Now going by Nate instead, she slowly discovers that Nate is a completely different person who does not altogether disgust her. In fact, quite the contrary, she can't help but find herself attracted to the new and improved man, but she certainly proceeds with caution based on all of her previous bad experience.This was a very sweet romance and Marty is nothing short of a class act. She could have handled things very differently and even though her instinct is to be cutting and cruel to keep up her barriers, she finds herself wanting to believe and trusting even against her better judgement. Nate was patient, loving and caring in this book, but I still struggled with the near death experience changing a person from a chauvinist pig into Superman. The premise of the previous two novels is a lifetime of subtle changes and growing up, but Nate pulls a 180 overnight when he looks in the mirror and doesn't like what he sees. Regardless, the story is sexy, poignent, and even has a bit of mystery to solve the crime of who actually attacked him. This was a great wrap up to a very entertaining romantic series."},{"Title":"Wanting Something More (Stepp Sisters, Book 3)","review":"This was definitely my favorite book in the Stepp sisters trilogy and you can definitely read it without having read the other 2 books. It's nice to see her sisters again, but nothing that happens in the previous two books is necessary for enjoying this book.The thing that set this book apart from the other two, for me, is the unique relationship between Marty and Nate. Unlike with both previous books where the heroine had a crush on the hero in high school (and in the case of Ellie, sister 2, that crush continued on long past high school), in this book, Marty has a terrible history with Nate and absolutely hates him. This makes for some interesting interactions between the two characters and adds a little more tension throughout the book.I really enjoyed Marty's battle within herself over whether or not to trust that Nate had really changed and trying to reconcile the Nate that WAS (pre-incident) with the Nate that IS (post-incident). When I saw that Nate was going to be the hero of the 3rd book, I was wondering how the author was going to pull that off, because when we met him briefly in the beginning of book 2, he was a total jerk, as he was in the prologue of this book. But Nate's drastic personality change, and the reason behind it, in addition to Marty's reluctance to just accept it, really added a depth and tension to this book that I thought was missing in the previous two books.While I enjoyed reading books 1 and 2, I thought this book was just one notch higher in my enjoyability scale. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Wanting Something More (Stepp Sisters, Book 3)","review":"After reading the first two stories in this series I was looking forward to this one and wasn't disappointed. Marty while successful in her career has had bad luck in love. Nat with his arrogant background was a great character, how his life changed after his near death experience.

Marty couldn't forgive and trust nate at first. but he's changed after a vicious attack. the two grew from keepin a distance from each other to can't keep hands off each other. it's one of the best romance novels. maybe not THAT realistic, but it's definitely a GREAT fantasy."},{"Title":"Wanting Something More (Stepp Sisters, Book 3)","review":"If you read the first two books of this series(a must) you will like the nice touch of this last book.

It's storming out and the first person she encounters is her nemesis and most hated citizen of Millbrook, Nathaniel Peck. He once hurt and embarrassed her horribly in high school, starting what would be one of her first disappointments with the male species. She's not any happier to encounter him on the stormy night. But... something's different about him, and the more time she spends in Millbrook, getting reacquainted with the town, the more she is coming to find out that something changed the night he was attacked in his home.For his part, Nate would love to get to know Marty. She's smart, sassy, beautiful of course, what model isn't, but beneath her jaded exterior, he senses a soul just as vulnerable and lonely as his own. He wants to prove to her, to all of Millbrook, that he has changed, that he's no longer the jackass they knew and hated. He also wants to find out who attacked him, for his own piece of mind. What will happen between these two? Well, you'll have to read to find out!If you've read the first two stories in this trilogy, you know that missing Marty's story would be a grave mistake. Once again, Ms. Love has created a story with a very sensual thrust, while at the same time, creating a deep and abiding love. This is really a true romance at heart. And besides, who can resist a story where the heroine once detested the hero? Nate's tale is tragic, but it is what he has made of his life since that night that shows what a great man he is. I fell a bit in love with him myself. The one qualm I had was that it seemed like he had become TOO good, in order to make up for being so cruel before. He turned almost too perfect, but I suppose that isn't necessarily a bad thing in a romance story. He was still a great guy, a soft touch, and a man willing to do anything for the woman he loves.I was very happy with the subtle nuances of this story, and especially with Marty's quest to change her own life around, to become someone she could respect. Her story is a nonstop page-turner.You won't want to pass on this story! I guarantee it. The great thing is though, whether or not you've read the first to Stepp sisters stories, you'll still be able to understand this story quite clearly, something most romance fans will appreciate."},{"Title":"Wanting Something More (Stepp Sisters, Book 3)","review":"After this, I'm \\"wanting something more\\" from Kathy Love! What a wonderful book!This is the last book of the Stepp Sister Series, and it's definitely my favorite. Marty Stepp is a character to whom many women can relate (granted, not all of us can claim to be supermodels). Throughout parts of her life, Mary was teased, rejected, cheated, and criticized by men. And because of these instances, Marty is convinced that she is unworthy of true love.Enter Nate Peck: He was the bane of Marty's existence early on in her life. Selfishly cruel, Nate lived to prank and tease unfortunates. He only cared about himself and impressing his friends. Well... that is until he has a near death experience. This event changes his whole outlook on life. Nate feels sincere remorse for all the horrible deeds he had done - no longer does he want to live selfishly, without care for anyone else.The joining of Marty and Nate is written very convincingly. Understandably, Marty doesn't trust Nate's intentions. But, thankfully, she doesn't completely cut him off. As a result, the two slowly form a solid friendship based on mutual respect and affection; and eventually, this evolves into a breathtaking romance.This story made me sigh out loud several times. It was food for all five of the senses...especially with all the descriptions of Christmas, snow, family, and food. I was tempted several times to use my fire place - but that's just not practical when it's the middle of summer.This is a very good book people! It's worth the purchase."},{"Title":"Wanting Something More (Stepp Sisters, Book 3)","review":"Marty Stepp is coming home to Millbrook, Maine after leaving behind her life in New York. The fact she has left her career as a super model behind her along with Rod is only the half of it. She is half way home when she hits the snowstorm to end all snowstorms. But this is not the worst. Instead she runs into her high school heartbreak, Nathaniel Peck. This isn't her first run in with this particular man and she is not interested in what he has to say. She has no idea that fate has it's own plans and Nate and Marty are going to be spending a great deal of time together.Nate has changed and for the better. Granted he was once a nasty piece of work but an attack that left him severely hurt seems to be the catalyst to taking life a little more seriously, and to treat people a little bit nicer. People he used to tease and torment are now his friends. He doesn't remember a lot and part of his memories of the way he treated Marty are MIA. But, will he finally be able to remember and make up the hurt he caused the one woman he really has an interest in or will Marty hold on tightly to the hurt feelings he generated/This was my favorite of the Stepp Sisters' series. Marty and Nate are very interesting characters and their romance was sweet. Again we get to visit with Abby, Ellie, Mason and Chase and I was sorry to have to say good-bye to all of these wonderful characters.

She's left her modeling agency and career with no notice to spend the holidays with her family, sisters Abby and Ellie. On her way home, she encounters Nathaniel Peck, Millbrook's chief of police. She remembers him as a conceited jerk, but unknown to her, Nate's had a life-altering experience, and is not the person he once was.Nate follows her home that snowy evening, concerned she won't make it in her jaguar. When he approaches Marty, all she remembers is a time in high school when he humiliated her. Nate doesn't recall the high school incident at this point. Months ago, Nate was attacked while he slept in his home and almost died, going into a coma. When Nate woke up, he was a changed man. He grew out his hair, became a vegetarian, and is now a \\"big brother\\" to a couple of hard-luck kids. Despite the change, Marty is reluctant to believe it, even though the sparks fly between her and Nate from the moment they meet.Marty tries to fight her attraction to Nate, but its futile. She's hopelessly fallen for him. Nate, who is really a great guy, can't help but be attracted to the supermodel. He finds her gorgeous - inside and out. They go out on a series of dates, and Nate tries to go slow for Marty's sake, letting her set the pace. Finally, on New Year's Eve, Nate and Marty consummate their relationship.Nate's old friend, Jared Nye, tries to come between Marty and Nate. His sister, Josie, tells Marty lies about Nate, which scares her so bad, Marty leaves to go back to her modeling career. Nate learns of Jared and Josie's deception, and follows Marty to New York where he wins her heart.CHARACTERS:Nate and Marty - The Main charactersMary Stepp is pretty, personable, and ready to settle down after a high profile career. She wants something more out of life than modeling can give her.Nate Peck is a changed man and a very likeable guy. He's very contrite over his past hurtful actions and he's a male Adonis to boot.Abby, Ellie and their families - Supporting charactersIt's nice to catch up with Marty's sisters. Abby and Chase are expecting and while Abby tries to knit a blanket for the new baby, she realizes she's not much of a homebody. Ellie and Mason are very happy together. They have a daughter, Emily, who is adorable and precocious.Jared Nye - The bad guyJared wants everything Nate has - his land and Marty, and will stop at nothing to get it. Through the course of the novel, it is revealed that he's the one who attacked Nate and almost killed him.PLOT AND PACINGMy only complaint with the pacing is that by page 200, I was as sexually frustrated as Nate. Still, it's not enough to take away my five star rating. When Marty and Nate finally consummate their relationship, its very rewarding.The plot is perfect for \\"Chick Lit\\". It's a very engaging novel.DIALOGUECrisp and sharp, it easily moves the story forward.DESCRIPTIONSLove gives the reader enough to allow the reader to picture snowy New England in the winter. There's not too much or too little. She's found the perfect balance and sets the novel well.THOUGHTS AND IMPRESSIONS\\"Wanting Something More\\" is a very easy read. Love is a master at Chick Lit and the Stepp Sisters series is very enjoyable. If you want to take a time out for an evening, this novel is the perfect one to do it with. Mary and Nate easily pull you into their world."},{"Title":"Wanting Something More (Stepp Sisters, Book 3)","review":"This is the first book I read of Kathy Love's and I thought it was really well writen and intertaining. I was in a little town's used bookstore on the way to the airport and wanted to get a cute fun book for the 3 hour flight and I glanced at this book and decided why not. I am so glad that I picked this one, once I started it I couldnt put it down. I just loved the fact that when this hot super model was in high school she was the dorky girl who always got made fun of and then when she grew up she turned into something great and showed her old town. Of course seeing your old high school crush who broke your heart can always throw you for a loop but she took it and it just set the pace for this great book. The style of writing reminded my of Janet Evanovich so if you like one you will possibly like the other. Hope all who reads it enjoy it as much as I did.

Nock viewed the war-guilt clause of the treaty (which placed total blame for WWI upon the Germans) as a piece of moralistic buncombe which would get the United States and her allies in trouble down the road. His predictions in this matter were more correct than most people writing during the time. Nock was one of the critics of our war policy who remained true to his cause throughout the war and refused to be silenced. Never one to jump on any band-wagon, Nock rips into Wilsonian idealism as well as French and British diplomatic duplicity. A must read for any understanding of the Versailles Treaty, its presuppositions and its consequences."},{"Title":"The myth of a guilty nation","review":"Published in 1922 by the great individualist-anarchist Albert Jay Nock, \\"The Myth of a Guilty Nation\\" is one of the first great works of the first world war \\"revisionism.\\" In it, Nock challenges the idea -- already entrenched by the terms of the Versailles Treaty -- that Germany was solely responsible for the onset of the war. Nock does not argue, as he takes pains to point out, that Germany bears *no* responsibility. He does say, however, that Germany's responsibility is certainly no greater than that of other nations, and that it may even be less.By 1921, British premier David Lloyd George had already declared German guilt a \\"chose jug&eacute;e\\" -- a \\"judged thing\\" or settled matter, a phrase Nock repeats many times in these pages. Nock however brings together a number of suppressed or forgotten facts, from the relative size of pre-war defense budgets to statements of politicians like Lloyd George himself, to argue that to the extent the question has been \\"settled,\\" it has been done so on the basis of lies that can only come back to bite the US and its allies in the future.Nock's book is a short one, and other writers (notably Harry Elmer Barnes) would cover the topic in far greater depth and detail. But Nock's early effort is still worth revisiting. As the causes and consequences of the first world war become ever more lost in the mists of history, the facts Nock brings out -- as well as the example of one of the great men of America's pro-freedom tradition -- are even more worthy of remembering by the Remnant."},{"Title":"The myth of a guilty nation","review":"Albert Jay Nock wrote one of the first American books of WWI Revisionism - revising the received story of why WWI began. As a lover of history, what is particularly fascinating about his book The Myth of a Guilty Nation is not whether this is the best explanation for WWI. What is fascinating is the great contrast Nock makes between two wholly different views of origin of the war. What \`everyone knew' about the origins of The Great War at the time are quite different from what \`everyone knows' now.The common American notion was that Germany was responsible for the war. No less a personage than David Lloyd George declared \\"What are we fighting for? To defeat the most dangerous conspiracy ever plotted against the liberty of nations; carefully, skilfully, insidiously, clandestinely planned in every detail, with ruthless, cynical determination.\\"By reading the book we start to see just how differently people viewed the origin of the war at the time, especially in the U.S. Since WWI the revisionists won many of the battles, WWI is usually viewed today more as a tragedy, a pointless disaster, the effect of secret diplomacy, general militarism, etc. The reader today is therefore unaware of how many Americans understood the war as the sole outcome of a German conspiracy for plunder. While today we know Europe was an armed camp, the pro-allied propaganda claimed that Europe was unprepared for war. Nock makes the reader aware of the great extent to which the allied politicians continually lied to blame Germany and justify the war, or at least told stories with no regard for the truth. No wonder Hitler found British propaganda so inspiring. In fact the story at the time made it sound like Germany was trying over-run Europe the way Hitler temporarily did a few decades later.What Nock brings to the fore is the extent to which WWI may be viewed as the opposite of a conspiracy by Germany. If there was a conspiracy it would have been by the allied Entente powers. To a large degree it was blundered in to by state officials. whose desire for peace was fatally undermined by their imperialist ambitions.We should first note that he also touches on how many powerful parties simply wanted peace. However small powerful parties in France, Britain, and Russia all pushed for war and created secret treaties among each other. As Ralph Raico pointed out English foreign policy was dominated by a small secret clique no more answerable to Parliament and the people than a dictatorship like Nazi Germany. Those who knew of England secret obligations lied to Parliament and denied their existence.As Nock shows English, French and Russian foreign policy was directed against Germany and Austria-Hungary, and military spending was quite large and much greater than Germany and Austria-Hungary's. All three had powerful cliques who were aggressive towards the Central Powers. They were bound by secret treaties, though this alliance was not publicly acknowledged.In Nock's book this is roughly what happened to start WWI. Serbia and the Balkans had a foreign policy dominated by Russia. The assassins of Archduke Ferdinand were linked to the Russian pro-war clique. Russia had been 'test' mobilizing since the spring of 1914, and its army alone was equal to Germany and Austria-Hungary combined. Russia had a secret treaty with France calling for France to support Russia if Russia mobilized and went to war. The UK had a secret treaty with France calling for it to support France during war, and to a much lesser but important degree Russia. Bound by secret treaties all three powers found themselves thrust in to war. Germany saw itself encircled by superior numbers. (Therefore it had to defeat the France and Russia in decisive battles before it succumbed in a war of attrition. Similar to Israel's situation when faced with a land war against three neighbors.)The assassination of the Archduke Ferdinand, conveniently for the Pro-War Entente cliques, set off the train of powder to the powder keg of a general European war of France, Russia and England against Germany and Austria-Hungary.For sources Nock makes great use of Belgian diplomatic correspondence, which noted little evidence of German aggression. The Soviet Union also released many embarrassing secret documents from the Tsarist archives. Nock highly recommends English Liberals Francis Neilson's and E. D. Morel's works of WWI revisionism. (Neilson's How Diplomats Make War is hard to read, while Nock's is a breeze. Neilson focuses more on the English diplomacy and other created uncertainty.) It should be noted too that Nock shows evidence that Belgian Neutrality was a fig leaf to justify unpopular UK involvement.Having documentation of a push for war by cliques in Russia, France, and England, Nock shows how German war guilt is a myth and if anything pro-war cliques in Russia, France, and England were successful in conspiring for war.What makes this book worth reading is not whether this is the best explanation for WWI. It is worth seeing how small groups of state officials engaged in secret actions that lead to a catastrophic war, and continually lied throughout the whole process to provide themselves ideological cover. What is fascinating is the great contrast Nock makes between two wholly different views of origin of the war. While history and reality seems settled and known, people at different times have radically different understandings of the exact same events."},{"Title":"Mojave Pottery, Mojave People: The Dillingham Collection of Mojave Ceramics","review":"Our friends, who were raised on an Indian Reservation, loved this book and told us they learned a lot from it."},{"Title":"The Tree That Never Dies: Oral history of the Michigan Indians","review":"The Tree That Never Dies: Oral History of the Michigan Indians has a homemade feel, with typeset pages and poor binding (my copy was printed with most pages either upside down or out of order, and fell apart to the touch--I rebound it), published by the Grand Rapids Public Library.

Sections include: crafts (not a how to, unfortunately, but descriptions), hunting, diet, housing, education, medicine beliefs, death, pow-wows, and storytelling.Writing down oral history is a difficult process, because you have to be faithful to what was said, and the direction stories take may be hampered by the original interviewer or interviewees. When people have passed on or are not available for follow-up questions, sometimes entire stories are not present, and you feel like you're just getting a sample of the really good stuff. That was some of the frustration I felt when reading The Tree That Never Dies. I wished I could ask the interviewees follow up questions to learn more about what they had said and better flesh out the stories. Much of the book is summaries rather than direct quotes. Another fault of the book is that it does not list most dates of when events took place, instead using no terms at all, or vague terms like \\"years ago\\" (41). The reader will be confused about whether the events are from the '70s (when the book was compiled) or much earlier, something important to know especially for those reading the book for a scholarly purpose. Additionally, names are not used, so it's not clear who is who.That being said, it's still an interesting book by an anthropologist who did us all a favor by compiling tapes into a text and preserving a bit of regional history. For the amount of time and effort that likely went into the project by all involved, it deserves four stars."},{"Title":"The 12 Step Prayer Book: A Collection of Favorite 12 Step Prayers and Inspirational Readings","review":"I carry this with me every day.

Whichever stories you believe are missing are either not short stories or mis-attributed to him. There are other editions of Maupassant's \\"complete\\" stories but these other editions often include dozens, if not over a hundred stories which were written by other people. Artine Artinian, the editor of the correct (this) edition is an excellent Maupassant scholar. I'm left with wondering what exactly was a waste of money - that you didn't care for the writing or that you feel the book was incomplete? And why buy it if you felt you could get them online for free?If you enjoy short stories and have not read Maupassant, shame on you. Maupassant, along with Hemingway, is the father of the short story and defines exactly what a short story ought to be. The richness and economy of his writing speaks even through the translation.

The authors detail the wealth of external evidence that illustrates the priority of Matthew -- a conclusion which, if accepted, automatically discredits the Two-Source Hypothesis and the Farrer Hypothesis. The authors go on to show that the external evidence is compatible with both the Two-Gospel Hypothesis and the Augustinian hypothesis (Matthew, Mark, Luke).Most helpful is the way that the authors go line by line through the gospel of Mark and show how he has taken some of Matthew and some of Luke.But it's one thing to go line by line through Mark and show how his gospel could be a summarized and conflated version of Matthew and Luke. It's something else to consider all of the material that Mark does NOT include, and ask why he omitted it. The authors of the book acknowledge this important question, i.e. why would Mark omit the sermon on the mount/plain, and why would he omit the Lord's Prayer. Unfortunately, I find the authors' reasoning difficult to accept.The Synoptic Problem is enormously complex and the authors do provide an introduction for people who are 'just getting started.' Still, I'd recommend a basic proficiency in Greek and at least a familiarity with the various solutions to the Synoptic Problem before picking up this book. It is well worth the read."},{"Title":"One Gospel From Two: Mark's Use of Matthew and Luke","review":"The collaborative effort of David B. Peabody (Nebraska Wesleyan University, Lincoln, Nebraska), Lamar Cope (Carroll College, Waukesha, Wisconsin), and Allan J. McNicol (Austin Graduate School of Theology, Austin, Texas), One Gospel From Two: Mark's Use Of Matthew And Luke offers a dissenting voice from the mainstream claim that Mark was the first Gospel historically written, and that Matthew and Luke borrowed materials for their accounts from Mark, among other sources. Instead, One Gospel From Two claims that the Gospel of Mark was dependent upon those of Matthew and Luke. Iconoclastic and highly recommended reading for students of New Testament Studies, the extensive analysis of literary details, careful annotation, an erudite text, and persuasive details derived from meticulous research, distinguish One Gospel From Two as a carefully conceived and a particularly well-argued New Testament study."},{"Title":"The Sherman Tank","review":"If you need an illustrated history of the Sherman Tank, and have absolutely no other resources at hand, this book is possibly better than nothing. However, it is full of generalizations and some outright errors, and the whole thing seems to have been thrown together rather quickly. A far better choice would be any of Steven J. Zaloga's books published by Osprey and Concord or either Squadron-Signal publication (\\"Sherman in Action\\" or \\"Sherman Walkaround\\"). Best of all is Richard Hunnicutt's enormous work \\"Sherman: A History of the American Medium Tank.\\" Though many would balk at the price, it is by far the best work available, with thousands of photos and multiview 1:48th scale drawings by D.P. Dyer of every Sherman subtype. However, it is hard to find at the moment.Steven J. Zaloga's new book , \\"Armored Thunderbolt: The U.S. Army Sherman in World War II\\" is an excellent and comprehensive book on the vehicle's development and operations, with 400 photos (though only a handful of drawings). It is also an excellent value for money."},{"Title":"The Sherman Tank","review":"This book tells the story of the American made Sherman Tank. It begins with the early influences that lead up to the development and manufacture of the tank. Subsequent chapters cover the Sherman in action, variants of the tank such as self propelled artillery and a fairly complete history up to its post war use by Isreal. The photos and graphics are good. The author has done a good job of covering the subject without getting bogged down in the myriad of details of this vast subject. For most military enthusiasts this book should enough detail to provide a complete understanding of the tank.I'd recommend this book for a reader looking for a solid, well balanced history of the Sherman Tank."},{"Title":"The North Carolina Sierra Club's guide to the Jocassee Gorges: Horsepasture, Bearwallow, & Toxaway Region","review":"The written information in this guide is somewhat dated, but still useful.

Susan writes the prologue, a woman is about to give birth to her first child. She loves her child, a product of one night with her boyfriend before he went off to war and was killed. Her parents are disappointed in her, and plan to give her child to another family, but she can't do it. She flees on a cold wet night and has her baby in a strangers home, where her parents locate her. Taking her daughter with her she flees again. She travels for a while then comes across a home and leaves her child on the doorstep with a locket. The first story &quot;The Woman Next Door&quot; is also writen by Susan and chronicles how this little baby was found by Michael, a man who's lost his wife and child and feels empty inside. When he finds the child her turns to his neighbor, Katherine, to help him with the child. This story shows the romance blossom between the two of them and the love for the child. Both women bring love and joy back into his life. The next story in the book follows the mom who gave up her daugher. Cassie Edwards picks up the story and Davinda's struggles to deal with the loss of her daughter. Walking Thunder is the Chief to the Blackfoot people, and takes her in and tries to heal the loss in her heart. She eventually trusts him and they go on to have several children, and they take care of Walking Thunder's nephew Daniel, but she never forgets her first born. This is where Lori Copeland takes over. She writes of Sarah, a piano teacher raised by Michael and Katherine. She takes on a new student Daniel, who wants to learn how to play a song for his &quot;adopted mother's&quot; birthday. They begin to grow feelings for each other, but feel that they have to hide it because he is Indian and she is white. Well, their love wins out and he takes her home to meet his family. Of course mother and daughter reunite, when Daniel recognizes the locket both his wife and his &quot;adopted mother&quot; have. This whole book is just wonderful and I have read it several times, and always in one sitting. The stories come together beautifully and no one author lacks in keeping your attention. I bought this book being a Casey Edwards fan, but I have sinse bought all of Susan's books and are starting in on Lori's. This book is masterfully writen by three amazing authors."},{"Title":"The Family Trade (Merchant Princes)","review":"I will admit that in the beginning, I was not sure if I would enjoy this book. However, the more I read - the more it captured my interest and it became a 'I can't put this down' type of book. I admire Stross for his innovative storyline of moving from one time line into another and back again. I have always known there were parallel timelines and parallel universes. In quantum physics all things are possible. I thoroughly enjoyed Stross' ability to be outrageous. His storyline reminded me of Alice in Wonderland. In one sense this is Through the Looking Glass. For those who want a new genre of science fiction, I recommend this book.

The Family Trade et al., is certainly frothier and not nearly as jampacked with crazy, cool ideas and analyses (though certainly the book isn't fully lacking in these), and the quasi-Fantasy motif was initially surprising (though really despite the packaging it is science fiction in the end), but the characters (particularly the protagonist) are so fun and engaging that I couldn't wait to dive into the next one. And the next one. These aren't the books Stross will be remembered for in decades to come (and he will be remembered) but they're the ones that I enjoyed the most."},{"Title":"The Family Trade (Merchant Princes)","review":"This is called a fantasy novel. I suppose it is but it is not in the domain of wizards and elves and such. It reads more like a science fiction mystery.It is the story of one Miriam Beckstein. She is a techno-journalist and she has the goods on some dirty dealings and drug laundering in the business community. As a result, she gets fired. This starts a complex chain of events. She visits her adoptive mother, her biological one was killed when she was just a baby, and Mom gives her a little more information on her background along with a box of possessions from her bio-mom. Included in the box is a strange amulet. When examining the amulet, she finds herself transported to a different world.The world is a parallel of our own but has developed differently. It is feudal in nature and the most powerful power block is her own biological family. A recessive gene permits them to transport themselves between the two worlds. This allows them all sorts of trade advantages. On one side, they transport drugs slipping by all authorities. On the other, they import luxury items that only they can get from our world. It makes for a lucrative living. The problem is that it is run in Machiavellian fashion and women have very little place in the scheme of things except as couriers and breeders. This does not sit well with our heroine.She dislikes the drug trade and dislikes the role of women. She wants to change things. The vested interests do not want their applecart overturned. That naturally leads to plots of murder...by multiple factions.It's an interesting and well written work. My only complaint is the cliffhanger ending where nothing is resolved. I suppose I shall have to read the next book..."},{"Title":"The Family Trade (Merchant Princes)","review":"Came across both this and its sequel, \`The Hidden Family' whilst browsing the new books shelf in the local library. Despite the somewhat romantic artwork on the front cover and avoiding the usual unctuous and overly obsequious periodical praise on the backs this seemed intriguing. Rather than an alternative history, it sought to take fantasy, mesh it with time travel and then add in some alternative realities. Original and entertaining at first glance and so it proved.Stross has produced a novel that offers a wealth of plot, characterization and action which more than compensates for the writing style that is, at times, rushed. The lead character, Miriam Beckstein, a.k.a Countess Helge Thorold Hjorth, is prone to trusting all and sundry and seems incapable of not speaking the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth to anyone who asks. Still, this minor character flaw, coupled with her personality that demands all come under her authority, doesn't detract from a plot that is fascinating.The story opens with Miriam's impromptu sacking from her journalist career for delving into a topic that implicates too many people in money laundering. Her visit to her adopted mother, Iris, reveals a package with a Celtic knot medallion which is able to transport her to an alternative America that has only reached a technological state of the later medieval period. A few investigative sorties result in her capture by her extended family as she learns that she is descended from her mother, Patricia and father Alfred, both world-travelling members of the Clan. Her appearance on the scene provokes all kinds of furore as she takes her inheritance and is sent by her uncle, Angbard, to meet with the King and establish herself at Court.Subsequent assassination attempts, a passionate love affair with Roland, intrigues with Olga and Brilliana, and her attempts to get away from the business affairs that fund her extremely rich family lead Miriam to find a third world where America is under the influence of a Victorian-eqsue English rule. Her business acumen allows her to set up a business where her patents bring her wealth in the third world whilst she is able to shift Old Masters back to her world to make vast profit whilst she is trying to discover who is trying to assassinate her.So, Charles Stross has created an opening novel that offers a new take on the fantasy and alternative history genres. The action is measured, the plot crisp. The characterization needs work and this will improve as the series develops but this opener offers sufficient interest to ensure that the second novel will be read."},{"Title":"The Family Trade (Merchant Princes)","review":"It's that time of year again. I'm rereading S.M. Stirling's \\"Nantucket\\" stories, and just finished rereading his \\"Dies The Fire\\". So when I found a new \\"Misplaced Modern\\" (I love that term ... who coined it?) by an author I'd never heard of before, I had to buy it at the college bookstore.After all, Stirling is all about time/space displacement, slaves and massacres. One needs a change of pace.Miriam is 'almost' charming. She reminds me somehow of of George Alec Effinger's \\"Marueen Birnbaum, Barbarian Swordsperson\\", but without the cover art. Forgive the obscure cultural reference.Miriam would be more charming if she had more personal flaws. She would be Kinsey Millhone, if she drove a VeeWee. Interesting, but she needs a beauty spot.Still, the pace of the book is fast, there's plenty of action and a little mystery hinting of great revelations (remember Darth Vader spiraling out of the universe at the end of \\"Star Wars\\"?)It's more popcorn than meat-and-potatoe, and it piqued my interest sufficiently that I onlined Amazon and bought the second book in hardcover. Go there, and see what happened."},{"Title":"The Family Trade (Merchant Princes)","review":"Charles Stross held my interest quickly and kept it. I spent about six hours over two days on the book and although at times I found it a little hard to follow some of the jargon and the names gave me some trouble I enjoyed it. I would recommend to others who also found time travel interesting or enjoyed intrigue as well as fantasy. This is my first experience with Charles Stross and although I prefer stand alone novels in a series I will probably buy the second novel. If Mr. Stoss had completed this story I would have given him a 4.75. It is a great line of thought, interesting, well presented and unique to my reading experience, but I do not enjoy being left hanging."},{"Title":"The Family Trade (Merchant Princes)","review":"I found the concepts and plot of the novel to be well conceived. The \\"alternate world\\" scenario is familiar to readers of SF&F;, but he introduces some new ideas to this old concept. The idea of cross-world trade is handled well, as is the fleshing out of the medieval society on the other side. The ways in which Miriam's troubles in our world connect with her new life in the other world are intriguing.HOWEVER, Stross' dialogue is unendingly awkward. He uses a lot of fragments; characters start to say, \\"I--\\" and then launch into an entirely different thought. He may be doing this in an attempt to write natural-sounding dialogue, but fails miserably as the constant fragments leap out. Characters often start sentences with \\"Listen,\\" or \\"Look,\\" something which I've rarely encountered in actual conversation. Characters make leaps of logic which do not seem realistic, given the conversation. Pivotal moments in action are glossed over, or skipped entirely. And Miriam's romantic involvement with Roland is completely unbelievable. There's no character building or growth; their relationship springs from nowhere, apparently fully formed.Overall, it was an interesting read and I was impressed with the concepts and the way in which Stross sidestepped stereotypes. However, his writing leaves a lot to be desired."},{"Title":"The Family Trade (Merchant Princes)","review":"A decent book, but...Stross, stick to the hard Sci-Fi! Readers, skip this and read (or re-read, as the case may be) the Amber Chronicles! And did I read some review somewhere that stated this was a great \\"update\\" of the Amber tale? Gimme a break! Might as well say we need to update Moby Dick or Hamlet! Amber don't need no stinkin' update! The late Roger Zelazny not only did it first, but did it much, much better! On a trivia note, I give Stross kudos for what I think was an homage to Neuromancer. The first line of this book reads very much like an updated version of the first line of that seminal Gibson cyberpunk novel! I give you a nod for that, but it don't change the review, old bean! Long live Amber!"},{"Title":"The Family Trade (Merchant Princes)","review":"Stross writes brilliantly executed and gripping stories. Deep, thoughtful, complex, well visioned.This was bland, and as the first of at least five novels (the fifth doesn't resolve the story, it just leaves us with Bush and Cheney nuking the United States ...) it seems almost a fan fic by someone borrowing Stross's name.The premise is well described elsewhere. A family discovers that a celtic knot pattern causes them to shift between worlds. An assassination attempt kills one member and strands a baby child in our world, where she is rediscovered after she is a well developed adult, letting the author have the protagonist give us a modern person meets a dark ages culture and society that impinges on our world story.That goes slowly, pretty much nowhere, without much imagination.I'm perplexed more than anything else, I'd give this book two and a half stars. But if you want to know what is wrong with the book, it is a failure of imagination, a failure of characterization and a failure of to break out of being bland. If I had not read this book I would never have suspected Stross of being able to write a book (or a series of books) like this.Not terribly bad, just not good."},{"Title":"The Family Trade (Merchant Princes)","review":"This book is based on an interesting idea that is unevenly executed. Blending elements of a Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, the mafia as portrayed on TV, alternate history, and pretty people with guns, Stross creates a genre bending novel that includes some of my favorite elements such as anachronistically armed knights, bootstrapping primitive civilizations, and feudal intrigue but doesn't quite pull it off. I can't really complain about any single thing in this novel or its sequel, I read them quickly and enjoyed them, but neither did they stick out as great reads."},{"Title":"The Family Trade (Merchant Princes)","review":"unbelievable protagonist. silly situation. ridiculous decisions. just not good. I rarely put a book away before finishing it, even bad ones but I couldn't make it to halfway."},{"Title":"The Family Trade (Merchant Princes)","review":"I feel like the majority of the book was spent setting up the sequels, which I haven't read yet so I could be totally off. It's an interesting premise but after the original twist nothing really surprised me. Will most likely pick up the next one in a while."},{"Title":"The Family Trade (Merchant Princes)","review":"Let me start by saying I love Charles Stross. His Laundry Files series is snarky and well-written, funny and with good and complex characters.That's why this book was such a disappointment. If this exact book had been written by someone with less potential, I'd probably have enjoyed it more -- but I bought it being familiar with Stross' track record on his later novels, and was expecting more than I got.The book's biggest flaw, besides an incomprehensible political situation with warring clans of merchants, is that so much of the story comes from exposition. Rather than having his characters really experience the world, and the story being shown rather than told, the characters spout huge blocks of expository dialogue, so they end up telling you more than showing you.I'd say stay away from this one. It's not horrible, but it's not interesting enough to try and slog through the dialogue and the politics to try to find the nuggets of good story."},{"Title":"The Family Trade (Merchant Princes)","review":"Stross is one of those authors I've never been sure about. I've enjoyed some of his stories but others have left me with a shrug. He always seems to be talked up as a great innovator in science fiction, the cream of the cream, but he just doesn't affect me that way. This book, the first in the \\"Merchant Princes\\" trilogy, isn't a bad story but it certainly isn't a masterpiece. From the castle in the jacket illustration, I was sort of expecting a fantasy yarn, but it turns out to be a parallel-worlds story, very heavy on politics and economics. Miriam Beckstein is in her early thirties, a reasonably successful business and science journalist in Boston specializing in biotech (her abandoned medical school career is good for something). She's been around -- married, divorced, an abortion in college -- and she's got a grip on her life. The key fact in her existence, though, is that her mother, name unknown, was murdered when Miriam was only a few weeks old and she was fostered on a young, hip academic couple. While those are the parents she has ever known, she's still aware of the mystery regarding her origins. Now her foster mother, who is seriously ill, has given her a shoebox full of old papers and mementos, including a gold locket with an oddly hypnotic knotwork design inside. And when she examines it, stares at it, she finds herself suddenly somewhere else -- in a medieval-seeming world where the knights in armor also carry machine pistols. Miriam turns out to be a long-lost heiress to a serious fortune, a member of a powerful family in an alternate version of New England where (apparently) the Norse settled in permanently, in a world where Western Europe appears to be under Mongol control. Or something. Of course, she isn't going to be allowed to sit back and enjoy her new fortune. Like it or not, she's now a playing-piece, a pawn in the power struggle between family factions, and between the family and the outside world. She's in some danger, including from her newly discovered blood relatives. And the \\"family trade\\" in import/export is not one she's at all comfortable with. But Miriam isn't the sort of person to simply do what she's told, and the last page makes it clear she intends (in the next volume) to take on the world.Miriam is an excessively competent person, as is so often the case in alternate-world and time-travel novels. It doesn't take her an hour to work out what's happening to her and for her to begin making plans. Also, she seems to be angry all the time, alternating between high dudgeon and cold fury. Moreover, Stross is guilty of overwriting in places, including some rather turgid dialogue. Still, he's got my interest sufficiently that I'll be hunting up the next two volumes."},{"Title":"The Family Trade (Merchant Princes)","review":"The concept of alternate universes is not new, but Stross takes the idea and investigates more than the technical. Miriam thinks she's an orphan growing up in the US and knows nothing about alternate universes. Things change. The pacing of her trying to understand her new environment is good and the story is enjoyable.There are two problems keeping it from a five. First is the very poor cliff hanger ending. A good writer can clearly end each novel and make it a contained whole. Stross couldn't. Second, there's some Melville-like tangential rants about politics that are unneeded."},{"Title":"The Family Trade (Merchant Princes)","review":"Reading Charles Stross' Merchant Princes series, it is difficult to avoid a comparison with Roger Zelazny'sThe Great Book of Amber: The Complete Amber Chronicles, 1-10 (Chronicles of Amber). In fact, it is difficult to imagine that Zelazny was not an influence on Stross. The first and second book (The Hidden Family: Book Two of Merchant Princes) of the series are an interesting and entertaining riff on the world walker into alternative worlds theme. The characters are interesting and Stross has fascinating ideas about economics which, in the books I read, remain unreconciled."},{"Title":"The Family Trade (Merchant Princes)","review":"There are a lot of things not to like about this book.

It's ordered.That said.. if you haven't read Amber by Zelazny, you should. It starts slow but is a engrossing experience. Nine Princes in Amber"},{"Title":"The Family Trade (Merchant Princes)","review":"I came across this series as a recommendation on Amazon's plog. It sounded interesting so I decided to give the series a try via my public library. I won't go too much into the plot summary as that's been discussed in various reviews here and is on the book jacket.As others have mentioned, the premise of parallel worlds is not new, but the way in which each series deals with such worlds and how they operate are certainly a continual source of creativity. Then, of course, there are the colorful characters and how they interact.The Family Tradecertainly brings an interesting variation to the alternate universe story. Rather than another world in which the technologic advances are far beyond present-day Earth and the protoganist has to catch up, it is Earth which has advanced much further than the other world, or world(s), as the case may be, and the inhabitants that need to catch up. Throw in one world that appears based on medieval society with uses for the modern world and a giant dash of Mafia politics, then another world in which history deviates from present Earth since the mid 1700s on, and you have the makings of an intriguing story verse indeed.Unfortunately, in this first of Mr Stross's The Merchant Princes series, the book really doesn't hit its stride till midway, after which the story flow moves much more swiftly and smoothly. The first half deals essentially with Miriam trying to understand and absorb the new world she's discovered. Aside from Miriam's annoying tendency to talk to herself about almost every little thing, this part is serviceable, if a bit flat. There's a great deal of information for both Miriam and the reader to absorb as well.The pace picks up once Miriam has gotten some of the basics of this new world down and then has to survive pretty much by the seat of her pants. She's intelligent and thwarts multiple assassination attempts without being some sort of superhero caricature. She uses her brains and what weapons she has available to her; these in themselves make Miriam stand out from many other books in the sci-fi/fantasy genre. On the other hand, I do have to cavil at the fact that though she is an investigative journalist, she clearly forgot that data should always be backed up, and if it's hot, as in life-threatening data, always have multiple copies stashed in various places.The romance element of this story is weak. I think the story could have been made stronger by not including this element at this time or by making it more plausible at least. The author made an attempt to provide a rationale, essentially 2 outsiders who are lonely and understand their isolation come together, but there wasn't really much chemistry between them, for this reader at least, and their relationship went from nil to 60 in virtually no time.I gave 3 stars for the slow first half, the weak romantic thread that would have been better served to be cut, and the very, very abrupt ending."},{"Title":"The Family Trade (Merchant Princes)","review":"I have been pretty avidly reading and occasionally reviewing science fiction for over fifty years, and I am always on the lookout for a new series. Thus, I was delighted when I discovered Stross' \\"Merchant Princes\\" series two weeks ago, and I have spent quite a few late nights reading through the six volumes that comprise this series.I like alternative history series, too, so I have, in general, very much enjoyed reading about these worlds in their dizzying and complex collision. However, this joy has not been unalloyed, and as I progressed through these novels, I was ultimately put off by Stross' increasing injection of his own politics into the center of these books in which he made a Republican administration, the Bush administration in very thin disguise, by far the most blameworthy, the worst villains of all in Stross' dark tale of conflict, betrayal and revenge; a treasonous, scheming, murderous, genocidal crew, far greater in treachery and villainy than any of the other murderous villains portrayed, a choice Stross apparently made just to score cheap political points.As I looked back over the span of the six novel series, this ruined the series for me and, as much as I liked many elements of this series, Stross's political cheap shots \\"poisoned the well.\\""},{"Title":"The Family Trade (Merchant Princes)","review":"One of the enjoyments I have of reading fantasy is that you often get a view that is different from yours. That certainly happens here in an unattractive manner. What I don't accept is zealots -- left or right. This author is extreme in that. Put him on one side of the teeter-totter and the worst Neocon on the other and they will balance it perfectly.He doesn't even bother to hide some names. It is a biased portrait of the worst of Dubya's gang. Lord know, there is little need for such exaggeration. It carries it to the point that you want to see Stross water-boarded.The writing starts out well. The premise is interesting. Then, like so many overreaching series, it falls apart. The writing deteriorated. Unfortunate when one's emotion trumps all. Zealotry results. Sad! Very sad."},{"Title":"The Family Trade (Merchant Princes)","review":"Charles Stross is a relatively new writer who has already developed quite a track record of breathing new life into classic SF themes. In Singularity Sky and Iron Sunrise were stories of interstellar adventure, but set in a post-singularity universe. In the Atrocity Archives he gave us spies vs. Lovecraftian horrors. Now, once again, it is time for something completely different.The Family Trade is a slim book that is clearly the first of a series (Merchant Princes). Miriam Beckstein is a financial reporter specializing in biotech. She is fired when she stumbles over a money-laundering scheme that her bosses have a stake in, and then discovers that she is the long lost child of a family of Merchant Princes from an alternate earth who have the genetic ability to cross from their medieval alternate earth to ours, and who have built up a financial empire based upon cross-world import/export and smuggling.The naive character suddenly over her head in an alien culture is a familiar SF theme, and Stross handles it expertly. The Merchant Princes have an essentially medieval attitude toward women, while Miriam is a modern, American, professional woman. The Merchant Princes have a complicated family structure (they are required to marry into the family to maintain expression of the recessive world-walking trait). Miriam must quickly find her balance in the complex family intrigues of the Princes before one of them decides to assassinate her (and assassination is hard to avoid when an assassin can suddenly pop in from an alternate world). But she has one key asset--her knowledge of modern business practices and her skills as an investigative journalist.Like Stross's other work, \\"The Family Trade\\" manages to bring back fond memories of classic stories without seeming at all derivative. In this case, I was beset by fond memories of Zelazny's \\"Nine Princes in Amber.\\" And like the first book in Zelazny's Amber series, \\"The Family Trade\\" is frustratingly slim, ending just as it gets going really good. Nevertheless, while it left me wanting more (and soon; I hope he writes fast), \\"The Family Trade\\" is a satisfying read. However, be warned that if you get started on this series, you may well find yourself buying expensive hardcovers because you won't be able to wait for the next one to come out in paperback."},{"Title":"The Family Trade (Merchant Princes)","review":"Long ago, when I played a lot of fantasy role playing games (D&D; for grownups) we had long discussions about how much one could do with a single magic spell. In a sense, that's what the author has examined here: if you had the single \\"magic\\" capability of swapping between two universes in a flash... what could you accomplish that you couldn't do now? What would you bring back and forth, and who would benefit?It's a great premise, and the author does a good (not blow-me-away-wow but good) job at exploring it. Miriam is a high-tech journalist who loses her job and, on the same day, through a series of mishaps, discovers that staring at her birth mother's locket can bring her to an alternate universe. (It's in the same place as Boston, for instance... just a different history that brought the people there.)Do be aware that this is the first of a series; the author doesn't wrap up very much at the end, so you may not feel as though the book has closure. Also, the story is heavy on political intrigue, and brings up economic theory; that may be a turn-off or something you appreciate.While the story isn't perfect -- there were a few places in which I thought the protagonist simply wouldn't DO that -- the book held my interest, and I stayed up late to finish it. It also re-sparked our old discussions about what you could do with this particular single magic spell: would *you* have made the same decisions that Miriam did? that her family did? Any novel that instigates philosophical conversations gets a positive nod."},{"Title":"The Family Trade (Merchant Princes)","review":"You have to love a book that starts out with this kind of a bang: \\"Ten and a half hours before a mounted knight with a machine gun tried to kill her, tech journalist Miriam Beckstein lost her job. Before the day was out, her pink slip would set in train a chain of events that would topple governments, trigger civil wars, and kill thousands.\\"The trouble starts when Miriam uncovers an enormous money-laundering scheme. When she brings it to the attention of her boss, she's instantly fired. As it turns out, Miriam's now ex-employer's parent company is deep in the action. Miriam visits her ailing adoptive mother, who gives her newspaper articles about Miriam's birth mother --- a \\"Jane Doe\\" who was stabbed to death. The murdered woman's baby, Miriam, was adopted. Now Miriam's adoptive mother challenges Miriam to investigate the murder.Along with the papers, Miriam receives a locket worn by her murdered mother. As she examines it, she sees blue-white lights, smells burning toast, her stomach is upset, the light goes out, and she falls down. When she rises, she is no longer in her home. Instead, she's outside in a forest. As she attempts to orient herself, she spies a most disorienting sight --- armored knights riding horses toward her, and shooting at her. She gazes again at the locket and finds herself near her home.Miriam decides she must return to the mysterious place. Not only must she satisfy her journalist's curiosity, but she also needs to find the connection that the strange forest may have with her birth mother. After her life is threatened concerning her knowledge of the money-laundering scheme, she suspects that she may someday have to travel to the forest to hide. However, that makes her wonder: if her birth mother could have escaped to the other world, why hadn't she done so to escape her murderer?As Miriam sleeps in her own bed, she is kidnapped. Her kidnappers wear swords and call Miriam \\"your highness.\\" The reader discovers what happens when take-charge Miriam finds herself in an unbearable and dangerous situation.

When, oh when, will Book Two be out?--- Reviewed by Terry Miller Shannon"},{"Title":"The Family Trade (Merchant Princes)","review":"\\"The Family Trade\\" is the first volume in a new series by Charles Stross called \\"The Merchant Princes.\\" I would assume this series is going to be a trilogy, but I could not find this stated. In theory, the type of world Stross created would allow for as many volumes as the author can think up stories. There will definitely be a sequel, \\"The Hidden Family\\", and the structure of this first book is such that it feels like the beginning of a trilogy.Miriam Beckstein is an investigative reporter for a technology magazine in Boston. When Paulette, a co-worker and researcher at the magazine brings Miriam an exhaustive stack of research on a story Miriam is working on, what they discover is strong evidence of corruption and money laundering. Bringing it to her editor, Miriam is promptly fired and soon receives death threats. Paulette, for being involved is also fired. The cause has nothing to do with the offense except that the company that owns the building the magazine works in (and possibly the magazine) may be implicated. Miriam goes to her adoptive mother to tell her about being fired and her mother says it is time Miriam knew a little bit more of how she ended up in the care of the family she did. She also gives Miriam a shoe box containing some of her true mother's belongings.When Miriam gets home she opens the box and discovers a locket. The locket has a strange pattern and when she focuses on the pattern she finds herself in the middle of a forest with no sign of civilization except for a horseman riding towards her holding a machine gun. She focuses back on the locket and returns home. This is the true beginning to the story. As an investigative reporter, Miriam needs to figure this out, to find out what happened or if she is simply going crazy. While going crazy might work for a short story, it would be a pretty poor opening for a fantasy novel if the fantasy world isn't real. It is, of course, and she begins to investigate what this medieval styled world is like and what is all about. She soon learns that she is part of the aristocracy there, but that things are darker and more dangerous than what she expected.As a long time fantasy reader I think the idea behind this book is fascinating. I want to know how these worlds are connected, why, who and how this was discovered. I want to see further interaction between the worlds as Miriam discovers how this works and what her place is in either world. I even want to know what happens in the next book. I just want someone else to write it.See, \\"The Family Trade\\" is a very interesting concept and Miriam Beckstein is a smart woman who behaves in a much more realistic way than most fantasy characters who get plopped into a strange new world. Most behave as if they know everything or as if they can know nothing. Miriam seems to learn and it makes sense how she figures things out, even if there may be jumps in logic which don't work for me but might work for a reporter. The problem is the writing, especially early on, is just cheap and weak. Here's an example of page four of the paperback and where I almost gave up:\\"Back upstairs, fortified by an unfeasibly large mug of coffee, she had to work out what to wear. She dived into her closet and found herself using her teeth to tear the plastic bag off one of the three suits she'd had dry cleaned on Friday --only to discover it was her black formal interview affair, not at all the right thing for a rainy Monday pounding the street--or at least doing telephone interviews from a cubicle in the office\\"Bear in mind this is just after Miriam fled downstairs and switched on the coffee percolator. The beginning of the book was all like this and while it did get somewhat better, this was still the same tone that was used throughout the book and it simply downgraded what is, at heart, an interesting story.In the hands of another author I am sure I would have loved this book and would be excited to read the second volume. As it stands, I didn't and I'm not. I am interested enough in the core story that I'm actually considering it, but I can only hope that the writing style improves somewhat.The bottom line is that as a first book in a series, this is not a complete story. The pace is fast enough that this is a book that will be finished fairly quickly and the idea is interesting enough that I still do want to know what happens next. The way Stross phrases sentences, ideas, and paragraphs just leaves a little to be desired.-Joe Sherry"},{"Title":"The Family Trade (Merchant Princes)","review":"Stross takes a good shot at a world walker premise and gets it right.The start is a bit rough, some edits would have helped. Not every choice of the author propels the story, but it gets good within the first few chapters.The protagonist is engaging, the story has lots of meat. It compares favorably to other stories of this kind (Zelazny's 'Amber series' mentioned most often, is superior.)One star removed for an abrupt, unsatisfying ending forcing reader to the next book. High marks for very consistent quality and strength of execution of premise."},{"Title":"The Family Trade (Merchant Princes)","review":"Since others have outlined the plot of this book, I will just say that I enjoyed reading it. However, the author does seem to have a lot of trouble with the various relationships of Miriam's family. First, her mother is her presumed uncle's sister, then his step sister, then possibly a half sister. Roland is variously described as a first cousin to Miriam, then a 2nd cousin, etc. Gets very confusing! Just the same, the concept is fun and Miriam (of course) always gets out of a jam. I still don't know just why, on her first visit to the alternate world, there was a knight in armor shooting at her with an automatic weapon. Forget the strange juxtoposition of that - why was he shooting at her in the first place, instead of trying to capture her and find out who she was and how she arrived on the road he was travelling.A good, fast book, if you are looking for a fast read."},{"Title":"The Family Trade (Merchant Princes)","review":"This series reminds me a great deal of Doris Egan/Jane Emerson's \\"Gate of Ivory\\" books. Female heroine finds herself in dire straits in a world she is not familiar with and she has an unknown \\"magical\\" power.This is the first book of the Merchant Clan series and sadly it is the best. Book 2 (The Hidden Family) is nearly as good, but Book 3 (The Clan Corporate) is almost so different that it seems to have been written by another author.Overall, Stross is a readable writer. I use the term \\"readable\\" in many of my reviews because that is the first, and most important, thing that I look for in a book. I've read a ton of books, and I'm tired of forcing myself to trudge through a difficult-to-read book to find out how it ends. So I score highly on whether the book was entertaining and fun to read. Stross is readable in most cases, and that earns him points.Next, I look for one of two things - a plot that forces me to finish the book because I want to see how it ends, or a character that is so good that I want to find out how things turn out for them.Stross succeeds in both cases here. I'd give him four stars for the plot and five stars for the character. Miriam/Helge is an interesting character and I found myself enjoying her \\"take charge\\" attitude throughout the book. The plot is also interesting, once you get past the rather cliche premise. Without spoiling anything, I will say that you will just have to accept the first part of the book and move on, or you won't enjoy any of it. It is a fantasy genre, and it has a fantastic setup. Once past that, the plot is fairly interesting.BE FOREWARNED THOUGH, this is NOT a complete book. It ends abruptly with little or no plot resolution. Book two (The Hidden Family) is simply the second half of this book. Buy them both, or you will be frustrated when you come to the end of this book.I gave this book four stars, and would have given it four and 1/2 if I was able to do so. Overall, it is a very readable and enjoyable piece of fantasy-fiction and worth your time if you enjoy this sort of writing. Stross is a (mostly) solid and readable writer and I recommend most of what he has written to sci-fi and fantasy readers."},{"Title":"The Family Trade (Merchant Princes)","review":"Others have probably summarized the plot and the main conceit of this book for you. Let me add that the characers are very much to my taste. And I find the central idea interesting and his depiction of our own society, even though he and I differ greatly about many real-world matters, is excellent. His depiction of the \\"other side\\" is imaginative. The dialogue is really well-done.The book, however, does not end. It doesn't end in a cliff-hanger and it certainly doesn't end in the manner of a stand-alone novel. It just stops. This isn't too terrible as the sequels are available and this can be treated as one long novel, as it should be.However, the next book in the series will certainly influence my rating for this one. And the subsequent books will also, if I read them. If the next book is really bad, I will demote this one. On the other paw, this may be the beginning of a five-star series."},{"Title":"The Family Trade (Merchant Princes)","review":"The author brings an interesting blend of several different genres(fantasy/time travel/multi-dimensional travel) together. Some of the strengths of the story are some characters who make sense in the roles that they are cast and that makes them enjoyable. The biggest weakness is the main character who seems to have left her blue and red superwoman suit in her luggage. The author needs to throttle back on the unending stream of skills and abilities that the main character acquires whenever something happens. It's ok to let the main character flounder and fail a bit in order for her to be realistic.I look foward to the next iteration to see what he does with the storyline because the first book has done a good job of setting a stage where multiple factions appear to be competing with each other to accomplish the death/nullification of the main character. I hope that the author doesn't continue with the trend of her being superhuman, but let's her accomplish get goals through better collaberation and luck instead of a seemingly unending stash of subject specific expertise and spy/soldier skills that don't make a lot of sense coming from a Med School Student/Journalist."},{"Title":"The Family Trade (Merchant Princes)","review":"I like alternate-history and alternate-universe stories, so perhaps I was predisposed to like this book. But I also have recently read a couple of disappointments (you can take a look at my other recent reviews) and it was quite a relief to finally get to a current novel that is well-written, well-plotted, has interesting characters...Well written. While the information presented above gives you what is nominally the first sentence of the book, that is actually the first sentence of an italicized abstract sort of prologue. The real first sentence of the book is this:\\"The sky was the color of a dead laptop display, silver-gray and full of rain.\\" Woo! I like that! The chapter titles are clever, too. While there's bits of foreshadowing, it's not heavy-handed.While the jacket blurbs compare Stross to Zelazny and H. Beam Piper, I am most reminded of Poul Anderson, perhaps because of the clear Viking/Nordic strain running through this rather medieval world. I would strongly recommend reading some of his old classics, if you aren't already familiar with them. Stross himself acknowledges Zelazny and Piper, but I don't see that much Piper in here, stylistically. More of the references to Piper are in incidental things - the fact that someone crosses the worlds at all, of course, and that the world she goes to is more primitive, but also the frequent references to Pennsylvania (you'll recall that Lord Kalvan was a Pennsylvania State Trooper), and the Sky-Father, Lightning-Child, Crone-Mother religion of this world resembles the figures that the first house Kalvan comes to worships. In other respects, however, there is no strong resemblance - unlike \\"Gunpowder God,\\" priests and religion are not the major players here.Since many other reviews have detailed the plot, I'll skip rehashing that, and simply mention a few more of the bits I particularly like:* the use of the phrase \\"Human Resources\\" as rather a dirty word;* the king who drinks because even he can't stand the family politics, and because he knows he's going to have to marry his son the idiot to some unfortunate girl;* Miriam brings Brill over to our world, and they get into a taxi:\\"The cab moved off. Brill looked around in fascination, then reached down toward her ankles. 'It's *heated!' she said quietly.\\"'Of course it's heated,' said the driver in a Pakistani accent. 'You think I let my passengers freeze to death before they pay me?'\\"'Excuse my friend,' Miriam told him. 'She's from Russia. Just arrived.'\\"Family reading alert: there's a mild bit of sex, in no way intended to replace real plot or characterization - unlike some fantasy and SF books I've read lately, where sex replaces any real romance, covers up all kinds of plot discontinuities, and fills the book out. Perhaps as a result of this lack of unneccesary filler, the book is a little on the thin side, and it ends in the middle of the plot - luckily, the next book is already out. The bit of sex there is might make this a bit racy for younger teens who happen to be invading the adult-level science fiction section, as I was when I was 13, but it's no racier than most paperback romances, and a lot less racy than, say, the current crop of vampire novels, so it probably would be acceptable reading for older teens. And there's a heck of a lot less gore and four-letter language than most graphic novels. So if these things concern you, this book is fairly mild. (Unlike some of Stross's other stuff, which isn't.)Speaking of which, Stross has several different series running, and they don't all resemble each other that much. If you are expecting the bouncing-off-the-wall pace and skewed humor of Manfred Macx and the group-mind satellite lobsters, the style of this book will be a bit of a shock to you - it's quite different. At first, one might also feel it's slower, because it's not in that superfast, cyberpunk-on-Ritalin style, but in fact, there's quite a bit happening, quite quickly. So don't skip parts - you will miss things you need to know. You might also want to keep an index card handy to start sketching family relationships, because otherwise they could become hard to follow.In sum: call it alternate-history, although it's a little different; read some classic Piper and Anderson to increase your appreciation of the cultural references and feel like you'll be getting the inside nods to SF readers, and plan on getting hooked on the series."},{"Title":"The Family Trade (Merchant Princes)","review":"I thought I'd try this out because I enjoy Zelanzy's Amber series, and people have compared this effort to it.Unfortunately, I could only read about the first 50 pages, and I certainly wasn't drawn into it. Even on a long airline flight with nothing better to do, I couldn't pick it back up.The main character is petty and navel gazing. I realize you can start a main character one way and let them develop over time, but I think I was supposed to like her... anyway, I couldn't stand to hear one more observation through her perceptions. Back to the library it goes."},{"Title":"The Family Trade (Merchant Princes)","review":"First - I love world-hopping alternate universe fiction. My almost worn-out from rereading copy of Lord Kalvan of Otherwhen offered as evidence. Second - I'll admit I skipped ahead and read the synopses of all the books in this series. Time is precious and I don't have much to spend on less than satisfactory fiction. Third - I'm both a member of the US military and a fairly strict Constitutional Constructionist but I don't disregard \\"left\\" leaning opinion/fiction out of hand. Especially if it's thoughtfully and entertainingly written. But, I knew this entire series was problematic the moment one of the Clan's security super-soldier black ops guys clicked off the safety on Miriam's snub-nosed 38 revolver. Mr. Stross evidently can't even be bothered to use easily accessible web resources to discover that selectable safety equipped revolvers are extremely few and far between. The likelihood that Miriam's stepfather would've owned one is pretty low to impossible. When I see a silly error like that it typically points to the entire book/series having a lack of consistency and focus.

I was a little bit hesitant, since from the cover this appeared very old-school nostalgic straight-up fantasy. Young woman discovers that she has a hidden legacy in another world. And it does have a little bit of that. But, as usual, Stross does a great job of turning genre on its head and the end result is an interesting read.Like other readers, I could have done with a teeny tiny bit more closure in The Family Trade. I don't mind books in a series, but I do like each book to be able to stand on its own as a book. I felt like this ended abruptly, and I kind of resent needing to buy the next book just to finish the thread.Anyhow, recommended for fans of smart speculative fiction/slipstream writing. I guess that I would recommend the novels in the Accelerando group first if you have not yet read Stross, but The Merchant Princes might actually be better for readers whose taste runs more to fantasy than hard sci fi."},{"Title":"The Family Trade (Merchant Princes)","review":"This was my first experience with Stross and I very much enjoyed the book. Fans of Amber or other cross-worlds books will find a lot that is similar here. But I do believe this is different enough to make it worthwhile.Miriam is a likiable character. As a divorcee I don't think she is obsessing about her divorce; it is something that changes a person and she is reflecting that change. What Miriam is obbessed with is her own smarts. It is very odd to me that she is alternately very intelligent or very dumb. And she does have a supernatural ability to avoid potentially life threatening situations.The world is different and well developed. The interesection between the two isn't great. The romance was too sudden for my tastes, but makes sense. I am looking forward to the next book in the series."},{"Title":"The Family Trade (Merchant Princes)","review":"Charles Stross has fairly quickly established a reputation as one of the leading \\"idea men\\" in contemporary SF, a writer much associated with \\"post-Singularity\\" stories. His best short work is extremely clever and idea-dense, while also fun to read for fast-moving plots and snappy writing. (I'd say his characters come in a pretty definite fourth -- and there is a tendency for many of them to sound and \\"feel\\" the same, to my sensibility anyway.) He's also pretty prolific (though to some extent this may be the result of a number of novels mostly written several years ago finally selling at the same time.)This time out he's decided to write a Fantasy. Though to my way of thinking, The Family Trade is really SF, resembling more than anything H. Beam Piper's Paratime stories. That is, its central idea is that there are parallel worlds, and that some people can travel from one world to the other (with hints of at least one more). There is also some (secret) trade. The alleged fantasy element is that certain genetically gifted people switch worlds by use of a pattern. No reason not to regard that as SF, in my book (granted, pretty squishy SF but so what). There are no witches or wizards, no dragons or trolls, no magical spells. It's true that the main parallel world has Kings and Queens and Castles, granted. Still, to me, it feels more like SF than F. Not that the label should matter that much.Miriam Beckstein is a journalist in what seems our world. She and her research assistant uncover a nasty money-laundering plot, but her bosses immediately quash the story, going to the extent of firing her on a trumped up charge. She soon gathers that she could be in real trouble -- she's annoyed some powerful and amoral people. Then, on a visit to her adopted mother, she is given a box of material associated with her mysterious birth mother, who was murdered when Miriam was barely born, and who was never identified. One item is an amulet, and when staring into it Miriam is suddenly somewhere else ... somewhere where she is soon attacked by armored men on horses with submachine guns.Obviously, this is another world. Miriam carefully starts to research the problem, when she is kidnapped -- by agents from the other world, who turn out to be her relatives. It seems she the child of a highly born woman of a very influential family, the Clan. The Clan's talent, the ability to \\"worldwalk\\", has allowed them to become rich and powerful in their rather backward world. But a previous \\"civil war\\" has reduced their numbers. Now Miriam, who has inherited the talent and who is entitled by birth to a high position, becomes an important political piece. Unfortunately, women in this world are to a great extent mainly used as broodmares and as marriage tokens -- and Miriam isn't interested in that. But her \\"family\\" plays mighty rough. Moreover, she finds herself falling for a black sheep of sorts in the Clan. Meanwhile, there are obscure hints that an agent unknown to the main players in the Clan is also acting ... doubtless future books (the second one is just out, I believe) will elaborate.I thought it fairly good reading -- Stross can tell a good adventure tale, for sure. But I missed the heady speculation of his purer SF. And I felt, too often, that Miriam Beckstein was just another version of Rachel Mansour (heroine of Singularity Sky). And The Family Trade, as the first volume of a series, engages in a lot of scene-setting but doesn't really resolve anything. So -- not bad, and I'll keep reading, but not up to the level of his first few novels nor of his best short fiction."},{"Title":"The Family Trade (Merchant Princes)","review":"I think it was only about a year ago I discovered Charles Stross and started reading his work. I first ran into The Atrocity archives, the Iron Sunrise, Singularity Sky, and some short stories. One thing that quickly becomes obvious is the Stross' mind wanders far and wide. In terms of pure ideas Stross is one of the most imaginative writers out there, one who has a knack for seeing where a particular vector is likely to lead.The Family Trade posits a clan of folks who live on a parallel earth where accommodations are medieval and the mindset often Victorian. These particular folks have an inherited ability to walk between the two worlds. And they've discovered that this skill is perfect for drug running, general trade in valuables and activities even more nefarious. Imagine the value to a pre-industrial world if someone can deliver a message across a continent in hours instead of months. Or imagine what a drug cartel would pay for pick up and delivery of cocaine that is literally invisible.Miriam Beckstein thinks she is an out of work business reporter for a hi-tech magazine in Boston. But when she is given a package of items from here first mother, she finds a locket with an intriguing pattern in it. She stares at it and finds herself suddenly transported otherwhere. Suddenly she finds that she is a countess, heir to an important title, and everyone's favorite target. Bewildered, she must find a way to survive and a way to convert her family's business to something less illegal. In the meantime her uncle has ordered her to get to the imperial court and find a husband. Women in her new home are not encouraged to rule from the foreground.As you can see, Stross has come up with a complicated plot device, and must spend a good deal of time helping the reader to see the potentialities. Unfortunately, while Stross' ideas are his strong point, is ability to build compelling characters is less successful. This first volume is a lot of explanation and world painting, but the characterization lags far behind. Worse, the story turns on theoretical economics of all things. The result is a very slow start.Miriam is interesting in a brainy mercantile/romantic sort of way, but the rest of the characters are still sketches and hopes. If the volumes to come spend more time on the players and the more interesting elements of the power struggles within the families than there is hope that the series will return to Stross' successful style. If not then this series may become his worst flop - an odd cross between chick lit and The Godfather."},{"Title":"The Family Trade (Merchant Princes)","review":"This is the first book In the Merchant Princes Series, and while the topic has been done before, a women from our world transplanted into a new world, Stross puts an interesting new spin on it. While many have compared this to Zelzaney's Amber Chronicles, this is more in line with Donaldson's Mordant's Need series, except for our heroine here is not a neurotic women with no sense of self, but a competent and strong women who knows how to handle things on her own and doesn't need some big strapping man to give her a sense of worth. Stross, typically a Science Fiction writer, invents one of the more interesting fantasy conundrums in recent history. He installs a sense of reality based ethics into a fantasy world, and maybe not intentionally, creates a interests counterpoint to many of the financial shenanigans we see in our modern world."},{"Title":"The Family Trade (Merchant Princes)","review":"I usually enjoy parallel universe stories and this one is no exception. Would continue reading the series.One caveat, why o why don't authors who are going to have weapons figure predominantly in their books do at least a minimum amount of research about them?

I bought this because Paul Krugman - of all people - personally recommended it, and my first reaction was that Paul should be a bit more careful with his endorsements. Charlie Stross does neither psychology like Henry James, nor prose like Elmore Leonard. His prose is so unlike Elmore Leonard's, in fact, that the first person his heroine, Miriam, brought to mind was Marilee - she of the beauty that defied description - from the Bulwer-Lytton competition.What really interests Stross is developmental socioeconomics (well, that and ditzy, but razor-sharp, machine-pistol wielding babes in renaissance gowns), and as this side of the story starts to build momentum, helped along by the economics tutorials that punctuate the fire-fights, I actually found myself, having enduring the details of Miriam's hairstyling problems and the occasional bad sex scene, being entertained. Enough so that I have just bought volume 2.Note to the author - the Rothschild family do not produce Champagne, at least not under the Rothschild name."},{"Title":"The Family Trade (Merchant Princes)","review":"(Book #1 is a 5/5, but I am rating this as a series and books 5 and 6 are 2/5, at best and spoil the whole lot, in my opinion)This series started out so very, very, well. A fresh spin on something not done as cleverly since Zelazny's Amber. Add family intrigue, spies, cool guns, economics, alt.history and whip in a dash of female empowerment. Nah, lots of kick-behind female empowerment. Geeks in medieval time. Joy!But, even in the beginning there were worrying signs. The so-conveniently interestingly-employed ex-boyfriend. The somewhat lengthy economics \\"expositions\\". Still the overall cleverness of the core idea, along with a pretty good plot and an endearing heroine, made this book into a firecracker....Book 2-4 coasted along, starting out well, but getting progressively slower. New plotlines, quite a few deaths, new threads... A clear story arc? No, not really. More and more family members of interest that could be worked into the plot, along with new bad guys. And a dash of whom is gonna romance whom. Close each book with a cliffhanger.You know the formula. It's commonly used in TV. Keep the series alive and milk it. Dare I say it? Soap opera-ish.Ah, yes... lots more \\"economic expositions\\". Not much new in ideas, the first book claimed most of them.(not really a spoiler, but more specific than anything before)..............Books 5-6 however jump the shark. I don't like to mix my politics and SF much. I really don't need lectures about how evil such and such recently retired American politician is supposed to have been. And I really don't need it this criticism delivered in such an over the top manner. Yes, even if I abhor said politician myself. Major editorial lapse, in my opinion.Mr. Stross, if you gotta mix politics with your writing, at least be good at it. Have that much respect for your paying customers. Tedious, un-funny, un-clever, unbelievable political diatribes are annoying to most readers, regardless of whom they are aimed at. Read up the Stalin POV chapter in a One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich to see an example of amusing character assassination. Surely this politician could have been made fun of more elegantly?Not only that, but the series is well set up to continue as book 6 ends with little closure and lots of unresolved threads."},{"Title":"The Family Trade (Merchant Princes)","review":"I loved this book. It was refreshing to encounter old style \\"what if\\" sci fi, now that the shelves are dominated by supernatural romances and far future Virtual Reality Goo.

Other than _Ethan of Athos_ it is the only book to look at \\"psi powers\\" from the standpoint of Mendelian genetics."},{"Title":"The Family Trade (Merchant Princes)","review":"If you read this book because you like more recent Stross books, as I do, you may be disappointed. Don't let that stop you from reading the rest of the series. It gets better as it goes along, with more interesting ideas and less of the medieval kings-and-court stuff."},{"Title":"The Family Trade (Merchant Princes)","review":"The author tells a good story but really needs to work harder. Even the main characters lack definition, and their personalities drift something awful. Some conversations make no sense except from the author's perspective - he alone knows what's going on. Alas, it is a good story, but the price in reader suffering is very high."},{"Title":"The Family Trade (Merchant Princes)","review":"I can't believe anyone would rate this well. It is not a story, it is a portion of a story. 300 loosely packed pages later, Mr. Stross stops the story so that he can sell the next volume for another $7 (or $17 hardcover).It is a sad state of affairs that he can so rest on his laurels as to put this lackluster effort forward.Wait for the combined volume a few years from now, maybe then it will be a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"The Family Trade (Merchant Princes)","review":"_The Family Trade_ by Charles Stross is the first book in his series known as the The Merchant Princes, a very enjoyable and quick-reading book of parallel universe travel and intrigue.The main character is Miriam Beckstein, a reporter for a high-tech magazine in Boston. Working with her research assistant and friend Paulette, they stumble upon a massively corrupt, highly illegal deal that would make huge headlines. Bringing it straight to one of their editors, Miriam upon returning to her office from his belatedly realized that the money-laundering scheme also involved the company she worked for, and by the time they returned to their office security was already waiting to escort both of them out of the building. They were fired and her former employers were generously offering to drop any charges against the two if they did not purse any further investigations.Left at loose ends, Miriam visited her adoptive mother, who gave her a box full of mementos left behind by her mother, who had died when Miriam was an infant (she had been murdered). One of them was a strange locket, and when Miriam opened it she saw a bizarre, intricate pattern inside, one that had a hypnotic, dizzying effect. Before she realized what was going on (how could she?) she found herself in a forest, apparently somewhere else. Did she travel through time? Through space? Both?Being the careful investigative journalist she is, she did some experiments and investigation and found that by careful use of the locket, she could visit a parallel universe, an alternate reality, and then return. Though she was still in the same position on Earth relative to her home, geography and the history that produced it were completely different. Instead of being a modern, 21st century United States, she was in a medieval world settled by Europeans - mainly Vikings - from the Middle Ages, settlers who had established kingdoms up and down the eastern seaboard. She found herself in Gruinmarkt, which roughly corresponded to New York, Maine, and Massachusetts on our world. Technology and social organization roughly corresponded to that of the high Middle Ages of Europe, with castles, armor, swords, horse-drawn carriages, and peasantry.Or did it?I don't want to give too much away, but Miriam finds she is not the only one who can \\"world-walk\\" with use of that pattern, in fact there are six families who make up something called the Clan, who through intermarriage and careful alliances are able to keep not only that trait alive but make themselves very wealthy and powerful...in their world and in ours.Most of the adventure and intrigue of the book revolves around Clan politics, as Miriam finds herself in a hornet's nest of plans within plans involving jockeying for power, vying for favor from the King, and schemes involving her sudden appearance (a benefit to some families, a grave threat to others). She makes valuable friends in this new world, and some powerful enemies, though she is never entirely sure who is who, especially at first.I liked how Miriam could vividly compare and contrast our modern world with the medieval world she found herself in, how she was an active, intelligent, highly adaptable person, keen to protect herself and not simply give in meekly to the powers that be on the alternate world, using her training, her sharp mind, and the modern tools at her disposal to hold her own in this strange, new world.I also liked how Miriam (and the author) fully explored all the implications of world-walking, both the good and bad aspects, and how one might come to terms in a world where such abilities were known to exist.Reading this book reminds me a lot of the house politics in _Conquistador_ by S.M. Stirling, of nobility of a sort active on a world in an alternate reality that is aware of and exploits our own reality. In this work though the families, the Clan, are a great deal more powerful. Also this book explores them in great depth as after all it is the first book of a series, while _Conquistador_ was a single, stand-alone novel."},{"Title":"The Family Trade (Merchant Princes)","review":"Why don't people just write books instead of writing series? It's a rhetorical question, I understand the economic incentives fine. But this is a book with a nice, Amber-like idea (woman discovers she can cross between universes, is princess in alternate world), a decent understanding of what real people would do in that situation (smuggle drugs via alternate world, silly), and a couple of good scenes where loyalties shift, and 300 pages out of about 350 that we could essentially have done without if it meant THE STORY WOULD END IN ONE BOOK."},{"Title":"The Family Trade (Merchant Princes)","review":"As JLBloyd stated, there are just too many avoidable errors for the story to flow well, in spite some well-crafted characters and a plot line with great potential. I know C. Stross is from a land where guns are evil, but do some research, man! For good info, try: http://www.quarry.nildram.co.uk/index.htm [...]Even C. Stross' few sword references jar. There are only two ways to wear a sword with a modern suit."},{"Title":"The Family Trade (Merchant Princes)","review":"This is a book with a somewhat typical fantasy premise. Adopted girl finds out that her birth parents are from an alternate Earth, and that she is actually royalty. The beginning of the book was a bit slow for me and I wasn't very impressed with Miriam, the main character. However, the alternate Earth and the Family that Miriam finds herself pulled back into are interesting; just the politics and economics of a group of people who can cross over between our world and an alternate Earth makes for some fascinating what-ifs. By the end of the book, I was totally drawn in to Miriam's troubles and the larger political struggle going on."},{"Title":"The Family Trade (Merchant Princes)","review":"Charles Stross is an extremely talented writer of both fantasy and SF writer - easily a peer of Lois Bujold or Greg Bear - but I very much wish I hadn't started this series. There is much to recommend it - good worldbuilding, interesting characters, twisty plotting, lots of action - but the ending is a horror.SPOILER: specifically, the upshot is that the US finds out how to transition airplanes into the quasi-medieval alternate universe - and carpet-bombs an entire country with many dozens of hydrogen bombs - killing a million or so innocents. The burning flesh, etc., is described in loving detail. The viewpoint character, and most of her close associates, escape for now - but so what? This ending is not what I expected. However, if you really liked On The Beach (everybody dies) or The Doomsday Book (everybody dies, except the time traveller who's visiting them), you might like this better than I did.Some of the reviewers seem indignant about the author's view of certain US politicians, but I wouldn't take exception to that. I don't think this book is particularly \\"about\\" those people - they are seen as malignant but not particularly interesting.Books 1-6 are described somewhere as the \\"first part\\" of the Merchant Princes series, and there is lots left to work with if the author chooses to go farther. Clearly the world he has built has many doors left to open - but I wish I hadn't started reading this."},{"Title":"The Family Trade (Merchant Princes)","review":"There are a number of good reviews below that hit both the strong and weak points of this book. I would just like to add that if you have something else to read, wait until the author writes the other half of this book, then read the whole thing. This one has multiple threads, one introduced near the end, and none of them resolved. If you have a low tolerance for authors who can't complete any part of a storyline in one book, this would not be the book for you."},{"Title":"The Family Trade (Merchant Princes)","review":"The Family Trade is a relatively slim introduction to a large concept series--the idea that a Family clan has the ability to \\"worldwalk\\" between their mostly medieval world and our own via their bloodline (the ability is hereditary) and a special amulet. The main character, Miriam, is a journalist in our own modern world who, after being fired from her job, is handed an old shoebox by her adoptive mother containing the newspaper clipping about her real mother's murder and her mother's amulet (which of course takes her into the feudal world). Once in the the Clan-dominated kingdom of Gruinmarkt, Miriam finds she is the long-lost heir to a duke and is soon involved in the clan's various economic and political machinations, backstabbings, and assassination attempts. As well as a mysterious third party who also seems to want her dead. Far from a passive victim, Miriam leaps full-heartedly into defensive and offensive modes, happily taking on the system's economic, political, and social structures, such as those that seem to consider women inferior or keep in place a strict class structure.At times one feels Miriam jumps a bit too whole-heartedly and easily into the mix. Her background and skills all seem a bit too conveniently created for just this situation, and while she suffers quite a bit of physical disorientation due to the crossings, her mental/social disorientation is all too quickly glossed over. The book also gets bogged down in jargon, mostly economic though sometimes technological as well. And while it's compared in its publicity to Zelazny's Amber series, though it shares the world-walking premise, it's too a less comprehensive degree (though that may change) and its characters/world are not quite so fully developed. Nor it the voice.That said, it's a quick and entertaining read and if it gets bogged down in terminology and backstory, as it does, one can perhaps ascribe that to its need as a first novel to set up the next few. To that end it suffices. It's enough of an interesting read, enough of an interesting story told well enough to lure the reader onto the next one, even if it doesn't compel him/her to do so or make him/her eagerly wait with panting breath. Mildly recommended."},{"Title":"The Family Trade (Merchant Princes)","review":"Miriam Beckstein, a reporter for a hi-tech industry magazine based in Boston, starts off the work day happy, successful, and on the verge of breaking the biggest story of her career. She ends the day unemployed, her career and her reputation threatened, and contemplating the few items left to her from the birth mother murdered when she was a toddler. One of those items is a locket that, when studied too closely, bumps her into an alternate world-the world her unremembered parents came from. In that world, Miriam is the heir of one of the wealthier branches of a clan that has the ability to hope between that timeline and our own. Her home timeline is technologically and politically somewhat behind ours, at about the 15th or 16th century level, and her kin have used their ability to become merchant princes, jumped-up \\"new\\" nobility somewhat resented by the older noble families but highly valued by the king because of their ability to finance him. It's a dangerous world, with conflicts with neighboring kingdoms, conflicts with other nobility, and conflicts verging on outright warfare among the different families and lineages of Miriam's own clan.It's not a comfortable life, but it is a privileged one if you can learn the rules quickly enough, and Miriam quickly finds she's better-suited to the challenge and the danger of it than she might have expected. She's also met a guy-her cousin Roland-whom she's very interested in, and made some friends, including another cousin, Olga.It is a bit of a complication that the head of their family intends Roland to marry Olga, and Miriam to find someone suitable to marry who'll bring her powerful allies within the clan. It's more of a complication that a good bit of the clan's wealth comes from drug smuggling in our world, and Miriam finds this deeply morally objectionable.The really big complication, though, is that Miriam and Roland want to completely reorganize the clan's business model and political structure.And then there's the whole never-adequately-answered question of who, exactly, murdered Miriam's parents, and why.This is a really well-done, enjoyable, world-hopping adventure, with the complications thought out and explored in interesting ways. My only real complaint is that the book stops abruptly in mid-story-Tor apparently took one long book and chopped it in half. For the rest of the story, we have to wait for The Hidden Family.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Family Trade (Merchant Princes)","review":"While The Family Trade is unabashedly the gateway drug for a longer series, it is also a nice little trip. The beginning is a bit exposition-heavy, but the premise is intriguing and well executed. Once the action gets going the book is almost impossible to put down. I won't bother to summarize the plot - there are plenty of other summaries on this page. Suffice to say that I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a good time and doesn't mind getting hooked."},{"Title":"The Family Trade (Merchant Princes)","review":"Looking at the cover, you might think this to be a standard fantasy novel, with some damsel in a medieval-type dress, looking at a suitably impressive castle. The first discordant note to this comfortable assessment occurs if you scan the image more closely. She is holding what sure looks like a modern pistol.So it's more complicated. Well, the text turns out to indeed be a traditional hard science fiction tale. There is a parallel universe, with a different, backward Earth. The hero, Miriam, gets to traverse between these worlds. Specifically between the two North Americas. Where the other one is some squalid medieval morass, where the peasants are held down by a feuding aristocracy.If you do like parallel universe stories, and especially those set in the United States, then this book may be compared to the classic Lord Kalvan series by H Beam Piper. Or, indeed, Steve Stirling's Nantucket or Conquistador books.Perhaps the only discordant note I found with the book was the implausibility of how the other side makes its living, by arbitraging what it could provide on its side, that others in our America could not easily otherwise perform. In Stirling's Conquistador, he provides a logical economic scenario that is lacking here."},{"Title":"The Family Trade (Merchant Princes)","review":"I've bought and read all of the books in this series. The story line is pretty good, but the author loves cliffhanger endings. I won't be buying any more in this series."},{"Title":"The Family Trade (Merchant Princes)","review":"I finished this series of six books and I can see Stross' publisher wringing hands like Scrooge. I started this series because Stross can write interesting and involved SF. His book HALTING STATE is right up there and I enjoyed that style of writing as well as the plot.I gave this book a single star because it's the good and bad reviews I read and the middle ratings are just middling. This particular book deserves a three- or four-star rating, but the series stinks. Read the reviews for Book 6 (Trade of Queens) to see how disappointed his readers are. Save yourself time and frustration by reading something else.Charles Stross' problems include an inability to maintain the environment of his story. He is nowhere near J K Rowling in creating and moving characters through a consistent, detailed world across books. He seems too lazy to maintain rules, landscapes, or characters. Maybe he lacks the ability to write a series. Some of his other books, like GLASSHOUSE, suffer the same lost-plot problems.Stross is also a poor story teller. As a reader, I expect each book to have a proper beginning, middle, and end, but not Stross. His remaining five books start at page 1 and end at page 300 without rhyme or reason or plot. This includes, unfortunately, the last one. It never ends the story at all. There's a danger he'll carry on annoying his readers through yet another series.More annoying are the subplots he sets up and then ignores. For example, a character smuggles an ultra light across the worlds and then Stross can't figure out the technical details of how to use it in the plot. The ultra light takes off to deliver a package, the enemy is alerted to watch the skies and... he writes around that detail conflict and puts it in the past. So much for that problem!Stross can't deal with his own subplots. By Book 2 we are alerted to a traitor in our midst. The importance of this waxes and wanes to resolve issues he can't deal with otherwise. In Book 5 he plants motives and clues that all point to Olga but, darn it!, he likes Olga and so do we so-o-o he never mentions the traitor again.Stross kills off inconvenient characters without advancing the plot. He invents a 'West Coast' operation which never appears again despite its potential as a plot twist. In an early book, the family provide drug transport; in a later book they are growing the stuff -- but he ignores processing it for the market. It's all confusing and frustrating.By Book 6, he is bringing in characters both old and new, using them to extend the book length in pages without doing anything for the plot lines. Our ultra light smuggler is among them, accounting for perhaps five going-nowhere pages. He walks on, there is a lot of backfill, there is a small advance toward a future use in the plot, and poof! he disappears forever. Miriam's love interest bops in and out of the books like a plastic groundhog in a game of Whack! Miriam herself goes into plot potential rigor mortis by Book 5 and never gets over it.If you start this series, stop after this first book. You'll be tempted to try the next book because the plot line at the end of this first book is pretty good, the economics, drug war, and other plot lines are holding together in an interesting way, and the principle character is more willow-wood than dead-wood. Miriam adapts. Stand up to this temptation to read the series. Nothing good follows this book. The 'arc' of this series is straight down the tubes.In summary, Stross is a good starter, a poor middler, and a lousy finisher. Don't get started. This series is a waste of his imagination and your time to read 2,000 pages."},{"Title":"The Family Trade (Merchant Princes)","review":"This definitely isn't your average, run-of-the-mill fantasy novel. In fact, if you tilt your head just so, it can legitimately look an awful lot like science fiction.Which makes sense, actually, 'cause Charles Stross has made his reputation as a hard sci-fi author, and he brings that same kind of intellectual thoroughness and detailed invention to \\"The Family Trade.\\" So when journalist Miriam Beckstein gets unexpectedly transported to a seriously medieval alternate Earth, she's no fairy-tale princess searching for Prince Right, but a long-lost daughter of an enormous family that's equal parts Medici and Corleone. And many members of that family immediately make it clear that they'd have preferred she stay long-lost. Cue \\"Speak Softly Love.\\"It does take about a third of the book for the premise proper to kick in, but that's only a problem if you read the description on the back of the book and need to get there NOW NOW NOW. The setup Stross does give us is interesting, and close enough in feel to the \\"main\\" plot that I'm sure it will come back into play at some point.That's one of the numerous reasons this novel was so enjoyable: nothing is wasted. It seems that every seemingly throwaway detail becomes important later on. All the cutthroat politics and intrigue lend an air of paranoia and tension that keeps the suspense (and manic page-turning) high, but to his credit Stross never lets it become overwhelming or stifling. All the elements are well-balanced, with the possible caveat that Miriam herself is a relatively stock-standard heroine of the kind that's common in genre fiction these days -- tough, smart, cynical, and career-oriented, with a jaundiced view of romance and a distinct lack of sentimentality. I'm not complaining, she's a perfectly appropriate protagonist for this very idea- and plot-oriented story.The (occasionally self-conscious) defiance of convention and the cold-blooded high stakes make this a fresh and madly enjoyable book. Leave your fantasy-novel expectations at the door and you probably won't go wrong with The Family Trade. I'd recommend it to fans of Zelazny's \\"Amber\\" series and George R.R. Martin's \\"A Song of Ice and Fire,\\" or to tough-minded science-fiction readers who may think there's no fantasy novels they could enjoy. This might change their mind."},{"Title":"The Family Trade (Merchant Princes)","review":"Stross' homage to Zelazny explores the concept of parallel worlds. I've just finished it, and it left me really wanting to read the other 5 books of the series (of which 3 more are currently in print.)For me, a fan of Zelazny's Amber, this was a fresh take on old favorates, with protagonists of more human scope... but it still involves Machiavellian family politics and Stross' usual 'ultra-current' technological and business perspective."},{"Title":"The Family Trade (Merchant Princes)","review":"If Roger Zelazny's Amberites are Supermen, then Charlie Stross' Clanmembers are on the level of street hood that Daredevil and Batman dealwith.

She stumbles across something one day, and everything goes to hell.This, is, of course associated with who her real parents are, and the ability to world walk.The 'other world' is far more primitive, so, of course theworld-walking Clan has an advantage, with access to information,technology, and money from 21st century America.Miriam and the Clan are the target of guerilla assassins, andprobably traitors. There seems to be more than one group at work in allthese nefarious schemes.This, of course, is a classic series set up.

Poe's use of alchemical tropes underscores the value of imagination as a means of transformation. Hawthorne's alchemy reminds us of the magical quality of love - capable of transforming the coldest, hardest heart into warm flesh and blood. And Fuller's alchemy offers an affirmation of individual dignity and responsibility. Coincidentally, C.G.

There are a lot of books out there that are still influnced by training agencies that still think all divers should be taught like they are Navy Seals. It was refreshing to find a book that is accuarte and promotes diving for what it really is a fun, non-competitive, family sport.

Sure, there are some who won't touch one of those books with their trademark yellow and black covers just because of the \\"for Dummies\\" designation, but they are wrong. The \\"for Dummies\\" books are anything but. I mean, they have \\"Calculus for Dummies\\"! And quite a few of the \\"for Dummies\\" books are on my bookshelf, though I do not necessarily consider myself one.What you do get in every \\"for Dummies\\" book is a no-nonsense, friendly and sort of jovial piece of reading material that treats you like a friend. They all follow a formula, of course, but it is a good one as long as the somewhat silly graphics (paragraphs are usually marked as \\"dive talking,\\" \\"save diving,\\" \\"tip,\\" \\"technical stuff,\\" and so on; it gets old quickly) and the occasional rather forced attempts at being simple and friendly without talking down to the reader doesn't turn you off. If you can see beyond that, \\"Scuba Diving & Snorkling for Dummies\\" is a very useful introduction to diving that covers everything.Make no mistake, this book is serious. Everything you need to know is there. But instead of presenting it in a lecturing tone or making things look as complicated as possible (all too many authors like to do that in an effort of coming across as true experts), this book tries to explain everything in simple, everyday language. And succeeds admirably.It starts with an introduction to all diving equipment and how to use it. Then explains what you need and what to look out for. It then explains dive training and all the basics and more advanced matters it covers. It then goes into setting up your gear for real world diving, how to enter the water, navigate, and dive. Physics and physiology are explained, as well as all the potential problems and illnesses that can happen. All of the world's oceans are described, as well as waves, currents and general water behavior. The book also goes into what to find and expect underwater (and that includes a nicely done 14-page color photo section), how to behave, and what can be dangerous. It explains how to find trips, how to travel, and the different kinds of dives, as well as the major locations and what they offer and require. The book closes with recommendations and pages of links and resources.As many \\"for Dummies\\" books, this one includes a CD. In this case one that contains the PADI \\"open water diving\\" lectures, but not all of them. You do get a taste of what it's like, but for now an incomplete one, and one that dates back to 1999 (the latest version of the PADI Open Water course includes a DVD with much more video). In my case, that only fueled my resolve to get the real thing!If you're okay with the special \\"for Dummies\\" formula, this book discusses everything you need to know about diving.

The city's evil, its oppressiveness, is palpable. He casts a fascinating, if thoroughly unflattering, light on Calcutta.Unfortunately, Simmons' characters do not come to life as much as his settings, and we are left with mediocre characters walking on a great stage.Song of Kali is a depressing book filled with mostly unlikeable characters (although the wife of the protagonist is a notable exception). The story and the setting were interesting enough to keep me turning pages in spite of my distaste.Overall, Song of Kali is an unpleasant, yet unforgettable experience."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"So I guess I was a little gullible for placing any stock in the whole \\"most frightening novel ever\\" stuff that is plastered all over the cover of this book. Like another review noted, there is the \\"germ\\" of a good, and frightening, book here. But is never really develops.It is also a little difficult to look past Simmions' disparaging description of the citizens and culture of India. Before beginning the book, I was aware that \\"Calcutta as a nexus of evil\\" was to be one of the major premises of the story. Still, I expected the author to approach that notion with more sophistication than simply portraying India and Indians as uncivilized and inferior.I purchased this book because I enjoyed one of Simmons' other works, Hyperion. Song of Kali was no where near as good. It was easy to read. The plot developed at a suitable pace. It simply didn't amount to much."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"Song of Kali was fairly underwhelming. For a book touted to be one of the best horror novels of all time, I was understandably shocked when I finished the book unable to recall ever being scared. Simmons is apt at painting a dreary and filthy portrait of Calcutta, a \\"city too wicked to be suffered\\", but never in the novel is there a sense of fear, of shock, of terror. Sure there's vivid imagery of squalor and contamination, even graphic depictions of corpses, but is that scary? No, that's just gross. Gross is fine when backed up with fear, but the relationship between the two never quite materializes in Song of Kali.That being said, the narrative was fairly engaging. The story moves along at a nice place, though Richard Luczsek is essentially an unlikeable moron. The plot resolution, however,(or more appropriately, the lack thereof) will leave you dissatisfied and perhaps feeling a little cheated. The weirdness and the paranormal events are fairly standard for the genre, and nothing really jumps off the page at you to frighten or enthrall, but as this is Simmons' first novel, perhaps that's an unfair expectation. There is an overhanging sense of despair and melancholy in the novel, which fits in well and gives an interesting atmosphere to the book; unfortunately, though, the atmosphere is never utilized to its full potential and ends up serving only as a half-developed image of an abysmal and horrid Calcutta."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"As a huge fan of Dan Simmons, I expected more from this novel. Song Of Kali is definitely a page-turner, but it does not live up to the comments written on the jacket. It's definitely not the scariest book I've ever read. Not even close. \\"Disturbing\\" and \\"depressing\\" would be better words. It is masterly written and is fascinating from a cultural point of view and for its brave ventures into the human nature and situations few writers dare touch.But, unfortunately, the last 1/4 is a huge disappointment. You keep turning the pages and wondering, \\"Where is he going with this?\\" You are eager and impatient to find out what the whole thing was about... but you never do. The author does not reveal some of the most mysterious characters' identities or their motives. Why not, that escapes me. We're simply left with completely wasted 4 final chapters.If you're a Dan Simmons fan, you have greater chances of enjoying this book. If you aren't, I suggest reading his Hyperion series and Carrion Comfort for starters."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"The writing is tight and the plot is compelling, but I wondered throughout why Simmons seemed so obsessed with the idea of Calcutta's intrinsic evil.Yes, Calcutta is named for the goddess Kali. Yes, followers of that particular goddess have done some pretty nasty things. But, you could learn all that from Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, which is much gorier and at least has a satisfying ending, but is even more plagued by racist sensationalism.I read above that Simmons spent only a few days in Calcutta before writing this book. I wonder what happened to him there?Anyway, if you want something to do for a few hours and don't mind a little xenophobia, then this is the book for you. Otherwise don't bother. Stephen King (who Simmons' narrator describes as \\"trashy\\") writes a much better horror story, Lovecraft does the scary ancient cult thing a lot more effectively, and I have no idea why this novel was even considered for the World Fantasy Award, let alone why it won?!That said, I couldn't put it down, but I was so disappointed by the ending (or rather lack thereof) that I sat down and wrote this.btw: The Tor trade paperback reprint edition I read had numerous editorial snafus, which drives me crazy."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"From my title you might assume I am stating that Dan Simmons cannot write. Quite the contrary, Mr. Simmons is an excellent author --- I could only dream of being half the writer he is. But Mr. Simmons needs some help with endings. Now don't jump on me for criticizing this portion of his writing style, but I'm becoming a little concerned (perturbed maybe?) with the way he ends his novels. I started with Hyperion --- which was an absolutely awesome story --- and 'graduated' through that series. Now I've finished Song of Kali and noted the same problems. His endings....well...stink. Sorry, but there's no other way to put it. But let's move on....Song of Kali is the story of Mr. Robert Luczak and his discovery of evil incarnate growing within Calcutta. The story is basically about loss in the extreme, but retaining one's vision of why we continue on even in the face of overwhelming and insurmountable obstacles. Mr. Luczak initially goes to India on assignment for Harper's Magazine to find out if a famous Poet ---M. Das --- is still alive after years of no one seeing him and being presumed 'dead.' A Poet manuscript has been discovered that fits the writing style of M. Das and Mr. Luczak has to find out the truth as to its origins. He soon falls into the cracks of the black background of Calcutta and discovers death and dismay at every corner. The descriptions of Calcutta are vivid and depressing (just as they should be coming from Mr. Simmons). Mr. Luczak soon learns that this isn't the place to be but seems helpless to leave or get his family to safety. Driven forward by his desire to 'finish his assignment' he is forced into a soul and death struggle once he encounters The Song Of Kali.But even after his return to America (minus a family member --- but I won't tell you who) he seems embittered and lost. His soul is fighting between light and darkness and he is forced to return to Calcutta by the Song. But he can't obey the Song of Kali and forces himself back again to America where he settles down once again. But to what end? The blackhole of Calcutta remains and will it devour the world of light? It appears that only Mr. Simmons know this. Frustrating.Okay, but would I recommend this book. Definitely. Mr. Simmons is a master-storyteller...at least up til the end. This is good literature, however."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"In Jones & Newman's \\"Horror: 100 Best Books,\\" Edward Bryant, writing of his choice for inclusion in that overview volume, Dan Simmons' \\"Song of Kali,\\" mentions that Simmons had spent precisely 2 1/2 days in Calcutta before writing his first book, in which that city plays so central and memorable a role. Despite Simmons' short stay, Bryant reveals that the author filled \\"voluminous notebooks\\" with impressions and sketches of the city, and any reader who enters the grim but remarkably detailed horror novel that is \\"Song of Kali\\" will be amazed that its author spent such a short time there. The city is superbly well depicted in this book, and indeed is its most fully fleshed-out \\"character\\": a vile, overcrowded, steaming cesspool of a city that breathes iniquity, mystery and corruption. It is a stunning backdrop for a grisly tale of terror that deservingly won 1985's World Fantasy Award, as well as a spot in Jones & Newman's volume.In the novel, we are introduced to Robert Luczak, an American poet who travels to Calcutta, with his Indian wife and 6-month-old daughter, to do a magazine article on M. Das, an Indian poet who was believed long dead but who has now seemingly, uh, resurfaced and wants his new epic poem to see publication. Luczak and his family undergo a particularly horrendous time during their 10 days in the city, in a story that conflates Kali, the living goddess of death, her maniacal followers, reincarnation, kidnapping, leprosy, rats, morgue scenes, oodles of decomposing bodies, stabbings, drugs, smuggling, festering slums and other assorted nastiness. Simmons treats the reader to two especially horrific sequences: the first, a Kali initiation ceremony, as described by an Indian student; the second, Luczak's remarkable experiences in the Kali temple and his subsequent escape. Those readers with a squeamish temperament should be forewarned; as Bryant has written elsewhere, \\"Where Stephen King flinches, Simmons doesn't.\\" First-time novelist Simmons shows remarkable control throughout, carefully keeping the suspense high, the shocks strategically placed, the detail convincing and the Luczak family likable and well drawn. Despite the downbeat proceedings, the author even manages to work in a hopeful ending of sorts; a plea for sanity and reason in a world seemingly more and more dominated by violence and death...the song of Kali. Today, Simmons is something of a big deal, a Hugo winner (for his 1990 \\"Hyperion\\") and one of the brightest lights in the fields of fantasy, horror and sci-fi. How remarkable it is to see such a sure hand, the master's touch, in his very first outing. This really is some kind of bravura work.That said, I must add that Simmons' grasp is not 100% full in this, his first novel. A close reading will reveal, for example, some confusion as regards dates. When the story opens, it is June 1977, and Luczak mentions that his daughter is 7 months old; but several pages later, he says that she had been born on January 22, 1977. Wouldn't that make her 5 months old in mid-June? In another scene, in Calcutta in July, one of the characters mentions that Vladimir Nabokov had just passed away (Nabokov died on July 2 of that year). A few Calcutta days later, and another character mentions that New York City had just experienced an historic blackout. But that blackout didn't occur until July 13! Something funny there! There are a few other inconsistencies that a careful reading will reveal, such as Luczak telling us that his Exeter, New Hampshire home contains nine original oil paintings; some 300 pages later, that number is said to be eight. But these are mere quibbles, really, that only the pettiest of nitpickers (yeah, that's me!) would notice. The fact is, \\"Song of Kali\\" is a terrific horror novel that really does deliver the goods. It leaves many outstanding questions unanswered, which may indeed frustrate some, but for this reader, that only added to its air of evil and mystery. I wouldn't go within 500 miles of Calcutta now if you paid me...a sure sign of the power and effectiveness of Simmons' first book!"},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"in my review on \\"drood\\" by dan simmons, i wrote that he is one of my favorite sci-fi authors, but that i've rarely ventured outside that genre for his writing. after reading \\"drood\\" and thoroughly enjoying it, i decided to backtrack a bit and get one of simmons' earlier novels, \\"song of kali.\\" again, thick with rich and socially disturbing images and descriptions of the novel's locale, in this case calcutta, india. but the story beneath this backdrop is just as disturbing. i enjoyed it - read it all in one weekend - and appreciated simmons' references to the history and social structure of calcutta at the time of the story."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"Not what I expected. Simmons is my favorite author, Hyperion my favorite series. That said, the only unsurprising thing about the Song of Kali is the quality of the work--excellent.Other reviews have adequately highlighted the story, the 'what is', of The Song of Kali, so refer to one of them for a plot synopsis. The 'what [it] does' will be the focal point of this review.The book evoked in me emotions utterly alien to any fiction I've read before. This is, without a doubt, a work of horror (and a ridiculously effective one at that), but it underscores the fundamental difference between the haunting and the frightening. Almost entirely the former, The Song of Kali does not scare, it does much more: it repulses. Not through horrible writing, not through ludicrous and tasteless violence, but through hideous atmosphere. Dan Simmon's Calcutta is so irrefutably sinister, so fecal, so hopeless, that you'll find yourself in agreement with Simmons' contention that Calcutta should be eradicated, that it is too malevolent to be left standing. It makes you wonder how accurate his depiction is, and you want to believe that he fabricated all of it.For what it is (the story of a man spiraling into a maelstrom in the most ominous sense), this is one of the most compelling books I've ever read. I have to say, though, that beneath all the grime, the story is fairly standard and would have been nothing special had it not been in the capable hands of Dan Simmons."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"There are a couple of things about \\"Song of Kali\\" by Dan Simmons that you should know. First, this is not a horror book. There are scary moments and very disturbing actions, but this book won't have you sleeping with the lights on. Second, there is an ending to this book, maybe not the ending or closure people want... but there is an ending. Granted, loose ends exists and I found myself trying to make sense of them after the book was done, but I tend to like that in a story. Third and final, this was Dan Simmons' first book. In my opinion it's not his best, but for a first effort it's quite extraordinary. It's a smart haunting tale that sticks with you.The story is about a writer given his first big break. He is to go to Calcutta and bring back the latest poem by the famous M.Das, a poet who had died several years earlier. Bobby, our writer, travels to India with his wife and baby to obtain the manuscript and shed light on the mystery of how a supposed dead writer is still writing. It's to be a brief trip but problems arises and the horrors of Calcutta eventually overwhelm Bobby and his family.The book takes place in the 70's, and I'm assuming here, has little to do with the Calcutta of today. The city Simmons paints becomes the main character or maybe the main villain. Calcutta is a horror. It is a pit of despair and disease. It is also played as an offering to the Goddess Kali. In western literature we often have fun with our \\"devil\\", playing him as an egomaniac, a trickster, a cartoon fool, a manipulator or a beast. After reading \\"Song of Kali\\" I am quite confident that Kali could kick our devil's shinny red butt. She is pure darkness, darkness that strikes like a cobra. Simmons uses most of his time slowly building the suspense of this book by painstaking building Bobby's contempt for Calcutta. When it reaches its zenith, odds are you will gasp; but the real ending is in the hope that Bobby and his family finds afterwards."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"Sinsiter Enough to make Stephen King cringe ! Dan Simmons is top notch story teller , to say the least ....."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"I have been reading Dan Simmons off and on for about ten years. While I enjoyed him most of the time, I have always felt that his endings were a bit weak. Since I read his book, The Terror, I have been a bit more of a fan, and had decided to pick up all of his books as I could find them.I found The Song of Kali at a local library sale and really looked forward to reading it as I feel his horror novels seem to be a touch better. I was somewhat disappointed.There is a long section where the poet the main character has been searching for sits with him and tells him a very long story about what has happened to him. This section is almost 70 pages or approaching a full third of my copy. It is just too long for what it gives us as readers. There are a lot of long descriptions of life in Calcutta that ring true and are fascinating, but as another reviewer mentions, they just don't fit into the main events of the story. Granted the setting of a horror novel is a good portion of the novel, but imagine reading a lot of description of a haunted house in a more traditional horror story. In that case, it better be relevant. Because I am not familiar with Calcutta, I am willing to give a bit more lee-way here, but I'm not just going to surrender to the writer either.I don't want to put any spoilers in this review, but the main horror of the novel is just too much. Personally I think that Simmons knew this, and backed away from it, consciously or sub-consciously. He either needed to accept it was shocking and go for it, or find something less horrifying.There were quite a few very good portions in the book, so if it sounds like I am slamming the book as a whole, I am not. It was worth reading, but mainly for a Dan Simmons fan, not the general reader who is trying to find out what he is about. That reader will more than likely decide Simmons isn't worth reading.I feel that sometimes an author is published before he is ready, simply because a publisher can see that he has promise. Unfortunately in these days of instant best-sellers, that philosophy is gone.Personally, I felt that his second book, Phases of Gravity was a substantially better book. It also begins in India, and I feel the section (about 50 pages) gives you a feel for modern India with a lot less words. If you are willing to read a character driven book, check that one out. (I have also reviewed that book.)"},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"For his first novel, Dan Simmons has captured the essence of down right creepy. The vision I used to have of Calcutta is a very different one after reading this work of art. Calcutta, like many places I guess, has its vernable pit of slum depicted nowhere else is such a shocking, disturbing manor. Made me a Simmons fan!"},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"For a good disturbing story pick up this book. Read it on a cross-Atlantic flight and it made a long boring trip cruise right by."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"This is a novel that I really wanted to like. I'm a fan of Dan Simmons, have heard good things about this book, and thought the premise was good. Despite all of those things, I was never able to get into the story. Part of it was that the story was really slow to develop. Another part was that I couldn't relate to the main character Bobby Luczak, a poet who is covering a story on a supposedly dead English poet. I thought Simmons did an effective job of painting Calcutta as the most God-forsaken place in the universe. There were some interesting aspects to the novel, like the backstory of the cults in Calcutta and their relation to the goddess Kali. The author also did an effective job in showing Luczak's unraveling. Still, for the most part the novel didn't work for me and left me unsatisfied.Carl Alves - author of Two For Eternity"},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"Song Of Kali is only the second book that I've read of Dan Simmons's novels, the first being the truly superb Drood. I wish half stars were available on web sites to rate books other than just the full stars. My true score/ rating for this novel is 3.5 stars. It is a very good read and the length for this particular novel is just about right. It is a dark and depressing story and features some genuine creepy moments, it is not in my view as scary as some make it out to be, well that's in my view. I would definitely read it if you are contemplating doing so. I will say this, Dan Simmons is a superb writer (Drood in particular is a masterful novel, excellent prose)and I will most certainly reading more of his books in the future."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"There is something about Simmons' writing that wants you to turn each page. I absolutely adore the first part of the this book. The rest of the book turns darker, perhaps too dark for some readers... but worth the read. I recommend this book"},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"Prior to reading this, all I knew of Dan Simmons was a very short viral Internet story in which he appears as the uncle of a time-traveller from a future in which we're losing the war against Islamist terror. I liked the story; I like this book even better.Song of Kali takes us along with his protagonist, a minor poet and college professor who goes to Calcutta with his Indian wife and their newborn baby to collect a new poem cycle from a mysterious Indian poet thought dead nine years. As he follows contacts of the poet he (and the editor of the poetry review for whom he's undertaken the errand) have thought was dead all this time, he takes us along into a winding path led by devotees of a shadowy cult of worshippers of the goddess Kali - the obscene (to Western eyes) Mother and Destroyer of all life, into whose maw all must go to die and from whose womb all are born. Uncomprehending, Simmons' protagonist steps too far into this world - then it reaches out to plunge him and his family into nightmare.Simmons does a wonderful job of taking us along with his protagonist into a world of horrors. In many ways, Song of Kali can be read as an allegory of the Western experience in the Near East since 9/11, in which many of us have come away scarred from the realization we only dimly understood what we were getting into. But Simmons wisely resists the urge to write a morality story; his book is simply a horror show that starts in semi-rural Vermont, takes us through the underside of Kali's city, and leaves us in Simmons' home of Colorado, shaken and stirred. And it succeeds admirably at that."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"This is one of those books that, as you're reading it, seems too long winded and trite. But then, a few days later, you realize that you're still thinking about it and referencing back to it.The horror aspect of the book really comes at the end - and the horror is really more about humanity and it's evils than any possible supernatural evil. The reader knows SOMETHING is coming, and when it finally does, it's ugly as hell.But for me, the most interesting aspect of the book was the author's theory about parts of the world being so terrible that they couldn't truly be part of the rest of the world - that they exist on a seperate geometric plane altogether. This is a brilliant theory and one I applied just today in my personal life while driving to work in a town in the US that is a crime ridden hell hole. I wish the author had delved deeper into this theory, but even the little taste he offered was cool."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"Dan Simmons was a tad late coming to the table during the \\"horror boom\\" of the 80s, but when he did, he claimed a prominent place at it, with such classics as Carrion Comfort, Children of the Night, and his debut masterpiece, Song of Kali.A harrowing ride through both the streets of Calcutta and the depths of the human soul, this book left me breathless."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"Reading this excellent book, I was swept by the wordly grandeur of exotic (though corrupt and crude) Calcutta, India; and I was swept by the horror and mystery of pure evil as well.This book reads like a real-life story of a professional man who travels to a far away land and encounters the truly evil. The writing is top-notch and conjures up pictures quite deftly. This is a great horror novel. It'll keep you on the edge of your seat and you won't be able to put it down."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"The author does not only play with his characters but the readers are caught in this sinister atmosphere and the books enigmatic plot as well. There is no dramatic irony, no distance, we have to endure everything just like the protagonist. And we become aware of the terrible fact: it is true - Kali is everywhere, Kali is always. The book is about the immanent desire of man to destroy his own kind, and this is done in most horrorful ways. Repulsive - fascinating - a must!"},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"Simmon's debut presents an intense character study, not of any human characters, but of the city of Calcutta itself. Indeed, with the notable exception of the narrator's wife, the character developement in this novel is often thin and weak (a problem Simmons almost overcompensates for in his follow up novels). What makes Song Of Kali so effective and terrifying are two things: the attention to detail in describing the sights, smells, oppressive heat, and claustrophobic crowding of the poorest of the poor; and his writing style itself. While the protagonist may be somewhat weak, Simmons makes what happens to him so vivid your disbelief is suspended for you. Even the most horrifying (and supposedly supernatural) events in the story give the reader an out: you don't have to accept a character's description as accurate, not taking a description at face value only hightens the tension and therein lies this novels power."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"I was blown away by Dan Simmons' Hyperion series (and I'm not a sci-fi fan), so I was eagerly anticipating this book after reading all the rapturous reviews. I didn't find it scary, just gross - and, overall, terribly sad. It paints a horrible picture of Calcutta, with filth, vermin, death and disease everywhere.It probably says more about me that I have no problem whatsoever believing in vampires, ESP, monsters, ancient gods come to life, etc., but I just can't see why anyone would bring their infant to such a nasty place! ;)"},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"After all the raves for Simmons' supposedly finely crafted prose, I expected something quite poetic--ala Rushdie. But Simmons' style is a lot closer to Elmore Leonard than I expected. More pulp than poetry. Frankly, I found his writing pedestrian. If you consider the unimaginative M. Night Shyamalan to be an engaging director of horror films, Simmons might bring the night terror you're looking for."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"The book is full of little actions and descriptions which don't have much meaning in the story. Looks like they are here for filling the pages.The text would have needed radical cuttings. At one point I even wondered if Simmons had written it himself; but actually it was his first novel.Slow and pointless."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"Dan Simmons is something unique in the literary world. He writes horror and science-fiction, alright, but I never considered this as something bad. The way he writes it, is brilliant. His &quot;Carrion Comfort&quot; is a masterpiece in every way, and &quot;Summer of Night&quot; and &quot;Prayers to Broken Stones&quot; prove his brilliance too.&quot;Song of Kali&quot; was in that way a disappointment. It's a pretty good horror novel, well written, suspenseful and all, but something was missing. Something &quot;Simmons&quot;.The story is about a literature agent who travels to Calcutta to find a manuscript by a famous, but vanished author. On his journey he gets involved in cultural and occult struggles and his life changes dramatically.Right up to the middle of the book, it's also built-up and exposition. It can be read easy, it's not too interesting, but not boring. Then, after 3/4 the suspense somehow increases extremly. From that point on I had to read it all till the end. The end itself was not disappointing, but surprising in another way than usual.&quot;Song of Kali&quot; is a good read, not brilliant, but better than most Koontz and some King."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"The stench of Calcutta comes right off the pages in this vivid tale of an American family's visit to India. I believe this won the Bram Stoker award for best first novel. It is mesmerizing. The story of the body will stay with me a long time. Highly recommended for any horror fan."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"After reading the Hyperion and Iluim novels, I approached Kali with high expectations and was frankly disappointed. Maybe I'm jaded by images of human sacrifice, but reading Kali was like reading the novelization of \\"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,\\" minus the comedy."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"Working off the sensation fiction tradition exoticized by the likes of Rudyard Kipling (a much greater writer than Dan Simmons), Dan Simmons' novel Song of Kali follows a married couple- the Luczaks- and their infant to Calcutta where they experience a modern version of such tales. The object of the trip is to obtain a new manuscript of an Indian poet named M. Das. The complication is that the poet has long been considered dead- for eight years no less!The couple arrives in Calcutta and immediately shudders at the horror of it. Their horror doesn't stop at the poverty which surrounds them. Soon they shudder with horror at every Indian they meet. They are introduced to the local Calcutta Writers Union President, Mr. Chatterjee, and Mr. Luczak takes an immediate dislike to him. The Calcutta Writers Union happens to be in possession of the new Das manuscript. They however refuse to allow Mr. Luczak to meet with the author. Naturally Mr. Laczak would wish to do so in order to authenticate the poem.Frustrated Mr. Luczak, goes back to his hotel, but later that evening, Mr. Luczak is treated to a story about how the poet M. Das has been resurrected by members of the local Kali cult. As the story progresses, the nature of this cult becomes more apparent. This cult is one part Indian, one part Vodoo, and one part followers of Nietzsche. Mr. Simmons concocts this cult by stringing together these different philosophies and appears satisfied with this Frankenstein creation. Unfortunately, much of the horror dissipates because of this creation; it lacks any coherency and consequently plausibility, and will lead any thinking individual to spend more time scratching their head. Furthermore, the cult, which Mr. Simmons uses as a sit in for Indian culture, doesn't seem very Indian at all in the end except in imagery.After the revelation of the M. Das resurrection twist, which probably should have been saved for later in the narrative (also the only good part of the story), the story treats us to more lengthy images of poverty of Calcutta in case you have missed the point. This is then followed by a conversation where Mr. Simmons establishes that Indian culture is different in kind and not degree from western culture ( the \`East is East and West is West' sentiment of Kipling), thus establishing that poverty and suffering has more to do with what one believes than circumstance. Then we get more filler scenes of Indian poverty. And then there are other filler scenes where all that happens in the chapter is that Mr. Luczak walks to M. Das' secret temporary house (in which we are treated to more depictions of poverty). And thus the feeling of horror ceases after the M. Das resurrection twist is revealed as it is followed by long boring descriptive passages. (In my opinion, all of these long passages ought to have been cut out. Having established the idea that where there is poverty there is great Evil, Mr. Simmons is less accomplished in maintaining it (the books prose deteriorates as it goes on). But then if he had cut it out, he would be removing eighty percent of the book!)All of this then leads to a completely nonsensical ending that gives the book its sensational ending (this is sensation fiction after all), but if the reader really thinks about why any criminal group would use the Luczaks for their purposes when they could use someone with a lower profile than affluent westerners, the reader will immediately see that the ending is unlikely (in fact, it feels unearned). Then the book just sort of shuts down and the last 75 pages are so excruciating, that I had to fight an urge to quit. All of the mysteries remain mysteries- which is o.k. by me. After all, I had long since ceased to care.All together, I think the book would have been good if it were better developed. I mean if you are going to claim that strange cultures cause evil in the world, why not really dig into it. Why invent a Kali cult. Kali is widely worshipped in Bengal, where the story takes place. Do some research (by the way the Kali in Kali yuga and Kali mata (the goddess) are two different words; also no Indian woman buys saris by the bolt, so a bolt of cloth wouldn't be delivered- more like a bag or if she went nuts in the store a parcel). Look at how they worship her and then draw the connection between culture and poverty (that is if you can). In the end, the novel left me mostly with the impression that it was just a short story stretched with filler images- which is another way to say that the book suffers from poor plotting and development.Note: this book came out in 1985, a year after the mucho racist film Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. One wonders if this book was inspired by the film?"},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"Dan Simmons is a brilliant writer. I don't think anybody will deny that after reading his works...especially Song of Kali. He takes you to a dark, dark place and doesn't let you go. You feel like gasping for breath but you can't. His writing does that to you. I've never read anything like this in horror. I'm not surprised it won the World Fantasy Award. He creates a horrific world where menacing things lurk at every corner. This is what horror should do and he does it very nicely. If you want to read another horror masterpiece by Simmons, you should check out Summer of Night. Its better in my opinion. But this is still an unforgettable experience. Simmons has the gift."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"While I must say that I love Dan Simmons' SF novels, his \\"horror\\" novels mostly leave me cold. \\"Song of Kali\\" is no exception to this. While it's by no means a disaster, it really doesn't live up to the hype.What \\"Song\\" does extremely well is to paint a truly atmospheric and horrifying picture of Calcutta, as a city that is pretty much the embodiment of evil. I've never been there so I have no idea if this is accurate, but Simmons has convinced me not to go there anytime soon.That being said, the rest of the story left me mostly cold. I didn't really care much about the self-absorbed and unresponsible protagonist and his unusually docile and subservient wife. I also think that the story doesn't really go anywhere. It starts out very nicely and sets up all kinds of mystery and intrigue, but the end it all collapses into a big anticlimax in which, ultimately, very little makes sense and very little is resolved.That being said, I don't want to be too hard on this book. Like most of Simmons' work, it's undeniably well-written, and there are parts that work really well, like the story of the Indian student. But in the end, it feels to much like an attempt to vent frustations about Calcutta than as a fully-fledged and well-constructed story."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"I must say that I truly enjoyed reading this book. Throughout the novel, there is a lot of mystery and encroaching horror. The ultimate payoff, however, is not there and you're left wondering if this is really even a horror novel at all. The Kali figure doesn't even seem real much less hard to get away from. Where's the ancient evil?"},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"The book is extremely predictable and the story is just one clich&eacute; after another. One extra star for good depiction of the city."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"For those familiar with Kali even slightly, this book does not even live up to its billing as \\"frightening\\", let alone \\"horror\\". Some of the philosophy is rather intriguing: the notion that there is no such thing as evil, only power, and violence \\"is an attempt to exercise power\\". An interesting read, nonetheless."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"Robert Luczack (pronounced 'Loozak') works for the magazine 'Other Voices' and is sent to Calcutta, India to write a story about recently written poetry from a poet who is supposed to have been dead for 8 years. Reluctantly he brings his wife and baby girl along for the trip. Once in Calcutta he finds himself in a totally different world filled with trash, grime, violence and an underground cult who worships Kali, the goddess of death. Things go from bad to worse to nightmarish as he plunges further into the depths of this cult.For Simmons' first novel, Song of Kali is written quite well. Even out of the gate Simmons writes like a seasoned pro, however his later works trump this. For a short novel (for Simmons) this has some lengthy sections that I just didn't find all that interesting. Overall it's a decent read but I just never found myself hooked like I did with his other efforts like 'Summer of Night' and 'The Terror'. However, I will say that the end of this book is certainly nightmarish, it just takes a minute to get there. I imagine if you're a parent (which I'm not) then you'll find the ending to be unbearably disturbing.This is a worthy read for sure, but his later work does improve significantly. I'm giving this one a pessimistic 3.5."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"When poet Bobby Luczak is asked to go to Calcutta in search of the poet M.

Luczak begins to suspect that it may be a scam, but the truth of the matter is far more horrifying.A haunting tale that will stick with readers long after it's finished. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"SONG OF KALI chronicles one family's hellish journey into darkest India. A major American publisher has received samples of a new work by India's greatest poet, M. Das. What makes this exceptional is that M. Das is believed to have died several years earlier. So poet and small press publisher Robert Luczak is sent on an all expense paid flight to Calcutta to investigate, and discover whether it is somehow true or an elaborate literary hoax. But Luczak will find this is anything but a free ride. His curiosity will cost him dearly in other, less material ways.The back cover of the Tor reissue of this novel builds the story up a great deal, indeed perhaps beyond the ability of any author to deliver. Is it, in fact, the most chilling, shocking thing I've ever read? Did it strike me through with fear like nothing else has before? Well, no. However, it does contain some very chilling moments, a whole lot of solid suspense, and a final, major shock near its conclusion - all contained within quality writing. If it has any flaw, it's that it leaves a lot of questions never answered. More realistic, particularly since we are experiencing the story from one character's perspective, but it leaves one wanting, nonetheless.But never mind. The journey is the thing, and it's still a powerful story worth reading. It is also interesting for its philosophical content.

This book, on the other hand... read it and see for yourself. Really, really, good read."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"Another reviewer said that this book was missing something &quot;Simmons&quot; and I totally agree. Song of Kali is a very quick and easy read, and overall it's quite enjoyable. However, I was expecting something more from this award winner (and why is this book NOT a Horror winner but a Fantasy winner???). I really enjoyed the ending, or at least the way Simmons ended it, since there isn't really an ending to this book (and I like that a lot!!). Not your typical smiley face, happy, Hollywood type story, Song of Kali is a definitely gets under your skin...but I was expecting a bit more. With that said, I'm about ready to start Carrion Comfort - can't wait!"},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"I read Song of Kali about 10 years ago. To this day, when I'm asked what the most disturbing, frightening fiction I've read is, this is the book I name. Simmons is a master here, placing the reader in a land that is in equal parts mysterious, evil and suffocating. You see Calcutta in all its ugliness and what forces possess those who will do anything to survive in a land of no hope. The plot has been outlined above, but I can say that the ending of this story took me totally by surprise and was the most upsetting ending to any story I've ever read -- I never did go back and reread it, although ten years should be time enough to try. Even though the ending of this book made me want to turn away, it is a great book. It accomplishes what it sets out to do -- it terrifies. It's not frightening in the sense of ghosts in haunted houses, but in Simmons' clearly-defined vision of real-world evil that dwells in dark hearts and a foreign land where the rules most of us live by seemingly do not apply."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"This is one of those books that holds you for the whole book, but somehow never quite pays off.Bobby Luczak, an American poet, his Indian-born wife Amrita, and their daughter Victoria, embark on a trip to the city of Calcutta. Luczak has been contacted about doing a magazine article on the new work of a famous Indian poet, who has been missing for eight years. What the family instead finds is a hidden cult that worships evil, and personal tragedy.Simmons knows how to build a sinister mood. From the early warnings of Luczak's friend Abe about going, to Luczak's first person observations of the city, Calcutta is a haunting, frightening, disturbing place. Indeed, it is probably the best developed \\"character\\" of the novel, a place reminiscent of something out of \\"Blade Runner,\\" with its omnipresent shadows, grinding poverty, and general inhumanity swirling in a morass of evil.Further, Simmons keeps the reader intrigued throughout, as Luczak encounters tightlipped professors and suspicious assistants, discovers a horrible secret about the poet, Das, and finally reads the horrifying epic poem,the titular \\"Song of Kali\\", that Das has uncharacteristically created after his 8-year absence. Luczak's battle for survival, his panic, and his frenzy to escape with his family from Calcutta clung to me, compelling me to turn the page even when it was really time I should go to bed. Simmons creates a generally unhealthy atmosphere throughout the book, and his simple, yet detailed prose paints a grotesque picture.The problem with this book is its ending. While too much detail would spoil it, suffice it to say, I kept looking at the top of the page thinking \\"He needs to give us the payoff here, not too many pages left.\\" Unfortunately, the payoff isn't there. While Simmons makes his point about human nature, there are a few too many loose-threads. While it's not unheard of (indeed, it's really a cliche) to leave a certain ambiguity in novels of this type, Simmons leaves too much ambiguity. Characters' motivations and actions are hinted at, but never confirmed. Ultimately, upon reaching the last page, my only reaction was \\"That's it?\\" This rather hurt the book overall.Nonetheless, the majority of the book is still excellent, and ALMOST overcomes its abrupt ending. But the ending hurts, and marred my enjoyment of a book that I suspect would have otherwise played on my mind for some time to come."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"As many others have noted, this book is quite depressing, but very good. Author Dan Simmons pulls no punches as he describes the dark atmosphere of Calcutta and its inhabitants. Indeed, the very city is a character in itself that permeates the entire book with its madness. The storyline moves forward at a brisk pace as the entire novel unfolds in the first person narrative of its main protagonist, Robert Luczack, a poet. Like in Simmons' later novel, Hyperion, a poem is one of the main plotines in the story, and there are varied literary references. The supernatural elements in the novel take on a very menacing and realistic aspect because the reader gets so involved in the nightmarish surroundings of Calcutta. We enter the mindset of the hindus and the terrible worship of the death goddess Kali.I give the book 4 stars because the book leaves many unresolved questions (also like in his later novel, Hyperion, but that one at least had a sequel). Dan Simmons may argue, and rightly so, that in real life not all answers are given, but still, a little more insight into the motivation of some of the characters would have been appreciated."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"I'll get to the point: the book is good, but not a masterpiece (understandably).Regardless of what the hype on the back cover claims, this is not the scariest book out there. It's not the goriest, not the most depraved, not the most chilling. It's a fascinating view of a city that the book claims is rotten to the core accompanied by a mildly compelling storyline.However, the story resolves itself suddenly without a satisfying conclusion or any real explanation of the book's events. It's an entertaining read, but not the 'masterwork' worthy of many re-reads like the 'Hyperion' books (by this author) are.If you're looking for a horror novel, check out an early-mid Stephen King work. If you're looking for a fantasy (or sci-fi) novel, check Tad Williams, Terry Goodkind, J.R.R. Tolkien, or Ursula K. Leguin."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"While there are many insightful criticisms for this book I am stunned by the number of dismissive reviews for this powerful book. It's boring? Hardly. Nothing happens? A lie. No one has even mentioned the cultural aspects of this novel which for me, along with tidbits of Indian history and Indian arts, were the most compelling features of the story. No one has mentioned that although originally published in 1985 the book is set in 1977 which is key to the story and provides a explanation of the mindset (and naivet&eacute; as some called it) of the protagonist. I find it alarming that people dismiss this book as \\"not horror.\\" It is a story that has genuine supernatural elements and has more than a fair share of gore for the readers that crave that kind of thing. So what's the problem? It's not scary enough? A childish complaint. The book is primarily an effectively told and intelligently written story of EVERYDAY horror ACCEPTED AS THE NORM in a culture that is as corrupt as our own United States. I guess most horror readers want only witches, demons, vampires, and all the other derivative clich&eacute;s of folklore and legend. I think those books need to stop. Who cares? That stuff has all been told a thousand fold. This is a modern day horror novel of a kind of horror that is IGNORED by most people. The negative reviews prove that this book's content is as easily dismissed as an Untouchable is ignored as a non-entity by an Indian Brahman. That's the horror Simmons is telling us about."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"First novel of Dan Simmons, SONG OF KALI could be read as the perfect introduction to CARRION COMFORT, another Simmons's effort. According to this writer, the world is threatened by evil forces hidden to the common people but well known by the heroes of these novels. The bloody ritual of the indian goddess, Kali, is one of the roots of the Tree of Evil.The philosophical theory of Manicheism that presents the world as the gigantic battlefield between the Forces of Evil and those of the Good is a theory used, openly or not, by thousands of writers for centuries now. Dan Simmons adds to this pyramidal construction of books his own personal version by associating the Forces of Evil with a city : Calcutta.The descriptions of Calcutta and of its people, strange rites and Kafkaan administrations are, as far as I can judge, accurate and are certainly not sponsored by the Indian Tourist Office. The story is interesting and you won't leave THE SONG OF KALI before its ending. But there are a lot of weak pages in it ; characters disappearing and leaving the reader unaware of their destinies, multiple hesitations between the social thriller and the pure Fantastic genre, a rather simple explanation of the system of classes and religions ruling the indian society.So I would recommend THE SONG OF KALI only to the readers already familiar with the world of Dan Simmons. The other readers can go directly to CARRION COMFORT.A -stay at home- book."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"First off, be warned, Simmons can be extremely graphic. This is not a book for the faint of heart. He spares no expense in depicting some truly vile and horrific images. Some of the passages are extremely vivid and disturbing. I think, at times, Simmons is overly explicit in some of his descriptions, which is the only complaint I have with this book.That being said, this is, overall an excellent book. I was hooked within the first few pages. His writing is straightforward, and strongly evocative. I have never been to Calcutta, or any place like it, yet I had no problem envisioning it Simmons has a talent for making the reader feel for and fear for his characters, something that is lacking in most books of this genre.This is one of the most original horror books you will ever read. I recommend this book, and as I have read the entire Hyperion series, anything else written by Simmons."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"SONG OF KALI is a brutal but also subtle and evocative novel of almost overwhelmingly intense horror.Kali sings a seductive song of violence and blood, a song her followers want to be heard throughout the world. One man's research into a recently published poem about the evil goddess ultimately leads him to Calcutta and a cult of worshippers who will stop at nothing to spread her malevolent influence.Dan Simmons has devised an incredibly powerful story about a \\"civilized\\" man's near-absorption into an ancient and mysterious culture that seems to thrive only on violence and revenge. He vividly describes the steamy hot, paranoia-filled urban landscape of Calcutta, bringing the city horrifically alive. Its a place that no reader of this book will ever want to visit. Mixing urban paranoia with a strong tinge of the supernatural, the thickly atmospheric proceedings lead to a climax that is easily one of the most uncompromising and terrifying in all of literature.SONG OF KALI is Simmons' finest novel to date. Normally associated with science fiction, he has subsequently attempted a series of overlong, ploddingly conventional \\"best seller\\" vampire novels strongly influenced by Stephen King. Simmons' recent disappointments cannot dilute the power of his first foray into horror, the lushly atmospheric and unforgettably cruel SONG OF KALI."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"I've been a fan of Dan Simmons for some time now, but it was only recently that I put my hands on a copy of \\"Song of Kali\\". I approached the book expecting a standard horror story yet Simmons delivered much more than that. The city of Calcutta is described as a surreal, nightmarish hell on Earth, and certainly won't earn Simmons a job writing Indian travelogues. The overall picture painted here is bleak, unforgiving and downright horrifying, even to a longtime follower of horror novels like me.I was captivated and truly unnerved at many of the events described here. There is an underlying sense of \\"wrongness\\" within these pages disguised as a rather straightforward tale. I read this novel in one sitting and it kept me riveted to my seat.Other reviewers have commented upon the lack of \\"closure\\" in some of the plotlines. From my perspective, the terror of the unknown and leaving the horrors unsolved made for a more realistic and true-to-life ending. Certainly in \\"real life\\" there are not too many times when events wrap up in a neat little package. H.P. Lovecraft was a master of using fear of the Unknown to horrify his readers, and Simmons has learned his Lovecraft lessons well.If high quality horror is your bag, you need \\"Song of Kali\\" in your library."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"Dan Simmons does great atmosphere.He presents a disturbing picture of Calcutta in Song of Kali. The city's evil, its oppressiveness, is palpable. He casts a fascinating, if thoroughly unflattering, light on Calcutta.Unfortunately, Simmons' characters do not come to life as much as his settings, and we are left with mediocre characters walking on a great stage.Song of Kali is a depressing book filled with mostly unlikeable characters (although the wife of the protagonist is a notable exception). The story and the setting were interesting enough to keep me turning pages in spite of my distaste.Overall, Song of Kali is an unpleasant, yet unforgettable experience."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"A scary, page-turning narrative but Simmons' Calcutta of the 1970s was a far cry from the beautiful city of my birth."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"I have never encountered a paperback book of any kind, fiction or non-fiction, that had as many punctuation and spelling errors as this one. It actually became distracting at times. That being said, the story is a decently written novel about India and how it is the worst place in the entire world. I'm looking forward to exploring more about India, partly to figure out what the hell Dan Simmons' problem was with the place. From the one page \\"prologue\\", it is clear that Simmons is virulently hateful of India.I was told it was one of the scariest novels ever written. While it has managed to haunt my thoughts, I believe that is a result more out of wonder if India is really as evil as it is in the novel."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"When I first met Dan I told him \\"Song of Kali\\" was the most disturbing novel I'd ever read. He was thrilled. This book, while taking you through one of the world's most sinister cities, provides you with such an eerie atmosphere you'll change your perception of the world and the concept of evil. While some may find the ending somewhat incongruous with the rest of the novel, most of its readers enjoyed it all the more. You have a rare treat in store if you're about to buy it. Writing this review makes me want to search my shelves, pluck it out and read it in a day and-a-half, just as I did nearly 20 years ago."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"Dan Simmons is brilliant at putting you in a place you have never been and your actually feeling like you are really there experiencing all the elements. In Terror you were freezing and hungry as you read it. In Song of Kali you will be hot, sweaty, cringing and nasuated for the weak of stomach. He can really write wonderful scenes! The story is a good read and held my attention but it is disturbing. Don't read it expecting great explanations or pretty nice bows tieing up everything at the end. Still a good read, just don't do as I did and try and eat a tuna sandwhich while reading certain scenes!"},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"Wow! I just finished reading Dan Simmons' excellent first novel, &quot;Song of Kali,&quot; and I must say that I am extremely impressed by this work of fantastic horror and its meaning in the real world the reader is invited to recognize as both insane and wonderful all at the same time.Yes, there are some flaws in the book, and for that reason you should ignore the hype and superlative praise showered on it. For starters, the narrator is not a particularly likeable character; he admits to having a short fuse and a quick temper that often seem out of proportion to even minor annoyances.In addition, the author goes on for too long just setting up this tale, and nothing much of consequence actually happens for the first third of the story. Then there is the problem of the loose ends that do not answer the questions raised by a murder which serves as the emotional climax of the novel. My best guess is that Simmons deliberately left some things obscure to reflect the protagonist's own confused and frustrated inability to understand what prompted the killing, but - if such is the case - it still leaves the reader unsatisfied with the unresolved mystery of why certain events happened as they did.Finally, &quot;Song of Kali&quot; suffers from a lack of editing and/or proofreading (at least in its paperback edition), as shown by the many typos in the manuscript. Ordinarily, this would not matter a great deal, but in a story that concerns itself with wordsmiths in one form or another (i.e., writers, editors, and a literary agent) the errors are glaring and disrupt the flow of the otherwise nicely nuanced text.However, having said all that, I remain amazed at how well the &quot;Song of Kali&quot; managed to pull me into its plot and delve into themes that were at once disturbing and yet undeniably fascinating. The dramatic tension between good and evil is captured in dialogue and descriptive prose that explores the duality of man at both the macroscopic and microscopic levels. This might sound dry and dismal but in fact the final third of &quot;Song of Kali&quot; truly does build suspense like a runaway freight train, and I was unable to put the novel down for the last 80 pages.Simmons also does an especially good job of translating the universal nature of depravity from the teeming streets of Calcutta to the familiar environs of our own supposedly more civilized society. Although he touches on Indian mythology, the occult, mysticism, and the supernatural, Simmons suggests that the manifestations of culture and religion are merely props that mirror the darkness (or lightness) of the human soul.And that is really what this book is about when you get down to it: the importance of free will and each person deciding for him- or herself whether to embrace hope and life or give into greed, hate, and the fear of death. In spite of its faults, &quot;Song of Kali&quot; concludes on an optimistic note that does not smack of a conventional, contrived happy ending. Instead, Simmons says, we must beware of the beast within us, but choose the better way."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"Dan Simmons is one of my favorite writers. I LOVED Due North, The Terror, and now I add SONG of KALI."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"I loved it. The plot was just realistic enough to make this a terrifying read. The story is addictive. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes their horror believable."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"This book started out a little depressing and went completely downhill. Likely I was not in the mood to read about the tragedies which occur in this novel but I did not enjoy this read."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"I am an avid reader and devour books at an alarming rate. This book sucked me in from the moment I started to read it."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"as always Dan Simmons manages to create an atmosphere that is creepy and makes you wonder what bad will happen on the next page. Story moves along quickly and is hard to put down--makes you want to read in one sitting."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"Another horror novel of the disturbing sort. When a book publisher type discovers a heretofore unknown work by a dead author, he goes to India in search of it.What he uncovers is a whole lot of nastiness associated with the worship of the goddess Kali, and publishing this work would make things even nastier.Pretty much a story of unrelenting and likely unstoppable evil."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"The first books of Simmons that I read was the Hyperion series, I never knew he had horror background. As a parent it is difficult to read about the death of the baby, but the intensity is remarkable. I definately recommend this for anyone who enjoys horror or scifi."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"I kid you not, the *entire premise* of this book is how inscrutable and exotic and creepy Indian people are...what with their bad hygiene, and the weird food they eat, and their yucky poverty, and their bizarro religion with all those freaky goddesses, and oh yeah, human sacrifice...besides, Calcutta is an EVIL city, do you understand?!?! EEEEEEVIL! EEEEEEVIL!!!Characters in this book repeat different variations on that sentence approximately seven thousand times. Maybe if I could buy into that premise - that Calcutta, a city of more than 10 million people, is just EEEEEEEVIL, poisoned by a loathesome and murderous vileness utterly incomprehensible to the rational Western mind - then this book might have scared me. But I don't buy that, because it's stupid xenophobic garbage, and so this book just got on my nerves. I'm sorry you didn't like your vacation in Calcutta, Mr. Simmons. Cripes. Now give it a rest."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"I loved this book because it totally could happen. I've been there and the way Simmons describes it is almost too kind. It's the bowels of the earth, to be sure. Also, I really believe in this sort of thing...statues coming to life and all that. And when you read what happens to the baby, well, it's not for the squeamish. The people who live there are gross and infested with lice, rats and human feces. Gawd, it's terrible. In the end, the protagonist considers Calcutta in a mushroom cloud and I agree. Some places should just not exist."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"The Song of Kali was at times brilliant, and at times boring. The story is about a writer for Harper's who heads to Calcutta to research a story on a poet by the name of M. Das. Once there, chaos insues.The first 100 pages were brilliant. I loved the story and couldn't put the book down. Somewhere thereafter, the author lost his focus. The story meanders through near endless line after line about the city of Calcutta, making the story trudge along line a bloated corpse. I could barely finish the last 100 pages. The book had become so filled with tedious description that I found I had little desire left to finish. (Not did I care what happened)This story is not horror. It is \\"Literature\\", if you catch my drift."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"A journalist is sent off to India to collect a new epic poem written by a famous poet supposedly dead for eight years. Expecting something scary, I was sorely disappointed. Song of Kali is more proof that the judges of the World Fantasy Award just don't have time to read. Granted, the writing is clear and precise; Simmons isn't lacking technical skill. In fact, the book isn't bad, it just can't be called fantasy, and isn't quite horror. So what is it? It's a scary mystery with an unhappy ending."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"I have read a couple of the reviews which complained about the baby dying or the general lack of characterization and I wonder did you get the point. The book was written to make us fear the land of Calcutta and India; it was making a statement about the evils of society and not written as a character driven psychological study. The baby dying was terrible, but though I thought this obvious, the novel is a horror novel and if it is affective it should repulse the reader a little. In conclusion this is one of the three best horror novels I have ever read, the other two being Midnight by Dean Koontz and Animal Farm by George Orwell and yes I regard that novel as horror and if you don't you've begun to take your life for granted. Read this if you have the heart."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"I was quite satisfied with \\"Summer of night\\" (while the ending wasn't that great, the writing was excellent, suspense never faded) so I had some high expectations of his work 'Song of Kali'.What a disappointment this book is. All characters are cardboard-like (one would think Simmons would have at least some character development, maybe not an a l&aacute; King, but 300+ pages obviously didn't allow him to do that? I felt there is more character development in any of the S. King's short stories @ 15-20 pages) and the dialogue is painfully boring and stiff.The plot is \\"ok\\", only at a first glance, but the way he tries to get deeper into it (or the lack of it!) leaves much to be desired. I felt like Mr Simmons had a great idea but got tired of it along the way, and sent the first draft to the editor and later the publisher company."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"What a go-nowhere do-nothing story of a writer/poet who goes Calcutta, India for Harper's to get a copy of a manuscript andinterview a famous Indian poet, M. Das, who supposedly died 8 years earlier but who is now purported to be alive andwriting again. Three quarters of the time spent in the book is playing cat and mouse obtaining the manuscript and then withsetting up the interview with M. Das.Well it turns out old M. Das had leprosy and committed suicide. BUT he was brought back to life by Kali the Hindu goddessof power, death, destruction, construction, darkness, you name it, and used by her to write and spread the word of Kali worldwide (the manuscript must get published!). Anyway our poet after his interview with M. Das returns to M. Das to drop off acouple of requested books. In the bag along with the books is a gun so M. Das can end his miserable life, which he does BUThe doesn't have the good grace to do so later after our poet is safely away. SO the Kali disciples kidnap and kill our poets 7month old daughter, whom I can't for the life of me figure why he has brought to the dirty filthy sickness infested dangerousIndia to begin with. He chose to bring is Indian wife as an interpreter (irresponsible) and then never used her. The death of hischild enrages him so that he sorta comes under the song of Kali seeking revenge. But he triumphs and goes home. End of aboring pointless story. No horror here (chapter 3 yes, the rest no)The only book I've enjoyed of DSs was Children of the Night. I Have read Song of Kali, Hyperion, Hard Freeze, CrookFactory, Hardcase and now Summer of Night, Carrion Comfort."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"I picked up Song of Kali because it was tauted as being a horror novel. It clearly was not. It was a novel about a city with a very seedy and violent nature, but it was not a horror novel. I personally feel robbed that it was advertised as such and obviously wasn't.If you want to read a novel about Calcutta and the underbelly of its society, then by all means read this novel. But, don't expect too much. What little plot there was could be seen coming from miles away. My advice would be to buy a used copy or get it from the library."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"This is book for real horror/splatterpunk fans, not people like me who read fiction or combination of epic fiction and thrillers.Book is set in India, where I have never been and I really don't know if morbid underground cults and human sacrifices described in book exist, but book just sucks you in those unpleasant places and you feel as if you are witness to them.All in all, this book reminds me of Clive Barker's early story 'Midnight meat train' from 'Books of Blood' and is too scary for me!"},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"I had high expectations about this book, somehow driven by the good reviews.But it didn't took long before I began turning pages thinking \\"maybe it's now this is gonna warm up\\", just to find out it didn't. And it never did.Except for some curiosities about the indian way of life/culture and the description of Calcuta, the story doesn't have more to hook the reader. I felt disapointed at the end and felt this is a book I wouldn't spend money on if I could turn back time. Consider yourself advised."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"I couldn4t help being surprised by this book - it is quite an impressive read - but at the same time I was a little let down, too, for reasons that aren4t all that easy to figure out. I guess the problem is that when we normaly say that a book is &quot;good&quot;, what we mean is that &quot;reading this book made me feel good&quot;. And when we4re talking about a horror book we mean, by saying that it was good, perhaps that it scared us in some strange, enjoyable sort of way. This book doesn4t do that. It4s scary, yes, but that4s it. For a long period in the first part of the book, nothing happens; all we get to see is some americans loafing around in Calcutta, like so many other tourists, and since Dan Simmons describes it in such an ordinary, credible way, with a great portion of local colour too, you swallow it all - it allmost bores you. All this brings you, without you being aware of it, quite close to the the central character. And so when things start going terribly wrong it doesn4t feel good at all.What Dan Simmons explores isn4t that nice tingling sensation we get from the horror movies, but rather the true feeling of despair, loneliness and anxiety. These are all feelings that rely more on the unseen and imagined than on the present or chockingly visual, and could just as well be explained by the author4s unwillingness to show all that happens to the reader. Though bound to irritate some people, in the end this way of insinuating things rather than showing them turns out to be the most powerful quality of the author. I remember at one point reading a description of the body of a torture victim, where you as a reader get no clues as to how the terrible events took place. All you get is a picture of a dead body - it is perturbing and painful to read.So if i have to summon it all up, I would have to say that this is a very well-written book, but definetely not for all tastes. This is the first book i have read by Dan Simmons (and only, but not for long), and it left me with the impression of an author who promises even better work."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"I've read nearly every book written by this author. I just picked Song of Kali up to round out my Dan Simmons reading list. I was not expecting the physical sensation of not being able to take a breath, nor pull my eyes away from the lurid horror revealed in these pages. The last few chapters were a spiritual struggle for me, because Dan was so completely effective at interweaving a sense of awe and dread into my quiet evenings. I've read many books in this genre, only two or three have knocked me off my feet like this one. Song of Kali will haunt me for a long time."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"I discovered this book by Harlan Ellison's recommendation in his documentary. I was expecting much more of a fantasy element, and not so much of a crime/mystery genre, but Song of Kali made up for it in a well told and well written story."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"Suffice to say this book has prompted my first ever Amazon review.I first read Dan Simmons' The Crook Factory after the repeated prompting of a friend. The book grew on me, and years later picked up The Terror, which was thoroughly engrossing, despite an ending that was a bit of a letdown.I was excited to finally grab The Song of Kali on Kindle, and blew through it in a matter of days. Simmons has truly made the streets of Calcutta the villain in this novel, and a people utterly resigned to their plight its victims. The uneasiness Simmons creates through his atmospheric writing grows as the book progresses, and weighs heavily on the reader throughout, reaching its apex at a moment of true shock. Cheers, Dan; I was completely caught off guard and gasped aloud.Intentional or not, Simmons' doesn't tie things up in a bow for the reader. Life is usually like that, which makes The Song of Kali so unsettling."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"Championed by Harlan Ellison and winner of the 1986 World Fantasy Award, Song of Kali is the debut novel by prolific author, Dan Simmons. The book follows Robert Luzak through the thick heat and urban chaos of Calcutta, as he pursues rumored new work by a poet named M. Das, who has been assumed dead for several years. As Luzak grows closer to unearthing the alleged manuscript, he finds himself entangled with the Kapalikas, a dangerous secret society who worship the goddess Kali and might be involved in the poet's disappearance.With its vivid depiction of the Calcutta's hot and crowded squalor, Song of Kali is drenched in the palpable anxiety created by a first world protagonist thrown into a third world local, escalating with a sweaty, violent propulsion into one of horror's most memorably gruesome scenes.The fact that the supernatural elements of Song of Kali are amongst its least scary aspects doesn't speak poorly of their development or delivery, but rather to Simmons's eclipsing strengths at stifling atmosphere and asphyxiating real world terror.This is horror done so well it feels unimaginable reading it on the beach, and unconscionable to recommend to just anyone."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"This is the second novel by Dam Simmons that I have read and I am fast becoming a very big fan. This book has several themes in common with Drood - they both draw their horror from an average man's encounters with what may or may not be an ancient cult. In this case, it is the cult of Kali.One of the things I love about this book is that it has the courage to despise the location where the action takes place. This is, essentially, travel writing. I teach travel writing and I used to assign my students an essay entitled: \\"Trying Really Hard to Like India.\\" This novel is written in the same spirit as that essay. Calcutta, as described as it was in 1977, is not a place one would want to go for a fun vacation. In this novel, the city itself can be an avatar of the goddess, Kali.What impresses me most about Simmons is his command of style. As soon as you begin reading one of his books, you know you are in the hands of someone who knows what he is doing. I look forward to reading his other works."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"This blew me away. When I started it, I thought it was going to be thriller with some serious horror elements to it and wondered if it would be for me. and then it got good. and then it got better. and then it hit its climax and stunned me.Its dark. There is magic and gods and lots of foreign ideas. There were many times I wanted to yell at Bobby Luczak, the main character, but I never wanted to stop reading. For a bit, I thought it was a horror novel. It's not. It's a very dark fantasy but I don't think it qualifies as Horror. Its more of a modern day/urban fantasy with some horror elements."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"Dan Simmons presents Calcutta as a city haunted by its past and present in Song of Kali. Writer Robert Luczak goes to Calcutta on an assignment to retrieve the manuscript of a massive poem written by the legendary Das. Das disappeared nearly a decade ago yet suddenly new works that appear to be his surface. Luczak is also supposed to try and interview the reclusive author while and takes his Indian born wife Amrita as interpreter and their baby Victoria. Luczak discovers that the poem that Das has written is designed for some evil purpose and suddenly finds his family in peril as he tries to uncover the truth of what really happened to Das and what sinister purpose lies beneath the surface of Das' new epic poem.One of author Dan Simmons' earliest published novels, Song of Kali won the World Fantasy Award when it was published back in 1985. Simmons is an accomplished prose stylist and has written a riveting supernatural thriller. The minor flaw in the book also manages to be a strength as well because the main character of Luczak often has to play the role of idiot when it comes to the mythology that provides the backbone of the novel. Luczak should be better informed about Indian mythology and religious cults and yet has to have things explained to him. As aresult we discover much of what is happening just as Luczak does. This narrative device works pretty well overall increasing our identification with Luczak although there are times when it does stretch credibility.Unlike some reviewers, I don't feel that the ending is forced at all, overly sentimental or optimistic. It provides a coda that rounds off the story while still keeping the door open about what could happen. There's a sense of unfinished business and doubt about the future of humanity even as Luczak finally finds himself able to live again.Song of Kali still demonstrates that Simmons is a master of storytelling. It's pretty clear that his skills were continuing to develop with Kali. Kali clearly set the stage for later more masterful works such as his horror thriller Carrion Comfort and even his science fiction masterpiece Hyperion Cantos."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"This novel is entertaining and absorbing. I think I particularly enjoyed it since I recently visited India and found many of the descriptions fairly realistic. All through this story I thought I had it figured out but never really did. I think it could have had a more clever ending but perhaps that wouldn't have been consistent with \\"Kali's Influence\\" on the characters' lives in the story. I will reread this novel for sure."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"This book is one of the reasons I keep a classic on my shelve ...a must read for horror, thriller, and mystery fans alike.."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"I've long been a fan of Dan Simmons' literate versions of sci-fi and horror ever since I first read his Hyperion Cantos and Carrion Comfort. But until now I'd never picked up his first horror novel, Song of Kali.Perhaps it's because Song of Kali was written early in his career, but the book never really connected with me. I can lose myself in some of Simmons' other works, but Song of Kali didn't have the ability to draw me in on a visceral level. Despite its exotic locale, I never felt I was there in Calcutta. Perhaps it's because I had a college friend who grew up in Calcutta and who told me much about the city that the book failed to connect with me. Simmons seems intent on portraying the impoverished areas of Calcutta almost exclusively - and he does it with a vengence! The Calcutta of Song of Kali had no redeeming qualities. It's denizens are uniformly portrayed as the worst form of stereotypes.Yet still I found much to recommend the book. For one, Simmons can portray dramatic moments realistically. For example, his depiction of when one of the characters is kidnapped and fantasizes about escaping his captors, but knows he cannot overpower them and heroically escape, is spot on. So, too, are the reactions of two characters who face a devastating tragedy. He is able to reveal more about them in just a simple description of their movements than he could by letting readers into the characters' heads.This is not Simmons at his best, but it marks a clear starting point for him. Readers who go into this book expecting the same sort of quality that is found in his later books are likely to be disappointed. But if you're able to put your expectations on hold and go along for the ride, Song of Kali is a perfectly good read."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"Although not what I would call scary or shocking, this book was very engrossing. It puts you dead-center in Calcutta so that you can almost smell and see what's being described. The writing style is excellent, the characters are entirely believable and the story moves at a perfect pace. It's different - highly recommended."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"My first Simmons &quot;horror&quot; title after Endymion. This was a fun and creepy read -- enjoyable for the most part. He wrapped things up quickly toward the end but the suspense and pacing of the book overall kept me up to see what would happen next."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"This book takes you on a trip straight into the hellhole that is Calcutta. Although the book has some great supernatural elements (quite reminiscent of Lovecraft), it is the real life occurrences that are most creepy. Simmons depicts the utter depravity and morbidity of Calcutta with such verve, such immediacy, that you feel as if you are with him in the dark alleys and crowded plazas, surround by scarred and diseased beggars and knowing that one more murder in this city wouldn't make one hell of a difference. If you like quick, intense horror then give this book a read."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"Dan Simmons has crafted a chilling novel that will leave the hair on your body standing on end!! He has written a novel that transcends any genre; he has written a novel every parent should read. This is a novel of heartbreak and the ability to go on.Simmons is more well known for his fantasy and sci-fi fiction than horror, but he has a knack for horror. He can do so many wonderful things with his storytelling in horror. He already has and I hope he continues.I absolutely loved this novel and read the last 20-30 pages 5 or 6 times! The ending is heartbreaking, but I won't divulge too much here. It is just amazing what Simmons can do!!"},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"Magnificent wordsmithing by a top young writer. Simmons' lush descriptions and vivid characterizations are up to the challenge of his strong topic. Perhaps the only mild letdown is the principal character's sporadic density---he brings his wife to her native India to assist in translation, but never actually bringing her to any functions where translation might be required. I find it hard to believe that Simmons meant only to use the presence of the wife and child to advance his theme on evil in the world towards the tail end of the tome while ignoring their existence for most of the novel, but that's what he did.A great read, really. I read this on an airplane and had to ask myself a few questions about air rage---especially since I'd been bumped off a full flight and was getting home six hours late on my wife's birthday. There was a point where during that evening when I could relate to Simmons' naive protagonist (psssst...read the book to see what that meant)."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"While the author's intense prose descriptions of Calcutta were horrifying enough to keep me away forever, and his story riveting enough to keep me glued for several days, he couldn't seem to figure out how to solve (and thus end) his own mystery. The last 75 pages were a huge let-down. No answers -- simply the &quot;cult of evil&quot; spreading throughout the world, with no understanding of the identity of the mysterious woman who kidnapped the protagonists' baby, the real motivation of the master poet, the cult, etc. etc.A worthwhile read but an ultimate disappointment."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"While I cannot say that this was the best book I ever read - I can say that it was very well written, and one of the best. Mr. Simmons had me hooked from the moment I opened the book. As a matter of fact, I stopped reading two other books I was reading to read this book in its entirety. I'm definitely a loyol fan after reading this book. The writing was very unique. I didn't stop reading until the book was over. I will not compare Mr. Simmons with Stephen King. The two writers are stylistically different. Mr. Simmons has earned his Kudo's independently of Stephen King.Mr. Simmons, you are one of the best."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"The atmosphere reeks of horror throughout this story. It's bleak and a couple of little things dangle at the end, but it's also pretty powerful. Good stuff very reminiscient of another master of atmosphere, H.P. Lovecraft. The story within the story is also a nice touch. Truly horrible."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"One of the most disturbing books I've ever read. You'll feel the heat and smell the stench of Calcutta. Dan Simmons really takes you there. Just like the Goddess Kali, it's horrifying and yet too fascinating to just look away. Just like the hero you'll walk into the trap of your own free will and discover too late that you're hooked into something really nasty. Too amazingly good to be a first novel. He won a Fantasy award for it. If you like horror, you've got to check this out!"},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"I first heard this book being read by Harlan Ellison. It was breathtaking then and continued to be when I read it myself. Whatever genre Dan writes in his style is superb and his stories are insiteful and scary. I'm constantly on the look-out for anything new by Mr. Simmons!"},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"The strength of this book is its stunning power of setting: the misery and festering evil that is this version of Calcutta. The scenes live and breathe and are vicarious fun to drift through - just like a movie.However, the hero is extremely unlikable, constantly exploding like a five year-old prone to tantrums and impulsive behavior. Also, the plot has real credibility problems. Why did the hero take his wife and baby to such an awful place as Calcutta? He knew he was inconveniencing his wife (a math professor who had work to do), and he also knew that she, while Indian, was not steeped in the right culture to serve as an effective interpreter and guide for him.Why? Well, obviously to put them in danger as a clumsy plot device. Ultimately, the plot problems capsize the interest of the setting. I wouldn't recommend this one unless you want to try a library copy first."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"Friends and reviews sold me this book as an intense exercise in shock/weird horror. I am sorry to say this, but this book doesn't live up to any of those standards. If you want shocking horror, go read Monica J. O'Rouke's \\"Suffer the Flesh\\".First we have the enigmatic dedication that reads: \\"To Harlan Ellison, who has heard the Song\\". (Rough retranslation from a Spanish translation) This alone sets the mood for an interesting read. After that, the very opening line is sure to glue you to the following pages... but that's about it. The intense, \\"horror\\", atmosphere begins around a little less than 100 before the book is finished; all the pages before, Simmons was creating background with some gross mutilated corpses thrown in to spice up the mix, but not real suspense.It's too bad, really. Simmons can paint really disturbing images in your mind, he really can, but too much time (and trees) was wasted in \\"i'm-going-nowhere\\" plot building. There is a sense of a cruel supernatural world exiting alongside ours, but its existence is just hinted at, and in the end nothing is really resolved leaving a trail of doubt, which is good in fact, plot-wise.Oh, did I forget to say that \\"good triumphs over evil\\" is hinted at in the end?To his merit, we can say that Simmons does a GREAT work in describing that hell hole known as Calcuta; his description of putrid streets, low lives, underground crime, grotesque morgues and pits infested with trash, vomit and people are, simply put, deliciously disgusting. He does success in the \\"bleak is the existence\\" departmentSong of Kali, if properly rewritten, would make a superb short story... but it doesn't make a good book. I'm not even sure if this volume can be called \\"horror\\" at all."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"It's probably a huge mistake to include inflated words of hype on the cover of a horror book. \\"SHOCK TREATMENTS ABOUND!\\" And inside the cover, we're made to believe that this is one of the most harrowing novels ever. Well...it had the potential. I won't give in to the \\"should have beens\\", but I assumed the end dealt with some kind of sacrifice. The narrator would fall under the goddess Kali's influence and ravage his own family. Would this be more horrific? Or how about some subtlety? I feel the ending came out of left field. I won't give away the secret, but the resloution seemed unrelated to the main plotline, or perhaps thrown in to manipulate what would happen. It is a dreadful conclusion, but grates against simple logic. Perhaps Calcutta trapped the family in a quagmire of despair, forcing them to remain in its corrupt embrace. Either circumstance kept the wife and child there, or an author's slick contrivances.As for the protagonist, I felt little for him. He was either an arrogant wise#$%, or would explode into fits of anger that seemed disproportional to what was happening. He never really developed a personality, unlike the other characters. The descriptions of Calcutta's rank alleys and abysmal moral center were well done, but I wonder if the author has ever been to India. If so, I think there would have been more fascinating details than the children constantly defecating in the open, bathing in mud puddles, or sleeping under sheets in the rain. He paints a vividly gruesome portrait of the slums, but it grew almost repetitive after a few chapters. The cult of Kali and its mechanisms was frightening, but it never seemed to plummet into the realm of true, paralyzing terror.All in all, this was a creepy book with a fair share of terrible images. Perhaps a little more time and imagination would have made it the scare classic it boasts about in the opening pages."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"I read this book mainly to see if I could recognize the Calcutta that I used to know ten years ago. I have no great interest in books on anything supernatural, books involving traveling in time or midgets on horseback constantly fleeing from an unidentified threat in the horizon. The fact that D.R. Koontz expressed his admiration for Song of Kali on the back cover of the Finnish-language edition was a minor put-off for me.I was quite pleasantly surprised. The story takes place some fifteen years earlier than my visits to Calcutta, but I did find it interesting to see how Mr. Simmons had experienced that, to my mind, wonderful Indian city. The Grand Oberoi Hotel, obviously, had not been renovated yet, and the young boy who used to lie on his back on the sidewalk of Chowringhee St. with his head buried into a pothole filled with sand had not been borne yet.The slight tinge of fear brought about by the intense culture shock you are likely to experience when you come to Calcutta for the first time was not there, for me, in the Song of Kali. And in reality, too, it wore off after the few first visits. The dark shadows of throngs of dark people and cows in the night, living on the streets, lit only by open cooking fires on the roadsides, all the way from Dum Dum Airport to Chowringhee St., in a rattling, hot Ambassador speeding through the hot, moist darkness of the night, constantly swerving around potholes or policemen; all this, and the noise and the sounding horns make quite a memorable experience.The story itself was better than I had expected in the sense that nothing supernatural happened, the plot was believable. O.K., the image of Kali came to life once, but that was maybe two pages, at the most. Amrita, the protagonist's wife, had moved to London with her family at the age of seven. Despite this, she knew six or seven Indian languages in addition to the normal European languages and Russian. This kind of exaggeration I find as annoying as Clint Eastwood portraying his clumsy he-man characters as connoisseurs of fine art and classical music--in his later films, that is, the ones he produced himself.The funniest part to read was Muktanandaji's account of how he was initiated into the secret and terrible society of Kali-worshipping criminals. The end flops badly. I got the impression that the last part was written to make Song of Kali a plausible manuscript for a film, complete with the second coming of the murdering thugs."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"I bought the Song of Kali based on my enjoyment of Simmons other works, particulary his Hyperion related books. This book started out great, set the scene, and established all of the items required for a good horror story.

It lacks some origionality, which I think has more to do with this being one of Simmons earlier works than any failure of the author's other works.This book is not a masterpeice of horror, or something that will haunt me in the dead of the night.

It is a book which grabs the very core of your being and takes it on a roller coaster ride in the macbre setting of India's most bloody cult. The prose flows like fine red wine, seeping into your mind with effortless ease, while exerting an influence which is irresistable. Plan on spending a while once you open the cover, as it will be nearly impossible to put it down once you have heard the the opening strains of the deadly song of Kali."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"Plot Summary: Bobby Luczac and his wife and baby are off to Calcutta to find a poet who is apparently creating new material despite being dead for over 8 years. How can M. Das be writing new poems, how is he still alive, where is he to be found? These are the questions Bobby is to answer as well as collect a new manuscript for his stateside periodical. Despite warnings from colleagues, the whole family flies to India, birthplace of his wife. Nothing good happens for Mr. and Mrs. Luczac from this point on.Opinion: I'm kind of in between on this book. At points I am amazed and disgusted by the imagery and the squalor of Calcutta. At other points I find myself just skimming to get on with the story. Simmons does a good job overall painting the city as this almost black hole of misfortune, horror, and evil. Much of it based on cult worshiping of the goddess Kali. I was impressed at how far he took the things that could and did happen in this book. Far past where a weaker author would have maybe spared us a little. Then things got a little out of character after the climax of the book. There is hope after all we are led to believe. The characters were all decently written including the city which is the main character of this horror story. I can't say how well this portrays Calcutta because I don't know anyone who has been there, but it was very vivid for me from the book that I wouldn't want to.Recommendation: I would recommend this to Simmons fans because he is a good writer and the story is pretty good. I would not suggest this as your first Simmons book though as I think his Hyperion and Ilium stories are much better. I rate it 3.5 out of 5 overall."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"According to Hindu teaching, we are in the Kali Yuga, the Age of Kali. Dan Simmons may well you believe it. With great intelligence and unexpected sensitivity, Simmons relates a story that could easily have turned to schlock, but which instead deals with cultural phobias, nightmare images, and the existence of a very unintellectual (and yet also very un-Stephen King) form of evil with the same deft touch. Certainly, the book sells as horror and roting corpses and all manner of nastiness abound, but Simmons handles them in context -- a context in which pain is sometimes sacred and the truly horrific merely a part of the pattern.The point that makes _The Song of Kali_ so intensely readable is that Simmons doesn't make the mistake of avoiding the cultural politics of a horror novel about a foreign deity...nor does he make the greater mistake of beating one over the head with relativistic blather. In one of the novel's most derailing passages, a character describes the differences between India and the west as the difference between Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometry...irreconcilable, nearly inconceivable._The Song of Kali_ has its flaws, but under the poisonous gleam of Simmons's Calcutta and even under the personal disaster that shatters the protagonist's life, there is an awareness of the darkness of an age where unspeakable violence is truly commonplace. That awareness, combined with the chilling thought that we have not, perhaps, chosen the right geometry, make reading this novel an experience that you will not -- and should not -- soon forget."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"I am *never* going to Calcutta.Apparently he only spent two and a half days there, but Calcutta must have made one hell of an impression on Dan Simmons. I don't know if his portrayal of it is accurate, but he's presented a dark, dirty, frightening city -- a place I've visited in my nightmares many times since reading &quot;Song of Kali.&quot;This is a novel that really stuck with me. In fact, after reading it I had to get rid of my copy, because it freaked me out so much. It's a thoroughly engaging story -- part of why it was so upsetting is that I believed the protagonists (a writer and his wife and baby) so completely.Lots of writers have approached the subject of bad places -- mostly in the form of haunted houses (Shirley Jackon's classic &quot;The Haunting of Hill House,&quot; Richard Matheson's &quot;Hell House,&quot; and Stephen King's &quot;The Shining&quot; all come to mind). This is the first example of a *city* as bad place that I've seen. It's also the first book in a long time that's really scared me."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"After havining seen the cover blurbs. I spent about two thirds of this book wondering what the hell I was missing. The overlong setup failed to get me invested in the main character, a self-involved poet, who comes across as rather petulant, dull and disengaged. We spend a short eternity with Luczack's literary mentor, a boring cliche of a cigar-chomping New Yorker with a heart of gold. Luczack's one saving grace is his capable, intellectually curious wife, whom he mostly talks down to and/or places in peril. (There's a ridiculous bit late in the book where he makes a big display of \\"I'm not leaving you again, kiddo\\", only to wander off again as soon as she falls asleep.) I would have been grateful for Luczack to get killed off early and the focus shifted to the wife.In addition, while the horrified-travelogue aspect of the book is effective, we never go any deeper than Luczack's ugly-American revulsion at a society he doesn't understand. Simmons seems content to paint most residents of Calcutta as potential gangsters or murderous fanatics, and leave it at that. The story only gets interesting (far too late in the book) when the Luczack character mercifully shuts up long enough to let some of the Indians tell their own stories. The storyline involving the Kali cult is genuinely, darkly fascinating and I wish Simmons had done more than scratch the surface of it.The emotional climax could have been wrenching if only I'd been invested in the main character, and unfortunately the novel peters out with him descending into a world of self-pity for several chapters. Some really interesting horror material here, sandwiched into an otherwise boring novel."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"If you are intersted in this book, DO NOT READ THE REVIEWS BELOW. The reviews below give away MAJOR plot points and ruined my reading of what would have been a suspenseful book."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"After reading Harlan Ellison's comments about this book years ago, I knew I had to have it. Not an easy book to locate then, but once I had it... Oh my God. I'd never read a horror novel like it. It was bloated with the corruption and festering malignancy of Calcutta: \\"Some places are too evil to be allowed to exist.\\" With that provocative opening line, Simmons opens up a universe filled with an overpowering sense of the otherworldly that the Western mind cannot escape.The novel feeds on our (inherent?) xenophobia, our fear of women (manifested in the devouring goddess of Kali), our passion for violence, and the all-too-real fear of our children taken from us. \\"All violence is power,\\" the poet Das says. \\"Sometimes there is no hope. Sometimes there is only pain.\\"THAT, friends and neighbors, is the true crux of all great horror fiction, and Simmons doesn't hesitate to take us as far down the river at the heart of darkness. His knowledge of classic poetry, particularly Yeats, and Luczak's wife's knowledge of geometry, infuses this novel with an intelligence and moral weight most horror writers either fake or never bother with in the first place. And India has such a vast and bizarre mythology I'm surprised no one explored it before like this.I love this book, and even picking it up again to write this review I'm tempted to read it a third time. Anyone with any knowledge of India's myths will find it all the more disturbing. The use of story-within-story that heightens the horror (for some reason I'm a sucker for this narrative trick; Lovecraft did it, King did it in \\"Pet Sematary\\", Anne Rice too-- it always chills me to the bone) I can't say enough of the fascination this book holds for me, its relentless darkness, its stench of rancid flesh, its charnel house images, its fusion of sex and death, its climax of delirium and fire--and the final moral stand of a man who comes to realize how truly helpless he is in the face of so much darkness.Listen to the song of Kali if you have at all a true taste for the macabre, the funereal, the hopeless, the living dark, the taint of blood: \\"The world is pain/O terrible wife of Siva/ You are chewing the flesh/Your tongue is drinking the blood, O dark Mother! O unclad Mother/O beloved of Siva/The world is pain.\\"\\"The Age of Kali has begun/The Song of Kali is now sung.\\" Hear it? Listen...."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"Particular scenes in The Song of Kali are still haunting me over a month after finishing the book. This is certainly the mark of a good horror story. What sets this novel apart is the mood created by the author. The story takes place in Calcutta, painted as a locale that is as evil as any you might find in your worst nightmare. The atmosphere and the local characters add to the effectiveness of this book in a way that exceeds any other book in recent memory. For lovers of well-written horror, you 'd be hard pressed to find a better page-turner. I'm a huge Stephen King fan, but this one has images that horrify more than Mr. King's best. If you read this book, you will be thinking about it for months. Try it and enjoy..."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"I read this novel mainly due to the blurbs on the back cover, which imply that this novel is a horror masterpiece. It isn't one.SONG OF KALI is an interesting, well-written novel in many ways. In particular, Dan Simmons does a great job creating atmosphere. Most of this novel takes place in Calcutta, India, which is not a very pleasant place to be. Simmons does an excellent job describing the city and I honestly felt like I was there myself, his writing was that good.Other than that, I didn't care for this novel that much. The characters are mainly unlikable intellectuals who are too self-absorbed for their own good. As a result, I didn't really care very much about what happened to them. The plot starts out very well, but then meanders and doesn't end in a satisfactory manner. Parts of this book are quite boring.I didn't feel like I wasted my time reading this novel, but it isn't for everybody. If you're looking for a scary, well-plotted book with vivid characterization, my advice is to skip this one and read some of Dan Simmons' later work, which is far superior to SONG OF KALI."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"As an avid reader of horror, fantasy and science fiction, I like to think that I'm immune to any lasting effects from the frightening images that emerge from those dark places within the minds of our best contemporary authors. Most of the time my reaction is, \\"Been there ... done that ... NEXT!\\". But last night I finished reading SONG OF KALI by Dan Simmons. And I fear that the images he conjures will be with me for a very long time to come.This horrible/delightful/remarkable book works on your psyche on two levels: it attacks your senses by describing, in graphic detail, the mundane, \\"real world\\" horrors that exist just beyond the field of awareness for most Westerners living in affluent, post-industrialized \\"societies\\"; but worse yet, it open up that dark place so deeply imbedded within our basal ganglia that it can only be assumed to be the most primal and ancient of human nerve centers. It triggers an autonomic recoil from the pure darkness, cold malevolence, and absolute EVIL that surrounds us. We begin, innocently enough on the first level, following our protagonist's journey to solve a mystery ... and then slowly ... methodically ... step by step and with our guard down ... we are led blindly into reeking depths of the primordial abyss. I've never been to Calcutta. But, like many other Americans, I have traveled to a number of other \\"Third World\\" settings, both in groups and as a individual. I never cease to be appalled at the the arrogance and materialistic ego-centricity of too many American travelers who fail to respect or even try to fathom other cultures, unfamiliar traditions, and those painful economic realities suffered by much of the REST of the world. Simmons captures the naive, and distinctly American, arrogance of his protagonist (Robert Luczak) remarkably well. But then he takes it one step further. He rolls Luczak's arrogance in broken glass and shoves it right down his throat.I like to think of myself as a savvy reader. Most of the time, I can sense where a story is heading before it actually takes me there. All the way through the first three quarters of SONG OF KALI, I was pretty certain I knew where the author was leading me. I expected the expected. I was anticipating the clich&eacute;. But the sheer horror of that final twist of the literary knife-in-the-gut left me utterly speechless, with my heart a-pounding and my mouth hanging open like a drooling simpleton. I simply could not believe that I didn't see this coming! I was caught so completely off guard that I actually had to back up and re-read that section several times, just to be certain that I was really reading what I thought I was reading. What an ending! My congratulations to Dan Simmons for writing such a dark masterpiece. I wonder, what deep, dark recess in your mind did you have to tap to dredge up something so completely unfathomable? What nightmares you must suffer."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"Or Kolkata now as it is called.Well I like most things horrific and I chanced upon this quaint little book written way back in the 1980's.Surprisingly it is really accurate and vivid.Having lived there myself I have grown up to some of the images,the overshadowing elements of poverty and life growing ceaselessly through it.However,Dan Simmons effectively paints a horrific picture in a seemingly mundane everyday Calcutta life.But the Goddess exists,I have been to Kalighat myself,knelt before Kali and offered her my prayers.Still people sacrifice animals to the goddess on Satrudays and Tuesdays,known as Kali's days.It is believed that the Goddess has some powers as she is \\"jagrata\\" as the author calls it.Regarding Kapaliks and Tantriks,they still abound both in Kalighat and in a nearby place called Tarapith.Which brings me back to the accuracy.While some of the prose is rather against my tastes, what with a sexual rendezvous with one of the most esteemed Goddesses,the book is powerful and effective.And factual.Calcutta is that and no amount of fractal math or parallel universes can cause it to be otherwise.However,apparently the horror isn't there.Its just a bunch of poor people roaming around half naked as the humidity and the sun render clothes to be a burden.And presently you can contrast it with the high risers and the McDonalds which have permeated the old by-lanes,as if trying to convert a dead man.However,inspite of the modernity,if you do go to Kalighat in the middle of the night,with the scream of the jackals and the small talk of the local mafia,you might just glimpse a very vivid image of Kali in the blood of all her glory."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"I picked this up to read on the plane during a recent vacation and couldn't put it down. Simmons' writing never fails to engage the reader. Song of Kali started off a little slow, but picks up the pace and drags you in; and down to places you probably don't want to go.It would have rated 5 stars, but it seemed Simmons felt the need to soften the finale, which seemed a little out of place. Overall, this is an excellent story, and not one for the squeemish."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"Simmons demonstrates over the years that he can pick up almost any genre, and excel at it. However, Song of Kali represents Simmons at his best: the telling of the psychological terror that ensues as the story's main character goes in search of the elusive poet M. Das in Calcutta.Simmons portrays a Calcutta--and the characters he encounters--that is as haunting in its squalor as it is unforgiving. Although the story-telling is refreshingly direct, Simmons still manages to captivate his audience with characters you feel forced to trust in spite of yourself."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"I am from India, never been to Calcutta, heard a lot about it. This is a book written by auther who musta spent a lot of time in India! truely the best horror book. It does have stuff some people from India may not like, I dont know how much is true and how much is imagination. But as a fiction book, it is great. This is a good author."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"Although award-winning, Song of Kali is definitely a B-grade Dan Simmons novel. It does not share the high quality of the Hyperion Cantos or Summer of Night/A Winter Haunting. However, it is still an excellent -- and frightening -- novel. Simmons's outstanding use of a first-person voice and rich and varied description of Calcutta's oppressive climate and population density combine to create a powerful horror story."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"...this is hardly the most frightening book ever written. I wouldn't even put it in the top 10. That said, Mr. Simmons has crafted a chilling read. Right from the introduction, I found myself completely seduced by his fictional Calcutta as a den of unspeakable evil. This has stayed with me after reading the book, and I find that I am now drawn to Calcutta in the same way I was drawn to New England after reading H.P. Lovecraft, just to see if it is really that disturbing.The book is extremely enjoyable to read, with an almost literary quality. The author is deft at handling the demands of exposition within the constraints of the first person narration. A few moments ring untrue, but others (including the climax) are just fantastic. Overall the book has the messy feel of a true-life story, which of course makes it all the more disturbing.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"Dan Simmons has compiled a wide body of eclectic work yet no major movie deals, which strikes me as odd. His writing is clear, riveting, and sometimes poetic. Having written horror, science fiction (Hyperion is just plain awesome), mystery, and other types of fiction, Simmons takes some very interesting chances to create an unusual story. The main character is an American writer named Kuczak who journeys to Calcutta, India to find the great Indian poet Das. He decides to take his Indian-born wife and infant daughter with him for reasons which turn out to be both unnecessary and very problematic. It's a natural story insert though as he believes he'll need a translator, but it turns out that translation is the least of his problems. Kuczak and his family feel the oppressing poverty and an air of evil the moment that set foot in Calcutta. It's a city of beggars, misery, class division, and despair that is palpable. All Kuczak wants to do the moment he arrives is to meet M. Das, get his new manuscript of poetry to be published in the states, and leave. Instead he is pulled into a series of events beyond his control and imagination. Along this journey we meet the mysterious Krishna who may or may not be an ally, the elitist Chatterjee who sees nothing wrong with the poverty and violence which he never has to interact with, and then there is the Cult of the goddess Kali with its bizarre and archaic practices and beliefs. What is reality and what is illusion? Kuczak is never certain. There is a great deal of criticism of Indian religion, culture, and beliefs that might be difficult for some Indians to take, but in the book some Indians can't help but despise what Calcutta is and rightly so as the elites have not only allowed the city to become what it is, but actually sustain the poverty and despair. In addition to being a horror story and mystery, this book also attempts to explore many different themes that third world countries face. This novel is filled with unexpected turns, imagery that is sickening to even read about, and is a no holds barred tour de force that will leave the reader drained at the end (and that's the point). This book is better than King and I won't even mention Koontz and is worth checking out along with Simmons' other great horror story, Carrion Comfort. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"Dan Simmons manages to take the tourist fears of third world countries and make them palatable enough that you not only sympathize with these people, you never want to travel to the places that they travel.This book is a rich textured trip into hell-on-earth as the poverty and decay slowly overwhelm the narrator and his wife. The caste system, drug dealers and apologists all work together to create an eerie hopeless desperation that the main character can only deny by the barest shred of rationalization.I am only giving this book 4 stars because the ending is stupid (it's an urban legend for chrissakes) but the trip there is just too horrifying to believe."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"Simmons does in this book what he does best. He plots, characterizes, and paints a picture that burns in your mind.Calcutta is crowded, heavy, seething, swarming, and fetid. This is the atmosphere of evil. Something horrible must bubble to the surface here and it does.His horror is as visceral as Clive Barker's without being as overwhelming and jaded. Those moments are sharp, painful, and lucid. The maggots. The jewels. The statue. The baby's fate. He spares no reader. These are the moments folded into the plot and left to seep into your psyche like the blood of a knife wound.Winner of the World Fantasy Award, Simmons' first novel is a smash hit. It gave me nightmares for a week."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"The coolest thing about Dan Simmons is that he usually goes to the places he writes about just so he can get the aunthenticity down. He likes to be honest with his readers. He wrote a book about Vlad The Impaler (Dracula) called Children Of The Night, so he traveled to Romania and visited the real Castle Dracula. In his first novel, Song Of Kali, a poet travels to India with his Indian wife and their infant daughter in search of some epic poem. Simmons writes about Calcutta and Simmons was there, for two and a half days, but that, apparently was enough to get the right ambiance down pat. Calcutta, as Simmons points out to us over and over again, is a complete f*cking sh*thole! I accept that. I never had a desire to see Calcutta & after Song Of Kali, I still have no desire to see it. Calcutta can stay where it is for all I care. Anyway, Song Of Kali is one of the best first novels ever written. Simmons won the World Fantasy Award for Best Novel, so that says something. I love this book. It's dark and brutal and intense. The ending will make you recoil in horror. Heavy. Dan Simmons has been a powerhouse since his first short story \\"The River Styx Runs Upstream\\" appeared in Twilight Zone Magazine. Intense.Dig It!"},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"Having read the Hyperion series, I was on the prowl for more Dan Simmons, when I came across Song of Kali. I was very surprised to find that Simmons wrote horror, and proceeded to read this book in one sitting. The lush descriptions and vivid details served to bring realism to the sordid world of Calcutta. I have rarely seen writing of this caliber in works of horror or fantasy. A propos the horror aspect -- I found this to be less of a horror novel than a tragedy. Yes, there were horrific fantastic elements, but these were not as overwhelming as the realistic descriptions of the surroundings. The story is truly tragic, and to me at least, it seemed about as 'horror' as Hamlet. Sure, there's a ghost in Hamlet, but that's not the point. Similarly, the mythos and horror of Kali is merely a vessel to convey a much more important message -- a warning about our society today. Apart from the horrific, this book also contained much of humor (in the vein of the great tragedies). I found myself chuckling out loud in parts, due to the absurb metaphorical juxtapositions the narrator sometimes presents. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys long, beautifully worded descriptions and an insight into violence in the world today."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"The book so so very predictable. As soon as Bobby takes his wife and baby to the arm pit of the world you knew that there was serious trouble. The flimsy excuse of using his wife as an interpreter was weak at best. Why would his intelligent wife let a stranger into her hotel room becuase she sais that she is a relative of the poet that Bobby is looking for much less let this woman handle her baby. If Booby, and I do mean Booby, had done his research on Das then he would have known that Das had no female relatives and, realistically, that is what would have happened. I think Simmons likes to put children in the way of great danger just to shock his readers. While Booby wanders around this dangerous trash heap of a city leaving his wife and child to the tender mercies of a demented town, I was just waiting to see what happens to the kid becuase that is what the story was driving to. Yea, sure the song of Kali was about the ultimate spread of violence committed on all humankind, but the climax was so predictable and finally not satifying, just plain sad. Simmons, I don't reccommend him. The action of the main people in the story just don't make sense and the children seem to suffer the most loss."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"I had heard good things about this book, and was happy when I finally got my hands on it. I had no idea what the plot was about, so I just dove right into it, having no idea what to expect.It is deeply embarassing to me that this book is so highly regarded as \\"terrifying.\\" It is almost unbelievably racist and xenophobic. For the majority of the book, the sheer xenophobia is the only \\"terrifying\\" factor. I am not exaggerating. The main character is appalled by the conditions of the city, the people, and the culture.We get treated to such terrifying descriptions as \\"masses of brown-skinned people\\", and people with \\"oily black hair\\". People with deformities, people sleeping in hovels, or in the streets, beggers - these are the \\"terrifying\\" things about this book.I just finished reading a different book that described the exact same circumstances...it was a true-life account of a doctor who created a hospital to help people in an impoverished country. Mountains Beyond Mountains, by Tracy Kidder. I recommend it to anyone who reads this book and finds it terrifying. Maybe it'll cure you of your xenophobia, make you a little more accepting of different cultures and feel empathy - not terror - for people who make less money in a year than you have in your pocket. Maybe I should send it to Dan Simmons...he might need it the most."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"SONG OF KALI is a combination of non-sensical plot choices (ex. the protagonist decides to bring his infant daughter from the US to India on a short business trip; the \\"rationale\\" given for this is so pathetically feeble, the author might just as well SAY \\"so the baby can be placed in danger for plot purposes\\"), repellant characters (particularly the protagonist, who's foolish, mean-spirited, rude, self-absorbed, racist... 300 pages spent with this jerk felt like a long, LONG time), fantasy/horror elements that don't manage to get off the ground, and storytelling that's heavy-handed and simple-minded. The whole novel comes across as if the author hated Calcutta so much during his brief visit to the city that he felt compelled to glorify his \\"ick! ick! ICK!\\" reaction by turning that reaction into a one-dimensional novel."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"To all those people saying how incredibly frightening this book is: You must get scared VERY easily. I was only bored. Nothing happened in this book for so long. At one point some guy with glasses and lots of pimples tells a l-o-n-g story that FINALLY reveals a dead man being brought back to life. And what scary stuff does this dead man do? Nothing. He just walks away. End of chapter.I am totally mystified what anyone would find frightening or unsettling about this book. This is the Blair Witch Project of the literary world--lots of great reviews and then it turns out to be nothing. Go read The Exorcist or The Shining if you want something spooky. Those of you thought THIS book was, try Little Red Riding Hood next--it has a very frightening wolf in it."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"First let me make it clear: I learnt a lesson from this book: When you hunt for something for a long time and the thing you have been dying to lay down your hands is terrible, the disappointment falls down on you like nothing else...One word could summarize this book: TERRIBLEI have read a quite number of Dan Simmons books, and mostly enjoyed them. He is not a Stephen King (who is?) but at least he can weave a descent story without going maudlin and characters can come alive on page...His SF books (Olympos and Ilium) are better than his horror output.But this book sucks. The disappointment mostly comes from excellent blurbs on the backcover, namely Dean Koontz and Harlan Ellison. The blurb by Dean Koontz is particularly misleading: \\"The best novel in the (horror) genre I can remember.\\" What? Mr Koontz I have read lots of bad books from you but at least I expect you to be more honest when suggesting good reads. I had suspicions about your ability to understand what good horror is or not due to the praise you heaped upon Richard Laymon but describing a distasteful travelogue book as the best of the genre? Come on....Buyers, don't waste your time. Don't believe blurbs. Up until page 200 nothing happens except for a very long-winded resurrected dead story and a few silly dreams. Dean Koontz says this is the best book he can remember in the genre but he should certainly have had Alzheimer then.After page 200, there is some action but nothing is coherent, there is still no horror and the resolution is meaningless. If you want to read a desolate, bleak Calcutta guideline this is the book for you.I don't know why Mr Simmons chose Calcutta as a fright-inducing place. Maybe One Night in Bangkok, a forgettable pop song from 80s, was very popular when this book was written and anything that seemed remotely far east was selling then. Avoid unless you are a completist, and even then, wait until you complete ALL OTHER BOOKS BY HIM"},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"Wow... worst book ever written. It's depiction of one of India's holiest cities and it's inhabitants is deluded at best, and diabolically racist at it's worst. Not to mention how many Hindus (myself included) his depiction of our beloved Goddess, Kali Ma... Hindus definitely don't sacrifice people to Kali... most Hindus are at the very least semi-vegetarians. Disgusting anti-religious sentiment and racist hatred is what summarizes this book best.Jai Sri Kali Mata!"},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"Where can I begin to descibe how awful this book was? How about that they murder the main characters baby in Calcutta to smuggle jewels in it Or that the author goes into an agonizing long description of stealing a bloated foul smelling corpse that was a drowning death.

That is the best way to descibe this book."},{"Title":"Song of Kali","review":"I have never read A dan simmons book before, I'm never going to read another book by him.

Never going to read any of this racist author again."},{"Title":"A Reply to the Headlines : Poems, 1965-1970","review":"Although this is among Mr. Robbin's earlier work, it, in my opinion, includes some of his best poetry."},{"Title":"Cry 'God For Harry'","review":"The only good (and lucid) portions of this plotless, characterless, poorly written novel are the portions the author plagiarized from A.M. Maugham's Harry of Monmouth, John Cowper Powys's Owen Glendower, and H.F. Hutchinson's Henry the Fifth. The rest of it, the author's creation, is so bad it's almost funny: a character who has eyes \\"UNDER high cheekbones\\" is also able to ride a ways, relating the sad tale of an early love, while carrying an arrow through his upper arm. Another character, on the eve of Agincourt, listens to the king relating the sad tale of an early love. Other such choice moments abound. Save your time and read Harry of Monmouth and Owen Glendower -- they're light-years above this idiotic twaddle. And did the author..... really ... have ... to use all..... those ..... ellipses ...? ...This would get a negative star, if that were an option."},{"Title":"Youth and the Bright Medusa","review":"Willa Catha, a writer I discovered by accident, to me is one of the great US writers. I have read book after book by her, and am glad still more are waiting for me to read.Youth and the Bright Medusa, is a book of short stories that continues her theme throughout her writing. \\"If you want to live fully, you must find what it is that is satisfying to you, you must find your passion\\". You must also recognize where those around you are invested in keeping you where they want you to be, having nothing to do with you and what satisfies you at all. It is the old American story, don't try to be uppity and someone other than who we want you to be. That being said, we have also all heard, \\"You can be whatever you want to be\\", while at the same time those same people do their best to hold you back. As Willa Cather stresses in this and her other books, \\"Get out there and be who you are. If you do not do that, you will live an unsatisfying life\\". You do not want to end your your life asking yourself: \\"What happened to me?\\""},{"Title":"Youth and the Bright Medusa","review":"I AM NOT A FAN OF WILLA CATHER - HAVING CONSIDERED HER WRITING TOO SIMPLISTIC, COMPARED TO SAY, THOMAS HARDY OR BALZAC.

In addition, in the first chapter the authors present all of the financial statements, which overwhelms some students. Finally, some topics are used before they are intoduced in detail.Nonetheless, the book is excellent in many ways. If you carefully read the text of each chapter, you will get a good background in basic accounting. There are many problems at the end of the chapter, and the online materials are splendid. Use them to you advantage, read the book, and attend your class, and with hard work success is probable."},{"Title":"Financial Accounting (6th Edition) (Prentice Hall Series in Accounting)","review":"What I like about the Horngren Series is the practicality of it. This series has always managed to hold the number of pages down to about 200 less than its quite excellent major competitors (Weygandt-Kieso-Kimmel and Wild-Larson-Chiappetta). It's still a large-dimension hardcover and this Horngren book has 752 pages. That's plenty of space for a student, and Horngren provides more than enough easy-access online materials as well.Horngren is mainly used by university students although Weygandt-Kieso-Kimmel have gained market share. But Horngren also recognizes that most financial accountants do not need an accounting degree. They need to understand accounting and know how to do their specific jobs. In fact, I've long noticed the small ratio of accountants working in accounting departments that actually have accounting degrees. For them, the Horngren Series is well-designed in addition to serving the needs of college students.Horngren places emphasis on the accounting cycle. In doing so, this textbook covers the actual job duties within an accounting department quite efficiently. That's why I also purchase Horngren Series books. I purchase them for staff as well as additional resource material to help me prepare when I teach accounting courses at the university level. Because if its special niche and top-notch editing, I would expect this series to last through many more editions."},{"Title":"Financial Accounting (6th Edition) (Prentice Hall Series in Accounting)","review":"I am currently taking an Accounting class with this book and I think it is great.

I live in Iowa, where the author is from and personally know one of her relatives. Read this book and you will be inspired by those who came before us who gave up so much to establish their states. I especially liked Aldrich's discription of prairie life and &quot;the way things were&quot;."},{"Title":"A Lantern in Her Hand","review":"This is not just a story about the frontier. This is a story about life and dreams and what happens when those dreams are deferred. Abbie is an amazing character, bursting with talents and dreams and love. All the hardships she encounters can't get her down. She dreams her dreams into her children, and her grandchildren. So many unforgettable characters!"},{"Title":"A Lantern in Her Hand","review":"I happened upon this book by accident while cleaning out a garage and I am so glad I did. I had heard of the author years ago but didn't try to read any of her books. I'm glad it was A Lantern In Her Hand that I found.I could not put it down; reading till the wee hours of the dark a.m., about falling asleep with it, only to finish it as soon as I could awaken.I found myself in Abbie Deal's story as a wife, mother, and now grandmother, over and over again. What we give up for and what we do for, our children and husbands goes largely unappreciated, but we would do it all over again just as Abbie would. This story speaks to the heart of every wife, mother, and grandmother. It somehow validates what we have done and why.It is an old-fashioned story and not for you unless you appreciate settling the west in covered wagons on a prairie, living off the land, and learning how to 'make do' with what one has at hand."},{"Title":"A Lantern in Her Hand","review":"A pioneer lady travels to Nebraska. This is her story from beginning to end - from living in a \\"Sodie\\" to a nice home. Anyone who is interested in the life of our early pioneers would be interested in this book. It is a peaceful, fulfilling book. No violence or swearing or lewd acts."},{"Title":"A Lantern in Her Hand","review":"I read this book when I was 12 or 13, perhaps younger. I loved this story so much I'm sure I read it a dozen times or more as a kid. And it was so memorable that I've never forgotten it. No longer having my original copy, I ordered it again recently from Amazon so I could re-read it. I was surprised at the negative reviews, but can only conclude that if you read this for the first time as an adult, perhaps the magic isn't quite the same. I think it's sad that someone can't appreciate this story, but I think it was well enough written, and the magic was in the detail and the story. I'm not sure if kids today would appreciate the story line, but in 1960 when I first read it, it obviously made quite an impression on me. I gave the book to my daughter when she was 12 or so, and she loved it as much as I did and has also remembered the story vividly now that she's an adult. I'd still recommend it for young girls in particular, perhaps in the age range of 9 to 13 or so."},{"Title":"A Lantern in Her Hand","review":"For all Mothers that are devoted to their children, as my mother was.

I love all of her books snd wish she had written more."},{"Title":"A Lantern in Her Hand","review":"Just getting young people to read--that is the dilemma sufficient to the moment. Even if it's fad-crazed series like 'Twilight' or 'Harry Potter', reading is reading, which ultimately opens the mind and expands mental horizons. But what a bonus for a teenager (or pre-teen) to pick up a book like Bess Streeter Aldrich's A LANTERN IN HER HAND. I read this book many (many, many) years ago as a young skull full of mush, and to this day the novel still inspires and brings back a plethora of memories.Young Abbie Deal once had dreamed of being a famous artist and singer; instead, she finds herself married to a simple farmer and homesteading the harsh remoteness of Nebraska. It's a brutal, challenging, laborious existence, and Abbie endures the elements and primitive lifestyle, bearing her children along the way. Yet ultimately, Abbie is rewarded, as her many talents and interests are manifested in her children and their children. All the while, the story is presented in Aldrich's poignant and masterful style. It's a wonderful read.A LANTERN IN HER HAND not only can pique a young adult's interest in reading--it also might pay off with the added bonus of generating an interest in our history. And that's quite a win/win. Regardless the reason or incentive to pick up this, or any other book, just read.--D. Mikels, Author, Walk-On"},{"Title":"A Lantern in Her Hand","review":"I ordered this book because it was from a Nebraska author in the state I was born in and wanted to know more about the state. I found an excellent story and have kept the book to read again."},{"Title":"A Lantern in Her Hand","review":"When Abbie Mckenzie was young she dreamed of becoming a lovely lady like her grandmother. She wanted to paint beautiful pictures and become a world famous singer. She even gets a chance to fulfill those dreams when the dashing young doctor hears her singing, falls in love, and offers to take her East and away from Iowa with him. But people's ideals change sometimes. Abbie finds love with poor but steady Will Deal. She gives up everything to move to Nebraska with him. Many obsticals awaited them there but together they made it. Abbie and Will were barely getting by, but their children were as happy as kings. Maybe that's because their lovely mother braught them up &quot;with a song upon her lips and a lantern in her hand&quot;. As Abbie Deal grows old, she realizes that none of her old dreams will ever come true for her but they will through her children. And as an old woman, she can look back on her life with a smile. This book is beautiful and touching and will bring tears to your eyes. I recomend this book because I absolutely loved it every time I read it."},{"Title":"A Lantern in Her Hand","review":"Like some other reviewers, I read this when I was quite young, and the story of Abbie Deal, who crossed the prairie to settle in Nebraska with her beloved husband Will, left a deep and abiding impression in my heart. Many times I have thought of Abbie Deal's story of strength and survival. She reminds me of my grandmother, who faced her own challenges in the early 1900's in the east Texas piney woods. Abbie, with her long slender fingers, shapely figure, her singing and painting talents, was born in the mid 1800's. Falling in love with Will Deal, she left her small town to travel with him to the uncivilized prairie to raise her family while facing weather disasters, insects, isolation, lack of cultural 'food' and the ever-present threat of disease and death. Could I have lived in a sod shanty or had babies with only a gruff German-speaking neighbor as midwife? Could I have kept my sanity while sweeping locusts out the door in great piles? While perhaps not the most elegant or multi-layered author, Bess Streeter Aldrich earns my respect by her straight-forward style, and by creating many of the most lively, memorable characters ever. One of the most poignant themes is how Abbie over time loses her shapley figure, her slender fingers becoming knarled by hard work, her singing and painting disused and forgotten. Yet how those attributes are 're-incarnated' in the following generations is one of the scenes that bring tears to my eyes every time I read it. If a book can be valued by the number of times that it is recalled in the reader's mind as a source of humor, comfort or warm nostalgia, then this book is among my most cherished few. Get this book, read it, love it. Become part of the community of those of us who have taken this work to our hearts."},{"Title":"A Lantern in Her Hand","review":"\\"A Lantern in Her Hand\\" is such a deep story, that I could only handle reading it in small portions. Each and every time, I would close the book with such sadness in my heart. Abbie worked so hard as a mother and a wife, and sacrificed her dreams and wantings, that it made me think of what my parents might have set aside for me. Her children, when grown, bothered me so much, to think their mother old-fashioned and somewhat senile. If only we can have such fond and cherished memories when we live to be in our 80s. I recommend."},{"Title":"A Lantern in Her Hand","review":"This was one of the most heartwarming, touching, most precious stories I've ever read. What I loved most about it(apart from the lovely and poetical way of writing), was how Aldrich wrote the story of Abby's whole life, and not just the romance era like most authors do. I never would have considered that old people are never really old, it's just that they have outgrown what the rest of us are still waiting to grow into; that they once had lives with romance and accomplishments and thing of their own, had I not read this book. Well, anyways, the story goes like this:Abby Mackenzie is eight years old when she moves to a little community with her family, and meets Will Deal. Well, all her young life, Abby has been told the story of her aristocratic father married her peasant mother, putting the rest of the family into peasantry. Her dream is to be like her aristocratic grandmother, Isabel Anders-Mackenzie, who has a portrait which Abby has only seen in her imagination.Well, when Abby grows older, she is courted by the dashing young doctor, Ed Mathews, who proposes while her friend Will is off at war. She thinks that if she marries him, she will have the chance to pursue all the dreams of being a fine lady, especially enriching her lovely singing voice. But, then Will comes home, and Abby marries him, realizing that he was the one she really loved. So, the newly weds pioneer-on-over to Nebraska Territory, where they raise a family.The rest of the story tells of their life on the prairie, and how Abby is able to live her dreams through her children instead of herself. The book goes on until she dies in her eighties. I loved it with all of my heart, and absolutely COULD NOT have imagined a sweeter ending than the one Aldrich gave.

Unfortunately, I forgot the title and the author, so in trying to find it again I had to search through page after page of items on internet search engines. Finally, after searching through four or five hundred entries, I found it. It is the most wonderful story of being a woman and being alive that I have ever come across.

The story always touched me....a beautiful lady, who could have married into wealth and luxury, but instead chose true love. She lived to realize all her dreams through her children. The story never fails to bring tears to my eyes. I can't wait to receive my copy and read it again and again!!!"},{"Title":"A Lantern in Her Hand","review":"Although I won't call Aldrich an American Jane Austen, I doubt that I will ever forget this book. The plot might seem slightly trite and dated when summarized, but the book contains more than a sentimental tale of a poor girl demonstrating true love by marrying a poor boy instead of a rich boy. It is a story of ideals, of human nature, of choices, of consequences, of joy, of disappointment, of the American frontier, of a complete (in both senses of the word) life. I was shocked to find a tear in my eye as I read the last pages of the story--a tear not catalyzed by despair or pity, but rather by some kind of bitter-sweet emotion that is difficult to describe. If I were to see this story on screen, I would like to see it either as a well-treated indie film or as a big-budget, large-scale movie with good cinematography and direction (perhaps ala Spielberg or Titanic sans \\"fluff\\" or The English Patient minus war and unrequited love..."},{"Title":"A Lantern in Her Hand","review":"I get the chills when I read the reviews for this book, because I have felt the same thing as so many of the reviewers.

It makes \\"Little House\\" pale and the characterization of this strong and determined pioneer woman are so vivid, the reader feels every emotion Abby Deal felt as she made a life and raised her children in some difficult but rewarding times. No we no longer live on prairies or travel in covered wagons, but we all make our way in difficult times working to make the best of times. This is a great book for today's young girls as it focuses in on fundamental values that never grow old.

I see each person with potential for greatness. It doesn't matter if the skill is just to make someone smile everyday, that's the power of one person. Bess Street Aldrich overcame much adversity when she lost her husband when her children were very small. Her sensitivity comes across in her books for others who face life struggles and their attempt to making a better life for their family. I recommend this book for all persons.

It tells the story of one woman named Abby Deal, and her life from a young girl to an elderly grandmother. It seems stuck in its time, as Abby acts like an &quot;old fashioned&quot; woman, but I suppose I can't expect differently. The story moves slowly, and it tells of how Nebraska became settled. Typical grandmother-granddaughter subplot where they leave in two different worlds, and typical subplot about another granddaughter who is just like Abby."},{"Title":"A Lantern in Her Hand","review":"This book had been recommended to me, and it seemed like it would be good when I read the introduction, but after three times of starting and trying to finish this book, I decided it just wasn't worth it. It may have some events that are significant and add to the story with the sense that should go along with them, but somehow, this book bored me and seemed very flat and detached from any real feeling. When I was reading it, I couldn't feel the story and could not relate to Abbie, maybe because few of her feelings were aptly expressed in the story. The only thing I could really feel was the inevitable rushing of time and Abbie's fear of death,who snatches people away. It may be a good book to other people, especially those who can stand to finish it, but it just didn't keep my attention, and I can usually tolerate some slowness in a book."},{"Title":"A Lantern in Her Hand","review":"I think that &quot;A lantern in Her Hand&quot; is a very good book. It is a great story about life, and I would love to read it again! I think that Abbie is a very realistic charactor. She is strong, but she has weaknesses, just like everyone does. You can really relate to her!"},{"Title":"A Lantern in Her Hand","review":"This is truly one of the most perfect, touching pieces of literature I have ever read. I wish I could give it 10 stars! Rarely do you read a novel that takes the reader through an entire lifespan of one person and manages to breathe genius into every phase of their life. I found myself crying several times during the book simply because it was SO true! This author seemed to have uncanny insight into the life, and heart, of pioneer woman.This book was written in the 1920's, yet every word still rings true. For god sakes, someone, get this OUT of the \\"young adult\\" category--this novel speaks to every woman, no matter her age."},{"Title":"A Lantern in Her Hand","review":"I picked up this book the other night to read. I read it when I was young, and haven't read it in the past 35 years. I knew immediately as I started to read, that I would appreciate it more now, than as a young girl. There is so much life experience in this book that young adults wouldn't really understand. This is a wonderful book for many reasons. It tells the entire story of Abby's life, it gives a good picture of how Nebraska became settled, but most importantly, it shows how people change as they grow up and age.

(There is even an Aldrich elementary.)While the setting is in the praries of Nebraska, the story is universal of a mother's love for her children and how she finds joy in them and through them. I just bought 4 more copies to give as gifts to moms I admire!"},{"Title":"A Lantern in Her Hand","review":"I read this book many years ago in high school and just found it again in my library.Enjoyed re-reading the story as had forgotten so many details. I didn't find anything about selling and buying back the string of pearls that another reviewer mentioned. Maybe that was left out of the edition I read.It was a very good history of life on the prairies where people survived by working hard and having hope."},{"Title":"A Lantern in Her Hand","review":"A Lantern in Her Hand is a remarkable feat. It is told from the viewpoint of Abbie Deal who through the course of the book matures from an eight-year-old whose family has recently migrated to Iowa into an \\"old lady who dies while the meat burned and the children played \`Run, Sheep, Run\\". Before you begrudge me for spoiling the end, let me reassure that this statement is actually found in Aldrich's introduction. With that opening, who could resist turning the page? For the first few chapters, Aldrich recounts Midwest adventures akin to those in the Little House books: The family fords streams, settles the land, and avoids Indians. After the family builds their home, the children attend school, do chores, and play. While this is all interesting enough, I most enjoyed reading about Abbie's creative pursuits. I also related to how she used every opportunity to dream of being a singer, painter, or writer. Then at the age of eighteen, Abbie faces a decision not uncommon at that time: Should she marry Ed Matthews, who wants to take her to New York for lessons, or Will Deal, who still toils the farm with his parents? Love wins out: Abbie and Will marry. Here's where Abbie's story really begins, for true to pioneer life the family meets very few people and face year after year of crop failure. Underlying A Lantern in Her Hand is a sadness about how time keeps rushing forward, forward, forward, and cannot be stopped. Yet always there is also Abbie Deal's strength of character. Even as she relinquishes her dreams of fame, she continues to have a lantern in her hand and a song in her heart. Aldrich has written a beautiful fictional tribute to the memories of her mother and all the other settlers whom she interviewed about the forging of this state."},{"Title":"A Lantern in Her Hand","review":"The headline is my whole review.

It is all about a girl who gives up some of her big dreams of singing, and instead moves out west with her new husband. She is always thinking about how quickly time flies, and she's right.

The story begins with an old woman telling of her life when she was a little girl up until her husband was thrown from a horse and killed. She tells of a gift her mother gave her, a string of pearls from Ireland, that her husband sold and then bought back many years later. She tells of love and faith and how a family continues to get along even in troubled times.My brother and I both read this book in high school. He did a book report on it.

She also suggested the sequel &quot;A White Bird Flying&quot;, which I read and then commenced to gather as many of Aldrich's books as I could find in print. I find her descriptions of the prairie as vivid and as colorful as I remember from my youth growing up in Iowa. Whenever I'm homesick, I read an Aldrich book.

Instead of her life fulfilling her dreams, however, she spent her days baking bread, piecing quilts, and taking care of children. Her children eventually accomplished the great things Abbie had hoped to do, but they seemed to care little for the life Abbie herself had led. It was a disappointing book for me, but it aptly brought to life the hopes and dreams of a young girl, and how real life prevents her from living her dreams. It did inspire me to analyze my dreams, to see if they are realistic, and to consider whether God might have other plans. Good dreams may need to be exchanged for what is best for us."},{"Title":"A Lantern in Her Hand","review":"I have read this book in eighth grade. I loved this book, and thought is was interesting, fun, and exciting. This book starts when Abbie is around eight years old and ends when she is eighty years old. By reading this book, you can watch her grow up. You will encounter happy, sad, and frustrating times in her life. This book can be easily related to women. Marriage, having babies, and doing the house work. I strongly recommend this book to any young reader."},{"Title":"A Lantern in Her Hand","review":"Personally, had I read this book at a younger age, I probably would have been unable to appreciate it. In this story about Abbie Deal, life is very layered just as life really is. A carefree little girl living in the mid-1800's goes through a life journey of extreme emotional and physical circumstances but her heart of love takes on layer after layer in a format that redeems her own humanity. What might look like insurmountable burdens to the culture of thought today at the reading of this frontier story, in fact was an opportunity to become the best of who Abbie really was.After a very active life at home and survival for 80+ years spanning roughly 1850 to 1930, Abbie is perfectly content with herself much to the chagrin of her own family. Laura, the young granddaughter who alone understands Abbie best, the portrait of her ancestor Isabelle Anders-Mackenzie that is searched for and found near the end of Abbie's life, and Katherine's \\"modern\\" day (1920's) personality that reverts back to the ways of an old-fashioned woman who happens to be her grandmother end this story in a delicate, endearing, soul-grabbing way.The tune that Abbie sang aloud during her many rough times became more and more inspiring as the story presented it yet again in each new layer.\\"Oh, the Lady of the Lea,Fair and young and gay was she,Beautiful exceedingly,The Lady of the Lea.For she had gold and she had land,Everything at her command,The Lady of the Lea.Dreaming visions longingly,The Lady of the Lea.\\"Excellent story.

I was very disappointed. I suffered about 1/3 through, skimmed the rest, then put it in a Goodwill box.

I bought this for my daughter, who is an avid fan of \\"Little House\\" books, yet has grown past them. This book was recommended by a company that I had trusted ONCE before to recommend sound Christian fiction. But I guess that was just one-time \\"luck.\\" The first book I read recommended by this company was one of the best Christian fiction stories I have ever read. This book, \\" A Lantern in Her Hand,\\" --a complete flop. It read like a boring soap opera. I actually told my husband it was like a cheap romance novel without any romance.

The best part of this book is the end!!!"},{"Title":"A Lantern in Her Hand","review":"This is the worst book ever, I cannot stand it. Whoa, I don't care if you can use 700 words to describe a sunset, that dosen't make a book good. Unentertaining garbage."},{"Title":"A Year In The Maine Woods","review":"There is something to be said about a book which remains on my bed stand for six years, and it's not \\"clean off your bed stand\\". In a time of escapism, A YEAR IN THE MAINE WOODS is my drug of choice. Most of Mr. Heinrich's books are delightful, they are always educational, as well as entertaining. The format of short chapters makes them timely for evening in-bed company, and they rarely repeat information, which is rare in most nature chronicles which are organized as month-by-month tomes. I have read this book so many times, that I cannot count them, and although I have read a few of Mr Heinrich's books, this particular one remains in my mind as the most engaging.If there is one fault, it would only be that I wish I had a hardcover with illustrations and fine paper, but beyond that, this book is escapist perfection."},{"Title":"A Year In The Maine Woods","review":"Bernd Heinrich has become more or less an icon over the year as to natural history writing. His work and writing on the life cycle and behavior of Ravens has become classical. This offering, A Year in the Maine Woods is one of my favorites of his work.Heinrich is a world class zoologist, expert ornithologist and an acknowledged expert on environmental issues. For me, reading this particular work was like taking a mini-seminar concerning life in the woods in the state of Maine. Heinrich is not only an expert on his subject, but has the writing ability to articulate and teach; passing bits and pieces of his knowledge on to his readers. I am certainly not a newcomer to the subjects covered by this author, but must confess that I learned much with the reading of this one!Now before I go on there are a couple of things to note. This author is not Thoreau and if you read his work carefully, it quickly becomes apparent that he is not trying to be. Much of this \\"Thoreau talk\\" is merely wishful thinking on the part of some readers. Old Henry was a creature of a different century, was not a trained zoologist or biologist, and was of a more literary philosophical bent. He in no doubt one of my favorite writers, but when I crave a read of Thoreau I will read Thoreau and when I crave the readings of Heinrich, well then, I will read Heinrich. I certainly do not grab a book by Ray Bradbury when I have a hankering for some Emily Bronte. We are talking two different literary animals here. While there are glimmers of Thoreau's attitude in Heinrich's writing, I feel strongly that that was not his intention. Secondly, if the reader is looking for a read filled with quirky, quaint and rustic local characters, then they, the reader, will be disappointed. Suggest you read something like \`The Egg and I.\\" You will get all the quirky local characters you want in that one.As one reviewer has pointed out, this is more or less the year long writings of a man who has sort of \\"dropped out,\\" taken a bit of time off from a very fulfilling life, and more or less isolated himself in a rather primitive cabin in the Northern Woods in Maine. In many ways this is a weekly, or even daily account of his life spent there. The vast majority of this work concerns his observations as a naturalist; the wildlife, trees, flowers, insects, et al, surrounding him throughout the four seasons. There is also a record of his random thought process and little side trips into astronomy, the condition of people in general and his somewhat pragmatic view of the way we are handling our environment in the location he is living. The sketches the author provides, along with the black and white reproductions of his watercolors, are a delight to the eye and enhance the reading of the book.As a couple of reviews here have complained; yes, the author does indeed use quite a number of scientific and technical names (gasp, Latin...how dare he), but for the life of me I cannot figure out how he could describe the various species of flora and fauna he is dealing with without using these terms. If you are uncomfortable with such, then you should probably look elsewhere. I think to receive the full impact of this work, to appreciate each and every aspect of it, then a wee bit of scientific training would be quite helpful and in order.On the other hand, the shear joy in which the author approaches his subjects, his vivid descriptions of the plants and wild life, his description of the weather and his accounts of surviving is a cabin with no electricity, running water or indoor plumbing of any sort, is pure pleasure to read. Now I am not a cold weather person by any stretch of the imagination and feel that anything under 80 degrees is really unlivable, but even I found myself enjoying his description of the climate and how the various critters, including himself, were and are able to cope. His ability to identify hundreds of birds by their call only is more than impressive. I always considered myself pretty good at this, but have to admit my ability is a mere shadow of his and I stand in awe.As I said before, reading this work was like taking a short course in natural history. If nothing else it certainly opens the door for the reader in many areas and certainly should encourage further learning. I know I felt a recharging of my batteries as I read this one and will certainly hit the bush with a different attitude and with even more enthusiasm after having read it.To be quite frank, I did not find one page of this work to be boring and in fact had trouble putting it down after I started it. This one will go on my list of book that I will be rereading in the future...if for no other reason than the inspirational aspect.My wife and I plan a trip soon to this area of the country and I am sure I will be looking at it through different eyes now.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"A Year In The Maine Woods","review":"Bernd Heinrich a Zoology Professor at the University of Vermont has written many books on natural history or what is now called nature writing. This is the first I've read and have enjoyed it immensely. His style is a mixture of deep zoological knowledge of the animals and plants of the Maine woods and the pure love of being a human being who can appreciate and really live the surrounding natural world. This is what is needed by all people if they want to appreciate their world. Its a delightful book but does not possess the intensity of Jack Turner's \\"Abstract Wild\\" or Doug Peacock's Grisly writing. But it doesn't really need it, it is just a man living in the woods for a year through the beautiful summer pestered by black flies and the stunning autumn into a cold winter and the new life of spring. The book is also full of very well drawn animals and plants. The story starts with him driving to his cabin with his pet raven Jack who, being a raven, is independent minded and eventually leaves. Its too bad Jack was truly fascinating. There is much to do including the chopping of wood for the winter, taking care of his apple trees, raven watching to do. Its amazing how beautiful nature is when someone is watching with all his heart and mind. A delightful book."},{"Title":"A Year In The Maine Woods","review":"Heinrich writes about his observations of Maine's animals and plants from winter silences to spring's new growth. It ranges from lyrical descriptions of wild flowers to more than you want to know about decaying carcasses attracting carrion eaters.I enjoyed reading it while parked in an RV in a Maine campground. My little window on the woods was so limited, making me appreciate his insights and trained eye. Sometimes he is philosophical, and at other times mundane (justifying why he doesn't wash his dishes more often)."},{"Title":"A Year In The Maine Woods","review":"I read this book a number of years ago (and have two signed copies!) and I do love it. It is an intimate look at the nature surrounding Dr. Heinrich's cabin in the woods of western Maine. Yes, it's true that he did not live in solitude for a year with no human interaction, but the man did live in an unheated cabin during the Maine winter! Even Thoreau didn't live in complete solitude during his \\"year alone\\"-- he was only a mile and a half from others. This is a thoroughly enjoyable book to read and re-read."},{"Title":"A Year In The Maine Woods","review":"This book combines the author's zest for life and naturewith a keen perception that only a scientist can apply tothe experience of spending a full year alone (with occasionaltrips to town) observing and coping with the vagaries ofnature in the Cooold north woods. Where else can you learn thatflies really hibernate in the nooks and crannies of a logcabin, only to wake at just the wrong times? The sense of humorevident in this well-written journal illustrates just what ittakes to be alone and make the best of it. This is highly-recommendedfor anyone who enjoys nature and musings about the meaning of life."},{"Title":"A Year In The Maine Woods","review":"I read this book while on vacation in the approximate vicinity of the author's cabin. It was a good travel book, in that it gave me an understanding of the nature around me. However, many times the author seemed to get into a &quot;nature-rut&quot; and not know how to get out. Where a page or two of detail would do, Heinrich might go on for three or four. The black and white line drawings were too simple to serve as a guide, and so seemed more of a distraction than anything else. The author also seemed to jump around in time and space, so that a promising story line would just disappear into a fog. While the book started strong with a captivating narrative (travel with Jack, the author's raven), it ended very weakly. It seemed that Heinrich's year (of the title) was up, so he just stopped the book."},{"Title":"A Year In The Maine Woods","review":"Bernd Heinrich is the master of the study of ravens and crows.

Read this book!"},{"Title":"A Year In The Maine Woods","review":"I grew up loving the woods of Southern New England and thus felt right at home with the author in his Maine woods. It is a light, somewhat disorganized read that for me was very relaxing. He is obviously very knowledgeable of the plants and animals present in his woods. These are not that different than the woods of my youth. But, I felt that it might not be as enjoyable a read for those that had not spent a fair amount of time learning about the plants and animals of the northeastern U.S."},{"Title":"A Year In The Maine Woods","review":"A Year in the Maine WoodsTransport yourself into the natural world and be guided by an expert who writes with acute observation.

He is one of my favorite authors."},{"Title":"A Year In The Maine Woods","review":"Heinrich obviously wants us to think of him as the modern Thoreau, but his thoughts are far shallower and less interesting. Furthermore Thoreau saw no need to ostentatiously parade his specialized knowledge before his readers, as Heinrich does. The specifying of 6 different kinds of warbler calls heard on a particular morning does not add to the atmosphere or enjoyment for almost anyone - but it DOES impress you with how much Heinrich knows about bird calls. Much of the book is in the same vein - paragraph after paragraph written not to instruct or entertain, but to impress. There are better choices out there by writers who are more impressed with their surroundings and less impressed with themselves."},{"Title":"A Year In The Maine Woods","review":"This is a diary written by a biologist familiar with the names of trees, insects, birds, leaf types, etc. If the reader is also familiar with these terms, the book might be of interest. For me, it was a bunch of terms that I wasn't familiar with, and nothing in the writing made me want to look them up.Why was the author in the Maine woods for a year? The reader is not told until half way through the book. Nothing happens except changes in weather, seasons, and migrations. Even when the author shows enthusiam about something, the reader is not brought in on the excitement, so the overall impression for me was, &quot;So what?&quot;"},{"Title":"A Year In The Maine Woods","review":"To appreciate Bernd Heinrich, you have to be prepared to slow down and look close. After all, the author himself has taken a year's leave of absence from a fast-paced university job to do just that. He wants to spend time in his beloved woods, study the creatures that live there and see where long rambles will take him. It not the sort of book to begin with an agenda in mind.That said, I found A Year in the Maine Woods a quixotic mix of science and human exploits - a glimpse at the lives of a whole host of insects, birds, mammals and plant life I never knew existed, and a chance to share in one person's approach to learning.Examples? Let's take Heinrich's penchant for climbing trees. For a full-grown, adult male he really does spend a lot of time in them, and as a result has some interesting stories to tell. There's the day he finds himself scrambling up a tree to avoid a moose who refuses to yield the right of way on a trail, and the time a doe wanders under the apple tree he is sitting in and proceeds to munch away. No amount of noise or movement on Heinrich's part seems to disturb her until he descends from the tree. Then she's off like a shot!Here's another example. Heinrich loves ravens. He is fascinated by their intelligence, close-knit family systems, their flying ability and survival skills, and is not above combing the countryside for roadkill in order to provide food for them. Heinrich's exploits with a pet raven are both hilarious and revealing. Here is a man who delights in life itself and is willing to put up with a fair amount of discomfort and irritation to learn about it.If you enjoy learning about special places on our planet, and the creatures that inhabit them, through the eyes of those who have studied and know them intimately, then this book will delight you. If, on the other hand you like your reading to be full of fast-paced action and spine-tingling climaxes, this is not the book for you. Be prepared to read slowly and savor the pictures Heinrich offers."},{"Title":"A Year In The Maine Woods","review":"Not planning to review this book, I changed my mind after perusing the reviews for \\"A Year in the Maine Woods.\\" Most of them are by people who miss the point of his book (and, dare I say, life) entirely.Yes, Bernd is foremost a Zoologist, and so does get a bit technical at times, but his over-whelming love of nature--and the sense that he's just a good guy doing what many of us are afraid to do (i.e. kick in our TeeVees and &quot;get back to nature&quot;)--is enough for my vote.In addition to the natural science found in these pages, I very much enjoyed his mundane, day-to-day observations (every time he made coffee or drank a beer, I inwardly smiled). He mixes his love for the woods with a few 21st-century earthly pleasures, as well he should. Of course he's no Thoreau, and I don't think he is in anyway trying to be. Still, he's a damn-sight closer to Nature and the ideas and mind of H.D.T than most.Truly a pleasurable read. Thanks, Bernd."},{"Title":"A Year In The Maine Woods","review":"This is the second book by Heinrich that I have read. The first, Ravens in Winter, I found very enjoyable. (see review)Based on the title and a review written on the book's back cover, I expected the book to be about Heinrich's year alone, except for his pet raven, Jack. With this in mind I thought we'd learn about his discoveries in nature and also his understanding into his own thoughts as he pondered life in seclusion.This was not a book about living in the wild woods of Maine in seclusion. Heinrich often went into town and ate, met with neighbors, had family visit, and at one point he had a number of students over for a couple of weeks. Was this bad...no, but not what I expected based on the review on his book's back cover.Heinrich has a gift in sharing information about nature. His curiosity and excitement for the natural world is contagious. In this respect I wasn't let down. He did go on quite a bit about the various things he noticed, sometimes sharing too much information, but I would just skip the paragraph and move on.I think what appeals to me most are the times he is in seclusion and reflects on nature and his own life. He endures an amazing amount of cold...below zero, doesn't have running water, and the inside temperature in his cabin dips down below freezing on several occasions. I would enjoy many of the aspects of living in the location he speaks of but I would do it with a few extras...insulation in the walls, and electricity are two that come to mind!Overall I did enjoy the book and I hope you do too!"},{"Title":"A Year In The Maine Woods","review":"We just took a vacation to Maine, in the same area the author stays for a year. It was great to see the descriptions of the countryside over the 4 seasons - not just the one that we saw. The author clearly describes nature and the intricate workings and interactions of all the plants and animals - especially insects and ravens. I felt sad that he saw so much so clearly, but did not (I am guessing) see God's hand in the creation of the finely tuned machine of nature. I never thought of lumbering as an environmental tool, so that was interesting. Loved the drawings of the plants and insects. Next walk I take will be a longer, more conscious one, thanks to this book."},{"Title":"A Year In The Maine Woods","review":"Like Aldo Leopold's &quot;Sand County Almanac&quot;,Heinrich has written a book that I find myself going back to with each changing season. His descriptions are those of an experienced naturalist who finds immense pleasure in the diversity and detail of nature. I especially enjoyed the many passages on bird song and his observations of the myriad colours and patterns in Red Maples in the fall. To fully appreciate this book, however, the reader needs to be knowledgeable about natural history. Whereas some other reviewers have said that they found the long passages about a particular plant or animal tiresome, these were the parts of the book that I enjoyed the most."},{"Title":"A Year In The Maine Woods","review":"I've read several of Heinrich's books and have never been disappointed. Some reviewers compare him to Thoreau, favorably or not. While in certain places he does evoke thoughts of Thoreau, that is not what he is trying to do, contrary to what some reviewers seem to think.As a word-class biologist and naturalist, Heinrich approaches his story of life in the Maine woods from two vantage points. First, as a scientist/naturalist, and then as a long-time resident of the area of Maine he calls home. The two themes are interwoven with a seasonal view of life in his cabin.Unlike Thoreau, who was an amateur nineteenth century naturalist and literary philosopher, Heinrich has the advantage of being both a keen observer and a trained scientist, albeit one who grew up surrounded by nature before receiving his academic research training as a physiological ecologist. While some might find the detail he presents in places to be too much, those who really wish to learn about combining the powers of observation with scientific insights will be richly rewarded.I must take exception to the reviewer who termed this book an \\"ego trip\\".Heinrich is hardly parading his vast scientific knowledge for the sake of seeming erudite. The man has garnered numerous scientific and literary kudos, for both his research and nature writing, so I suspect he hardly needs to engage in an \\"ego trip\\" by trying to ape Thoreau. In fact, given his vast knowledge of biology, I would say that he strikes a good balance between telling a personal story and presenting scientific facts and insights in the context of his experience.Having spent a few years in the area of Maine that Heinrich loves and writes about so well, I think that he does a wonderful job capturing both the nature and the lifestyle of rural Maine. If you are the type of person who enjoys taking walks in company of expertise, you will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"A Year In The Maine Woods","review":"Bernd Heinrich does a spectacular job of compliling his experiences of spending a year in the Maine woods into a book.This professor shows you in his journal how he explores the woods of Maine around his cabin, which is not equipped with running water or electricity.Mr. Heinrich mentions everything from the pet raven he partly-raised to his encounter with a majestic moose that crossed his path. Other birds, insects, plants and animals that he finds on his daily walks through the remote and beautiful Maine woods are also widely mentioned. He clearly describes the flute-like song of the Hermit Thrush, the chirping of the crickets, the eerie howling of the coyotes, and much, much more.This book is interesting and easy-to-read for nature lovers and casual observers alike who enjoy serene nature with a touch of civilization here and there.I recommend this book and hope that Mr. Heinrich will come out with another book as good as this one soon!"},{"Title":"A Year In The Maine Woods","review":"A must for any outdoor and simple living buff who have forgotten that the simple life does not also mean the easy life.

I grew tired of the non-stop dissertations on plant and animal life. The best parts of the book are when the author is interacting with his own species, but even those stories seemed to go nowhere. I wonder though, if the author became more eccentric after his year in the woods, or if he started out that way."},{"Title":"A Year In The Maine Woods","review":"I had bought this book back around 2007-2008 when my husband and I made our first two visits to Maine for vacation. We've since visited twice more, including this past week. Though I read dribs and drabs over the years, it finally caught my imagination, and I've read through almost all of it now. I enjoyed it a great deal- it speaks of slowing down, observing details, and appreciating the sense of accomplishment of thriving in a sometimes harsh environment. As for the content, it reads very much as a personal journal, and as another reviewer mentioned, you need to be willing to slow down and savor the details."},{"Title":"Emotion-Focused Therapy: Coaching Clients to Work Through Their Feelings","review":"I learned about Leslie Greenberg in graduate school from someone who studied with him for a week in Canada.

Now I have many of Leslie Greenberg's profound thoughts here in my hands.A great thing about this book is that I can recommend it to my friends who have not studied psychology or pscyotherapy and they have access to the material for themselves and those that they teach. The great thing about this book is that it can be used in many different arenas. Certainly therapy, but also in your own relationships (marriages, parents &amp; children) and in situations where you may want to teach about emotion (work, church, school, etc).

It details the attempts of the more radical Republican members of Congress to prevent most white Southerners from exercising their right to vote. By denying this right to the whites, these men expected to use the votes of the Southern blacks, along with Federal troops, to control the South, dominate Congress, and control the destiny of the nation. Their repeated attempts to do this are detailed in this book, as is their attempt to remove a President from office, simply because he disapproved of and would not support their plan. We read of the blacks who favored the Democrats, and of the native whites who sided with the radicals, seeing through them a way to personal power. This struggle, which began even as influential Southern whites were supporting the voting rights of blacks, ended with a desire on the part of most Southern whites to remove the possiblity of such struggles ever again convulsing their part of the nation, by effectively preventing most blacks from ever voting again. This book will be fascinating reading, whether you are a history buff, someone who is interested in politics, or just anyone who wants to read an entralling, riveting account of our nation's past."},{"Title":"The story of reconstruction,","review":"Number of pages and Date: (Very Large Heavy Book) - 633 Pages.

Henry was born in 1889 and this book was written at a time when many of those who lived during Reconstruction were still alive. He graduated from Vanderbilt in 1911 (A.B. and LL.B) and did post graduate work at Queens College in Cambridge, England and has written several histories of the Civil War and several more on the history of the railroads in the US.In the year immediately after the war's end, most people of the South were concerned primarily with getting a crop in the ground, rebuilding and just staying alive. The reports from the Freeman's Bureau for this year were promising. But there were those in the Radical wing of the Republican Party, who for reasons of greed, self-righteousness and a desire to make the ascendancy of the Republican Party permanent, sought to plunder, control and punish the breakaway states. Henry tells the story of this group and the harm they did the country in general and the South in particular and how they managed to achieve it. Had Lincoln lived, it would have never happened."},{"Title":"The story of reconstruction,","review":"Henry's account of reconstruction is an old one (originally published in 1938) and generally disregarded by historians today. He largely draws his material from conservative Northern and reactionary Southern newspapers, manuscript collections, and diaries. He doesn't consult the vast Freedman's Bureau or Military Department archives and, typical of the old Southern 'Bourbon' school, he slanders and maligns whatever non-conservative sources he does consult. Eric Foner'sReconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863-1877(published in 1988, still considered THE account) of the period is much better, but if you're looking for an account from the early 20th century, W.E.B. Du Bois'Black Reconstruction in America, 1860-1880is great.No serious historian could cite this book without be laughed out of academia, and anyone who reads this in order to learn about Reconstruction (rather than merely compare historiography of the period) will be greatly misinformed. I was tempted to give the book another star or two and blame the scholarship of the era, but considering people like Du Bois and James Allen were able to write acceptable accounts in the 1930's, there's no reason to go easy on Henry.Full disclosure: I have taken Eric Foner's class on the Civil War and Reconstruction, so perhaps I am biased towards his account. In any case, specialists on the topic still defer to him."},{"Title":"Gangs in America","review":"This edited volume provides a balanced approach to gangs that includes defining and measuring gang participation in several urban settings.

Douglas","review":"This book is trying to get the big picture, and William O. Douglas climbing mountains is one of its dramatic themes. The most interesting part of the book for me was how much trouble Justice Douglas could create for the rest of the U. S. Supreme Court and those who believe that law ought to conform to their ideal of an orderly administration of justice. In the middle of June, 1953, Justice Douglas issued a stay of execution for Ethel and Julius Rosenberg, thinking, \\"The Rosenbergs' indictment, trial and sentence had been under the wrong law, the Espionage Act of 1917. ... And under the Atomic Energy Act, a judge could impose the death penalty only on the recommendation of the jury and only with a showing that the offense had been committed with intent to injure the United States.\\" (p. 306). Then \\"Justice Douglas left Washington and headed west by car, thinking that his stay would remain in effect until the full Court could hear arguments during the fall term.\\" (p. 307). Justice Robert Jackson \\"suggested that his stay was an attempt to play to his liberal constituency with a popular solo performance.\\" (p. 299). Justice Jackson's law clerk, William H. Rehnquist had written a three-page memorandum in which the political context was considered:... the public opinion which has voiced itself in favor of the Rosenbergs is not even properly called \`left-wing' in the sense that the respectable liberal group in this country is behind it. It is a tiny minority of lunatic fringers and erratic scientist-sentimentalists. (p. 303).Justice Jackson was willing to hear the Rosenberg case so \\"the Court would save itself embarrassment and put to rest any doubts about the fairness of the Rosenberg trial\\" (p. 303) when Douglas had threatened to issue a memorandum \\"agreeing with the Court of Appeals that some of the conduct on the United States Attorney was \`wholly reprehensible',\\" (p. 302) but Douglas wasn't willing to act in the case until he found some reason to believe that the Rosenbergs might be able to win. On June 19, \\"When it was clear that a Court majority would not uphold the stay under any conditions, Justice Burton cast his vote with the majority, making the vote six to three.\\" (p. 310). The Court's decision was, \\"The Atomic Energy Act did not repeal or limit the provisions of the Espionage Act. Accordingly, we vacate the stay entered by Mr. Justice Douglas on June 17, 1953.\\" June 19 must have been a Friday, because \\"Out of respect for the Jewish Sabbath, the scheduled execution of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg on the evening of June 19 was moved up from the original 11:00 p.m. time\\" so it was all over by 8:16 p.m. (p. 311). Justices Black, Frankfurter and Douglas wrote dissenting opinions which \\"made a shambles of the majority's easy conclusions.\\" (p. 311). That should be pretty easy to do, for anyone who was born with a brain and isn't afraid to be considered one of the lunatic fringers."},{"Title":"Independent journey: The life of William O. Douglas","review":"William O. Douglas stands out as a most remarkable person. The son of a Presbyterian minister, he grew up in tragic circumstances, contracting polio as a child and losing his father at the age of six. Yet with the support of his mother - who maintained strict standards for young William and his siblings - Douglas excelled academically. After working his way through Whitman College, Douglas traveled east to attend Columbia Law School. From there his rise was meteoric - partner at a prestigious Wall Street law firm, then a leading law-school professor before joining the Securities and Exchange Commission during the New Deal. Douglas's ascent in government was no less meteoric, from becoming head of the SEC at the age of 37 to his appointment to the Supreme Court three years later, where he subsequently became the longest-serving justice in the nation's history.Yet Douglas remains a puzzle. Though Douglas wrote three volumes of autobiography, he made considerable use of \\"writer's license\\" in exaggerating many of the details of his life. The challenge that James Simon faced as the justice's biographer was to sift the myth from the reality and discover the \\"real\\" Douglas, a task hampered by the fact that he wrote the book before the Douglas papers in the Library of Congress were opened to researchers. In spite of this, Simon does a good job of culling many of the facts of Douglas's life from the legends he constructed. His effort to use these facts to understand the man behind them, though, is less successful. All too often his subject remains inscrutably Sphinx-like, and while Simon's explanations of the justice's activities (most notably his extraordinary handling of the Rosenberg spy case) are plausible, they remain little more than viable theories with little way of proving them.This is especially apparent in Simon's analysis of Douglas' jurisprudence. During Douglas' extensive tenure on the Court he emerged as a staunch libertarian and one of the most liberal justices ever to occupy the bench. Yet he failed to articulate a coherent judicial philosophy in his opinions, which were often criticized for failing to marshal the legal details to support his arguments. Simon's attempts to systematize Douglas' opinions into a coherent philosophy are admirable and his analysis is interesting, but the effort primarily succeeds in underlining the challenges in assessing Douglas' legacy in American law.In spite of these difficulties, Simon has written a good, readable biography of Douglas. His research - which included interviews with Douglas, his family, his clerks, and others - is first-rate, and he assembles an interesting portrait that gives the reader a real sense of who Douglas was as a person. While his coverage of Douglas' work on the Court is somewhat episodic, his focus on Douglas's broader life brings into sharper focus one of the more important figures in twentieth century American history and helps us to understand better the legacy of this extraordinarily complicated man."},{"Title":"Reshaping the World for the 21st Century: Society and Growth","review":"Reshaping the World for the 21st Century evaluates post-World War II economic development efforts in the United States, in Canada, and, in Brazil, and in Mexico. It argues that the proposal that the more fortunate countries should bring prosperity to the less developed ones failed: it did not stop the growth of poverty, did not protect the environment sufficiently, and did not promote human rights energetically.Smith begins with a presentation of the two chief development theories pursued after World War II, that is, the growth oriented, market driven model, and the communist ideology. She then chronicles the rise of dependency theory, a newer, 1960s based development perspective that was focused on the needs of less developed third world countries. Based on personal accounts of daily life in the megacities Sao Paulo and Mexico City, and on a review of other development analysts' conclusions, Smith evaluates the failures in Brazil and Mexico--the transportation fiascos spawned, the housing situation--and wonders how it could be that the most advanced industrial powers just didn't see that the poverty suffered by most people in Latin American countries was worsening even during the 1960s and 1970s, an era of relative prosperity."},{"Title":"Reshaping the World for the 21st Century: Society and Growth","review":"Combines thorough analysis with a stylistic flair and self-deprecating humour"},{"Title":"THE ENCYCLOPAEDIC DICTIONARY OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE","review":"A must for researchers in quaternary geology, physical geography, and the like.

The story tells of sixteen year old Emma Truckey, left behind with her mother and siblings to tend the lighthouse in Marquette, Michigan on Lake Superior during the Civil War, while her father, Nelson Truckey goes off to fight in the Michigan 27th.Emma's internal journey begins as one of self-doubt, but when her mother must travel to Canada to care for her sick sister, Emma, as the oldest child, finds that the responsibility of keeping the light and watching over her siblings fall upon her shoulders. With the help of her siblings, and her new friend, Bobby, Emma discovers the strength and inner resources she has always had. Bobby is a charming, fun friend who is able to help Emma discover her own value. Bobby dresses like a boy and is not afraid to step in and help out where needed. She is especially Emma's strength the night of a shipwreck when the two of them must go out in a rowboat to rescue the only survivor.The plot thickens with the rescue of the shipwreck survivor. Emma quickly discovers he is some sort of spy, but she does not know if he is a spy for the Union or the Confederacy. The result is a mission she must go on to help protect the Union. Her adventures ultimately lead to her growth and her reliance upon herself as her own best friend.I wanted to read \\"Finding My Light\\" because I am a native of Marquette, Michigan where the book is set. I am also an author who writes about the Marquette area so I was curious to see how a fellow author treated the same region. However, most of all I was interested in \\"Finding My Light\\" because the Truckeys in the novel are the author's actual ancestors, although she did fictionalize parts of the story--author's license of course. My own great-great-grandfather served in the Michigan 27th with Nelson Truckey, so I was ready to learn plenty about the time period of my ancestors. While the book captures the historical time-period and the feel of early Marquette as a small community, I was primarily impressed with the strong character development in Emma, who truly does find her own light during the book. The revelation she has at the end is one that will resonate with readers, especially young adults who are learning their own self-value as they move into adulthood.While I will not give away the ending, I know the author is planning a second book related to this one which includes a female disguised as a boy joining the Michigan 27th. I am already impatient to read it.I rank this book up there with \\"Dandelion Cottage\\" and \\"Granite Harbor\\" as one of the best young adult books produced about the Marquette area, and no doubt, the book has universal appeal to readers despite time period, location, and gender. I congratulate Chris Shanley Dillman for writing what I hope will become a classic.- Tyler R. Tichelaar, author of \\"Iron Pioneers, The Marquette Trilogy: Book One\\" available on Amazon"},{"Title":"Finding My Light","review":"What a delightful book with a unique concept. Having formerly lived at the beach and being a person who likes all things \\"beachy,\\" I couldn't wait to read this story of young Emma \\"coming of age\\" under the watchful eye of her mother who is a lighthouse keeper ... of all interesting, unusual occupations.The action happening during Civil War days was another drawing point for me.I think this is a sensitive portrayal of young Emma, and I enjoyed it immensely.I look forward to reading more by this author."},{"Title":"Finding My Light","review":"Once I started reading this book, I couldn't put it down. Author Chris Shanley Dillman's historical fiction novel based on a true story involving her ancestors was a great read! The story centers on 16-year-old Emma Truckey, the daughter of the Lighthouse Keeper responsible for the Marquette Lighthouse in Marquette, located on the shores of Lake Superior in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. The year is 1863, and the Civil War is raging on. Emma's father was called to serve for the Union, and the care of the lighthouse was left to Emma's mother, Anastasia, known by the local Native Americans as \\"Mother of the Light\\". Like in all wars, when the men left for duty, the women assumed the jobs that men would normally do, and they did it well. When the war was over, however, almost all the women lost their jobs in favor of the returning soldiers. This isn't in the story, but Emma's father returns with a musketball in his leg and is able to resume taking care of the lighthouse.When Anastasia leaves to take care of her ailing sister in Canada, it is up to Emma and her siblings to fend for themselves and run the lighthouse in her absence. During a bad storm, a ship crashed on the rocks due to the fury of Lake Superior, and Emma and her good friend, Bobby, row out to rescue any survivors. One man, Alex, did survive. When Emma goes to dry out the items in Alex's satchel, she discovers a secret that puts her entire family in jeopardy!Besides the fascinating backdrop of the historical portion of this novel, this story is also all about Emma's epic struggle with herself. She has no self-esteem, thinks she's ugly and a klutz, and has no idea what others really think of her. Her new friend, Bobby, is a girl that flaunts convention and dresses as a boy. Emma is awed by Bobby's confidence in herself. Throughout the story, Bobby makes inroads into helping Emma see what a valuable and loveable person she really is. This is a must-read for any age group over 12 to learn something about history, running a lighthouse, and finding one's way through life and becoming a confident person. A thoroughly enjoyable book! Perhaps because she was writing about her relatives, or perhaps it is just because Chris is an excellent writer, I found Emma's \\"voice\\" in this book coming through loud and clear. Great job, Chris! Your relatives must be looking down on you quite proudly, I'd say!"},{"Title":"Rimas, Leyendas y Narraciones","review":"Since I was a little girl B&eacute;cquer has always been my favourite writer. His were the first poems I read and whose feelings I really shared. They are simple, sincere, intimate rhymes, influenced by the Romantic German poet Heine. They deal with love, passion, despair and the very essence of poetry in a melancholic way.Yet what I love the most from B&eacute;cquer are his Narratives. They are a collection of Spanish legends beautifully told. You can find amongst them deadly wraiths, extrange weredeer, marble statues that can come into life, ruins, bewitching green-eyed ondines, damned souls, devilish creatures, evocations of medieval Spanish towns and forests and a poet in love with a moonbeam who might well be B&eacute;cquer himself. His prose is both poetic and compelling and can easily move in a wide range of stories, from Romantic weird infatuations from horror, from medieval times to untemporal events.I only regret that there are so few translations of B&eacute;cquer's works into English... He is a most loved writer in Spain. His verses are the first to be read and appreciated by teenagers who usually feel reluctant to read poetry.

None stands out because all are engulfed, crushed and swallowed by the voracious monster who is the main, if not the only real, character in the novel: the City itself, with its glaring lights, its stifling smells, its deafening sounds, its never-ending pulsating pace.In a style that revolutionized the art of writing by basing itself on the techniques of the movies, (short and brisk dialogues, no transitions, descriptions bursting in violent flashes), the writer managed to paint a dizzying mosaic of a city that, after ninety years, has not changed that much: the buildings may be taller, the cabs may be faster, but the people are the same, human, so human..."},{"Title":"Manhattan Transfer","review":"John Dos Passos (1896-1970) has tried to compose an artwork built of the stuff: NEW YORK, - and it works like a movie script - but written in a time (1925), in which the film industry did not yet have the tremendous technical and financially possibilities available as they owe today.Dos Passos portrayed the movement, the speed, the unstoppable energy of this city. The title \\"MANHATTAN TRANSFER\\" deciphered in the scene as ELLEN sits in a subway and the rhythmic strides seem to sound like \\"MAN-Hattan TRANS__FER. MAN-Hattan TRANS__FER. MAN-Hattan TRANS__FER\\".ELLEN is on the way in an unhappy partnership, it does not succeed in time to redirect, like a leaf in the wind seems to be the tempo of the city. They are simply unstoppable followers of that tempo. This is also what Dos Passos as the most impressive overall wants to feature.The fates of many are developing a high tempo - and apparently randomly, BUD, (at the beginning of the novel incoming in the New York harbor) jumps to the end of his life (and the novel) at the same place from the bridge into the water -- no into a wedding party, just because a ship below him was passing in the same moment. Fortune and misfortune, random-like are mixed in this scene: happy wedding couple and a man, trying to commit suicide.The milk man Gus McNiel is covered by an insurance payment to him as a victim of a rich man and self-conscious politicians, Congo Jack loses at first one leg during the war, but by extensive smuggling operations and continues he at least drives jovially in a Rolls-Royce.Jimmy Herfst, butler of Congo Jack, is leaving at the end of the novel disillusioned with the city - others have adapted it. Dos Passos has characterized NEW YORK as normally painters do - of course using other techniques: Piet Mondrian painted at the end of his life against that colorful Big Apple chaos with stripes looking like a city-map of New York. The contemporary artist James Rizzi paints skyscrapers with human faces (Dos Passos compares in his novel the multi-ballet dancer ELLEN with multi-window skyscraper).Television series like \\"SEX IN THE CITY\\" or musical events, like Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel performed in the Central Park, singing \\"NEW YORK, to that tall skyline I come, flyin in ... \\" - All those artworks try to explain NEW YORK as a focal point of modern life - and they do not focus the images of September eleven. I hope I will experience in my lifetime, that MANHATTAN TRANSFER once is a movie.John Dos Passos himself (sometimes compared with James Joyce or Marcel Proust or compared with Hemingway and Gertrude Stein who were friends) - he has after the completion of his novel managed to organize a movie: 1935, \\"Devil Is a Woman\\" (The Spanish Dancer ) - With Marlene Dietrich ..."},{"Title":"Manhattan Transfer","review":"Too plodding to recommend, but Dos Passos' style is interesting.

The one character, Stan Emery, who questions this overwhelming concern, claiming that \\"I'll like to meet somebody who wanted to fail. That's the only sublime thing,\\" does not quite survive the chaos he makes out of his life, while survivors either change like a chameleon to adapt, like Ellen, who becomes Elaine and then Helena, at different stages of her life, or opt out of the city entirely, like what Jimmy Herf does.In an urban, cosmopolitan city, where anonymity is the new norm for the waves of immigrants from their rural communities, modes of social relationships also become more distant. There is a sense of spectacle when one witnesses an act of arson by a \\"firebug\\". The reader follows the camera eye of the narrative as it scans the crowds and views the whole catastrophe from a position first from a higher and more distant position, and then as one in the crowd, but never getting close enough to feel the heat."},{"Title":"Manhattan Transfer","review":"Dos Pasos is first of all a poet and it shows in the language.

Eventually characters from some of the vingettes come together and a story line emerges but it is sometimes difficult to follow. Just sit back and enjoy the visual pictures."},{"Title":"Manhattan Transfer","review":". . . that's very dated today. Dos Passos was admired for his impressionistic writing in the 1930s, but he's weak on character development and that's at the center of contemporary fiction."},{"Title":"Manhattan Transfer","review":"At the risk of pointing out the obvious, none of the featured reviewers on Amazon's page for this novel mention the seemingly most obvious point about Dos Passos' style, which is that it's heavily influenced by Jazz rhythms and structures in its cutting between different characters and different points in time to flesh out and vary basic themes. The occasional interruptions by random characters echo the way a soloist seizes on elements or variations of a musical phrase to lend depth and context to an entire piece.I realize this is all pretty pedestrian: after all, it's New York in the mid-20s, duh. However, some of the reviewers make the novel sound almost like proto nouveau-roman, which seems to me to be both little unfair, and also to make the novel sound a lot more confusing and difficult than it actually is.In fact, I think an ordinary modern reader consciously or subconsciously familiar with musical and cinematic structures and techniques will have no great trouble understanding what Dos Passos is doing."},{"Title":"Manhattan Transfer","review":"The power of this book is only a fraction less than that of Dos Passos' USA Trilogy. Manhattan Transfer is a lesser-known epic, an intermingling of separate and not-so-separate lives during Jazz Age America. Different people weave in and out of each others' existences, and as readers, it is our job to travel vicariously with them. The end result, as with Dos Passos' other great works, is a massive, verbal slap in the face. We are faced with undying social issues, colossal questions, and the vague aching end-of-book feeling of How Could This Be the End. Because Dos Passos, with his perfect imagery and word usage, draws us into his books and brings so close to his characters that we feel we could reach out and touch them.Manhattan Transfer is a beautiful example of American Fiction, and John Dos Passos ought to make patriots proud and a little bit ashamed of ourselves. That, in my opinion, is the hallmark of a great nation-oriented writer."},{"Title":"Manhattan Transfer","review":"Let me first say that Dos Passos is a great author and his ability to write so many different characters is an incredible talent that I'm sure many authors wish they could emulate. That being said, with this novel being as brief as it is, some of the voices get lost in the shuffle. I think that the city vs. humanity motif is a great one and relevant in our bustling and merciless world of today, but I wonder if the story would have been more poignant through a single set of eyes, or at least a central character in the third person narrative.I'll give Dos Passos credit for being prophetic. I lived in NYC for the last couple of years while I was seeing someone who lived there. It is a world unto itself and many of the chapters concerning the vampire-like quality of Manhattan are spot on. But again, there were many occasions where I began to enjoy a single narrative, like George the attorney, only to have it vanish for twenty pages. I guess it is an acquired taste. From a technical standpoint it is definitely executed well. I am always wowed by authors who can mimic so many different voices and have it feel authentic. But I have to stick to my guns and say that there were just too many."},{"Title":"Manhattan Transfer","review":"'Manhattan Transfer' is certainly a curious read. It contains dozens of interwoven threads of people living in New York during World War I. Many of these threads are utterly forgettable, some are quite interesting. What makes 'Manhattan Transfer' so interesting is the narrative (..Dos Passos really captures the vernacular of locals) and the historical perspective; New York of 1918 is much different than it is today. So while certainly not for everyone, 'Manhattan Transfer' is a worthy diversion for those tired of fiction found on supermarket shelves.Bottom line: less ambitious than his more famous 'USA Trilogy', Dos Passos is in fine form with his earlier work 'Manhattan Transfer'. Recommended."},{"Title":"Manhattan Transfer","review":"There are novels that are about New York City and there are novels that live in New York City. This is one of the latter. It squats in the gutters of it the same way that the bums do when they're hunched down to avoid catching too much of the chill winds that blow through the canyons caused by the skyscrapers that loom overhead. It circles high above, in those very skyscrapers, where people smoke expensive cigars and make expensive plans on what to do to make even more money than they already have. It flutters through the days of history, as people fight their way through crowds of people and the smothering clustering sense that being in the center of the world isn't the best thing if the place is so dense you can't even catch your breath. The City requires big lungs and high stamina and if you're not built for it, the place will wear you down, bit by bit, until all you can do is stagger away for a town that that may more liveable but won't be quite the same. But there's no place like Manhattan. Anywhere. Ever.I've had a long, strange, weird affair with this book. I got into Dos Passos almost thirteen years ago, as a kid getting out of high school and looking for literature to discover. His cross-sections point of view and especially his experimental sense of HOW to tell a story led to me to \\"The USA Trilogy\\", one of the best snapshots of a certain \\"feel\\" this country had, at a certain point in time, hitched to a structure that made you think anything was possible.But even back then I knew about this, the earlier novel, the forerunner and the testing ground for what would become that later, more expansive trilogy. I only got around to buying it a few years later (many years later, probably, due to it being out of print briefly) and reading it just now. And in a sense, I don't think I would have been ready for it. \\"USA Trilogy\\", for all of its many, many merits, was planned and assured, the mark of someone who had perfected a style and was using it with a master's eye, to the best of his ability. That's not the case here. Here all the techniques that so defined that trilogy seem new, and not just to us, but to Dos Passos as well, so that all the experimentation and innovation of those three books has been compressed into four hundred pages, an entire country shoved into the borders of the biggest city on earth, which is perhaps fitting.The characters seem to feel it too, even if can't quite put a finger on it, shuffling and darting as their plots connect or barely miss each other, or seem to happen in different worlds. There's a creeping sense of desperation in their lives, the sense that they're slowly becoming aware that they're stepped into the middle of a storm they thought they could control, and it turns out they can't and now they're discovering that it's killing them. The story moves to the city's pulse and its rhythms, with a freewheeling quality that would turn into a more calculated eye. Here the news reports are thrown into the beginning of each chapter as a sort of feedback burst, giving you intense bits of information that aren't meaning so much as words to set the feel. The texture of a city rolling over you. Narratives drop into stream of consciousness without warning, the words dancing into new rhythms as peoples' thoughts race ahead and they try to keep up with them, as they attempt to keep up with a century rapidly spiralling out of their grasp. Sentences push against the page, still maintaining their normal structures but still straining against them, wanting to form new strictures and structures. It's all congealing but won't reach its final form here.It's not a typical novel in the sense that we follow a conventional narrative. The various stories don't dovetail into one whole, like a Dickens novel, we don't get a neat resolution so much as a gradual fade. But that's hardly the point. It's a snapshot and a cross-section, as Dos Passos leaps from character to character, staying with some for the bulk of the novel while abandoning others and bringing in still more, as they intersect and criss-cross and don't meet each other at all. It can make things difficult remembering who is who and what role they have, as down and out types are given the same space and consideration as the high and mighty folks. Time is an issue here, too, with leaps in years seeming to pass at points and a sense that history isn't so much happening as being experienced.But this makes it feel less of its time and more contemporary. It's a portrait of a New York City that no longer really exists but at the same time still can be found in the hectic pace of its life, in the corners and alleys, in the new and just as clotted century, where our own rapid changes are wearing us down as quickly as anyone else in this novel. We see their stories but too rarely see their resolutions. They come in, and live, and walk back out again, or fade, or explode. In this fantastic grimy glorious city. And in doing so, they approximate our lives. And so does this city. And so does this book."},{"Title":"Manhattan Transfer","review":"Ask anyone about the 1920's and they may think Jazz Age, Prohibition, Babe Ruth, Hemingway, Fitzgerald maybe Faulkner. Only a minority would throw John Dos Passos into that ring but he was in fact a giant of the time. His \\"USA Trilogy\\" and \\"Manhattan Transfer\\" were recognized and awarded the same acclaim as writers we know so much better today.Hemingway wrote that \\"Manhattan Transfer\\" finally gave the world the real picture of New York City. Alfred D&ouml;blin was deeply influenced by Dos Passos's style. He ran with the same crowd. Drank and partied with them all and yet almost a hundred years later his own fame is far eclipsed by so many others. Why?A great novel needs great characters and a central theme or conflict. Dos Passos was writing about a time and place; New York City in the first part of the 20 century. His focus is on atmosphere. He wants you to feel the city through it's accents, bustle, the frustrations of daily life, the food and drink and the movement of cars, taxis, subways, street cars and boats of every kind. Through all that he wants to convey the energy that's bursting in every direction but he also wants to expose the contradictions of daily life; war veterans not getting their bonuses, women yearning for more opportunity, backstreet abortions, failed marriages, banks and businesses and later drinking during prohibition.Characters come in go very briefly, re-appearing later. There are so many that it takes perhaps the first half of the book to keep it straight. For me it was hard to follow let alone develop an empathy or curiosity for them. It felt very flat. He uses major events of the day as a timeline but aside from war and prohibition much of those references are obscure and thus one tends to lose a sense of time passing that he was likely successfully conveying to his contemporaries.My conclusion is that it's too ambitious and there is too little for the modern reader to grasp. By doing so much there are interesting points and poignant scenes. But too often I was flipping back to see if I had already jumped to yet another vignette and double checking if he'd jumped a few weeks, months or years. Pulling this out of a time capsule I enjoyed this as a 1925 novel of early New York but I wonder if it were the book that I'd want to say best depicted New York at that time and I'd conclude that other works have surpassed it."},{"Title":"Manhattan Transfer","review":"Ambulance chasers, bootleggers, chorus girls, mashers, bums, anarchists, power brokers, working stiffs, abortionists, drunks, soubrettes, cads, and saps -- the shiftless and the soulless. These are the people of MANHATTAN TRANSFER, the people of New York City in the first quarter of the 20th Century.In a novel of vignettes, from one page to at most six pages in length, John Dos Passos sketches the actions of a large ensemble cast of New Yorkers. Only a few are present from the beginning of the novel to its end. Many have one-shot cameos; others pop up here and there; some have a prominent role for a while and then are forgotten; and a few come to sudden, self-inflicted ends. No one is heroic. New York beats down or corrupts everyone. Behind the glamour and the glitz, Dos Passos shows the squalor and the unrequited yearning. Near the end of the novel, a hack of a judge, in sentencing a penniless young girl who with her unemployed beau had resorted to holding up news stands and the like, unleashes a harangue about \\"the excitement and wickedness of what has been too well named, the jazz age.\\" That essentially encapsulates MANHATTAN TRANSFER.Dos Passos matches the excitement and wickedness of New York City with a writing style that is energetic, frenetic even. He loves adjectival neologisms: \\"he was leadentired\\"; \\"a lanternjawed, grayfaced woman\\"; \\"dollarproud eyes\\"; \\"dustreeking girder forest of the new building\\"; \\"rainseething streets\\"; \\"her body feels smoothwhittled\\"; \\"quiet in the claretmisted afterglow.\\" The novel is innovative, modern. I can well understand the tributes from later American writers such as Tim O'Brien, who said, \\"The influence of John Dos Passos has been tidal on our national literature.\\" But, to me, the writing is a tad undisciplined and the plotting is loose. MANHATTAN TRANSFER is not nearly as finely crafted as, say, Joyce's \\"Ulysses\\", which I suspect was a major influence.Just before reading it, I read another novel of the Jazz Age, F. Scott Fitzgerald's \\"The Great Gatsby.\\" Coincidentally, both were published in 1925, and they make for interesting reading in juxtaposition to one another. In addition to the rampant energy of the period, they both capture a kind of mindless and rootless questing. MANHATTAN TRANSFER probably is the more ambitious, but \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is - for me, at least - the better novel."},{"Title":"Manhattan Transfer","review":"This book was an awsom read! I would recomed it to a friends friend.Once I started reading it I just couldn5t put it down. I love the way the this book startes off with one man and then tells the story of evey man he meets and so on.. The only problum I think some people might have with this book is that if you dont concentrat you can get lost. This book switches from person to person so often some might think there reading about one man then it ends up being another, I found myslef doing this once in a while. But for the most part I loved it!"},{"Title":"Manhattan Transfer","review":"As a native New Yorker, this book makes me fall into the nostalgia of hearing my grandparents tell of how hard life was, with the fights to organize the unions, the wars, the racism, the music, the cheating in politics/bed/business..... of not being with the one that you fell in love with. Love is as problematic and elusive now, as it was then.Dos Passos' crew of characters in this novel are various levels of the privileged: celebrities, business elite and newcomers, politicians, bluebloods,organized crime etc. They cross the globe and return to New York bringing with them and returning with new exploits of love, art, music, etc. All the while there's the backdrop of poor immigrants (with real issues) coming into NYC with long pit stops at Ellis Island.I can relate to Dos Passos' characters, because I had plenty of privilege on an educational level, in addition to the advantages that growing up an international New Yorker afforded me. I had the freedom that my grandparents didn't. They were just like immigrants, but from other states in America. NY was/still is everyone's Mecca. I got my passport faster than my driver's license, and I went off to see the world, Most of my friends were first generation NYer's with one European or Asian or South American, or African parent. We saw each other all over that map. I believe it was that old Broadway play \\"Shenandoah\\" that had a verse in one of it song's that went: \\"Freedom ain't a state like Maine or Virginia; freedom is a state of mind.\\" My mind was free from birth because of being a New Yorker, always believing that everything is possible.In Manhattan Transfer, restlessness and dissatisfaction with life, money and privilege is intertwined with an inability to find true love or to accept it on its terms; debauchery ensues. Much of this stems from a sense of entitlement, some from lives broken in youth that can't be recompensed in adulthood. Unhappiness is battled with lots of drinking, sex, STD's and pregnancy, and even a hint of bi-curiosity in the circle. The secrets among them each have gone through in different periods of their lives. The passing of time narrows their options and reconciles them to their lot. Only the strong survive. Ellen, aka Elaine, aka Helena, seems to be the most well adjusted and adaptive of the group. She rolls with the punches and acclimates.There is no Hollywood ending in this book, as in life. You make the very best of what life hands you."},{"Title":"Manhattan Transfer","review":"Written in 1925-to what you can imagine were gaping jaws-Dos Passos paints a vivid picture of New York;its soul its frenetic pace,in his trade mark style of giving short snatches of each characters life with scene setting descriptions. Actors chorus girls, gays, stockbrokers and hoods all intermingle in the City as they surely must.Not only does Dos Passos capture the turn of the century and jazz age New york, he captures the psyche of the American dream, its dollar God, the fickleness of fame and fortune and the fear of poverty and old age in a youth orientated, unforgiving city.So good is this book that it could have been written yesterday.Psychoanalysis to 'cure' gays, crime and corruption being the easiest route to riches rather than honesty and hard work,the stock exchange just a huge gambling palace,political tensions and deceits, all so relevent and prevelent today. Dos Passos's paints a picture of money mad America that for the first time made me understand why such notorious murderers and robbers such as Dillenger and Bonnie and Clyde were folk heroes to many people. They were at least kicking against a dehumanising system that has too many losers in its cast.In a sense, they were the obvious products of it.A wonderful wonderful book that is arguably better than 'Gatsby' in laying claim to the 'Great American Novel' tag.Experimental in style when first published, it is a testamony to Dos Passos's influence on literature that it feels so familiar to todays reader, his style much imitated most notably by Sartre in his brilliant novel 'The Reprieve'(Sartre acknowledges his debt to Dos Passos)A fascinating real insight into the roaring 20's. And we fooloishly believed our Grand/Great Grandparents lived in an idyllic prudish world of black and white!Truth is, their lives were far more full of life than ours today!"},{"Title":"Manhattan Transfer","review":"Manhattan Transfer is a book that is designed to work by cumulative, metonymic impact. As such, its episodes linger but confusedly. It leaves us with a picture of a city both glittering and ragged, rife with abysmal failures and dubious successes, but ultimately fails to make us care much about it or them. Jimmy Herf and Ellen Oglethorpe, its main protagonists, are too weakly developed and, as such, are not by themselves sufficiently interesting to bring this book to the level of Dos Passos' own USA, or of its model, Joyce's Ulysses. The latter in particular not only displays a formal virtuosity that Manhattan Transfer never or very rarely attains but also provides us with a strong narrative anchor via Leopold Bloom. This is just what's lacking here and is powerfully present in a much, much sharply drawn (if arguably less totalizing) New York novel : Henry Roth's brilliant, under-appreciated Call it Sleep. To paraphrase Stendhal (and I think he'd agree), if your novel is a mirror, it is wise to have someone holding it to the world instead of just bouncing about in the carriage reflecting whatever. What you lose in supposed objectivity and newness, you gain in focus and power.Still, the influence of Dos Passos' method on Sartre, not to mention Gaddis, Pynchon, et al is enormous and obvious (it's also what makes some of their books such a drag to read). I for one tend to feel it even more in the films of the American New Wave: I'm thinking Altman's Nashville or his later Carver inspired Shorts (which incidentally are NOT my favorite Altman movies for just the reasons mentioned above)."},{"Title":"Manhattan Transfer","review":"This book is really one of the best American novels. Its style is unique. You will not &quot;read&quot; this book, but you are going tosmell New York, hear New York, see New York, walk around Manhattan on your own sore feet. It is also a fascinating work because different stories run in parallel in it. It may take you a while to find your way through the book, but then, it will give you a panoramic impression about NY at Dos Passos' time. This book is also a somewhat sceptical, even resigned or pessimistic book. Certainly, it reflects some of Dos Passos' own experiences, and life is not always happy-ended. Don't blame that on the book. This book is inimitable. Even Dos Passos himself did not succeed to create another work which is as uniform in style, compelling, impressive and impressionistic as this one. The USA trilogy is far more diconnected, harder to read, and the unique stlye of Manhattan Transfer turns into mere mannerism in the later trilogy. However, in &quot;Manhattan Transfer&quot;, everything is perfectly at balance, the style fits the objective perfectly, and there is no arbitrariness. Be patient when reading this book. It does not &quot;tell a story&quot; in straightforward way, so the fun of reading this book is not following a well-knit plot, but the fun lies rather in the process of reading itself, enjoying the style, cherishing every single line. A must read."},{"Title":"Manhattan Transfer","review":"Within the first few pages, it becomes apparent quickly that Manhattan Transfer is not a traditional novel. Dos Passos presents a collage of New York City in the 1920's that even 75 years later describes well the modern city. His technique of jumping from character to character as they interact with each other within the city as some succeed and others fail provides a bleak, yet at the same time oddly wonderful reading. His injection of newspaper ads, songs, and advertisements captures so well the bustle of large cities. I can only wonder why he is often left out of the &quot;canon&quot; of American Modernists. It does take adjustment to read Manhattan Transfer, but you will be more than rewarded for your efforts."},{"Title":"Manhattan Transfer","review":"Manhattan Transfer is a subway ride through New York - both across its geographic landscape - a burgeoning metropolis, the heart of the American economy; but also, slums, dark alleys and industrial wasteland. Likewise it is a ride across the ethnic and social landscape - self-made men, fatcats, bored bourgeois bohemians and anarchists, destitute immigrants, ambitious chorus girls, and washed up stock brokers.Dos Passsos's book is like a running paragraph that only briefly stops to take us from one sub-scape to another - his voyeuristic way of relating the social current of WWI and 1920's New York to the everyday lives of people, many of whom are caught up in that current. Dos Passos does not quite uncover any new ground or dig deep into any one point - he covers a lot of ground - there is a sense of equilibrium one gets from reading his prose. Just a few just-below the surface issues he tackles are the budding concerns of untested feminism, the moral puritanism of the Prohibition; less oblique are the issues of unfettered capitalism.Indisputably, Dos Passos's ability to weave in and out of lives while weaving the tapestry of an exciting period in NY and America is admirable. Still, there is an aloofness in a book whose characters are less important to the story than the social forces that encompass them. With no one to anchor the story (despite some possible tenable arguments for the recurring characters), the story just keeps floating along. It doesn't have to end after 400 pages, it can run on ad infinitum."},{"Title":"Manhattan Transfer","review":"Manhattan Transfer presents the good, the bad and the ugly side of life in New York. Money seems to be the driving force behind everybody's lives and love is hard to come by. However, even the failure to realise one's goals does not deter one from hanging on in New York, as Bud does. It is, after all, the 'center of things.' It is in the end Jimmy, who emerges as the man who dares to rebel aganst the 'getting and spending' life that the city promises. The various vignettes that Dos Passos offers somehow tie up, as they all have common concerns, concerns that centre around the great American Dream. What Dos Passos really wants to reveal is the hollowness of this dream."},{"Title":"Manhattan Transfer","review":"The prose style presented in Manhattan Transfer is fresh and unorthodox, two characteristics that all great literature must contain.The narrator of the novel is an eavesdropper who chooses his subjects at will. You are able to spend three pages with a subject, then not hear from the subject until scores of pages later, if at all.Manhattan Transfer serves as a history book, but not the standard type. You actually get to feel, hear, taste and smell what it was like to be in NYC during the early half of the 20th century. Most history books cite landmark events, but Manhattan Transfer records the life of the people living rather than the events the people were involved in.John Dos Passos is one of the most overlooked, underappreciated American writers of the 20th century. I highly recommend this book to everyone. You must visit NYC to fully appreciate the book, though."},{"Title":"Manhattan Transfer","review":"Manhattan Transfer's plot is a series of interwoven stories that span several generations of interconnected lives in early twentieth-century New York City. The most appealing element of the book is Dos Passos's beatifully poetic descriptive prose. The mini-plots are a bit over-contrived and difficult to follow; he assigns them less attention and care than his descriptions of the city itself, but this is his intention. As a reader, I felt no emotional connection to any of the (many) characters I met; I did, however, feel a deep attachment to the city. It is an organic being in Dos Passos's cosmology--it is in fact the book's protagonist, almost as though it's the city's growth we're meant to be charting through the decades and its relationships with its inhabitants, rather than vice versa. His use of verbs is brilliant and rather unique: the city \\"breathes,\\" it \\"sweats,\\" it \\"sighs\\"; it is alive. As a book lover, you'll appreciate the language, and as a New Yorker, you simply can't not read this novel."},{"Title":"Manhattan Transfer","review":"It is tragic that he isn't more celebrated. This is one of the best books I have ever read, because it works on so many levels: it is a wonderful pot-pourri of character portraits, it's a revealing examination of sociological values at work, and it is a marvelous literary work of a million subtle influences in harmony. It is, in short, a reflection of the motion-pictures that made their appearance at the time, and beyond that, is ripe with biblical allusions wonderfully entwined with the storyline. Dos Passos requires the reader to work, and he should be given more credit for making us do so with so much satisfaction."},{"Title":"Manhattan Transfer","review":"John dos Passos stands amongst the &quot;American modernists,&quot; a member of the lost generation, whose most outstanding feature in his literary production is a non-traditional writing style, an outspoken revolt against the molds of classic fiction. He invented the grammar of communication of the late twentieth century, and is considered by some critics as the American Joyce.In &quot;Manhattan Transfer&quot; the author depicts New York City in the 20's, reflecting social concerns and the two-fold morality of the American Dream. In his narrative he weaves several scenes and a horde of unrelated characters, with flashes and cut-backs, better described as a movie-technique. With the use of stream of consciousness, the author relies on the the reader to make his own conclusion. In view of these innovative techniques, &quot;Manhattan Transfer&quot; does not fit in the traditional scheme of composition and requires some adjustment from the reader.A knowledge of the author's biography (see &quot;Dos Passos,&quot; by Virginia Spencer) is a necessary tool in understanding John dos Passos. His family history (he was an illegitimate child) is characterized by deceits and desertions, by a fundamental sense of not belonging in the scheme of society. It is clear that his characters carry autobiographical references."},{"Title":"Manhattan Transfer","review":"Yes, a five-star book compared to most of them, but compared to \\"USA,\\" this novel's a warm-up, between 3 & 4 stars, rounded up for innovation if not poise. In the start of each chapter you get marvelous, miniature modernist riffs, reminding me of saxophones, Carl Sandburg, Whitman, and Joyce (he loves those runoncompounds too); these anticipate the \\"Camera Eye\\" vignettes that would enrich \\"USA\\"'s own prose concoctions. Jimmy Derf (some surname) and Ellen Oglethorpe emerge at the end as the two main characters; others come and go much like life itself--the central figure is not one human but a cast of millions. As an urban reporter here, Dos Passos excels at capturing the snatches of dialogue, smells of the bums, grit of the air (it's rare that nature itself is shown as less than threatening, when it's evident at all), and shouts and noise that, then as now, relentlessly hums and pounds along Manhattan's streets. It's naturalism combined with realism.Since \\"USA\\" for all its flaws is one of my favorite novels, I wanted to compare \\"MT.\\" The pace is very quick: I read this in three sittings, one per main section. What still seems innovative eight decades later is Dos Passos' ability to skip forward within a dialogue to show how the minutes pass even as the characters are speaking--you hear enough to understand that moment, but the next line may be a half hour later into the situation or scene or action. This \\"jump-cut\\" characteristic becomes a bit maddening at times, as it does in cinema, but technically it's fun to watch! This adds to the filmic parallels that flow through \\"MT,\\" which keeps the clips coming much as a well-edited docudrama might pull off.After 9/11, some readers of the opening pages of \\"Moby Dick\\" noticed headlines of \\"war in Afghanistan\\" and the like that seemed to presage the current turmoil, 150 years before. Towards the end of \\"MT,\\" my eye lingered as I re-read this paragraph: from a failed con-man talking to a slick lawyer: \\"I happen to know from a secret and reliable source that there is a subversive plot among undesirable elements in this country...Good God think of the Wall Street bomb outrage...I must say that the attitude of the press has been gratifying in one respect...in fact we're approaching a national unity undreamed of before the war.\\" (part 3. ch. 1)Dos Passos rarely lets his characters stand still and think things through. They try, but there's always someone bursting through the door, or buttonholing them on the street, or the danger, in one dramatic case, of daydreaming leading to disaster. He captures the frenetic speed demanded by NYC, and 20c city life, in this chronicle of a couple of handfuls of characters drawn to the bright lights, and the indifference of the city towards their ambitions and schemes. It's not uplifting or casual reading, but for an immersion into the sensations that ran through and past those who grew up from about 1900-1925, this novel, while uneven, captures what it must have been like for the latest generation who thought they were the first to invent novelty, encounter licentiousness, or concoct flim-flam and skulk around in deceit and skulduggery. Homosexuality, racism, injustice, bootlegging, protest, complacency, war-fever, and rags-to-riches and back down: all these color and vivify the portrayals of the few who stand for millions more in Manhattan.The slang may have changed since then, and the buildings have grown higher, but the people, even though they are more types than rounded (with the exception of about half-a-dozen who endure through most of the novel)--they are the kinds of figures you can still encounter today on any crowded street."},{"Title":"Manhattan Transfer","review":"THis often overlooked work by an often overlooked member of the Lost Generation is a true classic. Although it pales in comparison to Dos Passos' &quot;U.S.A.&quot; trilogy, this is a great look at mankind in the early twentieth century in its own right, as well as an early predecessor of &quot;U.S.A.&quot; Using his unique style of writing Dos Passos tells the tale of one man's journey to New York, and then proceeds to conntinue the story through the eyes of every single person he meets, and everyone they meet.

He casts a roving eye over the 100+ years of musical theater and divides up the riches into categories of the tried and true musicals (Carousel,Annie Get Your Gun), recent moneymakers (Annie,Godspell),musicals with a predominately male cast (The Boys of Syracuse),musicals that demand significant vocal talent (Candide),musicals tha require proficient dancers ( A Chorus Line),and so on.Filichia also offers brief synopsises of the musicals,which is particularly helpful with the lesser-known shows. He also informs you of the necessary props,costumes,characters,famous songs from the shows (if any),and inventive publicity activities that can be done to promote the show (some are ingenous,while others are strange or dull).Perhaps the most important thing that Filichia offers are the pros/cons of each musical-this is especially crucial for the schools that need to censor their dramatic presentations. If the storyline is suggestive or if the libretto contains foul language,you are duly notified. In less serious,yet just as important circumstances,Filichia points out unusual props (like an iron lung for City of Angels),difficult dialects (such as the local dialects for Oklahoma!),and if the musical is too familiar with audiences (such as Fiddler on the Roof).America's grammer school,high school,and college drama departments need all the help they can get. With Filichia's understanding,chatty book,the directors of the aforesaid departments receive a helping hand. For curious,interested devotees of musical theater (such as myself),this is a book suitable for browsing and discovering unknown gems of the musical stage"},{"Title":"Let's Put on a Musical!: How to Choose the Right Show for Your School, Community, or Professional Theater","review":"I got a job teaching high school drama despite having zero experience doing it. Worse, the only musicals I knew and had seen were \\"Cats\\" and \\"Phantom of the Opera.\\" So, when the band and choir directors starting throwing ideas for shows at me I was at a total loss. How would I know, without reading, listening to, and/or seeing every show they mentioned if it was a good idea or not?Then, I found this book. Now, when the choir director tells me she wants to do \\"Lil Abner\\" I can reply that it seems dated. Or, if she wants to do \\"Flower Drum Song,\\" I can tell her that we don't have enough Asians in our pool of talent. I can counter to her that \\"Into The Woods\\" is recommended for high schoolers, despite her objections to the contrary. I can recommend that we perform \\"Little Shop of Horrors\\" because it is a periennial money-maker and kids love it!The book is divided into sections like \\"Shows for a big budget\\" or \\"Musicals that rely heavily on costumes\\". There's \\"Musicals that feature choreography\\" and \\"Musicals with Little Choreography.\\" It's helpful to find the shows grouped together like this.Then, it breaks down the show, giving a synopsis, assests, liabilities (often the most important information!!!), cast needed, etc. If you're passingly familiar with a show, this is all you would need. If you don't know the show at all, this is enough to warrant further investigation or to rule it out entirely.I love this book. I would be lost without it. The only bad thing about it is that it doesn't have every single last musical ever created in it! But, it must contain more than two or three hundred shows listed, so that should be enough to get you by. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Let's Put on a Musical!: How to Choose the Right Show for Your School, Community, or Professional Theater","review":"If you are working in community theater or a school setting, this book is invaluable.

Instead it's about selecting the play you might want to put on.And it's description of some plays you might want to consider is very good. It gives you the story of what's happening, but far more information of a specialized nature that you need to know. For instance, how many performers, what kind of sets, costumes, props, special effects, etc. A very important detail given about the plays is where to go get rights. This can save you a lot of time.I have only three complaints about the book. First it needs updating, there are a lot of new plays you might consider. Second, it needs a section on smaller plays. My stage needs plays with 6-8 people, few of the ones listed here are that small. Third, the book needs to be about three times as long, I'd like to see all the plays that are available in a format done like this."},{"Title":"Let's Put on a Musical!: How to Choose the Right Show for Your School, Community, or Professional Theater","review":"This useful book sets out to do for musicals what Theodore Shank's &quot;500 Plays&quot; does for the theater: provide plot synposes, production notes, and useful background for a wide variety of shows. It's aimed at theatre groups, but it's equally enjoyable as a reference guide to musicals for the general reader -- perhaps the best one of its type in existence.For each show, the entry contains: the creators; background on its original run, including awards won; a plot outline; assets and liabilities; roles; dances; sets, costumes and props; instrumentation; marketing suggestions; production suggestions; resources (for example, videos of the show); and details of the rights.The book was clearly a labour of love, and it shows sometimes in the inconsistent treatments of different shows. Some shows get a one-sentence plot summary, for others it runs to several paragraphs. However, by and large it's an excellent resource, with its crisp, no-nonsense assessments of assets and liabilities. It packs a lot of information into a very small space."},{"Title":"Let's Put on a Musical!: How to Choose the Right Show for Your School, Community, or Professional Theater","review":"Although there are glaring faux pas in this book..wrong vocal range, rather irrelevant political comments by the the author,and and to me the biggest mistake, giving away the ending of one musical, this book is a must for any musical director on any level. I have been involved in musical theatre in various forms and organizational levels for many years and really enjoyed looking into what the author had to say about some of my favorites. Having just witnessed a LONG awaited production of 1776 by my local community theatre group, I found the book right on the money in the case of a musical that has &quot;too many men&quot;. Since the director has on occasion corresponded with Mr Filichia,I would imagine that he might have used the book as well. Would be nice if there were some kind of performer cross index. And the musical that he gave away the ending of is &quot;Shenandoah&quot;(talk about an overabundance of men!)

It has to regularly come out with Supplements because of the ongoing improvments in the field. All the major contributors to computing are discussed, with a good synopsis for each, explaining his or her bailiwick. The treatment is about 50-50 between hardware and software.

It is beautifully written and constructed. The reviewer from Booklist seems to have misunderstood the book when she said that the Sin Eater element was not well integrated -- all of the elements of this book are perfectly integrated. It is, in fact, the Sin Eater &quot;character&quot;(as well as Cole's grandparents, friends and community) that allow Cole to cope with and understand his loss. This is a truly beautiful book with many layers of meaning. It is about the value of family history and experience, the past, community, faith... It's a book that will make you think. It's a book you will want to reread. Don't take it lightly and don't miss it!"},{"Title":"The Sin Eater","review":"This is an amazing novel that is truly an example of fine writing. Ilene Cooper's review is fairly accurate. However, she did miss the point in one aspect. I read this book to my Seventh grade English students and they did grasp the &quot;Ambiguous&quot; themes and thoroughly enjoyed the description. The characters are sincere and well thought out. They were real. I am offended by the comment that only &quot;Astute&quot; readers will grasp the concept of the book. Not only should Schmidt not be under-estimated, the target audience should also not be under-estimated. I strongly recommend that this book be read. Schmidt has given young adults what they needed, a book that treats them like the young adults that they are. This book and the author will be a powerful asset in any library. I intend it to be part of my curriculum next school year."},{"Title":"The Sin Eater","review":"The best description of life on a mid-1900's small farm I've ever read; very realistic and a little nostalgic. The main story line about the Sin Eater is a little weak. Overall I enjoyed this book very much. But if you want lots of sex and blood this book is not for you."},{"Title":"The Sin Eater","review":"\\"Sin Eater\\" was a delightful yet semi-depressing story. The protagonist (Cole) is a young boy who lost his mother to cancer and lost his father to depression.You just want to shake the father and tell him to get a grip! Grieving comes in all forms though and Cole ends up being the stronger of the two. The father and Cole move to New Hampshire to live with Cole's grandparents. The relationship between the two grandparents is heartwarming and comical. It makes you wonder...would the grandfather have acted the same as the father if he lost his wife?The story revolves around death and family. Cole moves to New Hampshire after his mother's death, he bonds with his grandparents who seem to meet his needs and he makes new friends (good friends). In the midst of all this, Cole stumbles onto the history of the Sin Eater. As he learns more about the sin eater, he learns more about his ancestry.Anyway, the end will leave you wondering and questioning, what would make a man want to give up on life? Obviously he loved his wife tremendously. His actions could be considered very romantic instead of depressing. Is love really that deep?The grandparents are wonderful. I love the relationship they share with each other. The cantankerous ole fool! lol. They're funny and bring a sense of groundedness to the story.Gary Schmidt has a way of writing that makes you feel like you're there. You can almost smell the meadows and the hayfields and the manure! He's very descriptive! He has a very pretty way of writing. The words he choses and the way he describes things...it's just very pretty!"},{"Title":"The Sin Eater","review":"Overall I was very pleased with this book. Being familiar with the myth of the \\"Sin Eater\\", I was very excited about the topic of what I thought the book would present. After reading about one third of the way through however, I found it slightly odd and frankly disappointing that there had been only a brief sentence or two about a sin eater which appeared within the first chapter of the book. Not to be swayed, however, the book up to that point was filled with emotion and heartache. A young boy and his father return to the family farm after his mother's funeral to start a new life with his grandparents. There is an emptiness that rings through that pages that anyone can take to heart. Cole, the now motherless boy, narrates the text filled with daydreamed memories and a mournful spirit.Cole is not the only the reader routes for throughout the book. The grandparents are overflowing with a familiarity to my own family that is difficult to overlook. The language that Schmidt uses in anything from dialogue to description is precise and easy to relate to. The images that he paints with words almost pop in the head without purposeful thought.I did find the plot to move quite slowly for the first 100 pages or so. Although the background and daily observations were necessary to tie the whole story together, I did find myself aching for action. Although the title of the book leads one to believe Schmidt will tell a glorified tale of a real and local sin eater, that is not the case. That may leave some disappointment, but the book adds the myth just enough to flavor the true plot. The novel also brings in minor plots about making friends, being compassionate and trying to make the best out of heartache and sorrow.Throughout the novel Cole discovers a story about a sin eater who in fact lived on the very same farm he was living on generations ago. The tale of the sin eater leads Cole through a search on his own ancestors. He discovers a generation full of guilt and grudges. He is able to personalize his own feelings of guilt and pain in the memory and stories of his ancestors. Just when the reader has felt enough pain on the behalf of Cole, Schmidt adds a suicide of Cole's father that brings the reader to tears. Schmidt sets the stage and story in such a way that the reader feels the same anger and confusion as Cole. The reader is left in shock and asking why, although they should have seen it coming.Although the story is woven in pain, it gives the reader a boy reveling in his own family history to find a way to release his own guilt and anger. In the end, Cole uses the story of the sin eater who loosed the guilt of an ancestor and his adopted son to rid Cole of his own guilt and anger toward the loss of his parents."},{"Title":"The Sin Eater","review":"After reading these past reviews as compared to the booklist review, I cannot see how a critic can compare to the real people this book was written for--the regular reader. though it took me but a day to read this book, I found it invigorating, insightful and meaningful. I must admit, I am quite biased, Schmidt is one of my professors and mentors. Yet, regardless of this fact, this story is one that should be told. If not for the story itself, then for the moral and the message behind it--that one shouldn't let the hardships of life bring them down, that life goes on..we should charish life."},{"Title":"The Sin Eater","review":"I read this book and found it, frankly, depresing. If you would like to know, it is about a 15 year old boy who's mother passed away the year before. Now his father and himself have seemed to drift apart. So much that his father seems like a stranger. At the beginning of the book he reminises of the so-called Old Days when his mother was still alive, and when they went on car trips, and how they would play road games, which I hate to say made me feel ultimitly depressed. Then on about the second chapter, he reaches his grandparents house where he sulks and reminisses some more, while cleaning his grandmother's small family graveyard. At about 2/4 through the book, he notices a small picture of a man in a basic flannel shirt and blue jeans. After asking a family friend, he realizes it's a tin-type of the legendary Sin Eater. After this dreary period, he finally makes some local friends who take him to the Sin Eater's former house where he finds a treasure. Then Christmas time comes, and his father spends all his time upstairs in the attic, looking at old pictures, while he refuses to put up a tree, because of the memories of past Christmas's when his wife was still alive. I won't tell you the rest, in case you would like to read it yourself, but it ends in a somewhat happy ending. I would not recommed this book, but I suppose some people might like it, if your the type of person who enjoys some-what depressing lituature."},{"Title":"Bold as Love: The Jimi Hendrix Experience","review":"&quot;Bold As Love- The Jimi Hendrix Experience&quot; is a great book on Jimi, whether you're an old fan or someone who wants an introduction. It gives a well-balanced, brief bio of JH in 115 photo-packed pages. Speaking of photos, this book really delivers in that department. Many full- and half- page photos in their original glory brilliantly illustrate the many fascinating moods of uh, maybe the coolest guy ever. 'Bold As Love' is not as exhaustive as Gleebeck's 'Electric Gypsy', but it offers a more candid look at the JH legend .

You will feel that you personally witness his life from his childhood to his death, and the powerful legacy that was left behind because of his talent, insight, and love for life. This in turn fuelled his music, inspirational songs and quotes that to this day are still being sung by millions, while influencing generations of fandom from all genres of music around the world.After reading this book and looking through the photographs you'll know why (after 40 years) Hendrix is still the undisputed \\"KING OF ROCK N ROLL!\\" AND THE WORLDS GREATEST GUITARIST!!!!"},{"Title":"Delegating Authority (Barron's Business Success Guides)","review":"This small book (95 pages) is a great look at delegating - the barriers and benefits, exactly how to set goals, how to communicate, and how to track delegations.

Thus, it is probably not as useful for an executive wanting to delegate large responsibilities, but still is a good basic look at delegating."},{"Title":"Birchism Was My Business","review":"\\"How could an intelligent man...?\\" But that's only the first question that springs to mind as the reader begins this fascinating foray into the hitherto unexposed heart of the John Birch Society. For two years Gerald Schomp was a paid, professional patriot for one of the most astonishing socio-political organizations of our time. With naive enthusiasm he promulgated the party line until his rude awakening during an angry public confrontation with an illerate Negro garbageman. His ironic, devastating account of life among the Birchers provides one of the most enlightening, absorbing...and entertaining...political exposes of this or any other year.If anyone ever accused the John Birch Society of being blackly comic, the charge would be angrily and humorlessly refuted. Yet Schomp has written a book that is almost as funny as it is tragic: the story of a professional superpatriot tirelessly fighting to save the world from (...or for?...) Communism and the \\"International Conspiracy\\" of \\"Insiders\\". Secretive yet messianic, the Birch Society and its founder, Robert Welch, are tenacious anachronisms in contemporary society. And the Birchers themselves? Take it from a man who knows: \\"In general, Birchers are the 'least likely' people in the world.\\"What is the mystique of the Birch Society that attracts so many fervent and silent sympathizers? Where does the money come from? Who is Robert Welch and how has he managed to maintain monolithic control over so many followers? How does a quasi-secret society recruit volunteers? And neither last nor least...where does the JBS stand in relation to Jews, Negroes, and the conservatives of this country?Schomp traces the fascinating route of right-wing extremism from orgies of patriotism to mass paranoia, monomaniacal devotion to \\"duty\\", and finally to its inevitable and frightening public climax. His unsparing honesty and insight offer serious, provacotive reading to Americans of every political persuasion.189 pages.

He has written other books such asThe Political Assassination of Robert A. Taft,Overcoming Anxiety,The problem drinker, andParent Child God: Bringing You Closer Together. He is \\"a practicing Catholic,\\" and \\"the atheistic basis of the Communist ideology was entirely repugnant to me.\\" (Pg. 12)He wrote in the first chapter of this 1970 book, \\"This book is the first public critique written by someone who has been intimately acquainted with the Society on a sympathetic basis, has helped promote all the Birch programs on a professional level, and personally knows many of the Birch leaders and a sizable cross section of its hidden membership. I believe that my early objective and familiar association with the Birch Society qualifies me as one of its fairest and most knowledgeable critics.\\" (Pg. 11)Schomp notes that JBS founder Robert Welch often used ghostwriters (such as a reseacher who did the footnotes for Welch's controversial bookThe Politician); he also published a booklet under the name of \\"Chester Berrlow\\" (an anagram of \\"Robert R. Welch\\"), \\"so that sensitive Birchers could approach their friends with literature that did not bear the stigma of either the Society of Welch's name.\\" (Pg. 32)He opines that the controversial line in the pre-publication version of Welch's book \\"The Politician\\" (\\"...it is my firm belief that Dwight Eisenhower is a dedicated, conscious agent of the Communist conspiracy\\") was \\"The most disastrous mistake Welch ever made,\\" and that JBS members \\"are all fully aware that 'The Politician' has kept more people away from the Society than any other single factor.\\" (Pg. 36-27)Acknowledging that libel laws prevent the Birchers from calling someone a \\"Communist,\\" they instead use the term \\"Insiders.\\" (Pg. 43) He also notes that \\"most members tend to frown on drinking\\" (pg. 79).He says that \\"What totally disillusioned me was the reluctance of Society officials to revoke the memberships of Birchers who openly vented their hatred of (Jewish persons) as a reaction to the formation of a Jewish (JBS) affiliate.\\" (Pg. 101) KKK members are NOT allowed to join the society, however (Pg. 120).This book is a unique and very fascinating look at the John Birch Society---even though 40 years old."},{"Title":"Birchism Was My Business","review":"I have read this book many times from our local library.

The one that will drive you crazy is that Anne is back to being oblivious about Gilbert Blythe being the love of her life and her perfect match. The other thing that becomes obvious is that Montgomery is somewhat uncomfortable with Anne growing up, even though she is only &quot;half-past sixteen,&quot; as evidenced by the infusion of new children into the story because Anne is now teaching at Avonlea school while Marilla has adopted the irrepressible Keith twins, Davy and Dora. You can also throw into the mix the mysterious new neighbor with his parrot and (my favorite part) the eccentric Miss Lavendar who has been waiting a quarter of a century for her beloved Stephen Irving to return to her.Along with &quot;Anne of Windy Poplars,&quot; this book is a testament to Montgomery's respect for the teaching profession; indeed, the book is dedicated to her former teacher, Hattie Gordon Smith. While this is not one of my favorite Anne novels, it is still a worthy successor to the classic story. However, be warned: If you watch either of the &quot;Anne of Avonlea&quot; movies, either the black &amp; white version with the actress Anne Shirley playing Anne Shirley or the wonderful Ken Sullivan production with Meagan Follows, you will realize that virtually nothing from this novel ever made it to film."},{"Title":"Anne of Avonlea","review":"This story takes place along time ago when people had wooden houses in Avonlea in the country.

But some of her friends have different punishments for the children and about weird nabor that has a problem with change and a another nabor that has an adatude problem and it is funny,sad,and educational.In my opinion this book is an ok book I did not really understand it because their were allot of difficult words but the the things I could read were great thats why I gave it 4 stars.I would recemend this book because it was a great book and it tells you how it would be like to be a 16 year old teacher"},{"Title":"Lectures on Statistical Physics and Protein Folding","review":"This book is from a series of lectures given by the author at the Zhou Pei-Yuan Center for Applied Mathematics at Tsinghua University to introduce research in biology to individuals in other sciences.The first ten chapters are an introduction to statistical physics, but somewhat tilted towards biological applications. The last six chapters cover specific biophysical topics based on the general mathematical/physical principles.The book introduces an approach to protein folding from the point of view of kinetic theory. This is presented as the driving force of the process. A series of possible research directions is suggested to further investigate these theories.The book was published in June, 2004 and was up to date with current theories as of that time."},{"Title":"Unfit Commander: Texans for Truth Take on George W. Bush","review":"During the Vietnam War, John F. Kerry bravely performed his patriotic duty and risked his life in combat. During the same war, George Bush took the cowardly route and went AWOL from the Air National Guard for nearly a year. Glenn W. Smith's eye opening UNFIT COMMANDER provides full documented evidence, including over 250 pages of service records, that exposes the whole, shocking truth about Dumbya's shameful military \\"career\\". Smith provides a richly detailed introduction and commentary, plus an extensive appendix, that puts the sordid tale into proper perspective. Smith even addresses the recent CBS memo \\"controversy\\" and how Republicans used the media to promote that ridiculous sham of a news story in order to divert the populace from the truth about the president's cowardly past. UNFIT COMMANDER is a well researched and important historical document. Any remaining undecided voters out there should read it ASAP."},{"Title":"Unfit Commander: Texans for Truth Take on George W. Bush","review":"As a Texan, I've taken a lot of good-natured ribbing from activist friends around the world.They have told me that the best way to save the country would be to send Bush back to Texas. Because it ultimately implies that I and other Texans unanimously had supported Bush, this statement is a gross generalization. We actually had more reason to oppose his ascension than people from other states.Plus, already knowing what Bush would do to America and the world if he (unlike the figurehead Texas Governor position) actually had power, provided all the incentive which I needed to vote against him in 2000 and 2004.I and other alert Texans COULD NOT reside under the illusion that George W. Bush was somehow 'moderate'. We also knew that it did matter who actually won the presidential elections.Mounting casualties in Iraq coupled with a skyrocketing federal deficit are affirming just how bad a Bush administration really is for the world. Amidst a growing number of 'Bush' supporter head-scratching and (actually) genuine bewilderment, we say \\"I told you so\\".Continuing a pattern begun in early adulthood (to escape the Vietnam War he allegedly supported) Bush is a good-ole boy who depends on his family name and the monetary connections to avoid the situations which other Texans had to deal with.Borrowing an \`image' page from Ronald Reagan and his father's playbook, Bush intentionally cultivates an image of the 'rugged cowboy' who has made it on his own without any assistance.In addition to downplaying the importance of government, the \`cowboy' also is supposed to suggest that the president is a John-Wayne figure who will of course be able to protect the country against whatever is considered a threat.Yet, the truth is that Bush is a naive and sheltered person who has never had to take responsibility for his actions.This is why the Bush administration honestly is not bothered that they have lied to the American people, or are slaughtering American troops (who already face enough danger) with that same fabricated evidence about Iraq WMD's. As long as somebody else can go to war in their place, these people sincerely do not see a contradiction in their own actions.Even if I have personally read the general gist of this book elsewhere, I was pleased to see it again. The truth always bears repeating.The American people (and those in Texas) want to easily be comforted by 'security' images. Constant repetition of the real facts may thus be the very tool which encourages these swing voters to stop voting for the GOP---and/or recognize they are not the only Texans who hate Bush's war against the world. There are far more of us out here than the so-called liberal mass media has recognized.Don't send Bush back to Texas, lock him up far, far away where he will never be able to hurt anybody again."},{"Title":"Unfit Commander: Texans for Truth Take on George W. Bush","review":"While the Swift Boat Brigade that has attempted to besmirch the war record of John Kerry has been exposed as a group of malicious liars with the Navy providing the final stamp of approval on the Democratic presidential candidate's service, the record of George W. Bush in the Texas Air National Guard has been anything but exonerated.Glenn Smith does a great service in exposing Bush as the same spoiled son of privilege who appears in the pages of Kitty Kelley's lengthy work on the Bushes. Smith zeroes in on Bush's service and, to quote Gertrude Stein, discovers that \\"there is no there there.\\" Standing in the forefront is Bush's father, a prominent Texas congressman, who knows the right people and is prepared to make the right moves to help his son avoid active duty in Southeast Asia.The revelations of Smith demonstrate once more the double standard and rank hypocrisy running rampant on the Republican right. The same people who turn and look the other way in silent embarrassment when Bush's National Guard service, and lack thereof, are mentioned are the same individuals who wanted to hang Bill Clinton from the nearest tree for being a \\"draft dodger\\" when he had a strong belief that the Vietnam War was wrong.In the case of Bush he was a staunch anti-Communist who saluted Barry Goldwater's position of an aggressive bombing campaign against the North Vietnamese. Despite Bush's strong professed beliefs that the Vietnam War was the right move and that the Communists needed to be stopped, he headed for the tall grass when the opportunity to put his actions behind his stated convictions arose.At least there is some consistency in the Bush position. He did, after all, choose Dick Cheney as his vice president. Tough cold warrior Cheney also has solid credentials as a Chicken Hawk, having expressed himself strongly on behalf of the Vietnam War, then aggressively pursued four educational deferments. After the last deferment expired the man they would later call Mr. Gravitas did the only noble thing under the circumstances, he impregnated his wife, receiving a final deferment and saying goodbye for good to his Vietnam problems.Bush had, after all, been a cheerleader at Andover Academy. Bush and Cheney proved to be effective Chicken Hawk cheerleaders as the sons of East Los Angeles and Watts were called on to serve on active duty in Vietnam."},{"Title":"Unfit Commander: Texans for Truth Take on George W.

If you are tired of getting your information from partisan spin masters, then you will appreciate the opportunity to discover the truth from the records themselves...including none that are in dispute. The book also includes interesting and informative exchanges between the White House and the press regarding this issue.Smith's opening essay explains why this issue is relevant to the upcoming election.

I think, George W made own share of mistakes, but he did mostly what he believe in, also he had to deal with biggest terrorist act in US history. He had to rebuild CIA, FBI, and all branches of military to fix the harm that was done by Clinton by cutting intelligence and military budgets. Obviously, he had more class than Barak Hussein. He did not blame Clinton for anything that went wrong with his presidency."},{"Title":"Unfit Commander: Texans for Truth Take on George W. Bush","review":"In an election year rife with unsubstatiated rumors, this is a documentary treatment of President Bush's controversial military career. Who cares about something that happened 30 years ago? We should, because it documents character and integrity. Although Mr. Smith is clear about where his sympathies are - no doubt of that - this is not simple Bush bashing. He backs up his assertions with citations to the documents. Having done research myself, I sympathize with the mind-numbing effort to obtain, study, and interpret the record. Mr Smith gives us a 35-page opening essay that explores both sides of several perplexing questions regarding Bush's service. Most importantly, he explains why this issue is relevant to the 2004 election. He follows this with 56 pages of fascinating White House press briefings, 262 pages of service documents, plus a brief appendix. An especially useful section is \\"Late Breaking Records,\\" which contains documents that surfaced only in September 2004. Some of the documents are difficult to read because of the size reduction from the originals, or their poor physical quality. Although the last chapter in this story is yet to be written, I would recommend this book if you are at all interested in the military background and character of our President.

Which is the point of this book, to yet flesh out more lies that he's foisted upon the american public.

He has made us LESS SAFE by diverting men and money from fighting al Qaeda to his grudge-match against Iraq (finishing what Daddy didn't); he's turned a trillion-dollar surplus into a trillion-dollar deficit; he's consistently been in favor of corporate giveaways at the expense of the little guy and fat-cat tax cuts at the expense of the middle class; he's for the drug companies and not the consumers who can barely afford life-saving drugs...the list goes on and on, ad nauseum.

Bush","review":"I don't have any great love for George W. Bush. I bought this book expecting a appraisal of the president with reflection on his service record, and so on.What it turned out to be was about 50 pages explaining the origins of the Texans For Truth, with some background on the subject and references to other recent political events. The next 50 pages or so are transcripts of interviews and press conferences about the service record, then the remaining 50% of the book is just reproductions of Bush's service records.There is very little analysis, identification of key points, possible sources of error, anything. The information contained in the book I already knew, and even if I didn't I can think of several magazine sources that carried the information in a much more satisfactory manner and with more true analysis.The only thing that prevents this from being a one star turkey is that it could potentially be used as a source for anyone wanting to build a case for themselves. For anyone else, forget it."},{"Title":"Unfit Commander: Texans for Truth Take on George W. Bush","review":"I \\"read\\" this excuse for a book, which was already marked down to half price tonight, in about 30 minutes. I am glad, however, that I had a chance to see the documents myself. I am a drilling reservist and Iraqi Freedom veteran. I reviewed the voluminous documents of his military records that make up over half the book. Bush served his then 6 years statutory service obligation. He commissioned in 1968 and resigned his commission in 1974. I looked at his retirement points. He had the minimum 50 points/year while actively drilling to have the year count toward retirement. In the reserve component, you don't have to go to drill every month to have a good year. You get 4 points/ weekend drill and 15 point for annual training. You even get 15 points/year just for being in the guard/reserve. You can do make up training as well, if you want to, otherwise you can request and receive an excused absence without making up the drill. So you can miss several months/year, have up to 9 unexcused absences, and still be a satisfactory participant. People in the guard/reserve have full-time civilian jobs that at times may conflict with drill, hence the liberal makeup/absence policy. When he went to Harvard in 1973 he went into the inactive reserve but was still subject to involuntary recall until he resigned his commission in 1974 at the end of his service obligation. I read his officer evaluation reports. They were excellent! His commission was in the Reserve of the Air Force in the Air National Guard. When he served on active duty while federally recognized, he was in the Air Force. He had several DD214s with honorable active duty service and was honorably discharged from the service in 1974. He flew fighter jets as part of homeland defense during a time when we were also involved in a Cold War with the Soviet Union. He failed to take a physical and was removed from flying status when the Air Force was downsizing from Vietnam and his jet was becoming obsolete. It is curious the memo removing him from flight status shows another pilot from his unit also removed for not taking a physical but the name is redacted. It would be interesting to interview that person to see why they did not take the physical as well. Maybe they were told not to. I just don't understand how these facts render him \\"unfit.\\" You can't be AWOL unless you are on active duty. He did his duty and served honorably."},{"Title":"Unfit Commander: Texans for Truth Take on George W. Bush","review":"The book consists of 40 pages containing newspapers' stories about the president's military records, 53 pages containing White House's press briefings, and 250 pages of poorly reproduced military records.All the information in the book is old and well known. Although the author concludes that there are strong similarities, in behavior, between the dishonest young man and the current Commander in Chief, he fails to see other facts that contradict his prejudiced opinion, as follows:(1) George W. Bush did not choose to be born rich to an influential father. Thus, his preferential treatment was not deliberately sought, but offered to him as a pay back for his father's connections. In addition, the war in Vietnam was of questionable purpose.(2) In 1968, when young Bush was preferentially accepted in the National Guard, the entire country was plagued by racist and discriminatory culture. The whites discriminated against blacks, the rich discriminated against the poor, the Baptist discriminated against the Jews and Catholics. Thus, preferential treatment in that era and that young age (21-year old) could not justify the charge of \\"unfit commander\\". At least, the young Bush eliminated Saddam and the Talliban, in one term.(3) From 1968 through 1971, young Bush proved responsible, as his records show. That proves that he was able to accomplish when he was interested. His declined performance from 1972 and his discharge in 1973 is not an extreme conduct for a young man forced to comply with rigid military obligations.However, the inclusion of the president records in the book renders it a handy reference in studying other aspects of his achievements. For example, his Yale's major in History and Harvard's major in business administration shows his mediocre academic preparation, compared to others presidents, who studied Law that requires extensive reading and analytical skills far complicated that those needed in history and business.Although, Bush's run-ins with the law that included speeding, negligent accidents, and disorderly conduct are not extreme, since they occurred prior to the age of 21. The author may be correct that the president has still maintained impatience, poor judgment, and sense of entitlement above the norms of those of reasonable men. However, these charges could be refuted by the fact that without invading Iraq there was no mean to prove that the country did not have weapons of mass destruction. In addition, Saddam was a maniac whose address was known, while Bin Laden was elusive.Mohamed F.

Lt. Bush accumulated 954 points - exceeding the six-year Air National Guard requirement for service - threefold. He also exceeded the minimum 50-point requirement each year.He received an Honorable Discharge in October 1973 (March 1973 was when the final troops were withdrawn from Vietnam, by the way), having served 5 years, 4 months and 5 days. That should be the end of it.Imagine if a thoroughly uninformed writer with an obsessive and irrational hatred for the President, ignoring any potentially positive find he made and penning an entirely slanted book based on issues that don't even logically fit the National Guard's procedures and norms, argued that the Honorably Discharged President had in fact somehow shirked his duty.

This book contains wrong and misleading information, and the photographs are poorly selected.A sentence on p. 6 reads, \\"The main mint is in Washington, D.C.\\" This is totally wrong. There is, in fact, NO mint in Washington, D.C. Any moderately serious coin collector knows this. Thus, it is immediately obvious that this book was neither written nor checked by anyone with any real knowledge on the subject.Although the book explains that coins are stamped from dies, there is not a single picture of a die to be found anywhere.The discussion of proof coins on p. 16 contains the following misleading statement: \\"Coins made for collectors are polished. They are known as proof coins.\\" In the minting of proof coins, the blanks and dies are polished, resulting in a mirror-like background on the coin; the coin itself, however, is not \\"polished\\".The author continues on this same page with a discussion of old coins and their value. Since the topics covered on p. 16 are proof coins and old coins, it is quite odd that the facing page features a full-page photograph of a Susan B. Anthony dollar, which is neither a proof specimen nor old and valuable.A listing at the back of the book of web sites to visit does not even include the U.S. Mint's own web site. Of course, if the author had done even a minimal amount of research and visited this site, he would have found the information he needed to write knowledgeably about where mint facilities are located and how proof coins are made.All in all, this is a poorly researched, poorly produced book.

It has not seen the shelf yet.

Southerners have been brought up with the image of an angel as a person who's white, has a robe on, and wings on her back. The archangel is a man in white. Ninety-seven percent of white evangelical Christians trust in their existence. When we read the Bible, we read of the suffering of Christ and the glory of Christ. The angels know who Christ is as they have seen Him in His glory.The Christian life is the dynamic Spirit-filled life which does not come from what we know intellectually. Belief in angels declined with advanced education. But overall, 81% believe in the existence of angels. They can come to us in different forms, perhaps a bluebird, a butterfly, a fat, fluffy singing mockingbird high up in a tree of holly at the bus stop. God has his angels watching over us in times of great peril, some in human form like the stranger who yelled when I almost walked in front of a speeding car downtown (the drivers here act like maniacs behind the wheel of an auto and are never charged when they kill a pedestrian). Angels can appear unseen as the one who saved me from being choked to death by a paid assassin (he, too, was never charged). Were it not for God's intervention, I'd been a goner a long time ago, but He has left me here for a purpose I've yet to determine.When the angels saw Jesus bleed and die on the cross of Calvary, it was beyond their comprehension. Some things are left to God's will. \\"He gave his only son...\\" There is real power in love, which motivate us the most and is deeply fulfilling. Any time we do things with the wrong motive, we do not find happiness. We all have troubles, difficult times to deal with in our lives. Many people live without hope and believe there is no hope. \\"If I can't see it, I won't believe it\\" is still alive and kicking. We must believe before we can see. We walk by faith, not by sight.God speaks of beautiful angels as reakm created beings. Some believers doubt spiritual things which they have not experienced in their own lives. Whe God \\"tests and puts us through trials,\\" it is to purify us, to remove the bad so we can come forth as gold. I've started wearing a little monogramed gold ring which Brett gave to me years ago. I haven't figured out what the \\"P\\" stands for, but when I wear it now, I have a semblance of peace in hy hectic life. Satan (the devil) tries to get to us through our minds; he works in our thought life. If I'd doen this or that, things might be different. Don't believe him, as God is omnipresent and works in His own time for our good and fate doesn't come into this matter. Some say that angels are like ghosts, Santa Claus, the spirit; it's an attitude. At times of desolation when we feel that all is lost, we can go into His presence and ask of Him what we need -- ask and receive God's blessings.Do you believe in angels? Have you ever felt their presence? My first encounter was as a child in the throes of a high fever. \\"She\\" was beautiful with black flowing hair. After my fever broke, I searched everywhere for the \\"neighbor\\" who had stood at the bed and just looked down at me.

The book is chock full of the latest statistics on race, education, and the economy. \\"Uncommon Common Ground\\" is a must-read for anyone who wants to see America embrace our evolving future and thrive in the new global economy."},{"Title":"Searching for the Uncommon Common Ground: New Dimensions on Race in America (American Assembly Books)","review":"Since the election of President Obama, America has been walking around like Katharine Hepburn the first time she meets Sidney Poitier in the movie Guess Who's Coming to Dinner. Is there such a thing as intellectual speechlessness?In the 21st century the challenge is how best to create a new American narrative. Only when this is done will we be able to discuss racial equity. The new society requires a new vocabulary and language. Many of us are still groping in the dark.So much begins with Obama but ends with ourselves. In their book, Uncommon Common Ground, Angela Glover Blackwell, Stewart Kwoh, and Manuel Pastor include their personal narratives. Their stories add a nice glitter to the opening chapter of this book. To some extent the three personal profiles overshadow the charts and graphs by reminding us that people make history.Race is not going into hibernation for four or eight years because of what Obama does. The new narrative of the 21st century is that America is a multicultural nation. Sidney Poitier is bringing his friends to dinner. Blackwell, Kwoh, and Pastor remind us that there is a difference between racial equality and racial equity. They see the hope for change in the emergence of a new leadership with skills that embrace the technology that is eliminating old structures at a rapid pace.But how do we move beyond the old narrative? Uncommon Common Ground successfully \\"maps\\" the old terrain. There is mention here of Roosevelt's New Deal, but one wonders if reference should have been made to his second bill of rights. This book proclaims that \\"there has never been a better opportunity to make good on America's promise.\\" With equity, people will begin to reinvent America. One wonders if the new narrative will result in a more perfect union.The challenge is not simply finding common ground as we move forward but also defining the word community. Are we using it the way King did? Do we still believe we should try to build the beloved community? According to Blackwell, Kwoh, and Pastor the leaders for racial equity \\"have and will come in different shapes and sizes, hailing from the religious, labor, business and political spheres.\\"Uncommon Common Ground should be placed in the hands of all future storytellers. Let them speak truth to the people."},{"Title":"Searching for the Uncommon Common Ground: New Dimensions on Race in America (American Assembly Books)","review":"This response to Uncommon Common Ground: Race and America's Future is written by Jim Gibson, a Senior Fellow and board member of the Center for the Study of Social Policy (and the PolicyLink board chair).Uncommon Common Ground is an important book on several levels. It provides intelligent policy analysis regarding the powerful demographic trends and multi-decade data projections that display the reconfiguring of this nation's ethnic and cultural character. It ingeniously examines the seminal role of the \\"black-white paradigm\\" in shaping the current multi-ethnic dynamic. And particularly impressive to me personally, it shares the personal histories and experiences which have shaped the authors' paths to their roles, identities, and interactions with the racially sculpted shape of American reality. Finally, they make a persuasive case that we must, as a society, default to a conscious pursuit of equity as a driving framework that can \\"carve out space for more people to contribute to their communities, metropolitan regions, and the country.\\"I was 20 years old when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Brown v. Board of Education that it was no longer permitted under the Constitution to treat people differently based on race.Life dealt me a hand that essentially compelled me to participate in dismantling the Jim Crow structure of the South and its northern variations. I was able to participate in doing so through active involvement with my community in the civil rights movement - first, as co-chairman of the student movement in Atlanta and, subsequently, as executive secretary of the Atlanta Chapter of the NAACP. This was a time when we mounted successful economic boycotts against the city's major department stores, began the integration of the public schools, and otherwise went about wreaking havoc on the vast, deep, and pervasive manifestations of age-old, systemic racial discrimination.The point is that I became a community activist in a context that made me believe you can make needed changes if you organize with your neighbors and act with informed, strategic focus and determination.I also consider myself fortunate that my life permitted - in fact, forced me- to attend to the fundamental question posed by the Brown decision: What does the country have to do differently the day after it has said it's no longer legal to treat people differently based on race from what it was doing the day before? What administrative, programmatic, and institutional practices have to change? How do you make those changes?Uncommon Common Ground describes why we must admit we have not yet fully answered those questions and addresses how we can and must proceed from here."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"Great Book and Series.

Imagine having to eke it out in those conditions.Overall, this book kept me glued and it hasn't aged a day..."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"This is the fourth book in James Clavell's \\"Asian Saga\\". It is also the first book he wrote and the one that is closest to being autobiographical.King Rat really can be read as a stand alone novel. It is only about 350 pages long and doesn't involve any characters from previous novels (even though Peter Marlowe and Robin Grey appear in Noble House). It is about a Japanese prisoner of war camp called Changi in World War II.The King is an American soldier who trades camp members' valuable items to the guards for money which can then be used to buy contraband food. This is against Japanese rules and, thus, camp rules but most officers turn a blind eye to the trading. Robin Grey is the exception and he sets out to catch the King and humble him.King Rat is a very accurate depiction of Japanese prisoner of war camps in World War II and shows that the only true rule in the camp is to survive.The forward of the book mentions that the original publication had removed the women's perspectives. I am glad they added those parts back in, even though I wish they could have been a little more fleshed out. The big question at the end of the book is \\"what happens when the surviving soldiers go home?\\" We don't learn the answer to that question (even though we know a few things about the people left behind that the men aren't aware of) but that is the point. Changi has been the entire world for these men for so long and now that they are free, how do they go back to \\"normal\\"?"},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"This book King Rat, is one of the best genre fiction books you could ever come across. The detail of the plot is just so unexpected. All this happened in a miserable military concentration camp (which is what it was in Changi during ww 2) It is fresh and well written and psychologically real as if it was written recently and yet the book itself is older than the Beatles. There are at least 5 astoundingly original characters in this book as well as the usual corruptable military types.Corporal King (King Rat) is one of the less astounding but is completely believable as a street wise American who benefits from the moral shambles aroung him.The author, the late James Clavell-an Englisman- was imprisoned in Changi by the Japanese, himself as a young Captain.It is beautifully written within the tough prisoner genre that the book belongs to.If you like WW 2 stories about near triumphs and near misses over moral corruption you will really admire this classic book."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"Whether you are a fan of Clavell's Asian Saga or a casual reader, you will surely enjoy his first major book about prisoners of war at Changi in Sinapore during the Japanese occupation. Because Clavell himself spent time in the POW camp, he has a real perspective of what life was like in the camp. He is able to describe to the reader a sense of competitive community that the prisoners had amongst one another and that it seemed the Japanese hardly had a role at all. One enterprising character is able to make a great deal of money and garner a large amount of supplies at the envy of most others. The title itself has a cryptic meaning that only reading the book will dissolve...."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"This is the great ass-whuppin' that released James Clavell's literary chi-flow and allowed him to become the eternal master of intelligent historical potboilers. Never mind Umberto Eco's \\"Seven Seas Jim\\" high-cappin' in \\"Foucalt's Pendulum,\\" James Clavell lays down some staggeringly beautiful historical yarns. And this, the one that came straight from his own horrifying experiences, is the one that started it all.Where Remarque, Hasek, Grass, Vonnegut, Heller (and the list goes on) tell us the obvious truth that war sucks, Clavell fell into the ninth circle that the others were lucky enough to avoid. And he emerged with one novel that will make you sick even while you enjoy the heck out of it.King Rat, while short and spare, is truly the prerequisite to Shogun, Tai Pan, and all his other novels. That every subsequent novel makes peace with his one-time tormentors is even more extraordinary."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"When I started to read King Rat I was not sure what to expect. I was hoping for a cross between \\"Bridge on the River Kwai\\" and \\"The Great Escape.\\" Well I was kind of right on both counts.King Rat is an authentic novel written from Clavell's past experiences in a Japanese prison camp during the war.In a nutshell, we have an American, called The King who, back in America was as plain as dirt and who came from humble beginnings. Well ironically, while in Prison, his rough upbringing was just the thing that made him a survivor/local hero among the other enlisted men, yet among the educated British officers he was a trouble maker who wouldn't conform to the rules of the prison. To the Rat prison was the best thing that ever happened to him.Clavell, spent very little time on the Japanese. This novel dealt mainly with the interactions of the prisoners.Rather that a prison/war novel I felt this was more or less a character study of class systems. King Rat illustrates to us that a down and out loser from America who couldn't get arrested before the war, can become the most important and cunning survivor during the war. Because, when it is the comes down to it, this is the rule of the jungle, dog eat dog . Just like the actual rat, we loathe them, we try to kill as many as we can, yet we can never seem to kill them all, because a rat is a survivor and can adapt to its surroundings. So in short, the Rat was King in this jungle.Fine novel, I recommend it."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"This book is Clavells finest book, King Rat is one the finest views into a Prisoner of War.

I've read them in order so far, Shogun and Tai-pan for me were breathtaking, long books which I sped through. Gai-jin was more of a chore, with not much of ending. I found King Rat dull, I think the story wasn't too interesting. Other customers have commented on how harsh the prison was - too be honest, I thought it would've been worse. The King had none of the charisma of the heroes in the other books, and I found myself not really caring whether or not either him or Marlowe made it. Although a lot was made of their inner feelings, this made me feel that they were both just shallow people."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"James Clavell's \\"King Rat\\" is hands down the worst of his Asian saga. Only related to the other four by the main character's possession of a \\"gold ring, signet of the Clan Gordon\\" (italics) mentioned once on the seventh page. Any reader of Clavell would expect this to have some significance later but the thread never reemerges. Did the author forget about it, carried away by his clearly sophmoric adulation of his Hero? Or did he toss it in at his publisher's request in order to somehow justify this waste of print by weakly connecting it to his better works. And what is this shiftless down-and-out motherless drunkard's son doing with such a treasure anyway? Surely that would have made a more interesting book. Of course, the matural answer is that Clavell is telling his own story, what he lived through as a POW. He has, however, forgotten the first rule of freshman exposition: \\"Just because it happened to you, doesn't make it interesting.\\" Certainly, there are traces of the Clavell magic--despite his always hackneyed prose, he is a master storyteller, but in this case the threads lead nowhere and peter out where a quick death would be more merciful. A large theme is built up around a secret radio, but when discovered not once but twice the Japanese commander who has been built up as a terrifying menace offers cigarettes to all involved. None are tortured,jailed or even questioned. It is as if he is uncertain as to whether he wants to write The Gulag Archipelago or Catch 22 and settle for Hogan's Heroes\\" (of TV sitcom fame). Changi makes Stalak 13 look the Hanoi Hilton. There is even a Corporal Schwarz-like Japanese guard who, like his sitcom counterpart has \\"no stomach for war\\" and comes close to saying \\"I know nothing-Nothing!\\" Clavell,who knows how to spin yarn, would be great on a campout and we cannot forget the majestic sweep of his four ?good? books, but, like the t-shirt says, \\"I spent nearly four years in a Japanese POW camp and all could come up with was this lame book.

After all, it is rather depressing and there is not that much of a plot. Clavell does very well at describing the inhuman situtation and how some - the king Rat - of the title do better than others in this kind of circumstances. The prison world dehumanizes most of them, Peter Marlowe, is one the exceptions holding on to his upper class principles as much as can be expected under these circumstance. There is a lot about the relationship of the different classes in Englands and the lack of that in the USA. There is sort of a happy ending when most of the principal characters hang on their lives until their liberated with the end of the war.At the same time this looks like the downfall of the admired King Rat of the title, who when stripped of his power, has no friend left and dows nt seem to look forward to going back to freedom after the powerful postion he had enjoyed in the camp.It is powerful book and especially the ending makes it a book hard to forget. It does not have the wide range of other Clavell novels but it makes up for this by creating the claustrophobic world that was Changi. Quite recommendable."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"This is a truly great book. James Clavell is a master of making his audience feel as if they are immersed in the story.

The story is engrossing, with an intriguing plot and beautifully worded prose. Readers may be so amazed at this fact that they ignore the larger genius inside the work -- a study of human suffering, survival, competition, ethics, and beliefs. Fears, petty hatreds, pleasures, religious convictions, and the constraint of social rules are all subjected to a scrutiny which turns one's views upside down. The wisdom that Mr. Clavell gained out of his experience at Changi during the war is expressed perfectly in this &quot;fictional&quot; account of life at that prison camp; the commentary on humanity seen in all of his other books in the Asian Saga are first seen here. Quite simply, a MUST READ!!!"},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"This is different from the &#34;Asian Saga&#34; books. Still, it is just as excellent. Moreover, it is short and to the point.

James clavell. On. the evolution of Japan. Book. One shogun may have been the best book I ever read. I highly recommend the series to anyone who can read."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"The first book written in James Clavell's disparate six-novel \\"Asian Saga,\\" \\"King Rat\\" is nothing less than a monumental achievement.The novel is set in a prisoner-of-war camp during World War II, and its characters and their actions ring true, mainly because it is a semi-autobiographical work by Clavell, who was a POW himself. One reads details that are only accessible because the author has experienced them.The play on the words \\"King\\" and \\"Rat\\" are numerous and multilevel. The characters are in a unique Darwinistic setting, where the only rule is to survive. Each has to look out for number one, and the interplay between the characters is fascinating.It's a case of context influencing behavior, behavior that, in yet another context, would be abhorrent and immoral. It's a nightmarish stage on which the characters parade, each showing why he can or can't adapt to his environment. Prison is prison, be it a penal institution for criminals or one in which soldiers are ensconced, and one can easily draw the parallel between the two by reading this intensely readable novel.At the book's core is the transient element of power -- how it's acquired by some and how different people react to it. It's also a story of how one man can look at another and be influenced by his nature and actions, the result being the change of one's own behavior and worldview.From a microcosmic viewpoint, the tragedy and scope of World War II are depicted through the eyes of various characters. It's a thoroughly thought-provoking book, one that should be considered a classic. And though the statement is often overused, it undoubtedly applies here: This book is a must-read. It's a rare, great book, one which I cannot recommend highly enough."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"Unlike other James Clavell novels, King Rat had a point of reference in regard to a place and time that is embedded in more recent memories of people my age.It was not, in my view, as well written as the more completely fictional works but, nonetheless, it described very well the attitudes and stresses of humans in close contact, starving and in fear of death at any moment.The interplays between characters were well drawn to an extent that made up for the absence of the swashbuckling excitement of Tai Pan, Noble House and Shogun. King Rat was different, less exciting but despite that, enjoyable and informative.Sceptic Ian"},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"Terrific story, well- written. Thanks to King Rat, I'm now in the process of reading or re-reading all of Clavell's works.

I started reading King Rat thinking it would be on the same vein. At first, I thought I would stop reading it because it was about a prisoner camp but I am so happy that I persisted through the end. James Clavell's novel is such a great study of the human mind and soul. I learned a great deal and thought the novel was very thought provoking."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"King Rat has to be another one of my favorite novels, as it is not just a war story. It is a story of how characters react as their environments change.It has been a while since I have read the novel, so I will only refer to people by their ranks. The protagonist in the story is an officer (like a Captain) in the US armed forces. Then the main character is King Rat. As I recall, King Rat is non-commissioned officer (like a Sergeant). Completing the chain of command would be the enlisted men (like a private). But King Rat had the most power in the prison camp. His enlisted men treated him like a God; even Officers could come to him if they needed him.The prison was a microcosm of society. For example, there was a man that looked like a woman. Men would fight over him, so he had to be locked up at night for his protection.I don't want to give the story away, but when soldiers are released, the same men who wanted the feminine man and fought over him and wanted to have sex with him called him derogatory names and ostracized him in the outside world. So he waded into the water and drowned. It was an example of how people react to changes in environment. Those who have strong characters remain strong based on their convictions. This does not mean that they cannot change when their environments change.However, ethical people, such as the protagonist in the story, stays true to his convictions and does not yield to the masses. Others who are weak or two-faced will change to meet the change in environment, as they are more concerned with fitting in with the majority than making the moral decision. And that is why this novel mimics a morality play."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"King Rat is an American POW who economically and socially dominates a prison camp peopled with mostly British POWs of the Japanese. Life at Changi POW camp is a daily deadly race towards the time of hoped for liberation. The book operates on many levels and is infused with symbolism. One day a captured pilot, Lt Marlowe,comes to the camp and the saga of life at Changi,outside of Singapore, unravels before us.The Rat comes into conflict with the antagonist of the tale,Lt. Grey, who represents the dubious authority of those entrusted with enforcing enemy rules while keeping loyalty with their fellows. The Rat is an American enlisted man who accumulates wealth by breaking the rules that Grey must enforce. The Rat becomes a blessing to many on both sides and the object of admiration among most British officers. The Rat upturns not only the hierarchical nature of the military but symbolizes the conflict and leveling influence of free market capitalism on entrenched privilege.Perhaps the conflict in this book is also between capitalism and socialism. Perhaps The Rat is an anti socialist symbol to some while Grey is a symbol of collectivism. I think this thought is trite and lazy...what about you?As it turns out The Rat is capable of altruism despite his greed and helps in a serious medical crisis. The Rat becomes a symbol of Existential good verses mandated compliance with good rules... of free will rather than moral determinism.Camp life destroys conventional notions of right and wrong as war itself does...the camp becomes a moral desert...a rat race. A transvestite becomes the object of longing for many in the camp and then destroys himself by suicide. The Japanese themselves are caught in the web of deceit weaved by The Rat as he builds his empire on black market wealth and then destroys the authority of the camp commander who,interestingly, is a non-entity in the book. There are also literal rats in the camp.The nadir of the plot comes when The Rat decides to market a new brand of meat raised at low cost. A meat rat farm is built underneath a barracks. Rats are marketed as a new type of \\"chicken.\\" The rats struggle and feed off each other in a parody of the humans above them...a rat rat race.When the camp is closed, the place where the prisoners once lived and then vanished from is abandoned by the British...- the rat farm below,however,continues with a life-direction of its own. A new King Rat, heavy with the flesh of his comrades, emerges to carry on after the human one has left.KING RAT is worth a good read and seems written like a screenplay.

Clavell is a master of character development and as this is one of his earliest(if not earliest) works, one can see the greatness of this author who would go on to write at least one of the best books of our time (Shogun). This book which takes place in a Japanese prison camp located in Singapore Island during WW2 and it centers on one of the few Americans imprisoned among mainly British and Australian prisoners. The American thrives in this harsh environment and manages to possess more than anyone else and has a knack for making money. It is a character study about greed, friendship, war-time relationships and social hierarchy. It's a well written book and an interesting story that is remembered long after the book is read.

It's hard to explain the amazing feeling you get after reading it. you should read it. um, okay."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"this book is surely one of the best. its meaning is crystal clear : in life better strong than weak. the fact is that the king doesn't steal food or money like those weak officers , he just buys low ans sells high. what clavell wants to say to us is that making money out of other people's stupidity is much better than being stupid."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"For those of you who might think that a Clavell novel might be a little too long for you, this book is great, and the shortest of the six books in the Asian Saga. Plus it stands out in its own right as a book that will leave an impression on you. Emotionally, and as a result of reading a good book"},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"This is an excellent book, and of the Clavell books I have read (all except Gai-Jin), this has the most interesting, if not the best, ending. It seemed to me that Clavell got slightly redundant with the &quot;natural disaster&quot; ending, but he managed to avoid it in this book. I found that the way the story and the character's individual stories were resolved (or rather unresolved) fit perfectly with the insanity that would be occurring in a WWII prison camp. Oh yeah, the rest of the book is pretty cool, too"},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"I loved it! It showed how life was in a POW camp.It was a great story. It was humorous, and very original."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"I read this novel for an oral presentation in my 10th grade honors english class. This was such a good book, in fact, that I produced a 15 minute presentation and earned a grade of an A+ from a teacher that has NEVER given an A+ in 30 years of teaching.In his shortest Novel of the Asian series, Clavell fills every page with meaning. His contant references back to Christ build his every aspect of the setting. The last two pages of this novel are the best two pages of literature that I have ever seen in my 16 years on this earth. I have read and re-read them over 100 times (honest!).

It is said an authos best books are autobiographical, and this holds true here. Clavell was in a Japenese prison camp, and the charector of Marlowe is based on him. (that is made more clear in Noble House) Anyway, enjoy"},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"Great book! Compared to Clavell's other works, this is a short book, although most of his works read very well. Also, &quot;King Rat&quot; has a great ending that really sums up the meaning of the entire book, as opposed to &quot;Shogun,&quot; which was a great book, but didn't really leave the reader with one lasting &quot;lesson.&quot;"},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"With family recently traveling to Hong Kong this series by James Clavell, was the perfect gift!! Amazon delivered on time and in perfect condition!!"},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"This is my first review so bear with me. This book reminded me a lot of Catch-22 by Heller because of the wartime scene and its cast of characters. Though King Rat is not that humorous, Clavell still wrote a fascinating story.His style so easily reveals the key characters and what they're all about. Learning about King and Marlowe and Grey - early in the book, you know everything you need to know about them. The key is the dynamics between them - the interaction between them. I enjoyed every conversation between Marlowe and the King because I as the reader could feel the electricity.As it happens with any good story, you get so immersed in &quot;their&quot; (prisoners') situation, that you suddenly realize how much your view has changed throughout the story. That is good writing.I tried hard to read Clavell's Shogun - heck I went traveling to another country and still couldn't finish it - it's too long - it was a great epic but I needed answers or conclusions. King Rat is much shorter and as powerful.One other mention - the version I bought included 5 or 6 sets of 10-15 pages that discussed what happened to a few of the wives of the prisoners. You can buy either version - the story of the wives' is interesting and touching, but you're not going to get your sappy Hollywood ending in this one so it doesn't add to the story much."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"Actually, I rate this an 11. This was the first, and the fifth, and the last Clavell novel that I have read (yes, I read it three times). Clavell even coproduced an excellent movie adaptation in the late 60's (though filmed purposely in black and white) which captured the entire mood of the book. The reason that this book works so well is that Clavell himself lived the story. The character of Peter Marlowe is based on Clavell himself, and it shows.This book is a brutal, depressing display of humanity at its basest. Not for the light hearted, but a must for anyone interested in WWII or in Asia."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"First of all this is the first book I have read by James Clavell and I really enjoyed it. Some of my first thoughts were that the prison was not quite as horrible as I expected, but that is where Clavell did a good job allowing us to see the prison through the eyes of the prisoners. This was a really drmactic page turner for the specific reasons that there are so many levels of plot development and happenings.The two main characters are a British air officer named Marlowe and an American named the King. This book is of course about the psyche and human nature of survival in the face of insurmountable odds. When you read through the book you will think King is not so bad and doing what it takes to survive. By the end you will see the results of his behaviors, actions, and results. The last few pages are poetic and intense. I have read a lot of novels, and this one in my opinion is up there with the classics. Also King Rat could be read by people with all kinds of varying interests and enjoy it!"},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"As others have noted, this is James Clavell's first novel and definitely the most difficult for him to write. It deals with the Changi POW camp that Clavell himself was imprisoned in during the latter stages of the Second World War. Clavell's pain of having to revisit the very harsh memories of Changi will leave most readers with a better understanding of human sacrifice and survival.Although part of the Asian saga, King Rat can stand alone as an excellent WW2 memoir. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"This book, like all of Clavell's historical fiction, pulled me in within the first five pages. The gripping story of life within a WW2 POW camp is disturbing, enlightening and dramatic all at once. The story centers around two characters and their reactions to the horror around them. As we get deeper into their lives we begin to get a picture of why life is worth living and the way that it should be lived. The ending of the book is much more telling than the end of most of Clavell's books and does a fine job of summarizing the book's overall purpose. By far, this is the best book that I have ever read by Clavell."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"I read this book in a long London-Toronto flight. I just could not put it off.James Clavell continues to exercise its magic by creating a captivating universe that make us dream about the relative value of things. How much would you pay for a rat leg ?We follow the king in its daily rulings and dealings with its subjects, all prisonners of war in a Japanese camp during WWII. How can a corporal rule a camp and its general. How can cunning and ruthlessness elevate a man on a throne. This is a very strange american dream that is depicted in this novel.All rights reserved to The Reviewer Provided by courtesy to Amazon.com"},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"King Rat serves up a tale of advantage and envy in a less than desirable enviroment, the Changi prison. Changi prison becomes a microcosm of human nature and how base it can really sink when all the comforts and luxuries that so many take for granted are stripped away. A vicious Darwinism takes over as those who can survive and those who can't barely exist or worse. Is the Rat wrong to make himself (&amp; his cohorts to a lesser extent) as comfortable as possible during his stay in Changi? That is the question the reader has to ask themselves after reading this novel. Some of the King Rat characters are referenced further in Clavell's chronicle of the Straun family &amp; Asian business intrigue, &quot;Noble House&quot;."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"All right, so King Rat's a thriller, used bookstore fodder for thirteen year olds. It's still one of the best in the genre, with great characterizations and an ending that puts to shame most of today's &quot;profound&quot; bestsellers. King Rat differs in its psychological, internal approach to the POWs trapped inside the a Japanese camp in Singapore. Buy it for the thrills, but read it for the emotion."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"Well... I really despise reading. I hate it with a passion. There has never been a time when I decide to just &quot;pick up a book&quot; for a good time, I usually won't even consider that in my plans. However, a few summers ago I picked up King Rat. And I picked it up again a few weeks later. I lost it, but bought it last summer. I finished it in a weekend because I just couldn't put it down. I read it again a couple weeks ago. Every time you finish that book, something just comes over you, I swear it. It's the most amazing book I have ever, or will ever read in my entire life. Now that that's done, I can go paint my nails."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"At one time or another I've read most or all of James Clavell's novels. KING RAT is by far my favorite. I've lost count of the number of times I've read this novel. I also own the movie version of the story on DVD; and yes, I've lost count of the number of times I've watched the movie. I like the book better.Clavell survived as a POW in WWII. The sub-story is that the Peter Marlowe character in KING RAT is a fictionalized version of James Clavell and that the Corporal King character is a fictionalized version of the buddy in the Japanese camp who actually saved Clavell's life.I think all of Clavell's novels made it to either TV or Movie form; in some cases he wrote the screenplays, in most, not (he was too busy doing other more important things in Hollywood, or writing his next blockbuster novel). His career in Hollywood is almost as impressive as his novels (Due to lessons he learned the hard way in the POW camp? Correction: Due to lessons he learned the hard way in the POW camp!). Did you know that Clavell wrote the movie THE FLY? Did you know that Clavell co-wrote the movie THE GREAT ESCAPE? Did you know that Clavell wrote and directed the movie TO SIR, WITH LOVE?I won't sport with your intelligence by relating the plot of the famous KING RAT story as told in novel and movie beyond to say that it is the story of how an American prisoner in a Japanese internment camp became more powerful than the Japanese warden.For those fond of \\"How To\\" books like How To Succeed In Business, or How To Win At War, I wouldn't mess with SUN TZU or the latest rewording of Machiavelli. Go to KING RAT.@hg47"},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"James Clavell is renowned for his works such as _Shogun_ and _Noble House_. This darkly autobiographical novel was, so far as I am aware, his first literary work. It remains his best.Clavell was a prisoner of the Japanese. He was held at the infamous Changi prison on the eastern end of Singapore island as described in the novel. Like the protagonist, Peter Marlowe, Clavell came from a good family, though due to his eyesight he was in the Royal Artillery, not the Royal Air Force (a little harmless wish-fulfillment, there).I think the novel impresses so many readers due to its stark simplicity and forthrightness, particularly in describing the moral dilemmas that confront Marlowe. With the issue of survival in the balance, does morality become relative? Marlowe concludes that the only man who could answer his questions, his father, is dead-- killed on the Murmansk run. But just as Changi is rebirth for Marlowe, perhaps it is the King-- the trader with the Japanese-- who becomes Marlowe's father and answers those questions.There are many, many layers to this book. I have read it many times and have always walked away with something new. As with the Changi experience, itself, I sense that there is never complete resolution.Clavell died several years ago. I hope that he found peace.Add this work to testaments like Iris Chang's, _The Rape of Nanking_, as a remembrance of what the Japanese did to the defeated."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"Of all Clavell's books, this has always been my favorite. I will not deny that Clavell tends to use the same story and characters in every novel (compare shogun with tai-pan and noble house). I love all his books (even gai-jin which few seem to enjoy), but King Rat is the best. It really makes you think about human nature, and what's really important in life. All these people grew up in a certain lifestyle, and suddenly and thrown together in a POW camp, and under brutal circumstances. I have done research on POW camps at this time,and the findings are not pleasant, so it really is interesting to see how people change, and what they really value. Seeing as how Mr. Clavell spent time in Changi himself, all that we see in King Rat is an extension of that, and so you can really appreciate what he endured. It for these above reasons that I truly enjoyed this book above his other great novels, and why I have read several times over."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"King Rat has many unique aspects amongst the other novels in the Asian saga:- It was written first, with less connections to the rest of the series.- It's the shortest of the lot.- It's the most autobiographical, as Clavell spent time in that same prison.- There is the least cross-cultural interaction.Having said all of this, this WWII POW survival story is a compelling study of what people do to survive. In a sense, we all become rats, with one as king. Much of the book studies the manipulations between folks vying for power. There are the Americans trying to enforce prison standards. There are people living off of rank to hold a grasp of dignity. And then there is the King of the title, who finds a way to transcend above the problems, living off the black market and a network of informants.We are introduced to the character that most closely resembles Clavell in this novel too. Though he reappears in Noble House, we first catch the author as the King's sidekick, a downed soldier who has to struggle with where his loyalties are.I can not recommend the series enough. Whether you go through it chronologically as written, or in the order of time periods written about, you'll find this a deep addition to the series."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"This is the only only book that written that in my opinion supplants Clavell's own Shogun as perhaps the best historical novel ever written.Partly autobiographical, King Rat recounts the story of Phillip Marlowe, a character no doubt based on Clavell himself, and his years spent in the notorious Singapore POW camp known as Changi during WW2.What is so stunning about this novel, is that perhaps because of the very real life experiences that forged its narrative, it becomes more than mere words on paper, it becomes a very real world where the old class lines are broken down as officers and enlisted men sleep in the same mud huts, where getting an egg in your rice for dinner constitutes a great day, a transvestite becomes the sexual icon of the whole camp and the very concept of traditional ethics and morals are challenged.What makes this novel so very magical is that the depth with which the characters and their respective personalities and fates resonate with the readers, their laughter becomes your laughter, their sorrow becomes your sorrow, their joy becomes your joy, very rarely is a novel simultaneously able to so superbly entertain and make you affect your outlook on life, after the end of this short novel you will feel as if you have emerged from three years in a Singapore prison camp, and like the men in this novel, you will never be the same again."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"This book is lumped into the &quot;Asian Saga&quot; series of James Clavell, and yes, it takes place in Asia, but bears no other true resemblance to the rest of the saga. It's shorter, of course, but it's also not an epic...it takes place in a POW camp almost entirely.The character of King, the American trader who lives high-on-the-hog through his wheeling and dealing, is fascinating in the feelings of hatred &amp; envy he generates. Everyone wants to be close to him, not because they like him, but because he can afford to give away cigarettes, share an egg, pour coffee, etc. He has learned to manipulate the system totally to look out for #1.He makes friends with unassuming British fighter pilot Peter Marlowe, who at first acts and translator and later as partner and friend to King. His character goes through lots of development, and he is really the conscious of the camp. Although not written in the first person, we really see things through his eyes.The book is packed full of colorful characters, many sketched only briefly, yet Clavell makes us see them all, and understand them.THere are moments of high drama, where our characters are close to being caught or captured, and the plot moves at a brisk pace.I found the ending of the story to be just a tiny bit rushed, BUT it made some powerful statements. When the war ends, the fear that sweeps through the camp, first that the Japanese will take vengeance on the POWs and second, the fear of &quot;what do we do now,&quot; is very convincing. It's not what I ever thought the liberation of a POW camp would be like, and it really made me stop and think. And the dynamics that occur when the first officers from &quot;outside&quot; show up to help liberate the camp are fascinating.This book is an exploration of the human spirit that is dramatic, moving, occasionally funny and always unexpected. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!"},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"James Clavell's King Rat is a poignant, resonating tale about humanity and struggle in incredibly dire situations--namely, the World War II Japanese prison camp of Changi.The bulk of the story, consisting of the life-and-death daily turmoil among the POWs, is deeply affecting and intriguing. Clavell writes concisely and powerfully. The brief descriptions and terse dialog amplify the emotion and passion of the story. It is not often that a book is truly \\"hard to put down\\" for me, but this was one of them. The pace of the book and the compassion I developed for the characters was such that I really didn't want to stop.The ending left me profoundly melancholy--not necessarily a bad thing. Clavell creates intense moral questions for the reader about honor, duty, loyalty, love, and a thousand other human emotions. As the war ends and the prisoners are faced with the somehow-terrorizing concept of returning to normal life, the reader comes to grips with what truly matters in life, the hope and faith of the POWs, and the joy of life in the face of death.King Rat is a whirlwind of emotion and adventure. It will heighten your understanding of World War II history and leave you questioning. A grand tale."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"An American corporal manages to swindle and manipulate his way to being the &quot;King&quot; of a Japanese POW camp. The one thing that sets this aside from Clavell's three other novels that I have read, aside from being semi autobiographical is the protagonist. The King has a rascal like charm to him that makes the character highly readable and fun. He is the underdog. Plotting and conniving to make a buck and sticking it to his superiors and relishing it. A man in the right place at the right time. He befriends a British Lieutenant by the name of Marlowe (A nice little nod to Joseph Conrad) whose honor and integrity is arguably the the conflict in the book. Finally, on the opposite end of the spectrum, you have the dutiful yet pitful antagonist Lieutenant Grey. Who, while morally and lawfully in the right, alienates himself by taking himself too seriously. These three make for some great tension and are the main drive of the story.I was pleasantly surprised to find that this was not an epic, despite this being his most personal story. However, Clavell fans will not be disappointed. The protagonist thinks two steps ahead of everyone else (I would hate to play chess with the author) and I would not be surprised if King's shrewdness was a precursor to Toranaga in Shogun. Any less qualified author would have made this story into glorified genre pulp. For those struggling for a visual reference, think Bridge on the River Kwai and Pappilon. A great read and highly recommended."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"This, in my opinion, is the best of three books and movies about Japanese World War II prisoner of war camps. The others, also very good, are Bridge on the River Kwai and Empire of the Sun.The theme is how men survive in the horrendous conditions of POW camps. Set in one of the worst camps, Changi, near Singapore, an American corporal, called The King, thrives. He is street-smart, unscrupulous, the most powerful man among the 10,000 prisoners, and somewhat appealing in his vulnerability. The King is also honest -- at least about himself -- and the only other honest person in the book is his antagonist, the wretched, diarrhea-ridden British cop, Grey, who is attempting to rise above his lower-class origins. Most of the other British officers in the book are revealed to be vicious hypocrites.The King and his callow, worshipful friend, a British pilot named Marlowe, outsmart everyone...but then the war ends, and the real world begins again. This is a good tale on several levels: adventure, survival, an insider's look at a Japanese POW camp, and an examination of the differences between Brits and Americans. The movie rates five stars. The book is almost there."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"Warning: this is a disturbing book. It is gripping and enthralling, but horrifying. It shows men being tested to the utmost, and the many bad qualities this brings out. But it also shows true friendship and cooperation against adversity.Clavell truly brings to life a POW camp of Englishmen and Americans (captives of the Japanese) and the horrors they were subject to. Men help each other survive, but also betray each other, and are jealous of each other's success. The King, an American soldier, is especially envied because he is extremely skilled at trading and making deals. He and the Englishman Peter Marlowe are the main characters, but there are also stories of other men and how they survive.The ending is perhaps the most frightening part of the whole book. The prisoners are freed at the end of WWII, and as they leave the camp, they must learn to be part of the world again, and not the world they created. I won't spoil anything more. For anyone who can handle its intensity, \\"King Rat\\" is an eye-opening read."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"There we go again, after Shogun this is my second book by clavell. The best thing about the book is that the author did not try to justify the war. Japs were not the villains. Its was something bigger....situations...the situation,time was the biggest enemy. Just how mean people can get when the find themselves in bad situations. it is quiet true people can actually forget that they are fighting for the good side when it comes to saving their lifes.Mr clavel who actually went through all this, has written the book with an emotion (cant tell axactly is it anger or nostalgia)The book is a must read for every book lover"},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"Book is about World War II.Prison in Singapore,officers and soldiers,relationships,tragedy they all must go through.Very tens and brutal story."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"After reading Tai-Pan, I obviously wanted more of the same.

It's incredible how some, when put in a certain situation, die easily, while others have what it takes mentally to survive. It is an excellent book and of all of James Clavell's, this is my favorite."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"This is a magnificent book. It details the horrors of war and the inhumane conditions POWs were forced to face, but it also is a carefully crafted tale of friendship, and how people can thrive in the most unlikely places.

It will stay with you for a long time."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"I'll be honest, this is a depressing book. But it is about a depressing subject. This is a semi-autobiographical look at the author's internment in one of the Japanese's POW camps, Changi. It is a statement on the ingenuity and cunning of mankind, but also of its brutality. If you're looking for a quick, solid read, this is it."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"This was one of the best books I have ever read ... Easily, easily the best book by this author"},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"Once again James Clavell has exceeded my expectations and written a real gem.

I would encourage anyone to take the time to read this book...and then, go back and read the rest of his novels."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"The way that James Clavell compared humans to rats at the end of the book. It really showed how humans can revert to their basic instinct when it is nessesary."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"King Rat, tied with Shogun, is the best of Clavell's Asian Saga. He incorporated, and illustrated the very core of what it is to be a man. What makes this book an instant classic, is the simple, yet horrific, setting. Also, Clavell was able to fill each page with such meaning, he didn't have to make a several-hundred-page-behemoth of a book in order to digest the meaning within it. Compelling was the depth that a man falls to in such a desolate existance, and the measures required to lift a man up to some degree of dignity. For his ability to depict the strength of charicter of this western man in asia, Clavell has earned a place of honor among the great novellest of our time."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"Great!

What a masterful portrayal! Clavell is such an outstanding writer! Sho-gun was my first read.. This one is a classic also!! Recommended."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"The whole time devoted to reading this book was a magic spell to me. This book must be recommended as a text book for students. Because you can see the diffrences between haves and have-nots, how they become what they are, how strong the diffrences are. In KOREA we have a similar novel &quot;OUR DISTORTED HERO&quot; by a famous writer. but 'KING RAT&quot; is more vivid and has more juice.

I sometimes had to track down the paperback version to figure it out.These typos are prevalent and knocked a full star off my review.A scheming, hustling American Army corporal known as \\"The King\\" befriends an upper-crust Royal Air Force leftennant in a Japanese WWII POW camp. Both men adhere to well-developed, but radically different, codes of honor, and the novel is an exploration of their unlikely friendship and struggle to remain men (by their definitions) against the corrupting desolation of the prison. The matter-of-fact tone of King Rat pegs it as a 1960s paperback. Brutality and filth are background noise; the book alludes to the horrors of the camp without dwelling on them. The many characters and sub-plots of the book at times weave into complex and ingenious knots of suspense and drama, but Clavell isn't interested in calamity or resolution, so tensions are often smoothed over anti-climactically. Nothing much happens, and the pointlessness of prison life may be the point of the novel.More interesting are the exploits of \\"The King.\\" Originally presented as a conniving anti-hero, the only prisoner with a clean shirt and fresh underwear in a world where hungry men pawn their wedding rings for extra food, The King's honorable, if twisted, nature is slowly revealed and developed. Also, we come to see that the other characters in the camp, pitiable though they are, are just as corrupt as The King. There's no one to like, so the reader is left siding with the one character he/she can understand. The camp MP, a Dudley Do-Right named Lieutenant Grey, is instantly vile as the vile camp tattletale, but ends up almost the hero of the book simply because his devotion to pointless rules and laws doesn't look so bad once everyone else's dirty secrets are known.There were way too many people named \\"Sergeant\\" and \\"Colonel\\" in this novel. You'll need to put out a casting call for imaginary extras if, like me, you need to put faces to names when you read fiction.This may be the only WWII novel in which all the major characters are in the armed forces, many of them die, and yet not a single shot gets fired (okay, one bullet at the end, but it's incidental). People die from malaria, starvation, despair, snakebite, and suffocation in an outhouse (ew!) The violence in this book is largely internal and muffled.Note 1: James Clavell was a British soldier who was captured and interned in Singapore's Changi POW camp for the final months of WWII. The Changi prison of his novel is far harsher than the real POW camp was, according to most survivors and historians. (I'm sure the real Changi was no picnic, either.) Clavell is honest enough to insist in the preface that the book is entirely fictional."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"King Rat is set in a Japanese prisoner camp in World War II. Most of the novel deals with the interactions among the prisoners (who are British, Australian, American, etc.) and between the prisoners and the guards. The main theme is whether or not each prisoner is morally required to help the other prisoners, or whether in this setting it's &quot;every man for himself&quot;. The main character is someone who took every possible advantage for himself at the expense of the other prisoners. He becomes the most powerful force in the camp, but he has to sacrifice his humanity to do so. I found this book to be well written and thought provoking; I would recommend it to anyone but especially to anyone contemplating military service."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"Clavell is the best story teller of the twentieth century. His works are accurate, compelling, and timeless. An hour with this book &quot;King Rat&quot; goes by like a second. I have read Shogun, while much longer, it is also impossible to put down.

But the plot centers on an anti-hero, and shows the darker side of capitalism. A sharp break from the heroic figures of industry that I personally loved in Tai Pain and Noble House. After finishing the book you may be a little upset and wondering \\"what the point was the novel trying to get across?\\" I honestly don't know, the ending leaves you trying to figure things out on your own. But that's the beauty of the book at the same time as its biggest fault. This is a book you appreciate more and more after finishing it."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"The smallest of the Asia series focuses sharply into a POW camp in Singapore during WWII. Unlike the other installments of the series this is intensely intimate and the author does a great job expressing the feelings and agony of survival in the camp. With the constant specter of death in its many forms (tropical diseases, betrayal and starvation) hang over these men you can't help but get involved in there tale."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"I first read King Rat back in about 1988 and decided to read it again last month. Twenty-two years later, it has lost none of its greatness. I enjoyed reading it back then and I enjoyed reading it again this time around, perhaps even more so because I have learned a lot more about World War II in the Pacific theatre since then. Other reviewers have already done a splendid job of explaining the story and the reasons why they gave it five stars, I'll just toss my own five stars into the mix by saying this is a terrific book and a powerful, though-provoking story that is well worth anyone's time."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"As many have noted, King Rat is based on Clavell's own experiences at the dreaded Changi POW camp in Singapore during WWII.Filled with unforgettable scenes and characters, and tightly written, this book grabs you on the first page and never lets go.There are numerous set pieces -- the poker game, the rat farm, the diamond sale, the camp liberation, I could go on.Add to this a powerful tale of morality amid immoral conditions, and a search for what it means to be a man amid inhumane surroundings, and you have a tremendous story that is brilliantly told.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"Overall (with the exception of the ending) this book was a solid five stars and is second only to Shogun in my opinion. There are so many things going on in this book, and I could not stop turning the page.The ending on the other hand was extremely anticlimactic - hence my four-star. Sofar I have read the first four books in the Asian Saga including King Rat, and all of these books have an ending that falls flat. I was so angry when I read about what happened to the King. His sudden change in status is never really explained, and only if Clavell had made all of his endings good (Shogun was the only one with a halfway decent ending), then this series would inch its way over to a five-star rating."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"This is a brilliant work. I was fully vested in each and every character. Whether or not you like the populace of this prison camp, if you sympathize with the honest or the desperate, you will care about the men portrayed in this effort. Even the Japanese guards are well rendered and have substance. Read it!"},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"The setting is a Japanese POW camp near Singapore in early 1945. After years of Japanese neglect,near starvation diets, tropical diseases, and increasing hopelessness of liberation, British,Australian, and American prisoners are dropping like flies. A young and idealistic British pilot,Peter Marlowe, forms an unlikely friendship with a clever, street-smart enlisted American, 'theKing'. While all the prisoners are literally walking skeletons suffering from every disease thetropics have to offer, the King inexplicably manages to eat, live, and dress normally. The King'ssecret? Trading.However, in Changi trading is a zero-sum gain and absolutely forbidden. (In this strange world, thecommanding British officers strictly enforce Japanese orders against their fellow inmates.) For oneprisoner to eat, another will go hungry (ier). And the King is the master at not going hungry -looking out for No. 1. The king even outtrades his captors. Life is comparatively sweet for theKing, albeit lonely. After all, the entire camp burns with covetous envy regarding the King.Nearly, everyone depends on the King, though, to make a life-saving trade - a watch for a bowl ofrice, $20 for an orange, etc. The King decides to take the unaffected Marlowe under his wing as asort of junior partner.Marlowe is decidedly fascinated by this dynamic man (without a conscience?). And the King, in turn,remains mystified by Marlowe's idealism and self-sacrifice. The King lets Marlowe in on hisadventures and his secrets, something the whole camp would like to know, too. The ever imaginativeKing comes up with a brilliant scheme to both make money AND get revenge on his camp enemies. Andthis perverted world comes to a surrealistic end with the closing of the Pacific War. Though somesurvive Changi, the experience will haunt the survivors for the rest of their lives. The question iswho will survive.This is an outstanding book, which I read in the space of two days, barely able to put the book down.Clavell's book - based on his actual imprisonment in Changi - describes the truly surrealistic worldof an actual Japanese POW camp and the men within it. However, it is strictly a fictional account -only 2% of the prisoners held in Changi died according to the Australian War Memorial's Creation of Changi Prison Museum article by Kevin Blackburn."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"We should be really grateful for the strike that prevented Clavell to work as a screenplay writer and director for a few weeks in the early sixties and led them to write his first novel. In this edition there is a nice prologue by his daughter explaining what prompted him to write this book, and how quickly he wrote it. The novel is a fictionalized retelling of Clavell's experiences in a Japanese prisoner of war camp in Singapore.Clavell does an amazing job in describing the personalities of the different characters that take part in the story. The fact that the camp held American, English and Australian prisoners provided him with the opportunity to showcase his acute understanding of the different cultures. If you add on top of that the Japanese and the locals that were in charge of managing the camp, you will find a wealth of characters that make this a mesmerizing read. There are two characters though, that are at the center of this tale, and whose actions could serve as a study in sociology. One is an American, the King, who is a corporal that has the ability to facilitate commerce, which is prohibited by camp rules, and therefore makes a very nice living, especially when compared with everyone else. When the King meets Peter Marlowe, a British Lieutenant, the contrast of personalities and moral codes could not be clearer. Thus starts an unusual friendship that will test Marlowe's character and convictions, since he will have to decide between compromising his morals in return for better living conditions for him and his friends, and sticking to his guns and keep on living miserably.One thing that you can tell as soon as you start reading this novel, and that is confirmed later, is that Clavell is an excellent narrator and has a gift for describing characters and give them a soul. This helps understand how he can hold the reader's attention without it wavering in lengthy novels likeShogun. In this case, the parts that deal with the secret commerce help provide the story with variety, because they speed up the pace and change the tone. It is also interesting that this edition includes the passages related to the situation of those left behind, mainly wives and kids. These provide additional insights into the lives of the prisoners, helping us understand their motivations and behavior better.In summary, this can only be defined as an excellent read. Although it has some scenes that may be hard on some readers for their brutality, I believe that the great majority of people will love it."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"Circa 1962 Clavell astounds the reader with his insight to the human condition. From the beginning until the end, King Rat never ceases to surprise and evoke the dark humor concurrent withthe grim reality of terrible circumstances. I remember seeing this book in countless rucks during Viet Nam, read and re-read, taped together, dog eared and in heavily stressed condition then, passed along."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"In my honest opinion, this was one of the best books I have ever read. Its unique setting, plot, and characters make for an unforgettable read. The emotional roller coaster that King Rat takes you through is phenomenal. One minute, you could feel dire hatred toward the King because of his treatment of his fellow POWs. The next, you could be laughing hysterically due to the idea of Colonel Smedly-Taylor paying top dollar for rat legs. After that, you would be feeling sorrow and pity toward the King. No book I have read before has left such a lasting impression on me. After I was finished, I almost wished I were just beginning it so I could experience the ride all over again. I highly recommend it for anyone who wants a thoughtful, impacting story. James Clavell will forever hold a fond place in my heart."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"This is the first book that I've read by James Clavell and I'll have to say I will most likely be reading more of them. I chose to read this book as a history assignment and it is perfectly historically accurate. It shows the struggles POWs went through where tobacco is such a prized possession men stoop as low as to pick others used tobacco from the ground. The plot line is slow to realize but becomes more evident as the book becomes harder to read (pages 150 on). Overall the book really makes us feel for the people that fought for us in WW2."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"Although there is nothing patently wrong with King Rat, it is my least favorite of the first three books in Clavell's Asian Saga. The novel takes place entirely within a POW camp run by the Japanese in Singapore. The plot is engaging and I spent a couple of days eagerly flipping pages until the end, but I didn't get the sense that I had learned anything about Singapore the way that I felt I had learned about Japan and Hong Kong from reading Shogun and Taipan. In the book's defense, it is an excellent account of life in a POW camp and the ends to which people will go to survive in them, but I am hoping that King Rat is not a harbinger of things to come for the remaining books in the series."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"King Rat is a fairly accurate depiticion of life in a Japanese POW camp. He glosses over the harsher points of camp life, but leaves enough to give a good pitcure."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"I hadn't read anything of Clavell's before &quot;King Rat,&quot; so I came to him fresh and with no preconceived notions. I enjoyed this book, but found the ending somewhat unsatisfying.Still, I would recommend &quot;King Rat&quot; for its apparently realistic view of the horrors of a POW camp and the lengths to which the human spirit will go to survive. The main character IS an interesting fellow."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"This is my first James Clavell novel. In a nutshell, it is a Japanese version of Stalag 17. It is the story of American, British, and Australian POW's at Changi prison camp. A place where the real world is turned completely upside down. In addition to being prisoners, the POW's find their ranks are meaningless. Devoid of societal/military rules &quot;the strong&quot; survive. #1 is &quot;the King,&quot; an American corporal who runs the prison camp from the inside.The King effectively manipulates everyone in the camp from Colonels on down, through his payroll system. If you want money, eggs, cigarettes, medicine, you have to see the King. If you want to sell something, everyone knows you go through the King.Suspense is derived from the near misses of getting caught by the Japanese or the pip-squeak MP, Captain Grey. Grey's sole motivation is catching the King &quot;breaking the rules.&quot; Much of the action is seen through the eyes of Peter Marlowe, an affable English lieutenant to whom the King takes a liking due to his command of the local language and it's value to the King in trading and conversing with the guards.The King teeters on the edge of good and evil throughout the book, never completely falling off the fence to either side. Under the circumstances, the reader tends to forgive the King's &quot;business&quot; dealings over this lack of compassion for the suffering around him. But when the suffering befalls Marlowe, the King reacts as a true friend and saves Marlowe's arm from amputation.The finale is somewhat ambiguous and anticlimactic. The man who was once on top, the King, is reduced to a lowly corporal again and the many officers and outranking enlisted men are quick to see the King put back into his place when they are rescued and order is restored.The books is adequate at best as there are no major conflicts or plot twists. But it is one of the few books telling the story of a Japanese POW camp."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"I had read this book over 30 years ago as a teenager and thought it would be interesting to see how I reacted to it now. It's a fun and easy read, I'll admit that. But I can see why I liked it more as a 14-year-old; the book seems to have been written by a 14-year-old. And the \\"moral dilemmas\\" are of the kind you probably dealt with when you first learned what a \\"moral dilemma\\" is.And although the copy I read was a paperback from the early 1980's that was in its umpteenth printing, it had a surprising number of typos and major grammatical errors. I guess even back then no one took the book too seriously."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"I read this when I was 15, so I don't know if it was 'deep' or anything, but I can say I enjoyed it quite a bit."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"After Shogun one would expect much better. Compared with Shogun, King Rat is rather 2D. The plot is not as engrossing. I think readers will have a difficult time getting into the story. The ending is somewhat predictable (what do YOU think happens to all the prisoners?)and there are many things that are never explained (who is the informant that knew about the radio? ). On the whole an entertaining book, but it moves slowly and doesnt go anywhere (how exciting can life in a prison be anyway? :P )"},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"I really enjoyed the first 100 pages of King Rat and expected good things from the remaining chapters. But the novel goes downhill as the reader is forced to learn more about Peter Marlowe, a character I suspect we're supposed to admire for his complexity. The dialogue between prisoners is forced and the sub-plots are only of marginal interest. I found myself skimming the final third of the novel, as concentrating on it was much too painful.With a 4 and 1/2 star rating, a prospective reader would think they were buying \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\". Same goes for all of the books on Amazon that suffer from 'grade inflation'. With every novel commanding 4 or more stars, what's left to differentiate the great novels?"},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"I'd heard such good things about this book, and couldn't wait to read it. Unfortunately, I found it really slow. I read the paperback version, and to be honest, I couldn't bring myself to finish the book. Major disappointment."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"the book is ok but I am very dissapointed in the condition of the book as I am reading it it is falling apart from the binding and it was listed as good condition but in my opion it was in poor condition water stains yellowing pages and binding is falling apart for the price I paid I expected better quality I doubt that I will purchase thru this group ever again Sharyl"},{"Title":"The Sexiest Dead Man Alive","review":"Declan is a famous singer and songwriter. He lived life in the fast lane, and after a fatal tragedy left his brother dead, he decided to take a breather, and then allowed the world to think he was dead.Fast forward several years, and his career as a songwriter continues, though in secrecy. He writes songs for dying children, and when one of his songs garners a lot of attention, he is afraid that his insular life will change. Coincidentally, he has just hired a sexy new chef (he was tired of all those TV dinners).He lives the dark, and communicates with Rosalie via sound system. She has never met him, but really likes the voice. When she goes to investigate an odd noise, and finds the security guard out cold, she runs into his room, and discovers who her mystery boss is. Soon the two are involved in a passionate relationship that is soon threatened when a private investigator is hot on Declan's tail regarding that song.Though Declan loves Rosalie, he does not want to thrust her into the public out of fear that it will destroy her life as it did his brother. He is also a little disconcerted that she appears to have taken her status as his former chef to make a name for herself (though she denies all rumors that they were intimate).Will Declan get over his fears and welcome Rosalie into his heart? The plot is inventive and fresh and the characters quirky and endearing. Each chapter begins with a menu item which no doubt is on the menu at Rosalie's restaurant. You won't regret picking this one up!"},{"Title":"The Sexiest Dead Man Alive","review":"Good story that is hard to put down, although it moves a bit slow. The character, Declan, is a bit whiny, but, Rose is delightful. The thing that bothers me the most is the book cover. Most people probably don't think the cover of the book matters, but, sometimes it's what sparks your first interest. If I hadn't read the synopsis, I would not have purchased this book. The cover gives the reader the impression that this book is of lower grade. Also, the cover actor is not attractive and doesn't even remotely resemble the description of the character in the book. I think there would be more readers if the cover were more appealing."},{"Title":"The Sexiest Dead Man Alive","review":"I loved reading this book, I thought Rose was a great character, she was funny, sarcastic and tough when it needed done. But, Declan was such a big whiny baby. Could it be more about him?! Yes, fame and fortune come with a price, but hey people seem to live with it. He acted like he was the only one that this had ever happend to. All else was good."},{"Title":"The Sexiest Dead Man Alive","review":"\`The sexiest dead man alive' by Jane Blackwood has a mix of romance, hot tempers and grieving parents. Declan has been hiding out in his fortress for two years and then hires Rose to be his personal chef. Rose was hired for the job without ever meeting her new boss but has the \`hots' for him by just his voice. The secondary story of parents dealing with their little daughter's death was heartbreaking. This was pleasant afternoon read. I would recommend this novel and A Hard Man Is Good To Find by Jane Blackwood."},{"Title":"The Sexiest Dead Man Alive","review":"OK, here is the thing. The book was ok, not bad really. It had an ok plot, good dialouge and a prety good cast of characters. All except Decland. Now, he was an ok guy sometimes. For the rest of the book he is so self centered and his ego is so big that he cannot see past it to the fact that life in general does not revolve around him. That he is not God and that all things do not happen because he is alive. Throught the book it did not get better like it is suppose to, but worse. He would drone on and on to the point where you want to smack him and are yelling at your book. Its unbelievable. Rose is a sweetheart. She is sunny and warm and funny. Paired with an ego. Now, Decland does get a reality check and you see his light bulb turn on when he realises that he is not the world, but he does not redeam himself enough at all. Not even close. Being the *ss he was, another half of a book could have been written and he still would nto be redeamed enough. And I hear that her second book is worse the this one. Not good. I thought this was an ok book, but I would not recommend you buy it, library it."},{"Title":"The Sexiest Dead Man Alive","review":"I cannot agree with the positive reviews of this novel, because I could not stand Declan McDonald the hero of this story who was self centered, selfish, inconsiderate and downright annoying from beginning to end. The only saving grace to this book is its spotty humor and the heroine Rose. I was hoping that Declan would mellow out and stop feeling sorry for himself, but that never happen. Why Rose would fall in love with such a wimp and why Declan, a gorgeous, superstar who loved to write songs and sing, could think his life was awful was beyond my comprehension. His constant complaining and feeling sorry for himself just got to me. So many pages were wasted on his lamentations that I kept hoping Rose would find someone else and give Declan the brush off he deserved. I have absolutely no sympathy for someone who has everything who hates his life and feels sorry for himself. If you think you can stand that type of character by all means read this book - otherwise pass. By the way there are some very depressing segments in this book that that gave me another reason not to like it, but obviously did not bother other readers - at least these events were a relief from Declan's constant complaining."},{"Title":"The Sexiest Dead Man Alive","review":"I loved this book! I have passed it around to all my friends, and they have all enjoyed it. I will read just about anything, and this is one of the funniest ever. Yet it doesn't forget the romance, or the plot. This book has it all. If I find myself in a bad mood, all I have to do is pick it up and start reading anywhere, and the bad mood is gone."},{"Title":"The Sexiest Dead Man Alive","review":"I picked this book up at my church book fair for 25 cents, not having a clue what it was about. I didn't even read the back cover. I ended up absolutely loving this book. I could not put it down. I thought the story line was original and engaging, and you really felt the romance between Declon and Rose. The beginning was suspenseful trying to figure out who the mystery man was. You just really wanted things to work out with them throughout the whole book. I found myself thinking about the characters for days after I finished reading. I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a great romance novel."},{"Title":"The Sexiest Dead Man Alive","review":"I really did enjoy this book. But I agree with the reviewer from CA who said that Declan was a little 'wishy-washy'. His repeated insistance on sparing Rose future torment by distancing himself did get a little irksome. Overall the book was a great, fast-paced read and I really look forward to her next one."},{"Title":"The Sexiest Dead Man Alive","review":"Loved this book so much I hated to see it end. I was pondering for awhile about buying this book, but in the end I am so glad I did. I look forward to more books by Ms. Blackwood."},{"Title":"The Sexiest Dead Man Alive","review":"I picked up this book and read the first paragraph and had to read the rest of it. The front cover blurb really is true. Jane Blackwood did a truly fine job making her story, and her heroine real. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because the hero was just a little too conflicted for me. At times he seemed like a wishy-washy girl. I kept thinking, \\"Just make up your mind!\\"But the book was worth it. It deals with Italian food (yum), mourning the loss of a loved one, the conflict between movie stars and the press that hound them, and thr eternal hope that it will all end well. I totally sympathized with this story. A lot of the time I wonder what the hell is so interesting about famous people, except that they are very good at what they do. And this book touches on some good points. Rose's quips made me laugh and wish I could think of jokes like she does. Declan made me think about Brad Pitt's body. And there was a touching secondary story that really struck true. For those of you who like strong women, hot guys, laughs, sex, forgiveness, and love -- give this book a try."},{"Title":"The Sexiest Dead Man Alive","review":"The cover draws you in. The front cover review is intriguing and the back cover story line seals the deal. I'm so happy I cozied up to read this book. I'm tempted to say &quot;I laughed, I cried I etc., etc.&quot;. What better fantasy than a mystery hero who is every woman's dream man. Declan fits the bill. And Rose, in spite of a free spirit and strong convictions just can't help herself. I picture Tom Cruise as the recluse and dare I say it, Penelope Cruz as the heroine. In the end, this is not just about man meets woman. There are sub plots that tear at your heart. I heartily recommend it."},{"Title":"The Sexiest Dead Man Alive","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Like the 1st reviewer said, I, too, read the first page and had to keep reading.Ms. Blackwood writes great humor. I laughed out loud several times. If you are looking for a read that is funny, but not fluffy, this is it. Very good!"},{"Title":"President Reagan: the Triumph of Imagination","review":"Richard Reeves is a self proclaimed liberal. A funny thing happened to this author while writing this book, he learned to like and respect Ronald Reagan. In the end he wrote a fair and intriguing portrayl of the 40th U.S. President.The first biography written using recently released records from the Reagan White House, Reeves compiles a revealing portrait. Reeves debunks the popularly accepted myth that Reagan was driven by his wife and his staff. The book shows a President who knew what he wanted to acomplish and how to get there. He dreamed big dreams and pressed those that worked for him to get them done.The most exceptional revelation is that he often overuled the First Lady in her concerns and objections. He stubbornly dismissed her repeated calls for him to fire Chief of Staff Don Regan during the Iran-Contra scandal.Reeves also debunks some of the pro-Reagan myths including his promise to reduce the size of the federal government and the deficit while both grew by leaps and bounds during his two terms. He also shows that both Reagans were disciples of astrology long before the assasination attempt on his life.I have read many Reagan biographies including the mis-guided DUTCH and the previuosly definitive book by Lou Cannon. Reeves' work on Reagan is now the ultimate biography of this President exploring every facet of his Presidency and presenting a balanced and thorough review of his eight years in office."},{"Title":"President Reagan: the Triumph of Imagination","review":"The author's work on two previous presidents(Kennedy & Nixon)were gripping in their readability and sense that one was reading a new slant on old facts. This one reads like a collection of NY Times articles--indeed he seems to rely on the Times coverage for much of the book, listing the headlines on a half dozen occasions. It is not 'slanted' in a harsh way, Reeves makes clear that he is writing as a liberal but he doesn't neglect the obvious appeal Reagan had for Americans across the board. There is a lot on Iran/contra--maybe too much and one wished for more about the situation in Poland and Reagan's influence there along with that of John Paul II. However, it is good to be reminded that not all the \\"experts\\" really understood what happened in 1986/7 when Reagan and Gorbachov had their meetings.One(George Will) even suggested the Cold War was \\"lost\\" during these meetings--which looks now like nonsense. Not his best presidential book, not as multifaceted as Wills' \\"Reagan's America\\" but not a dud either."},{"Title":"President Reagan: the Triumph of Imagination","review":"A local candidate for the city council here in Colorado Springs announced that he was running as a \\"Reagan Republican.\\" Frankly, I was somewhat perplexed by what he meant by that. Did this mean that he was running as a \\"mainstream\\" centrist Republican or did it mean that he is running as a conservative Republican well to the right in the political spectrum? It's hard to know these days since Reagan re-defined the GOP. When Reagan stumped for Goldwater in 1964, he was regarded as a right wingnut. Even during his tenure as Governor of California, he was perceived as being well to the right within the ranks of his party. Nowadays, he is viewed by most political observers as representing the \\"centrist\\" faction of the Republican Party.This is a testament to the Gipper's profound influence on the GOP. He clearly moved his party well to the right. Reeves begrudgingly acknowledges that, despite his own personal animosity toward the policies of Ronald Reagan, that he defined Republicanism as we know it today.Some facts need to be ackowledged from the get-go. First, Reeves is no fan of Ronald Reagan. He states quite frankly his own distaste for most of Reagan's poliicies. Second, his task was an awesomely difficult one; to capture the essence of a man that virtually everyone agrees is impossible to know. Ronald Reagan, by all accounts, was a personally remote and self-contained individual. Efforts to capture \\"the real Reagan\\" are doomed to failure. Reeves does the best that he can, given the nature of his subject.The author has been criticized for his heavy reliance on already published secondary sources written by disgruntled former Reagan staffers. It is true that his source material is not original. For those who have read the previously published books and articles about Reagan, they may find little that they didn't know already.However, I think that Reeves does a creditable job of collecting a nice volume of inside information on the Reagan presidency. His chapters on the arms control negotiations with Gorbachev are nicely done. The reader gets a true birdseye view of what transpired behind closed doors. These chapters are the best in the book.Elsewhere, Reeves is dismissively contemptuous of a man that he considered a half-step from senility. He recounts numerous episodes of Reagan's inattentiveness and lax work habits.Reeve's book will ultimately stand as a begrudging back-handed tribute to a President that he couldn't stomach. If you're waiting for an even-handed, comprehensive account of the Reagan presidency, good luck to you. It will be difficult to find."},{"Title":"President Reagan: the Triumph of Imagination","review":"This review refers to the unabridged audio cassette edition of \\"President Reagan: The Triumph of Imagination\\" by Richard Reeves (Recorded Books)- Narrated by George WilsonThis book is not a complete biography of President Regean, but rather focuses on his very challenging political and personal times in the White House. It is a completely absorbing and thouroughly researched and reported account of the years that define the 80's. There is included many detailed political facts, figures,and quotations from various sources.It is not a lopsided or sugar-coated account, but reports on all sides of the spectrum, the good, the bad, and the ocassional goofy happenings(like when Reagan didn't know the microphone was on and joked about being at war with Russia - let the bombings begin!)Reagan was a man with a vision for returning to the old fashioned times. But with things moving along quite steadily in space, arms, disease(it took him a couple of years before he could say the word AIDS in public),terrorism. federal spending, this was a tough ideal to hold on to. Above and through all, he was at all times a very patriotic man. The first president to have been described in the form of a noun - Reaganism, and a Conservative Repulican who usually carried a high approval rating even by the younger voters. Noted for his positive outlook, and joke cracking(sometimes repeating the same old jokes) even after being shot in an assassination attempt. And when his rating did drop a bit, he would quip that that was no problem, he'll just go out and get shot again. An actor turned politiican he was always on stage, and his way with words and patriotism seemed to endear him to the American People. It was just \\"Reaganism\\"But the issues through the 80's were serious.Here's a sampling: the deficit,an unbalanced budged, the assassination attempt, terrorist hijackings,the Challenger disaster,arms and arms control,\\"Reaganomics\\",the Nicaraguans, the Russians, Greneda, Iran,Iraq, Israel,the Iran-Conta hearings(and Oliver North),atstrologists advising on good and bad days,and signs of Alzheimer's beginning to show - toward the end of his 2nd term an assissant was overheard telling him that he(Reagan) was in the oval office getting ready for an interview. And even though his health was beginning to fail him, he still managed to improve relations with Russian leaders. He made a difference.The book just doesn't touch on these subjects, it gives an in depth look at all sides of the situations.Also getting into Reagan's private thoughts as there are many diary entries as well. Narrator George Wilson gave an amazing reading. He not only kept me enthralled - there were many facts and figures to digest and I think listening to them was helpful - he became the characters that were speaking. He sounded so much like Reagan, at first I thought they were recordings of some sort, also getting the voices and nuances of many of the major players in the story just right as well. V.P. George Bush, Journalist Tom Brokaw,and others.History buffs will love this one. There are 18 cassettes - with great sound quality - with 26 hours of the 1980's to relive.The only thing this audio edition didn't have, that I sometimes find helpful with bios and nonfiction accounts was the bibliography and any notes that might have gone along with the reading. But still a 5 star read for audio enthusiasts.Enjoy the read.....Laurie"},{"Title":"President Reagan: the Triumph of Imagination","review":"Nice, not great. This is 30,000 ft fly by of the Reagan presidency. I was a bit surprised by it's lack of depth in some story lines but you can't put everything into one book. I know there is a liberal basis to the book and that was ok with me since I see myself as an independent. I didn't want to read a pro or con book about Reagan, just some interesting facts. That's about all you'll get, basically press releases from all 8 years of the Reagan administration. One thing this book did for me is motivate me to read other books to get a different perspective. So, for that I am thankful."},{"Title":"President Reagan: the Triumph of Imagination","review":"Richard Reeves estimates that over 900 books have been written on Ronald Reagan. This is an astonishing output for a man who left office just two decades ago. Unfortunately, many if not most books on Reagan are hagiographies designed to further a right-wing agenda. The most amusing trait such Reagan books have is they all portray Reagan as an uncompromising right-wing ideologue. Read this book to find the real Reagan. Reagan was indeed a conservative ideologically but Reagan was willing to compromise. Reagan's record going back to his days as the governor of California is replete with examples of Reagan shunting aside ideology to make a compromise. Reagan subscribed to the \\"half a loaf\\" theory of legislation. Reagan also was not the ideologically consistent paragon his hagiographers paint him to be. Taxation is the best example. Reagan hagiographies point to Reagan reducing the top tax bracket from 70% to 28% but ignore the realities of Reagan's record on taxes. Reagan--realizing supply-side economics was not working and was leading to massive deficits--went back to raise taxes practically every year of his presidency (especially regressive taxes such as excise taxes)! The Reagan administration euphemized these as \\"revenue enhancements\\", not tax increases. When Reagan reduced the top rate to 28% in 1986 it was in conjunction with a liberal Democratic senator (Bill Bradley) and they agreed that changes should be revenue neutral (offsetting tax rate reductions with the elimination of tax loopholes).Reagan mythology matters because every Republican presidential candidate has to conform to this impossible to match myth--a standard Reagan himself could not meet. Reeves is able to cut through the smoke because of his technique of writing presidential biographies in which he focuses on the world as the president saw it. Namely, he focuses on the advise a president is given by his advisers and the information he was aware of before reaching a decision. The Reagan that emerges through the smoke is a pragmatic one. This technique renders Reeves' liberalism to irrelevant. The book is about what Reagan saw, heard, and did. There is not much in the way of analysis of his actions and their consequences, which is the chief reason this book is a 4 star, not a 5 star book.The most interesting parts of the books are those about Reagan dealing with the USSR in his second term, his first year in office when he successfully forged a bipartisan coalition to pass his tax and budget cuts. The weakest part is, in my opinion, an inordinate amount of time spent on the Reagan administration's covert actions in Central America.Why is the book called President Reagan: The Triumph of Imagination? There is little analysis in this book but what little there is concerns the 40th president's personality. Reagan was a stubborn man who clung to a warped view of the world as he believed it to be. The book shows Reagan's overlooked tendency to flat out make things up--and then to genuinely believe that they were true (the most famous example of this is Reagan believing he fought in World War II and liberating a Nazi concentration camp--when he was in California filming war movies the entire time!). However, Reeves also points out that Reagan was a much harder worker than he was given credit for at the time by his political opponents. Among the Reagan myths shattered in this book is the myth--this one a liberal myth--that Reagan was a stooge controlled by his staff. In this book it is shown that in the end it was Reagan who was running the show, although he rarely concerned himself with the details of governing.President Reagan: the Role of a Lifetime (Lou Cannon) is the other excellent book on the Reagan presidency. It is probably a superior book. For someone interested in Reagan I would recommend reading that book before this one. However, this book is indispensable in any Reagan library. If you are just a student of presidential history I would recommend this book since its style provides more insight on what it is like to be president than Lou Cannon's book. Both of these books are significantly superior to Edmund Morris' Dutch. Morris is an excellent writer but Dutch's bizarre style renders that book average."},{"Title":"President Reagan: the Triumph of Imagination","review":"I found this book in the bargain section of Borders for $5 and decided to pick it up, as I haven't read too many books about Reagan, even though I was born during his presidency. This is not a definitive biography, or even a very thorough treatment of the 40th president, despite its 490 page legnth. Instead, this book is a play-by-play of the Reagan presidency; from the day he took office in 1981 to the day he left in 1989.What I like about this book is its brevity. There is no hero-worship here, like you hear from many commentators and politicians today. The book amazed me with just how many momentous events happened during the 1980's and how the Reagain administration dealt with it. Politically, Reagan's actions seemed to me very similar to today. Reagan succeeded an unpopular president and invoked the bad memories of his predecessor whenever possible. Reeves guides the reader through the ups and downs of Reagan's political fortunes with consummate skill, never letting us forget that there was a lot of opposition and criticism of him, even though both his elections were very soundly won. Reeves describes Reagan's political manuevers and the actions of his staff very well. His descriptions of the meetings with Gorbachev are probably the book's strongest sections. Here, he succeeds in telling the story with an engaging \\"fly on the wall\\" intimacy, which is a pleasure to read.The weak points of the book are the lack of narrative, organization, and contextual significance. Reeves never gives any perspective on the consequences or larger meanings of Reagan's actions. He just says what he did. This is fine for a journalist but poor for an historian, who is supposed to sum up and find meaning from events. The chapters are titled by a date; none of those dates seem to be particularly meaningful. He skips between subjects abruptly, which gets quite distracting. Has he never heard of transitions? The characters are often not properly identified, often leaving the reader to search throughout the book to figure out exactly who did what, particularly when it came to staff changes.Thematic organization might have helped. Intead, Reeves takes the reader through the Reagain years almost day-by-day, without offering any guideposts or indications of what happened before or what will happen after. Lack of coherent organization is this book's greatest weakness, followed by a lack of historical significance of everything in the book.Some reviewers have mentioned bias. Reeves admits in the introduction that he did not and still does not agree with Reagan's policies nor did he particularly like the man. So there is no hidden agenda; he laid his opinions out clearly. However, I find most of the book is fairly complimentary. At about the 2/3rds point, he gets into the Iran-Contra scandal in depth, which he set the stage for throughout the book (the closest thing to a narrative connection he offers). This section is the most critical, as he suggests that Reagan did not have full mental capacity by 1986-87. Overall, though, the book is relatively without harsh judgement, and about as good as can be expected from someone who didn't like the man at the time.Again, this is by no means definitive, and seems to be overdependent on staff memoirs, recollections, and interviews that may be biased themselves, as well as newspaper accounts - especially op-eds and the New York Times. There seemed to be little of the actual workings, motivations, thoughts of Reagan himself. Instead, its more how those under him and reporters perceived him, except concerning the Gorbachev sections. He includes a section detailing his trouble with accessing documents from the Reagan library. Perhaps that's a reason for some weaknesses.If you want a thorough biography of Reagan, there are better ones out there. But if you want to get a sense of presidential politics of the 1980's as it happened and as it was perceived at the time, this is a great book for you."},{"Title":"President Reagan: the Triumph of Imagination","review":"Every biographer of a figure as big and as opinion-provoking as Ronald Reagan is going to have presuppositions when coming to his or her subject. Reeves is no exception. Being a self-professed liberal, he obviously views Reagan through that lens, and that, by absolute necessity, colors his approach. Nevertheless, I think that for the most part his treatment of Reagan is relatively fair. However, there is some settling of scores in his overall evaluation of Reagan's presidency in the last chapter, and literally the last word in the entire work is from a severe Reagan critic.But Reeves also reveals a begrudging respect for Reagan's skills as a politician and as a leader. He often counter-poses the scoffing of Reagan's critics with his actual performance, which regularly exceeded expectations. Where Reagan succeeded, Reeves gives him credit. Where failed or where he blundered, Reeves covers that as well. This is what biographers are supposed to do.The main weakness of the book, ironically, is its underlying theme, which its subtitle suggests. Reeves believes that Reagan \\"imagined\\" an America that possibly (or even probably!) never existed, and that this vision motivated him to imagine a future for the country that drove his conservative ideology. To Reeves' Reagan, what others called a \\"revolution,\\" was actually a \\"restoration\\" of the values of that original \\"imagined\\" America. This is deep, deep cynicism, and a more than a little tiring. If Reagan was deluded into believing his own imaginings, it must have been some sort of mass delusion, because it resonated (and resonates) with a huge number of Americans.But from a strictly factual perspective, this is a useful and informative book. While I am inclined to appreciate Reagan, I also believe that his admirers are better served by knowing the truth about his foibles and mistakes. Reeves' book can aid in that. Perhaps it should be read in tandem with a more \\"friendly\\" biography. I hope that there is one out there that while coming from a different political perspective from Reeves, is also as realistic about the man and his presidency."},{"Title":"President Reagan: the Triumph of Imagination","review":"The purpose of any book review is to give the reader enough information to decide if they want to invest the time and money in reading the book in its entirety. Richard Reeves, a distinguished former reporter for \\"The New York Times,\\" has tackled a difficult subject in writing a biography of a politician who still engenders strong emotions in people of a positive and negative nature. You need not share Ronald Reagan's politics (Reeves does not), to find this an interesting and enjoyable read.From the subtitle, Reeves makes his interpretation clear. Reagan was not \\"a tired old man we elected king,\\" but rather a bold, dynamic politician who left behind a strong and powerful legacy. This book is revisionist in that it challenges the idea that Reagan was often \\"absent without leave\\" while in office. Reeves has done a good job of developing Reagan's voice, using notes, letters, and other records that the President left behind. Much of what he uses is new.Reagan was, according to Reeves, a big idea man. He thought up new ideas and left the details to others. In comparison, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill thought up big, creative ideas and had a good sense of strategy, but also liked to interject himself into the implementation of these ideas. Jimmy Carter, who was at the White House just before Reagan, had little vision and tended to interject himself into the implementation of policy even when he had a limited understanding of the topic. Reagan was often faulted in office for being detached from his job--like when no one on his staff woke him up to inform him of a dog fight between U.S. and Libyan fighter planes--but given the number of issues that one address in the Oval Office, his interest in the big picture looks pretty sound to Reeves.This book has its limits, though. This is not a full-fledged biography. Reeves looks just at the presidential years. Readers wanting to know about Reagan's background will be disappointed. Reflecting his training as a political reporter, Reeves shows a preference for the political process rather than policy. He skips some of the weightier issue that Presidents address like international finance, commerce, and trade policy. These topics get at best only superficial coverage. Reeves does focuses on tax and budget issues, which were of great interest to Reagan. Like many Presidents, Reagan often had enormous influence on areas that were of little personal interest to him and by ignoring these topics, Reeves does not do full justice to his subject.Still, as a first draft of history, this ain't too bad."},{"Title":"President Reagan: the Triumph of Imagination","review":"This book shows that Ronald Reagan was a great president through a carefully researched reconstruction of what happened and what was said. Richard Reeves meticulously worked to find out what Reagan knew and thought, when Reagan knew and thought it, and then how Reagan and his administration acted. The book benefits from the treasure of Reagan archives that were made available shortly before Reeves researched this book.\\"President Reagan: The Triumph of Imagination\\" portrays Reagan honestly and not like the Godzilla-monster war monger that neo-cons want you to believe about Reagan. That's not Reagan. He was strong and firm in his convictions, but also warm and willing to negotiate with people who were capable of honestly dealing with him. He sought \\"peace through strength.\\" One of his greatest assets was knowing the difference between when he could deal with others and when he had to be firm.He saw that he could change the dynamic of the Cold War, bring change to Eastern Europe, and work with the reformer Gorbachev, but Reagan also knew to be careful with the quicksand called the Middle East. After the bombing of marines in Lebanon, Reagan got out.One startling fact about Reagan is that he believed nuclear weapons to be immoral and sincerely feared the Armegeddon. Briefly Reagan thought he could reach his dream of abolishing all nukes. The actual transcripts of the summit in Iceland with Gorbachev show that Reagan and Gorbachev tentatively agreed to abolish all nuclear weapons. Reeves does a wonderful job of telling the story, sentence by sentence, when Reagan told his advisors the news. You must read this book.Originally Reeves did not like Reagan, but after carefully learning about the real Ronald Reagan, Reeves clearly was deeply impressed and had a change of opinion. Richard Reeves describes Ronald Reagan as a man who knew \\"how to be President, who knows that the job is not to manage the government but to lead a nation. In many ways, a quarter century later, he is still leading. As his vice president, George H.W. Bush, said after Reagan was shot and hospitalized in 1981: 'We will act as if he were here.' He is a heroic figure if not always a hero. He did not destroy communism, as his champions claim, but he knew it would self-destruct and hastened the collapse. No small thing. He believed the Soviet Union was evil and he had contempt for the established American policies of containment and d&eacute;tente. Asked about his own Cold War strategy, he answered: 'We win. They lose!'According to an article in the Wall Street Journal in June of 2007, Rudy Giuliani named this book as one of five leadership books he found inspiring. Giuliani said, \\"My wife, Judith, recently bought me Richard Reeves's book (subtitled \\"The Triumph of Imagination\\"), which excels in depicting Ronald Reagan's management style and unrelenting pursuit of his core principles: the restoration of the American spirit, limited government, a strong defense and the defeat of communism. For a longer-range look at the experiences that shaped Reagan's values, I recommend \\"The Role of a Lifetime\\" and 'A Life in Politics,' both by Lou Cannon, both works that do a remarkable job of revealing the character of this amazing man.\\"Despite the reactionary reviews from those who probably prefer the Godzilla-monster Reagan, this is a good biography that shows the greatness of Reagan. I also liked the Reagan biography called \\"Fate, Freedom and the Making of History\\" by John Patrick Diggins. Both books benefit from the recently-released Reagan archives and deserve five stars."},{"Title":"President Reagan: the Triumph of Imagination","review":"Unlike any other presidential historian, Richard Reeves understands the emotional core of the story of the Oval Office: it is an action story, filled with epic conflict, constant tragedy, and sporadic comedy, populated by a fascinating constellation of supporting characters.At the center of Reeves' drama is an American Giant, Ronald Reagan, revealed not through the comic-book idolatrous haze of conservative hero-worshippers or the empty cliches of liberal Reagan-haters, but through the unfolding, day-to-day action inside Reagan's White House. Reeves handles Reagan's strengths, weaknesses, complexities and contradictions without a shred of ideological bias and creates a rich portrait of a great, flawed man who understood like FDR and JFK that the first job of a president is to make Americans believe they are capable of doing great things.Ironically, Reagan's greatest historical achievement was that he ignored the bad advice of his neo-con advisers, led by Richard Perle, and personally engineered radical, sweeping arms control breakthroughs with his junior partner Gorbachev. When the door was closed, Reagan was literally pushing not only for deep nuclear cuts, but total abolition of nuclear weapons!At the time, Reagan was condemned by conservatives for Munich-like appeasement. Today, it's clear he was a visionary who should be revered by both the left and the right as The Most Radical Anti-Nuclear Leader of the Nuclear Age.My only complaint with this book is that Reeves relies a bit much on recycling contemporaneous press coverage. All in all, a great read and a definitive companion piece to Lou Cannon's monumental Reagan books."},{"Title":"President Reagan: the Triumph of Imagination","review":"Having read Reeves's two excellent previous works on Kennedy and Nixon, I was looking forward to his Reagan book. Fortunately, I didn't purchase it and took it out from the library. This book offered little in the way of depth, detail, or worthy analysis. A good comparsion is the dropoff between Tom Clancy's early works and his oft lampooned Op Center! It was almost as if Reeves spent little time on research and traded in his cache as a respected presidential historian in order to make a quick buck. I expect to see this poor excuse for history in the 4.95 dollar pile at the Strand within a few months, and even then I won't buy it."},{"Title":"President Reagan: the Triumph of Imagination","review":"If you want to read a book about President Reagan, this is not the book to read. In reality, Reeves paints a word portrait of Reagan as Reeves would like you to believe Reagan was. It is written as though Reeves were present at every meeting of Reagan's eight years of presidency. He starts off with a day-to-day rundown of life as President, and with the word-by-word dialogue Reeves uses, the reader would think that Reeves actually was present. However, as the book continues, a spirit of vindictiveness in the author becomes apparent. Using every quote he could find by disgruntled people, ex-cabinet members, Reagan's enemies, as well as the liberal media, Reeves paints a picture of Reagan as a bungling old fool who didn't do anything while he was in office, and that if something good did happen, the reason was not because of Reagan's doing. The book closes with this quote on page 490 about Reagan's funeral: \\" \`God, this is impressive,' said Steven Weisman, a New York Times White House correspondent during the Reagan years. \`But the man they're talking about is not the President I covered every day.' \\" If you disliked Reagan, I can not imagine why you would want to read this 500-page book about him, even if you think Reeves' picture is what you want to believe. If you liked Reagan, you surely do not want to wade through this 500-page negation. And if you really want to get to know Reagan, there have been over 900 books written about him. So, I am sure you can find a better and more subjective book than this one."},{"Title":"President Reagan: the Triumph of Imagination","review":"This book is written by a liberal -and in my opinion-for liberals. If you are a conservative and a fan of Reagan I don't recommend it. Instead, I'd site a work like 'Ronald Reagan' by Dinesh D'Souza."},{"Title":"President Reagan: the Triumph of Imagination","review":"I couldn't finish it, it got to a point where I couldn't trust what the author was saying because there were many times when Reeves seemed to intentionally discredit Reagan and conservatism. It was bearable at first, but after a while became too much to handle.It's not necessarily just about my own bias. If I were to read about FDR, I wouldn't want a biased conservative, or at least I'd want the author to be fair and unbalanced in the book's writing.With that said I'd certainly read a Kennedy book by Reeves, which I know he's written."},{"Title":"President Reagan: the Triumph of Imagination","review":"I'm shocked at the worship of President Reagan and this book is proof! Unbelieveable, amazing that no one will ever write a critical thing about Ronald Reagan."},{"Title":"President Reagan: the Triumph of Imagination","review":"Reagan began his acting career reading cue-cards in the service of General Electric during his stint at the \\"GE Playhouse.\\" Reagan's move to the White House had him doing much the same, reading cue-cards written for him by Big Business, including GE, a weapons and energy conglomerate that owns NBC.If people want to get a good feel for the Reagan administration, I'd recommend the books of Michael Parenti, who documents the legacy of dirty wars in Latin America and the global class war that is turning our planet into a dystopia of haves and have-nots. Globalized \\"Reaganomics\\" (aka, neoliberalism) is creating a planet of slums and prisons, war and ecocide. The parts of government that served the general public are being shredded, while the entitlement programs of war profiteers and various robber barrons create record profits.It's interesting to see the reverence Kim Jong Reagan receives; but whether people like him or not is immaterial, he wasn't in charge of the country. Rather, very rich and powerful corporate executives and an army of lawyers and lobbyists entrenched themselves during the Reagan administration. This corporate coup is something that many presidents have warned us about, including President Martin Van Buren who said, \\"I am more than ever convinced of the dangers to which the free and unbiased exercise of political opinion - the only sure foundation and safeguard of republican government - would be exposed by any further increase in the already overgrown influence of corporate authorities.\\"If people can break-away from the Reagan illusion, and want to learn about real power in this country, I'd recommend the DVD \\"The Corporation,\\" and the books and radio show of Thom Hartmann."},{"Title":"President Reagan: the Triumph of Imagination","review":"In \\"President Reagan: The Triumph Of Imagination\\", Richard Reeves provides the reader with a detailed history of the events of the Reagan Administration. Many of the key initiatives, reactions, triumphs and failures of the Administration, including the enactment of the economic recovery program, problems with Secretary of State Haig, the intervention in Lebanon, support of the contras, negotiations for the release of American hostages in Lebanon and the resulting Iran-Contra scandal, brushes with terrorists, controversies over the placement of missiles in Europe, Bitberg, and arms control and other negotiations with Gorbachev are presented in detail that I had not picked up at the time or in reading since.The title sets out the scope of this tome. It is, first, about President Reagan. It is not a whole life biography. His pre-White House life is related only in terms of explaining the source of the world view which focused Reagan's vision during his presidential years.The theme of the book is hinted at in the subtitle \\"Triumph of Imagination.\\" Throughout the book, Richard Reeves uses the concept of Imagination to describe Reagan's apparent disconnect from reality. Throughout the book Reeves implies, without actually saying, that Reagan was showing signs of Alzheimer's while serving as president. The Reagan detractor will find much \\"Imagination\\" to enjoy in the characterization of Reagan as a declining old man who imagined a world that never really existed and accomplishments that were never really achieved. These very characterizations Reaganites will find irritating. Some of these irritating observations are noted by other historians, such as Dinesh D'Souza in \\" Ronald Reagan: How An Ordinary Man Became An Extraordinary Leader\\" (see my Amazon.com review) The Reaganite, however will find much \\"Triumph\\" to appreciate. While Reagan may have deluded himself when his imagined world did not correspond perfectly with reality, he also imagined things that never were and made them happen. That is the \\"Triumph\\" in the \\"Triumph of Imaginations\\" and that, not even Richard Reeves, would dare take away from Ronald Reagan."},{"Title":"President Reagan: the Triumph of Imagination","review":"Reeves did not start out this book as a fan of Reagan, if fact as a progressive, Reeves thought of Reagan as an obtuse man, that just possessed great charisma and charm, he came away with a great appreciation for this singular man. This is a very good book, it teals new ground and I loved the story of the Russian telling someone how Reagan was like the a very smart Lion, he just layed quitely and rested and everytime he opened his eyes the prey was closer, then before the prey knew it he was standing over the old Lion and fade to black, instintanions death, the Russian was describing the way Reagan was cleaning Gorbachev's clock. Everyone has an opinion on Reagan, and the Reagan administrations slow movenment at the start of the AIDS crisis is the huge stain of his presidency, it's absolutly unforgivable, and is Reagans great shame because it happened on his watch and it cost millions of innocent lives, but I think everyone agrees that all and all, this was the right man at the right time, he reserected Americans pride and he spent the Soviet Union into oblivian. Reeves is no Reaganite and he gives a very balanced bio on Reagan, but you come way, like Reeves did with a real appreciation for this man, he believed in the American dream, after all this poor boy, with a tough childhood, and with average intelligence, lived it."},{"Title":"President Reagan: the Triumph of Imagination","review":"The public often forgets that there is the privileged right and the earned right. Reagan was the later. This biography is of a man who came from rural Illinois, grew up with a dreamer alcoholic father, became the man of the house while still a teenager, and made his own way from Illinois to California to the White House. Like his ideological soulmate, Margaret Thatcher, Reagan rescued the American economy after the hyper-inflation of the 1970's. Reaganomics fueled the boom years in the 80's and in the 90's long after he retired from public life. President Reagan's record as time passes reveals more about a man who did in the end ... lead his country with a vision."},{"Title":"President Reagan: the Triumph of Imagination","review":"The Washington Post review of Reeves' Reagan suggests that the author looks at selective days in the President's life from a point of fly-on-the-wall omniscience. Reeves in fact seems to always be looking for a fly or flaw in the ointment, and his omniscience is that of the New York Times, for which he worked.Five flaccid or failed presidencies before Reagan's had seemed to prove that the office was dangerous and devouring, that nobody in the modern era could succeed and survive as president. Two decades of presidential failure mirrored national decline. America and its leaders, on top of the world for brief shining moments after WWII, were either pitiful helpless giants or were merely pitiful and helpless. Then Reagan happened. Like FDR in 1933, Reagan survived, succeeded, and prevailed. Like FDR in 1936, Reagan's bold persistent experimentations with new relations between government and governed were rewarded with overwhelming vindication in 1984. To Reeves, Reagan's reelection and what it meant seem not to matter. Reagan's electoral triumph gets a grudging paragraph from Reeves, and his lead-up to November 1984 is a set-piece swoon for Walter Mondale, Reagan's opponent. Then Reeves moves briskly to the story he really wants to tell, a New-York-Times-eye-view of Iran-contra. Reeves looks at Reagan's triumph and sees a continuation of the long line of presidential failure.Here are the little tricks that give Reeves' game away: Liberal criticisms of Reagan by Times guys, Tip O'Neill, Brokaw, Rather, and Jennings are carefully quoted. Then, for fairness and balance, conservative criticisms of Reagan are carefully quoted too. Reeves rolls out George Will or Margaret Thatcher or Barry Goldwater or Peggy Noonan on those occasions when they say something that makes Reagan look bad. Almost without exception their contribution to the fairness and balance of Reeves' Reagan is pejorative. Same for fly-on-the-wall flip-offs from administration insiders such as Stockman, Deaver, Haig, or Don Regan. Reeves drags his conservative characters on stage only when he can use them to bash conservatism, and his only raves for Ron (after his excellent discussion of the president's near death experience in 1981) are muted back-hand compliments, usually in footnotes, from French socialist Mitterand and from Soviet arms negotiators.Reeves is not blatant in his dishonesty (although he claims that Reagan often was), but he has cherrypicked intel to produce a paid political announcement for the prosecution. It's not a lie, but it's not the truth. It's what we see in the New York Times: All the slanted news that's printed to fit the Northeast liberal consensus that dominated America's Big Media before Reagan got his horse's nose under the tent."},{"Title":"President Reagan: the Triumph of Imagination","review":"I disagree with the reviewers who feel that this book is not worthwhile reading, as it does provide some fresh insight into Ronald Reagan's character and his style as president. That being said, one is still not entirely convinced, or satisfied, with Reeeve's portrayal of the president, particularly in its analysis (or, rather, its lack of) of his capacity as a leader of the American people. Perhaps the fault is not entirely with Reeves in this regard, as Reagan was quite a complex man; certainly far more complex than he is made out to be by his left-wing enemies, and more complex, too, than those on the right who see him as a towering, heroic figure. Overall, the book is worthwhile, but not definitive."},{"Title":"President Reagan: the Triumph of Imagination","review":"The subtitle of this book is important. By \\"imagination\\" Richard Reeves means the combination of idealistic vision, dogged determination and sheer likeability that made Ronald Reagan so popular despite his obvious intellectual limitations and his capacity for mixing fact and fiction in public statements.Reeves sums up the man: He \\"knew how to be President\\" and he also understood that his most important job was to lead the nation, not just to manage the government.Reeves admits up front that he does not share Reagan's right-leaning political philosophy and tries to give him the benefit of the doubt when he can. Nonetheless, the portrait that emerges is one of a man with a limited grasp of the intricacies of world affairs and increasingly out of touch with important events that were swirling around him. He was \\"a man who knew what he believed\\" --- even when what he believed was palpably wrong. The public aura of adulation that grew up around him was sustained, says Reeves, by fiercely protective aides who told him what to say, protected him from adversaries and stage-managed his public appearances.One major theme that emerges from these pages --- and the reader may fear that it applies to many another recent President --- is the huge difference between what the public is told and the reality of their government's private actions. We read of top-level officials dishing out facts and figures that they know to be false, of covert actions undertaken and then denied, of quotes made up out of whole cloth by press secretaries. Am I the only reader nave enough to find all this discouraging?This book is devoted entirely to the eight years of Reagan's Presidency. It is thoroughly researched and engagingly written. All the big moments of Reagan's tenure are there: Iran-Contra, the Reykjavik summit with Gorbachev, Bitburg, \\"Star Wars,\\" the assassination attempt of 1981.Reagan is portrayed as a man driven by a few simplistic ideas --- America as a land specially favored by God, government as the problem rather than the solution, anyone who disagreed with him as at best deluded and at worst evil. There is a colorful gallery of villains --- Alexander Haig, arrogant and power-mad; Oliver North, duplicitous and self-righteous; Donald Regan, the officious treasury secretary and (later) chief of staff; hapless conspirators like John Poindexter and Robert MacFarlane. And yes, the strong influence exerted on Reagan by his iron-willed wife is given full play.Reagan's inability to focus on what was going on around him, according to Reeves, reached alarming proportions toward the end of his second term and kept his aides scurrying, first to help him function and then to keep his condition from becoming public. There is a rich lode of anecdotes, some of them relayed by former Reagan staffers who wrote books after leaving their jobs: Reagan falling asleep during a meeting with the Pope, his wife hurling a vulgar epithet at the press, five-year-old Chelsea Clinton writing to urge Reagan not to visit the Bitburg cemetery (\\"Dear Mr. President: I have seen The Sound of Music. The Nazis don't look like nice people...\\").Try though he does, on balance Richard Reeves does not paint a favorable picture of Ronald Reagan. His book is not a hatchet job by any means, but it steadily undermines the aura of sainthood that admirers have created around Reagan. Reeves's very last sentence seems to sum up his own attitude by quoting a fellow journalist watching the elaborate funeral ceremonies that followed Reagan's death in 2004: \\"God, this is impressive --- but the man they're talking about is not the President I covered every day.\\"--- Reviewed by Robert Finn"},{"Title":"President Reagan: the Triumph of Imagination","review":"I'm not sure what book some of the reviewers here are reading, but it cannot be the same tome. Some claim this book is contemptuous towards Reagan, but I cannot detect a hint of that so-called \\"contempt\\" in this book, and this is coming from someone who believes that Reagan was the best President of the past fifty years, though obviously that is not saying much. Rather, what I see is a revealing, fair account of Reagan and his legacy. Certainly, many sections of the book do not give Reagan as much credit as I feel he deserves, but that is the great beauty of an unbiased biography, rather than an overly sycophantic or critical one - you get to see Reagan not as a God, but as the wrinkled, tired and yet majestic lion in winter that he really was. In all honesty, the book is so scrupulously fair to Reagan that though there were times when I believed the author was a closet conservative and still other times when I thought he must be a flaming liberal, those moments were so fleeting as to be mere flashes of consciousness - now here, now gone. In the capacity of being balanced, Mr. Reeves' biography is an enviable achievement. My one complaint is that the biography only covers Reagan's presidency, without his earlier years as context, but perhaps that is to desire too much of a good thing. Ultimately, whether you like Reagan or not, you will find something to enjoy in this book, though you may also find yourself occasionally shifting uncomfortably in your seat as the reality of his Presidency gently intrudes on your mind."},{"Title":"President Reagan: the Triumph of Imagination","review":"Richard Reeves frequently lets his personal liberal bias get in the way of recognizing Reagan's greatness as a leader. He makes many insinuations that Reagan is lazy. Reeves has difficulty recognizing that Reagan had a plan to rebuild the United States from the Carter negatives to the Reagan positives. Still, in all, the biography of his presidency allows the Regan personality and magnetism to shine through Reeves' negativism."},{"Title":"President Reagan: the Triumph of Imagination","review":"Reeves trots out every disgruntled employee (lots of Donald Regan) to paint a biased, one-sided, portrait of Ronald Reagan. He purposely minimizes accomplishments and reduces Reagan to a lucky, out-of touch, and corny \\"old man.\\"President Reagan was, of course, not the saint that the Republicans seem/want to believe, but it's painfully obvious that the current super-heated turf wars between the major parties make any honest appraisal of the man impossible in the near term.The mean-spirited hatchet job that Richard Reeves delivers is shameful (and his contempt for the American electorate is staggering). At times it reads like Kitty Kelly. Too bad. I was looking forward to a comprehensive look at those years.I bought RR: The Triumph of Imagination at Costco for $19."},{"Title":"President Reagan: the Triumph of Imagination","review":"Richard Reeves delivers yet another well done biography of a United States president. For those unfamiliar with Reeves style, his presidential biographies start with day one in office and end on the day the president leaves office. It really gives an inside view to what a day in the life of that president is like. So there is a note of caution since the book moves linearly and not topically it requires a great deal of extra attention as you may see one thing about Iran Contra but then go thirty pages before seeing something else about it. Like Reeves other presidential biographies there is also a human theme to underscore the understanding of the president and in this case it is that Reagan while not an expert of all the facts knew how to use the imagination of the American public to be the president they needed at the time.This book does not portray him as a crusader against the evil empire, or the grand architect of Soviet defeat but for what he was; a man who held great zeal and passion for a brand of religious conservatism and a belief that people should be free. This book tracks through the good and the bad addressing the issues that plague Reagan's legacy. From the widening gap of wealth and the diminishing welfare services, the myth that he was often asleep at the wheel, and that Reagan was a war monger who abhorred peace. While Reeves does not agree with Reagan's politics he provides a fairly objective analysis on a president whose legacy still guides a party and insight into the man that Ronald Reagan was. For those who want to understand more about a fascinating modern politician this is the prefect place to start and well worth the time to read."},{"Title":"President Reagan: the Triumph of Imagination","review":"Historian Richard Reeves, who has made a literary career exploring the White House years of many of the more recent occupants of the Oval Office wrote last year's best selling non-fiction book \`President Reagan: The Triumph of Imagination,' a biographical examination of America's 40th president.This work on Reagan's time in Washington is Reeves' eleventh book and his third biography of a chief executive's tenure solely in the White House. He previously wrote about the presidential reign of Richard Nixon and John Kennedy. He is currently the Senior Lecturer at the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Southern California and a syndicated columnist whose column has appeared in more than 100 newspapers since 1979.Reeves published his first book, \`A Ford, not a Lincoln' in 1975. His tome \`President Kennedy: Profile of Power' is considered the authoritative work on the 35th president and won several national awards including being named the Best Non-Fiction Book of 1993 by Time Magazine and Book of the Year by the Washington Monthly.Twenty-six years after Ronald Reagan became president and changed the course of America, Reeves has written a surprising and revealing portrait of one of the most important leaders of the twentieth century. As he did in his bestselling books \`President Kennedy: Profile of Power' and \`President Nixon: Alone in the White House,' Reeves used newly declassified documents and hundreds of interviews to show a president at work day by day, sometimes minute by minute over the 40th president's two terms by selecting certain highlights in his eight years in office.'President Reagan: The Triumph of Imagination' is the storyof an accomplished politician, a bold, sometimes reckless leader, a gambler of what he believed to be right, a man who imagined an American past and an American future and made them real.Reagan is revealed to be a man of ideas who changed the world for better or worse with his own vision of good and right, a leader who understood that words are often more important than deeds in dealing with others, whether they be aides, the public, politicians with opposing viewpoints or world leaders. Reeves shows a man who understood how to be the president, who realized that the job is not to manage the government but to lead the nation. Reeves writes that in many ways, especially in the conservative movement of today a quarter of a century later, Reagan is still leading the charge.As his vice president, George H. W. Bush, said after Reagan was shot in an assassination attempt and hospitalized in March, 1981, \\"We will act as if he were here.\\"Reeves shows Reagan to be a heroic figure if not always a hero. He did not destroy communism, as his champions claim, but knew it would self-destruct and hastened the collapse by the build-up of America's military might in the 1980's. He believed the Soviet Union was evil and had contempt for the established American policies of containment and d&eacute;tente that was advocated by his many contemporaries and prior presidential officeholders. Asked about his own Cold War strategy, he answered, \\"We win. They lose!\\"Like one of his own personal heroes, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Reagan became larger than life. But as Roosevelt became an icon central to American liberalism, Reagan was the nucleus holding together American conservatism. He is the only president whose name became a political creed, a noun not an adjective: \`Reaganism.'Reeves claims through his liberal bias that Reagan's ideas were so old they seemed new. He preached individualism that many found to be inspiring yet also cruel. He dumbed-down America, brilliantly blending fact and fiction, transforming political debate into emotion-driven entertainment. He recklessly mortgaged America with uncontrolled military spending, less taxation, and more debt.In focusing on the key moments of the Reagan presidency, Reeves recounts the amazing resiliency of Reagan as the real \`comeback kid,' long before the term was used on Bill Clinton. Here is a seventy-year-old man coming back from a near-fatal gunshot wound, from cancer, from the worst recession in American history. Then, in personal despair as his administration was shredded by the lying and secrets of hidden wars and double-dealing, he was able to forge one of history's amazing relationships with the leader of \`the Evil Empire.' That story is told for the first time using the transcripts of the Reagan-Gorbachev meetings, the climax of an epic story, as if he were here to tell us in how own unique style.After Dwight Eisenhower's two full terms, we had five presidents in a row who didn't complete eight years in office until Reagan did so twenty-eight years later. Now we're going to have two chief executives in a row who will have served two terms. Is this now considered to be a new trend started again by Reagan or a continuance of what once was the norm of presidential politics that was maintained by George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and others in the course of American history?"},{"Title":"President Reagan: the Triumph of Imagination","review":"I have to admit that I was not a fan of President Reagan's during his presidency. In my own words, I thought that \\"the Iran-Contra affair was the biggest threat to our democracy since Nixon trying to hold on to the presidency after Watergate\\". I have since changed my mind, at least on President Reagan, and even on Oliver North, who I have had the pleasure of meeting at a book signing.I have to admit that I find Reeves' rehashing of the Reagan years enlightening in that I had forgotten so much of what had gone on, and it was interesting to read some of the behind the scenes details, although I had to wonder where some of the information came from. There were times when Reeves just could not avoid the backhanded remark, which was irritating at times. I also felt that he was struggling when he had to say something that might be construed as positive about Reagan. Be that as it may, it wasn't a bad read if you take into account the writer's view.Ronald Reagan certainly had his flaws. Everyone does. Great people are not always great people behind closed doors. This does not diminish the fact that they rose to the occasion when it presented itself, and one way or the other made the right decision. After reading Reeves' book, I came to the conclusion that the United States would be a much lesser county without Ronald Reagan.Reeves' book also convinced me that we need a great leader, much like Ronald Reagan, again. We need a leader who not only has the courage to make the tough, unpopular, decisions, but who can also communicate their beliefs in such a way that inspires the Nation, and the world, to do great things.If you can filter the author's bias, then I would recommend the book. The advantage of the author's bias is that what may have been glossed over, ignored, or buried under the apologetics of a completely pro-Reagan author, comes out in the raw with maybe some opinionated remarks. The reader can then weed out the remarks and come to their own conclusion."},{"Title":"President Reagan: the Triumph of Imagination","review":"This book is an excellent overview of the Reagan presidency. All the major events are covered: the early tax cuts, the assassination attempt, the bombings in Lebanon and the Israeli-Lebanese war, the invasion of Grenada, the wars in Central America and the Iran-Contra scandal, the 1986 tax reform bill, and the negotiations with Gorbachev, to name just a few. The book is full of quotes from people within the administration. The reader really gets an inside look at the administration and the way that President Reagan operated as well as the often bitter conflicts within the administration. The book is also full of personal touches and details. The reader really gets a sense of the personalities behind the names.There are already quite a few reviews of this book, so rather than trying to write a more in depth summary, I would like to say a few words about the supposed \\"bias\\" of the author, and the general question of \\"bias\\" in history writing. Reagan is a very polarizing figure so there are always going to be reviewers claiming that the author of any book about Reagan is \\"biased\\" one way or the other. There are a number of one star reviews of this book, but I think it speaks well of the author that the one star reviews make opposite claims. There are some one star reviews that claim this book is nothing but a \\"hatchet job\\" meant to make Reagan look like a fool. There are also some one star reviewers who accuse Reeves of \\"worshipping Reagan\\" and not being critical enough. The fact that this book can be read in both ways suggests that the author is relatively balanced.In reality the book leans more towards the critical side. Reagan does often come off as being a bit simplistic in his thinking (though this may be accurate). There are two points I want to make in response to those who would like to write this book off for being too biased. First, there is no way to be \\"unbiased\\" when writing history because our language has evaluations built into it. There is no \\"neutral\\" way to describe history that would not imply evaluations. That means that it is impossible to do what so many people seem to demand, namely, write an entirely unbiased account of the Reagan presidency.The second point I would make is this: pointing out places where Reeves is critical of Reagan is not enough to prove that he is \\"biased\\" in the sense of not being objective in his judgments. To prove bias it would be necessary to show that those criticisms are wrong or inaccurate. Too many people cry fowl as soon as they perceive anything resembling critical judgment, as opposed to straight forward narration, but they forget that sometimes criticisms are valid, and it would be ridiculous to accuse people of being \\"biased\\" for making valid criticisms. If I were to write a biography of Hitler in which I was critical of his racial policies no one would accuse me of bias because we all agree that the holocaust was a very bad thing. To claim that any \\"criticism\\" is \\"bias\\" is the same thing as saying \\"there is no such thing as valid criticism\\" and I do not believe that anybody really believes that.If you want to argue that an author is biased, therefore, it is necessary to provide an argument for why their criticisms are invalid and there are two general ways to do this, 1) you can claim that the criticism is factually inaccurate (for example, if someone criticizes Reagan for increasing the deficit you can argue that Reagan's policies were not really responsible for increasing the deficit), or 2) you can claim that the values that are behind the criticism are not objective values (to use the same example, you could argue that large deficits are not really a bad thing). If you are unable to provide some version of one of those arguments than any claim about the \\"bias\\" of an author is itself merely the result of an opposite \\"bias\\" and is pretty much useless.All of this is merely my way of saying: I would not let any of the one star reviews, claiming bias on Reeves' part, dissuade anyone from reading this book. It is really an excellent introduction to the Reagan presidency."},{"Title":"President Reagan: the Triumph of Imagination","review":"Towards the end of President Reagan: The Triumph of Imagination, Richard Reeves references the multiple books underwritten by the Hoover Institute and the Heritage Foundation which have sought to lionize Reagan. Based on Reeves' title choice, I thought I might be in for one of those. I also recalled a few reviews when the book came out that discussed Reeves' style, which seems to use documents and interviews to reconstruct conversations. As I listened to this on CD and did not read it, I could not check the footnotes to see how all of the quotations were reconstructed.Starting with these somewhat diminished expectations, I was impressed with Reeves detailed account of the Reagan presidency. Although Reeves calls it a day by day, hour by hour, and even minute by minute account, I would argue that the book is written episodically. When certain issues come on the scene, they dominate sections of the book. For example, most of the last third of the book is devoted to Iran-Contra and US/Soviet Summits. While these issues certainly dominated the headlines in the last third of Reagan's presidency, it is difficult to believe Reagan himself and the multitude of aides were not engaged in anything else. This is not really a criticism of the book, just an observation.There are two major themes that run through the entire book, despite the \\"episode\\" at issue. These are scandals besides Iran-Contra and Reagan's memory. Regarding the scandals, it is common for political biographies to mention ever mini-scandal that occurs and Reeves' book is no different. Although Michael Deaver was out of the White House when he was in a corruption scandal, the book spends a bit of time on it. As for Reagan's memory, there are multiple mentions and observations of his memory's shortcomings. Because these events are reconstructed from other people's writings and memories, we are getting multiple perspectives and Reeves never really addresses what the state of Reagan's memory actually was during his presidency.Another observation about the book is that it does not really touch on the 1984 presidential campaign with any detail, so do not expect to learn much about it except some highlights most readers of this book probably already know."},{"Title":"President Reagan: the Triumph of Imagination","review":"This book appears to be a well researched biography of Regan's eight years as president. It is very well read by the reader. His impersonation of Regan's speech, voice, inflection is particularly well done. The author offers deep insight into the character of all players. Rich in historical facts."},{"Title":"President Reagan: the Triumph of Imagination","review":"Reeves is a master of letting the camera lens tell a story. This is a book for those who appreciate nuance and perspective. There are endless examples of President Reagan's strategic brilliance, his consistent principles and the masterful way he changed the world. Along the way, we learn, in very illuminating examples, how dead wrong, elitist and narrow-minded Reagan's critics were. Many of Reagan's critics are the same people who now condemn President Bush. Reeves reports what happened in a very interesting way and lets the reader reach his/her own conclusion. Highly recommended for anyone wanting an inside look into one of our greatest Presidents."},{"Title":"President Reagan: the Triumph of Imagination","review":"It is sad and dumbfounding to read the negative comments by those who cannot stomach any criticism or praise of Pres. Reagan. I was very young when he was elected governor of my home state, but I was interested in him since then. I admit to not have ever voted for him, but that is not to say that I found him unlikable or uninteresting.This book is carefully crafted to give as fair a reading of Reagan as I have thus far seen. I don't touch the obviously partisan writers such as Peggy Noonan. The author quotes extensively from first hand sources and strives to give context to each significant issue of Reagan's presidency. From these sources and stories, it is obvious that Reagan was a much more formidable president than what he may sometimes have seemed. But, it was also obvious that a case for impeachment could have been made. Not noted in this book is House Majority leader's Tip O'Neil's refusal to consider an impeachment investigation for the good of the country. A sentiment that seems so out-of-place in the Congress of the last 15 years.There were times during the Reagan presidency when he amused me and instructed me on political intelligence. There were also times when he saddened and angered me with his war-like diatribes. He may have sincerely believed that giving Iranians weapons to exchange for hostages was noble, but he lacked the elementary logic to notice that more hostages were then taken for further weapon negotiations.All of these memories and emotions came forth as I read this book. I remembered why I could admire him, but not vote for him. These remembrances were mostly missing when I witnessed his funeral here in Washington D.C.Those now in charge of the Reagan legacy diminish him as a person and a president by refusing to consider all parts of his person and presidency. They began this process when he became too ill to comment in public. They treated him like he was already dead and in a Stalinist purge removed all aspects of Reagan that did not conform to their ideology. As the author quoted one person commenting on Reagan's funeral, they honored a man different from the one that I remember. I guess for politics, as with war, truth is the first casualty. It is too bad that Ronald Reagan had to also be a victim."},{"Title":"President Reagan: the Triumph of Imagination","review":"Presidential biographer Richard Reeves continues placing academic scholarship before political partisanship in this biography of Ronald Reagan. His latest presidential study examines how Ronald Reagan became ensconced as one of the greatest presidents of the 20th Century ---even while pointedly attacking and dismantling the New Deal itself---one of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's crowning achievements----and FDR being that Century's other great president.Reagan was able to achieve this contradiction through understanding how messages are effectively articulated. Because the specific message therefore mattered less than how the message was delivered, it was possible for the B-movie actor to rise into the White House. In 1985's \\"Back to the Future\\", a 1955 Doc Emmett Brown expresses shock that Ronald Reagan became president in the 1980's because this character had believed the voters would place more emphasis on presidential substance as opposed to image. Yet, from the historic Kennedy-Nixon debates onward, the television era emphasizes style of all politicians as essential to their achieving the office and policies.Reeves, a self-described liberal, insists that Reagan did have ideas of his own. Instead of seeing a fresh future, Reagan's America saw a very idealized and \`safe' past. All problems would be solved and order restored if only we could go back to \`the way things were'. A kinder-gentler extension of Nixon's pioneering \`southern strategy', this perspective relied on universal \`feel good' images and intentionally shied away from earlier harsh \`law and order motifs' promoting racial division and disharmony. Demonstrating just how masterful Reagan was with images, the head of American government succeeded with some measure of convincing people that the government itself is bad and the private sector offers real solutions to problems.This repositioning of American politics was so successful that we Democrats found ourselves portrayed as 'big government liberals'-and consequently stigmatized. Thinking of themselves as individual taxpayers instead of citizens for a common good, the American public came to distrust the very same ethos which rescued the country from both the Great Depression and won World War II. Bill Clinton would become the first Democratic president since Jimmy Carter only after assuring voters he was a \`new Democrat' who shared this limited economic policy-essentially having toappropriate portions of Reagan.Despite Reagan's \`cold-war warrior' reputation, he and Mikhail Gorbachev actually enjoyed a symbiotic partnership. Growing up in the last decade of the cold war, I found this portion of the book especially intriguing. The superficially peaceful collapse of communism had (like so many things in politics) a sophisticated reality. Both leaders intentionally used each other to cover up numerous policy failings and salvage political reputations as they were leaving office during the period. Reagan needed to \`end communism' in order to bolster his otherwise thin resume of accomplishments dotted with serious policy failures---including the unfolding Iran-Contra scandal. However, Reeves stresses that Reagan was not completely spared attacks on this strategy---and some of it came from a rather unlikely source.Contrasting with the left who had opposed his economic and social policies, the harshest criticism now came from fellow conservatives---certain that America lost the Cold War. After all of the swaggering and military build-up that he previously had promoted, how could Reagan simply let the USSR go about its own business? Why was he not going in and ending communism? How ironic that many of those same critics are now at the forefront to ensconce Reagan's name and image on every conceivable institution imaginable.This book is far from being the definitive Reagan biography (I am of the school which says biographies are always revised) but it is an interesting read."},{"Title":"President Reagan: the Triumph of Imagination","review":"While it does cover some of his acomplishments, it focuses on unsupported claims of his critics.

It includes some design tips sections on color, taking great photos, and other topics, which I found useful, as well as \\"assignments\\" in each section to spur you to actually create something.It's not exactly a book on scrapping on a budget (for example, some of the cardstock-only and one-embellishment pages leaned toward using extremely large photos - not really the most cost-effective choice), but overall very encouraging for those who like simple and effective design, who are on a budget, or who may want to avoid crowding their pages with too many goodies."},{"Title":"Step Up Your Scrapbooking","review":"I'm a big fan of Lisa's work and this book was outstanding.

I also found it to be quite annoying that the author repeated word for word some blurb about finding inspiration in her neighborhood. I felt like she was just trying to fill up space and insult the reader. The book could have used a lot more variety toward the last chapters when they brought in more elements to the pages.

Pictured by FREDERIC REMINGTON.","review":"This Dover edition makes available an important though almost never read collection of short stories and novellas by Hamlin Garland. Written at a time when his &quot;Realist&quot; and &quot;Naturalist&quot; compatriots were filling their work with grossly caricatured Indian characters (or leaving them out entirely, e.g. Henry James, WD Howells), this book of Garland's not only presents complex Indian characters, but in many cases has them speaking in their own voices. The finely realized novella &quot;Silent Eaters,&quot; for which this collection is the only current source, is a fictionalized biography of Sitting Bull told through the voice of an Indian boy named Iapi. All historical events are drawn from interviews Garland conducted with associates of Sitting Bull, not derived from white histories. By today's standards, these stories are probably &quot;colonial.&quot; After all, they are written by a white male who co-opted Native stories for his own profit and who also tended to adopt a somewhat paternalistic attitude toward the newly defeated (1890-1920) tribes. But in the context of the almost genocidal rhetoric coming from Mark Twain, Frank Oz, and others during this period, Garland's work becomes more noteworthy. The original edition (Harper Bros., 1923) included very disturbing racist illustrations by Frederick Remington (Garland disliked both the man and the illustrations), and I hope that this Dover edition retains them, for historical reasons if for nothing else. Highly recommended for students of Garland, naturalism, realism, veritism, or &quot;local color.&quot; Also a must for students of Native representations in Anglo literature.

But, being an American in the end of the twentieth century, Neville uses the process philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead and the metaphysical concepts of the ontology of Martin Heidegger, together with contemporary quantum physics theory and the big-bang theory, to give us an holistic account of the concept of time as examined through the context of Eternity, that is complimentary to Christianity thought, Buddhizm and Zen. No other book that I have read deals with such a deep philosophical question concerning time in such a broad context. You can never tell if neville is more faitefull to modern science, continental philosophy, religion or eastern thought. Neville is a modern theologian, a briliant scholar, that does not forget modern science, and treat it with due respect, like he treats continental philosophy and metaphysics. Although he deals with religion, metaphysics, moral philosophy, philosophy of science, physics and zen philosophy, Neville never fails the temptation to write in a popular way or in indoctrinical voice. He truly take the imposible task to write a complete metaphysic of time and Eternity, in the same context that Hegel judged Descartes, Spinoza, Liebnitz, Lock, Berckly and Hume to have their own metaphysics. Because Neville's book borrows from three main systems, that is from Bergson, Whitehead and Heidegger, and synthesise them together in order to find the answear to the question of time as this concept is used in physics, western culture, Budhism, Judaism and Christianity, it is not too exaggerated to claim that it is an original thought that have its place as one of western culture keystones - but still, only intellectualy, since this book is very rarly known in philosophical circles and university departments. The only flaw of this book is the trust that Neville feels (to my mind) towards the western modern sciences of astronomy, chemistry, physics and astrophysics. It seems to me that in bringing science into philosophy Neville have made this book a waste in a hundred years from now: it will be old instead of immortal. As science change, it will make this book redundant. For now, this book have a superb analysis of self-will and self-responsibility, that is based on its excellent understanding of the meaning of time (and subjective time) as related to the concept of Eternity."},{"Title":"Physics","review":"I found this translation easier to read than other translations of Aristotle.

The only thing that's different is that this nouveau riche has a more scandalous background than usual. Archy finds himself invited to the opening of an amazing maze in the back yard of an Ocean Boulevard mansion. It's quite a show . . . which ends in the mysterious death of the host's wife. Before the police can even begin their investigation, the host has hired Archy to help him find the murderer. Archy dislikes his host, but agrees to take on the task in order to be sure that something bad happens to the host.The story is notable for Binky developing some backbone . . . much to Archy's annoyance.The mystery's solution is a clever variation on the old locked room problem. I enjoyed the twist at the end, which I did not expect. I had come up with another solution that was dismissed by the author. That's all right. I liked Mr. Lardo's solution better.I would have graded the book a little higher but the dialogue and action were a little more vapid than is my taste. This book could have been edited down into a much stronger book. Have publishers started paying by the word again? I wonder.If you have liked the other Vincent Lardo books based on Lawrence Sanders's character, Archy McNally, you will probably find this to be an average or slightly below average offering."},{"Title":"McNally's Bluff","review":"I enjoyed the original McNally books by Lawrence Sanders and have generally enjoyed the follow-up books by Vince Lardo. From the beginning, this series has been lightweight stuff, suitable for a pleasant quick read and easy to forget. I found \\"McNally's Bluff\\" the lightest of the series so far. Archie McNally is back as Palm Beach PI to the rich and famous. Still ensconced in a tiny office in his father's law firm, Archie is the man about town always surrounded by some beautiful woman or two. His long-time squeeze, Consuela, has taken up with a dashing Cuban expatriate. Archie's newest love, Georgie, is a Florida state trooper who played a more prominent role in the previous novel.The plot this time revolves around Matthew Hayes, a former carnival operator and his sidekick and wife, Marlena Marvel. Ms Marvel is quickly disposed of at the opening gala to celebrate the new arrivals to Palm Beach and their amazing maze. How her body came to be in the center of the maze moments after the guests have been taipsing through it, and who killed her, is the puzzle Archie is hired to solve by Matthew Hayes. Although suspicion is cast on several characters, the villain is fairly clear from the start.The McNally novels have been fluffy from the start. This one is the fluffiest of the lot."},{"Title":"McNally's Bluff","review":"An ethereal quality which I quite enjoyed bled through into parts of this # 6 novel in Vincent Lardo's Archy collection (# 13 in the whole series). In certain luxuriously drawn scenes, I could almost sense light pouring holes through the pages, similarly to images which have been portrayed in movies like the Harry Potter series, and The Never Ending Story. In McNally's BLUFF, Lardo had honed his author skills so well, he seemed to be literally producing magic in how certain scenes lifted off the pages and danced before, around, and within me. One scene in particular, which was infused with this type of \\"living light,\\" was of the short yacht excursion to which Archy and Georgy were invited by Carolyn Taylor, and which included her boy toy, Billy, and Connie and Alex.While reading BLUFF I was able to conceptualize another of the core differences I've been sensing (on an edge of unconsciousness) between Sanders and Lardo. Lawrence Sander seemed to naturally view life through a philosophical perspective; Vincent Lardo seems to look at human machinations through a sociological lens. Each seasoned author etched those leanings, consciously or not, into their thematic content, plot structure, and designs of Archy's motivations, curiosities, and basic drives through life. Sanders was automatically focused on the meaning of life itself, and how to get the most out of the experience as an individual. Lardo seems to automatically center on the interconnections among human beings, especially as they're separated socially or politically into clusters, cliques, or classes.I don't know if these two authors fully realized how they were driven by this type of targeted viewpoint, when they were in process with a plot. Probably few of us do. Yet, I believe we're each driven by unique needs to know, by unique curiosities, which we each possess at core, at the center, the target of our essence-of-being, and of moving forward.In SECRET, Sanders had Archy state that we're all hedonists at heart, though few of us admit it. In essence, through his McNally series, Sanders uses Archy to dramatize that unique, individual desire to know what gives personal pleasure, what gives a sense of satisfaction, why it does so, and how to enhance that need to \\"suck the marrow out of life.\\"In BLUFF, Lardo's Archy seems to imply that we (as human beings) tend to compare ourselves to others at higher levels in social class structure, and that we need to belong, to be accepted within the cream of social strata. Yet, at the same time we've been liberally taught to revile luxury, opulence, privilege and class.These contrasts bring to mind the thematic essence of Ayn Rand's novels, FOUNTAINHEAD and ATLAS SHRUGGED. Are we naturally oriented, as a species, to self or to others; and which is the prime/ethical way of being.In myself, I have felt the natural needs of both Archies. I am very much an individual, and have released some of the culturally induced taint of feeling evil in having chosen to allow myself to center in a personal focus. Yet, I also crave to connect with and relate to others, fairly, sometimes intimately in friendship (to mutual benefit), and rightly. I'm wondering if this might be why, along with many others, I've been so fascinated with this series, especially given the comparisons and contrasts of the dual authorship.In an overall balance I'm more of a philosopher/psychologist, than a sociologist, and I know that's one of the reasons I enjoy the Spenser series. To me, Parker seems more like Sanders than Lardo, in his art, yet, like Lardo, Parker works with (and entertains through) sociological issues, too.Seeing this perspective contrast between the Sanders and Lardo Archies, the fact begins to clarify for me, of the two personas' varied needs to control (or not) others and their environments. If a person's focus is based comfortably in oneself, there's less or no need to control others. Whereas, if one is based in needs for social interaction, and for acceptance and approval from outside oneself, the need to control becomes natural, sometimes vital for emotional (and physical) survival. Though Ayn Rand does so, I do not want to conclude yet that one or the other type of personality structure is ethically right or wrong, morally good or evil. Maybe the correct fact is that we're each naturally different in these types of slants, and in different phases of maturity. I will admit, though, that the less I feel a need to control, the better I like life and myself.An angry face of a gorgeous tiger was featured on the book jacket design on the hardcover of McNally's BLUFF (# 13 in this series). At first the symbolism in that design had me puzzled, as I attempted to connect it to the plot. I had wondered why a maze hadn't been used as the graphic symbol... until I contrasted the appealingly brassy red-and-gold colors, and tiger in the bulls-eye on BLUFF's jacket, to the ritzy but somber black-and-gold book jacket on the hardback of McNally's SECRET (the pilot to the series). That cover design comparison gave me a double-bulls-eye \\"ah ha!\\" into the slightly different focus of Sanders and Lardo in their offerings in this series.With McNally's BLUFF, which appears to be the final book in the series, the McNally family's carnival history \\"secret\\" is coming full circle...I didn't want to see that circus circle closing, or stepping fully out of the closet in all its gore and glory. If I saw that too clearly, I might have to accept an underlying significance that # 13 is truly the end of this series. No!If that is so, however, McNally's BLUFF accomplished that honor of closing this series with amazing grace and literary panache!In view of this speculation, I needed to read BLUFF on one of my slowest savor speeds. As I did so, I gradually came to love the perfection of that jacket on the hardcover. Actually, the paperback design is appealingly interesting, too, given the above perspective.When I was more than half-way through the book, I noticed that the most current paperback design was very different; it applied an ebony background with a maze hedge stylized with a target in its center. Possibly due to the brain's need to \\"connect dots\\" that center symbol flashed my focus to the target used for Susan Silverman's practice with a fire arm in CRIMSON ROSE, # 15 in Robert B. Parker's Spenser series, which I reviewed recently. For some reason I continue seeing links between Spenser's world and Archy's, and what a stretch that is! I wrote about that brain spark in my review of McNally's SECRET.Though this may be my last McNally novel to review, I can offset that loss by looking forward to the several Spenser novels I haven't yet read. That thought takes me to my novels; my first thought (actually it felt like a craving) after having finished writing each of them was, \\"I wish I could read this novel fresh, without having written it.\\"Thus, it is with added thanks that I have more Spenser novels to experience from that fresh first time of reading. And, that pleasant awareness brings to focus for me the contrast of the author paths involved in the creation and endurance of Spenser and Archy McNally. I believe both situations have brought \\"amazing\\" (a prominent word in BLUFF) cultural insights to the history of literature and the mysteries of life.I love a good story, a good mystery, from almost any angle of approach.What amazing gifts we have available in all of the above.

The early books were charming, funny, and had great wit. And the first Lardo books were excellent. But this book and the one before it sound as if they were written by someone who never read a McNally book.The McNally character is lost completely, as is the witty style. Archie is unrecognizable. All the sophistication and wordplay are gone. The writing is awkward, and the plot uninteresting. All in all, a major disappointment."},{"Title":"McNally's Bluff","review":"All of Palm Beach society is gathered at the home of a new arrival--former carnival owner Matthew Hayes. The party, a first look at a huge maze the carney built on his expensive property. But the prize turns out to be something none of the party-goers expected--a dead body at the center of the maze. Private Investigator (and man about town) Archy McNally was at the party and now Matt is asking for Archy's help in finding his wife's killer. Archy resists at first--but the case just might tie into another one that his father has been asked to provide legal services to.As always, Archy finds himself swimming through a sea of beautiful women. There's his longtime-but-no-longer lover, Consuela. There's new love interest, Georgie. But there's also the beautiful and rich widow of a Florida billionaire--who just might have killed that very billionaire. And Archy can't help being attracted to the T.V. star--despite her being quite married. With his erstwhile sidekick, Binky, off providing services to a muckraking reporter, Archy is on his own in trying to find a killer.The Vincent Lardo/Lawrence Sanders stories attempt and sometimes achieve a modern remake of the suave private eyes of the 1930s. Archy is always well (if sometimes ostentatiously) dressed, likes his alcohol, treats women like cute puppies, and is fastidious with his grammar. In several earlier stories, I objected to a streak of cruelty in Archy's treatment of Binky and others. Here, Archy seems not less full of himself but at least less cruel to others. His run-in with a several-year-old suit even exposed a bit of well-hidden self-doubt.Lardo keeps a quick light tone, maintains a steady diet of beautiful women, corpses, high society, and murder, and delivers a page-turning mystery read. It's fluff, of course, but it's enjoyable fluff."},{"Title":"McNally's Bluff","review":"I finally finished McNally's Bluff by Laurence Sanders and Vincent Lardo. I say *finally* as this one took me about a week when generally it'd be a two day book...Archy McNally is called to investigate a murder when a party he's attending turns into a crime scene. A carnival owner who has moved into town has a maze built on the property, and during a grand opening party his wife is murdered and found dead in the goal of the maze. It's nearly impossible that she was able to appear earlier as a performer at the party and then be found dead, but that's apparently what happened. There are a number of people who might be connected to the death in some way, but none appear to have a clear-cut motive. When one of these people shows up dead, the plot gets even more complicated. Archy is trying to solve the murder and unravel the mystery before anyone else dies in the process...Normally I'm a big fan of the McNally series written by Lardo since Sanders passed away. And on the surface, this latest installment has the same witty writing and word play. But something just seems to be missing. Archie and Connie are no longer together, and the relationship between him and Georgia doesn't seem to advance anywhere here. His normal frustration with Binky is not there, as Binky seems to have a mind and life of his own in this book. Even Archie's dad, the head of the law firm, plays an extremely minor role here. The spark that normally propels me along with these books just wasn't there.Everyone's entitled to an off-day. I just hope this isn't a precursor to the end of an excellent series..."},{"Title":"McNally's Bluff","review":"I have read all of the McNally Novels and believe that Lardo has done an admirable and almost seamless job taking over the series for the late Lawrence Sanders. These books have always been lightweight, but the series appears to be moving from the Sean Connery to Roger Moore phase and becoming entirely self-parody in style. The characters are all there but the dialogue and plot are slighter than ever. From the outset of the crime, the murderer might as well carry a sign saying I did it."},{"Title":"McNally's Bluff","review":"It's about time Binky stood up for himself; I got the impression that Archie (grudgingly) respects that.As for romance, Archy and Connie are sooooooo not split up. Georgie is a rebound affair that's run its course; I hope she and Archy remain friends. For me, having him living with a squeeze is close enough to marrying him off; either go whole hog, hitch him and end the series - or move him back to his aerie."},{"Title":"McNally's Bluff","review":"I really like that Vincent Lardo is getting handle on the McNally Character and Binky character is become more of a man than mouse. The ending of this novel was very good and with a clifhanger.But this constant sparing between Consuela and Archy it's becoming too much. Archy needs make up his mind about who he wants. I personally would like Archy and Consuela back together. While I like McNally Bluff this wasn't his personal best."},{"Title":"McNally's Bluff","review":"Having read all the Sanders and Vincent Lardo books about Archie and co.., this by far was my favorite: funny, witty, and suspenseful at the same time.

Vincent Lardo obviously hasn't studied them in depth, since he makes mistakes with reference to Sanders' stories. Archy states he doesn't want to get married if he can't have a marriage as perfect as his parents. Lardo apparently is unaware that the \\"pater\\" had an affair in one of Sanders' installments! Archy isn't quite the same guy and is becoming quite the annoying snob. Al Rogoff was hardly in this one and I missed him. Archy's living with a girlfriend and there are few references to the McNally \\"manse\\", dinners with the folks, etc. And the climax was anything but; a true anticlimax that was over before I realized. Time to hang up the series? I do believe."},{"Title":"McNally's Bluff","review":"McNally's Bluff displays clearly the chasm between Lawrence Sanders and Vincent Lardo. LS understood wit and served it up with lightness and style; VL is not much more than a smartass, not as literate, and the constant wisecracking is ultimately exhausting. In addition, Boyd Gaines, the narrator of the digital e-version, adds an over-the top, forced broadness to the reading, sounding like a geriatric WC Fields without the talent, making the entire package unbearably irritating - I could only listen about a third of the way through before I had to stop.LS had a deep grasp of how language works; it was part of the whole wonderful, supreme joke that his thrillers were well-written, interestingly plotted, and literate, as well as quite funny. Lardo makes grammatical mood errors motivated by what I can't help interpreting as plain old pretentiousness (subjunctive instead of plain conditional, for example) and other simple syntactical errors that do not do justice to LS's craft.In Sanders's hands, Archy McNally is a scamp and a rogue, at least in his own eyes, but still a human being who loves his parents and solves crimes while chasing women and eating too much. Lardo turns Archy into an empty caricature, alternately boring and boorish and completely unfunny. It's a shame and he should stop now."},{"Title":"McNally's Bluff","review":"An ethereal quality which I quite enjoyed bled through into parts of this # 6 novel in Vincent Lardo's Archy collection (# 13 in the whole series).

However, we have to agree with those feeling this is the lightest of the light. Most of these books have us hobnobbing with the rich (if not famous) in Palm Beach and the various happenings, sometimes including murder, that cause them to seek McNally's \\"discrete\\" private eye services. While solving a mystery that is usually not too violent and not too enigmatic, we get steady doses of Archy's love life, his lavish wardrobe, his gossip sessions at the family manse, his sparring with his father's secretary and the mailroom attendant (Binky) at work, and his sumptuous meals at the Pelican Club and other hangouts.All of these elements resurface in \\"Bluff\\"; but the underlying mystery is so light, and its conclusion so direct, that the book seems little more than an assembly of past storylines and character interactions. While using now rich ex-carny entertainers as the principals wasn't a bad idea, the plot, centering on the murdered \\"Venus\\", Marlena Marvel, found in a literal maze of bushes, otherwise just generated little or no suspense to carry off the 300-page hunt for a close-at-hand killer.Sometimes these continuing series novels run out of steam, especially after a dozen or so entries. We'd hope for a much better effort next outing, or else we'd recommend early retirement for our pal Archy."},{"Title":"The Great Rascal: The life and adventures of Ned Buntline (Bantam giant)","review":"Biographer Jay Monaghan refers to the subject of his book as The Great Rascal. One often thinks of a rascal as an imp, a mischievous person. Well, this subject, Ned Buntline (1823-1886), was a bigamist who fathered and deserted a number of children, a murderer, a drunkard who preached abstinence, and one of the founders of the secretive political Know-Nothing Party that railed against Catholics and immigrants. He was possessed of a super-ego that he fed with lies about his background, war record, and accomplishments. Many of these lies continued on in the myth surrounding this self-professed discovered of Buffalo Bill and the cheap pulp dime novel. The Great Rascal is a very well researched and written biography of Buntline, with comprehensive notes and bibliography sections. I had often heard of the myths that had grown up around this character, such as being a hermit in the Adirondacks, a war hero, a great showman, and a hanged man who lived to tell about it (that part of the myth is true). This book sets the record straight while giving us the true, and yet still colorful, history of the great prevaricator. If anything could be attributed to Buntline, it would be the usage of the concept of \\"The Big Lie,\\" which was later utilized so successfully by Nikita Khrushchev and his Russian colleagues. Yes, Buntline did put Buffalo Bill on the stage, but he became a star long after Ned left the act. Yes, he did have some military service, but always on the fringe of action. Yes, he was a well-known pulp writer of his era, but he failed in many of his literary ventures. Late in life he did made a substantial living creating stories based on the tiniest kernels of truth, stories he claimed were mostly based on real life. Biographer Monaghan reprints bits and pieces of Buntline writings so that we can get a flavor of his work. He was a bad speller, a lousy punctuator, and his tales were amplified beyond belief. There are enough examples of Buntline's writing included that I have no desire to read anything he ever wrote. There are moments in this book where I despised Buntline; there are others where he came across as a bon vivant who would be fun to carouse with. The book begins with Buntline's experience with Buffalo Bill, and then turns to a strict chronological telling of his life's story. I could have done without this convolution, but otherwise I thoroughly enjoyed this book and getting the lowdown on the lowlife Ned Buntline."},{"Title":"The Great Rascal: The life and adventures of Ned Buntline (Bantam giant)","review":"I first encountered Edward Zane Carroll Judson, Ned Buntline, about fifty years ago while reading Stuart Lake's fictionalized biography of Wyatt Earp, \\"Frontier Marshall,\\" in which Buntline presumably presented Wyatt with a \\"Buntline Special,\\" a Colt Peacemaker with a 12 inch barrel. I didn't encounter him again until a few months ago while reading a biography of \\"Buffalo Bill\\" Cody, wherein I discovered that Ned was the man who brought \\"Buffalo Bill\\" and \\"Wild Bill\\" Hickok to the New York stage. That book peaked my interest and induced me to read this one.My preconceived notion of Buntline was that he was an aspiring \\"Dime Novelist\\" who went West to exploit Western gunfighters for his own purposes. I had no idea of the depth of his experiences or of his capabilities as an author. Neither did I know what an interesting and unusual character he was or what an exciting life he had led long before going West. It seems that Ned, himself, if he had been born in a different time and place, might very well have made a name for himself in the West as a lawman, outlaw, gambler, gunfighter, scout, Indian fighter, lady's man, or any or all of these.As it was, he simply became a teenage runaway, a cabin boy, sailor, naval officer, social/political reformer, multiple bigamist, duelist, accused murder, drunk, victim of an unsuccessful lynching, temperance lecturer, poet, convict, literary magazine and newspaper owner/editor, blackmailer, philanderer, political activist, founder of the \\"American Party\\" which he later named \\"The Know Nothings,\\" playwright, actor, Union Army sergeant and deserter, stockade resident, and one-bit (12 cents) nouvellette author and Dime novelist, among other things. He was a retired country gentleman when he went West at the age of 52, in an attempt to re-create himself, and presented \\"Buntline Specials\\" to Wyatt Earp, Bat Masterson, and Bill Tilghman in Dodge City, Kansas.This book tells the story of a truly remarkable author who was forced to write mostly \\"trash\\" for the masses and has largely faded from history and from memory, but who appears to have actually lived the kind of life he wrote about in his wildly sensationalized novels. It also provides an extremely interesting and informative glimpse into American history in the years leading up to and immediately following America's Civil War."},{"Title":"Adventures of Chatterer the Red Squirrel","review":"Chatterer the Red Squirrel is a precious animal adventure story that young children will love.

His mischieviousness finally catches up with him and because of his carelessness Farmer Brown's boy traps him. He then becomes a prisoner, although a quite comfortable one.

There were two sets of original Harrison Cady illustrations for this title:-- Published by Little, Brown, with 6 full-page grayscale illustrations.-- Published by Grosset & Dunlap, with 14 full-page B&W; line drawings, including line-drawing versions of all 6 original grayscale illustrations in the Little, Brown edition, plus many smaller line drawings.The redrawings in this Dover edition are of the 6 grayscale Little, Brown illustrations.I recommend the Grosset & Dunlap edition. Cady did them decades after he did the 6 grayscale Little, Brown illustrations, after he had grown as an artist. Even though the Grosset & Dunlap line drawings are simpler than the Little, Brown grayscale illustrations, they are more charming. On the other hand, the Little, Brown grayscale illustrations better show Cady's remarkable vision for Burgess' creatures, so if you can get both, that's ideal. But either one is better than the drawings in this Dover edition."},{"Title":"Adventures of Chatterer the Red Squirrel","review":"Mischievous and fun loving, Chatterer the Red Squirrel, takes center stage in this fun and entertaining tale about a squirrel who sets out to find a new home and ends up in more trouble than he ever thought possible.The tale starts out with Chatterer being chased by one of the area's most feared predators: Shadow the Weasel. All seems hopeless for Chatterer until he comes up with a brilliant last minute plan and sets another predator after Shadow; proving that sometimes it pays to be mischievous! Chatterer escapes that scenario only to find himself a prisoner of Farmer Brown's boy. Now Farmer Brown's boy doesn't consider Chatterer to be his prisoner, only his pet of sorts as he put Chatterer in a cage. However, while Chatterer is well fed and looked after, he lacks the freedom that he so desires. That is until one day when Chatterer is lucky enough to escape when Farmer Brown's boy leaves the gate open; whether by accident or on purpose, we never truly find out.I found the most charming aspect of this tale to be Chatterer's innocent love of mischief. He never takes his love of mischief too far, so we the parents are able to enjoy and appreciate it as a good source of entertainment for children. I highly recommend the book and hope you give it a try.Darien Summers, author ofThe Mischievous Hare, a children's book."},{"Title":"Adventures of Chatterer the Red Squirrel","review":"I read this when I was a kid, 55 plus years ago, and I still remember enjoying it.

A Rogue's Pleasure is, and I blush when I happily admit, a newly found guilty pleasure. I've already added several more of Hope Tarr's books to my to-be-read list. When the mood strikes, I can't wait to curl up with a chunk of chocolate, a warm blanket and surrender to the historical world the author paints. I quite enjoyed the dirty side of London. The characters are engaging and I fell head over heels for Lord Grenville. If you have a soft spot for 19th century rakes, you'll lust after him too. It was a fast paced read that had me flipping pages late into the night. I was having so much fun reading that I hated to put it down. It was entertaining, enjoyable, and delightfully romantic. Viscount Grenville is the ultimate historical bad boy of London and if I had a time machine I'd jump in it and likely throw myself on his doorstep. The love scenes were delicious and hung on the edge of erotic without spilling over into vulgarity. The language was romantic, seductive and sensual without being dirty. However, for the more prudish it might be too much and if you're longing for chaste traditional sexual restraint sometimes found in the historical genre, this is not your book. What I adored about Tarr's writing was that she mingles historical adventure and period setting with romantic sensuality. For me, this is a winning and entertaining combination. I felt very attached to Chelsea and Grenville and invested in their love story. I can't wait to read another!"},{"Title":"A Rogue's Pleasure","review":"I was pleasantly surprised by this little gem. I've never really been a fan of the Rogue/Rake Hero who womanizes his way through town only to be thought of as desirable and a worthy catch. It always seemed so double standard to me. And really, who would want to be with such a player? Some woman would and do, but I've never been one of those women--until now. Ms. Tarr managed to write a rake who I'd want to be with; a rake who I'd overlook his past conquests for; a rake I could cheer for.Miss Chelsea Bellamy is desperate. Her lands and home are impoverished since the death of her parents and the extravagance of her brother. Now her brother is being held from ransom. She turns to highway robbery as a way to raise funds with the help of her butler, a reformed highway robber himself. After Chelsea robs Lord Anthony Grenville, Viscount Montrose, the alarm has been sound and she decides to head to London and burglarize homes of the ton. She is caught by Anthony who is more intrigued than incensed to be robbed twice by the same woman. He is so fascinated by this bold and brazen beauty that he sets out to help her rescue her brother and seduce her into his bed.Chelsea was such a breath of fresh air. She was still subject to the protocol and structure of her day, but was independent, resourceful, proud, and determined. She wasn't always smart about her choices, getting into a few scrapes of her own making. When told to stay behind by the men, she'd plow on ahead anyways to prove a point; she would only prove them right and her ignorant of the world around her. Despite some of her ignorance, she does know her own mind and own heart and won't compromise herself for a little bit of passion and lust.Anthony was a conflicted soul. His search for happiness has led him to all sorts of places, persons, and things. He thought finding a wife would possibly bring him happiness, so he engaged the beauty of the ton only to find himself still unhappy. When a beauty shows up to rob him, he finds himself enjoying himself for the first time in a very long time. He quickly offers a situation to Chelsea as his mistress, because even if he is infatuated with her he still must marry within his station. He's really thrown off his horse when she refuses to succumb to his charms and his libido. He is actually forced to begin a friendship with Chelsea instead of just taking her to his bed.The ending was nice. Chelsea still held on to her beliefs and principles. She never forced a change on Anthony, but Anthony was forced with the decision to continue to live life like he had before or start anew with Chelsea.A ROUGE'S PLEASURE was a fun and light read full of fun characters, dialogue, and intrigue.*ARC provided by NetGalley*"},{"Title":"A Rogue's Pleasure","review":"A Rogue's Pleasure by Hope Tarr\\"A Rogue's Pleasure\\" is a re-release under a new publisher Carina Press.Miss Chelsea Bellemy is having a very bad few months...Her parents died in a carriage accident, her brother wants to join the army taking the last of their money to secure a commission, the Squire next door wants her body and soul and someone just kidnapped her brother and is asking for a large ransom. With no cash and no one to turn to she decides to try her hand at highway robbery under the guise of \\"One-Eye Jack\\" or rather a much younger version of the near famous highwayman. Of course who should Chelsea find to rob but the bored and affianced Lord Anthony Grenville who is just back from being wounded in the war, his fianc&eacute; and her mother.Of course with this being a romance, we have to find a way for Chelsea and Anthony to meet, fall in lust, then love and try to find a happily ever after. And Ms Tarr manages to do so quite cleverly. Although Ms Tarr uses the \\"mistress option\\" (Anthony can not see a way around his upcoming marriage so proposes he takes Chelsea as mistress) which has been done quite a lot in historical romance, she does it with finesse and a fair amount of heat and passion. Enough to send you for an ice cold beverage or a cool shower. The main characters are pleasant and believable, the evil characters are very evil and there are enough comedic interludes to keep you from getting overly weepy.

It is a definite keeper for me."},{"Title":"A Rogue's Pleasure","review":"Hope Tarr has changed my views on historical romance. In the past I have often avoided purchase of such books for light reading. Often, the plot line involved abusive behavior towards weak,insipid women. This trend really turned me off of that type of reading.However, when Hope wrote her novel I was fortunate and privileged enough to have met and befriended her. Therefore, of course, I read it as soon as my copy arrived! Once I started I couldn't put it down. I was teased by my employees as I finished the novel one night at work. Anyone, that has a romantic bone in their body will be captivated by Chelsea and Anthony's story.

Can't wait to read the next one!"},{"Title":"A Rogue's Pleasure","review":"First time author Hope Tarr has penned a sensational debut novel packed full of humor, wit, intrigue, and sexual tension galore. Set in Regency England, A Rogue's Pleasure is hard to set down once you pick it up. Chelsea Bellamy's younger brother Robert has been kidnapped and is being held for ransom at the sum of five hundred pounds. Orphaned over a year ago, Chelsea has no one to turn to and must therefore come up with a way to raise the needed funds herself. When all of her avenues for acquiring money are exhausted and desperation finally kicks in, she turns to her trusted servant Jack - a retired highwayman - to teach her his former trade. All is going according to plan until Chelsea and Jack decide to hold up a carriage that contains none other than the handsome and notorious rake Viscount Montrose and his fianc&eacute;e Olivia.Anthony Grenville, Viscount Montrose, can scarcely believe what's happening to him. Not only is he suffering the embarrassment of being robbed in front of his fianc&eacute;e, but the perpetrators in question consist of a slight girl and a one-eyed elderly man with scrunched shoulders and a noticeably dragging leg. Still, he can't help but to be amused...and intrigued. He has no choice but to let the girl and her elderly companion go on their way for now, but oddly enough, he hopes to see her again. So when he catches the girl relieving his townhouse of its silver a few days later and forces her to confess all, he can do no less than to help Chelsea get her brother back. Besides, it's the perfect way to keep Chelsea close to him, which is precisely where he most wants her.A Rogue's Pleasure contains an intriguing plot and superb protagonists, but its the budding relationship and sexual tension between the lead characters that will hold you spellbound. With Anthony engaged to another woman and determined to make Chelsea no more than his mistress, and Chelsea firmly committed to being his wife or nothing at all, readers can't help but to want to find out just how the situation will resolve itself into romantic bliss.As an aside to that dilemma, it is refreshing to read about a strong heroine that doesn't waste her time mooning over the hero; Anthony is the one that does all of the mooning in this book. How many times have romance fans been made to endure weak-willed, codependent heroines who make you want to jump into the book's pages and shake some sense into them? I'm happy to report that with A Rogue's Pleasure, you get all of the sexual tension without an ounce of caricatured female sappiness.Hope Tarr's first novel is an overall winner. Fast-paced, intriguing, and loaded with sexual tension, A Rogue's Pleasure is a real page turner.

In the wake of her parents' death, she and her brother, Robert, have almost nothing. When Robert is kidnapped and Chelsea receives a ransom note demanding five hundred pounds, she has no option but to turn to highway robbery. Unfortunately, one of the coaches Chelsea chooses to rob is the wrong one.Lord Anthony Grenville, Viscount Montrose, is surprised when he and his fianc&eacute;e are set upon by a highwayman. He's even more surprised to find that the highwayman is no man at all. When he catches Chelsea thieving again, this time from his home, he offers to help her rescue her brother. He claims he's helping Chelsea because he's bored, but what he really wants is the beautiful thief as his mistress.I was attracted to A Rogue's Pleasure by its premise and beautiful cover. To my delight, Hope Tarr presented a most entertaining first meeting for its protagonists. How often do you see a Regency heroine robbing the man she'll eventually fall in love with? Sadly, my pleasure in reading Chelsea and Anthony's story was short-lived. A Rogue's Pleasure moved at a slow pace and as much as I wanted to like Chelsea, there were far too many moments in the book where her intelligence seemed to have taken flight just so a certain situation could be set up. Anthony was even harder to like. I understand the plot device of having a hero engaged to one woman and then meeting his heroine. What frustrated me was that he didn't even seem to feel a hint of guilt (or if he did it was so quickly passed over I took no note of it) over trying to make Chelsea his mistress, all the while not telling her he still intended to marry someone else. To make matters worse, he had an awful habit of making assumptions about Chelsea that had no logical basis that I could see. All in all, A Rogue's Pleasure was just not the book for me.ShaynaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"},{"Title":"A Rogue's Pleasure","review":"Ordinarily, I don't read romance novels, but I read this one and enjoyed it immensely: it is something of a romp.

She turns to a series of not-very-well-thought-out crimes that involve her ever more deeply with Anthony, a handsome, but world-weary Viscount.The subplot involving Chelsea's brother and Anthony's fiance is particularly well done.

Anthony is rake that needs reforming and if any women can do it throughout this book, it will be Chelsea. They were a great match and I enjoyed the romance between.

From there, the adventure and sexual tension between Anthony and Chelsea build. The road for this couple is bumpy and great fun to read about. Anthony must constantly find ways to get Chelsea out the trouble she causes as she forges ahead regardless of the warnings of her elderly manservant and Anthony.I really enjoyed how the whole story unfolded and how the kidnapper were found (because you know their going to be found). 4 Stars for A Rogue's Pleasure."},{"Title":"A Rogue's Pleasure","review":"Ever since her beloved parents' deaths in a carriage accident last Autumn Chelsea Bellamy has struggled to ensure the wellbeing of the estate as well as see to her brother's Oxford education. Financially destitute the last thing she needs is more worries but a missive demanding five hundred pounds for the return of her nineteen year old brother pushes her into resorting to highway robbery posing as a bandit known as One-Eyed Jack.Injuries obtained in Spain while serving his country resulted in Lord Anthony Grenville's return to England and the stunning discovery that his uncle has died and left him a very wealthy man. He's already indulged in every sinful pleasure he could imagine and found them all lacking. He's bored and nothing seems to drive away the nightmares and memories. Even his fianc&eacute; bores him, so you can imagine his surprise when he becomes fascinated by the young highwayman who accosts his carriage - and holds a gun to his manhood.Robbing travelers of their valuables isn't paying well enough for Chelsea to acquire the funds she needs to save her brother in time so she devises a plan to travel to London and steal from Anthony's home. He's obviously very well off and shouldn't miss a few trinkets. Unfortunately he catches her before she can make her escape and discovers that the highwayman he's obsessed over is in fact a beautiful young woman. Anthony uses a little creative maneuvering along with some blackmail to ensure that Chelsea will revisit his home. He's determined to uncover everything he can about Chelsea and lure her to his bed - as his mistress. What he doesn't realize is Chelsea didn't succumb to a life of crime because she has loose morals - she is desperate. Once he does learn of the circumstances behind Chelsea's stint as a highwayman he vows to do everything he can to help rescue her brother - and seduce her. Admittedly Chelsea is extremely attracted to Anthony but she's adamant that she will not become his mistress - no matter how badly she desires him.Hope Tarr's A ROGUE'S PLEASURE is a fast paced fun read that captured my attention almost from the very first page. All of the characters are highly memorable and I loved the descriptions of the scenery throughout the storyline. The attention to detail Ms. Tarr exhibits in her writing makes it so much easier to become emotionally vested in the story and its outcome. Chelsea's bravery and determination in the face of an extremely difficult situation is endearing and at times laughable as her antics get her into all sorts of trouble. Anthony's utterly charming and it's obvious that he has no desire for the young woman he's promised to marry so I couldn't wait to find out how that whole situation played out. A ROGUE'S PLEASURE is a wonderful historical romance full of mystery, suspense, a little heartbreak and humor which will easily entertain readers until the very end.This book was reviewed using a digital galley via NetGalley.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)"},{"Title":"A Rogue's Pleasure","review":"Recently orphaned, responsible for her brother and their financially embarrassed estate, things can't get worse - can they?

Fortunately she has Jack, a faithful servant, with her. Chelsea is forced to London to either rob the rich, or see her brother die if she cannot raise the ransom. Here her path and Anthony's cross once more and both feel the strong attraction for the other.The barrier which stops them coming together is Anthony's fianc&eacute;e. He has arranged a marriage of convenience which commits him to partnership without love. Can Chelsea and Anthony turn away from the ever increasing strength of their attraction for one another?I do like Regency novels. This one followed the usual pattern of man and woman unable to come together due to previous commitments. Then it took an unusual path. Several internal thoughts and hot steamy scenes brought the characters to life. No insipid Regency miss here. Chelsea proved to be a feisty young lady, willing to follow her own path to rescue her brother and stay true to her own moral code. At times she wavered, but this only made her more human.Anthony on the other hand, could have been a male chauvinist from the present age, with perhaps a little more \\"gentleman\\" in him. At first he was merely a product of the Regency age and his upbringing, but as he and Chelsea became closer he had to fight the urge to act on his instincts and the gentleman side of him came to the fore.This book is fast moving and grabs the interest. More scintillating than the average Regency novel, it has far more life and vibrancy than is usually associated with this genre. Definitely a good read if you want something a little more upbeat.Originally posted at The Long and Short of It Romance Reviews"},{"Title":"Convergence","review":"I read CONVERGENCE several years ago, and it is still one of my favorites -- in fact, I have just ordered a new copy for myself.CONVERGENCE describes, in candid and loving detail, Ms. Bruder's journey to the Catholic faith.... while maintaining a profound, unwavering respect for her Jewish roots. The personal anecdotes are intimate, insightful, and presented with a warmth that draws the reader directly into the center of this brilliant, compassionate, and introspective woman's spiritual quest -- a quest which ultimately proves that the deepest and most enduring faith (no matter what that faith may be) is the one to which our heart is personally called.In an ideal world, this little-known gem of a spiritual autobiography would have received far more publicity. Don't let the opportunity slip away -- pick up a copy while it is still available."},{"Title":"Classical mathematics: A concise history of the classical era in mathematics (Armor book)","review":"This book gives brief descriptions (poorly translated from the original German) of various works by a huge number of authors. The first chapter describes the work of various mathematicians. In the first half of the chapter this is mostly on plane geometry problems, like Descartes' investigation of the Pappus locus problem, finding normals, tangents and quadratures of curves. Reading this one sees that there was a community of scholars interested in mathematical questions, rather than a few scattered geniuses like Descartes and Fermat writing for posterity, as one might believe if one had only done casually reading in the history of mathematics. In the latter half of the chapter we read about the infinitesimal methods of Cavalieri, Torricelli, Wallis, Brouncker, Mengoli, and Gregory.The second chapter is mostly related to infinite series. Having a transparent, easily manipulated algebraic symbolism was an aid to making new discoveries. I was surprised to find out that the power series expansion for log(1+x), which I have often used, was not first due to Mercator, as I had read years ago, but had been found first by Bartholom&auml;us Souvey in a study of the hyperbola, and later by Hudde, then Newton, then Mercator. I'm interested in following up Hofmann's remark that in a 1686 analysis of Wallis's Arithmetica Infinitorum, Jacob Bernoulli rediscovered the method of complete induction, published in the Sept. 1686 Acta Eruditorum. Hofmann mentions a 1707 compilation of G. Manfredi on differential equations.The third chapter talks less about particular works and instead talks about general tendencies of mathematical thought in the Enlightenment period. The major names here are Euler, the Bernoullis, Clairaut, Lagrange, Maclaurin, Maupertuis, Monge, D'Alembert, and Lambert, (classifying, for example, Laplace as a post-Enlightenment worker) but Hofmann also mentions less celebrated mathematicians. A particular interest of mine are Newton's identities that relate sums of powers of the roots of an equation and its coefficients, and Hofmann mentions papers by some lesser lights such as B&auml;rmann and K&auml;stner.This is a strange book. It is valuable as a kind of annotated bibliography, giving names of mathematicians you haven't heard about with a (too) brief description of their work, which you can then further look into. This is not a book that you'd gain much from reading cover to cover, or even sections of it."},{"Title":"Poems and Prophecies","review":"When it finally came time to add a volume of Blake to my permanent library I choose this excellent selection from the Everyman's Library.

This is a book that will last several lifetimes.I am not scholar enough to know if this is a complete compilation of the poet's work. However, I have not found it wanting. All the major works such as the Songs of Innocence and Experience, The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, America, Europe, The book of Urizen, Milton, Jerusalem, etc., are here; along with a large collection of manuscript fragments and poetical sketches. Moreover there is an informed biographical introduction and a detailed chronology of the author's life compared to the literary context of the time and to historical events. There are also about twenty plates of the artist's own illustrations of his works.One brief note on interpreting the work of this visionary mystic: the four Zoas correspond to Jung's four functions. Urison equals reason and law, Orc equals feeling, Tharmas equals sensing, while Los equals intuition and the visionary.I've heard Blake dismissed as a semi-literate eccentric by some. They have obviously never actually read the man. There are elements of Plato, Plotinus, the Hermetica, the Bhagavad Ghita, the Cabbala, as well as many other mythologies and theologies, imbedded in these works- and in the true spirit of their respective times and cultures.It is no wonder that Bucke lists him as one of the indisputable cases of Cosmic Consciousness."},{"Title":"The Titanic (Cornerstones of Freedom)","review":"This book gave an accurate account of the tragedy in 1912.

Yet it really goes further: it can be used, appreciated, by anyone wishing to improve or confirm their knowledge of written English. Gowers writes in compact, sometimes dryly humourous, style, as he corrects the often confused use of &quot;which-that&quot; and &quot;who-whom&quot;, the employment or negligence of the subjunctive, and punctuation. It's an enjoyable,educative work relevant to today, with the English language changing and, perhaps, degrading."},{"Title":"PLAIN WORDS","review":"The Complete Plain Words is an excellent resource for people who write as part of their occupation. Although written in 1948 for British civil servants, I believe it is still useful for just about anybody in government or business who must write the occasional report, memo, or e-mail.One thing that did surprise me a little from the book is just how wordy it is. Unfortunately, the author does not always follow his own advice to use the simple approach and to get to the point quickly. How much easier said than done.Here's some of his advice from his chapter \\"The Choice of Words\\":\\"Use no more words than are necessary to express your meaning, for if you use more you are likely to obscure it and to tire your reader. In particular do not use superfluous adjectives and adverbs and do not use roundabout phrases where single words would serve.Use familiar words rather than the far-fetched, if they express your meaning equally well; for the familiar are more likely to be readily understood.Use words with a precise meaning rather than those that are vague, for they will obviously serve better to make your meaning clear; and in particular prefer concrete words to the abstract, for they are more likely to have a precise meaning.\\"The author Sir Ernest Gowers also realizes that language and the written form of it are subject to change, which is refreshing. As such, his advice is to write using the conventions of the day, but always to shun the experimental forms of slang, short-hand expressions, and plain lazy writing. Sir Gowers writes:\\"English is not static - neither in vocabulary nor in grammar, nor yet in that elusive quality called style. The fashion in prose alternates between the ornate and the plain, the periodic and the colloquial. Grammar and punctuation defy all the efforts of grammarians to force them into the mould of a permanent code of rules. Old words drop out and change their meanings; new words are admitted. What was stigmatized by the purists of one generation as a corruption of the language may a few generations later be accepted as an enrichment, and what was then common currency may have become a pompous archaism or acquired a new significance.\\"Although this book will certainly not replace \\"The Elements of Style\\" by Strunk and White as the preeminent writing guide, \\"The Complete Plain Words\\" is an excellent resource for all writers struggling to communicate in a clear, concise fashion."},{"Title":"PLAIN WORDS","review":"This is how bureaucrats should answer questions in writing. It works.! It works! It works! And the author's bio is very interesting."},{"Title":"PLAIN WORDS","review":"Gowers who at one pointed headed England's 'Internal Revenue' originally wrote the two works combined in this 'Complete Plain Writing' as a guide for bureaucrats and public officials. He wished to teach them how to get across their message concisely and clearly. His first idea is that the person must know what they want to say, and then find the way to express it clearly. This involves according to Gowers a kind of civility, a kind of consideration of the 'other' and the way they understand things. Gowers provides a guide to correct usage and grammar which also parses individual words and expressions. He writes about the development of the language in general and describes the way neologisms enter the language. He points out how the experts and authorities have limited control over this process. For instance Jonathan Swift did not like the word 'mob' and thought its use should be discontinued. The mob however had their way and we are still using the term. Gowers also provides guidance to a lot of grammatical questions that plague many. He tells us for instance to prefer 'that' to ' which' in almost all cases and to use neither most of the time. He urges concision and clarity again and again.It is important to note that this guide is for a certain kind of writing only. I think that in many ways its advice is completely contrary to what we find in for instance great poetic writing. There the ambiguity and complication, the complexity irony and difficulty are elements in making us wish to reread and reread the writing. This guide is for the kind of writing which is meant to be understood at once in a complete way.I feel there is certainly much I could learn from this book and I believe that is true of most readers and writers."},{"Title":"PLAIN WORDS","review":"The book provides an excellent reference for those who want to be correct in their use of the English language and who need the occasional reminder of what is correct English."},{"Title":"PLAIN WORDS","review":"\`Catachresis' is a simple Greek word meaning \`misuse'. If you had never come across it in English before, neither had I until I read it in the second chapter of this book, where it is displayed proudly in the course of a lesson to us on the correct use of the word \`jargon'. The first edition of the book appeared in 1948, and it has reappeared in at least 5 revisions and reprints, my own copy dating from 1964. It must have sold well in that case, and while it purports to be trying to teach the British civil service how to write clearly, the author soon forgets this limited aim and treats us to yet another enthusiastic handbook on the proper use of English, a field I had thought well and truly ploughed and reploughed by Fowler, Quiller-Couch, A P Herbert and others. This is how it will have been read by its eager public, and so this is how it should be assessed. Half a century is not nearly long enough for such a work to go out of date, but of course a lot of the interest in reading it today is precisely in seeing how well it has stood the test of so many years, particularly in the age of email. However I found it even more interesting from a sociological viewpoint. \`Who's talking?' I kept asking myself. Who feels like pontificating in print on this subject, and why should the rest of us take any notice?We can forget the ostensible objective. Who on earth supposes that the language of the civil service is even trying to be clear much of the time? Whitehall mandarins write memos designed in the main to cover their rear, just as commercial executives do. When clarity is really their aim, it is perfectly compatible with lumpish expression, bad grammar, bad syntax, bad spelling and bad handwriting. The best-crafted English in the world will not make what they say unambiguous in a court of law, as is memorably shown by the story of the use of cleaning-rags \`in shops and places other than shops'. You, I and they might have thought that covered all possibilities, but not according to the judge who ruled that a mobile ice-cream tricycle was not a place. This book is really just another guide to good English, for the general public. As such, it is intelligent, balanced, stylish, clear and good-humoured. Gowers is neither pedantic nor unduly tolerant of shoddy writing. He understands that a language is a living thing, and he does his best to judge which neologisms are part of the organic development of the language and which are pimples and warts that could do with removing. Any educated reader with an ear for the language and a love of the language could probably do as well as he does, and I wonder what he would have made of the use of \`rendition' in 2005. I feel he is wasting his breath with his complaints about philosophers' idiom at the start of chapter 8 - philosophers have to write they way they do, just as lawyers have to. Checking his tastes against my own, I find us largely in agreement. I shall go to my final reckoning innocent of using \`anticipate' to mean \`expect', or \`aftermath' to mean \`outcome'. On the other hand I think he overdoes his objection to \`feasible' in the sense of \`plausible', and I can't see that \`the troops were issued with rations' is any worse than \`the troops were given rations', but I shall correct my use of \`comprise' in future in accordance with his strictures. I also agree that brevity makes for clarity, but it has its pitfalls too, as in a recipe that told me \`remove dish from oven and stand on a hot plate', or as in the exam question \`What can be said with confidence about...?' which got the answer \`Anything. Just say it with confidence'. And I wondered during chapter 8 whether the author was familiar with the term \`agglutinative', which gives respectability to expressions consisting entirely of nouns, e.g. \`city dockside warehouse fire'.Who's telling us all this anyhow? It's not just Ernest Gowers, it's Sir Ernest Gowers. Anyone using his title like this invites derision. Did his wife say to him at breakfast \`Would you like more toast, Sir Ernest?', or perhaps, in those tender intimate moments, \`That was wonderful, Sir Ernest, how was it for you?' The whole attitude underlying the book is a memorial of an era when Whitehall was the High Indaba of the British establishment. Future Sir Ernests took firsts in classics at Cambridge, joined the civil service and were later appointed to chair the Coal Mines Reorganisation Commission (later the Coal Commission) and similar. They were the mandarin administrators of Clement Attlee's socialist commonwealth of Britain and they lived by the gospel of Whitehall Knows Best. They recruited and assessed their successors in the manner of wine-experts judging a grand cru, and they brought a similar fastidiousness to their style of writing. Clarity was important mainly for giving them a criterion in criticising the writing of other civil servants, what really mattered was a special elevated style, or what they took for such a style. Out of hours they wrote, and - worse - read, articles and letters of dumbfounding pomposity in The Times newspaper expounding this or that nicety in the use of English. They were clever men (mainly), they were upright and dedicated men, they were highly educated men, but the mystery to me in retrospect is why equally educated members of the general public ever took seriously the pretensions of any chairman of the Coal Mines Reorganisation Commission (later the Coal Commission) to special expertise in the use of English. If I had at any stage been the boss of the future Sir Ernest on his way up and had caught him wrestling with The Choice of Words or such like preoccupations in His Majesty's time and at the taxpayer's expense, I think my own words to him would have been a model of the clarity he values so highly, and they would have been \`Get on with what you're paid to do'."},{"Title":"Why the Church?","review":"In an age in which the perception of Catholic Christianity tends to be marred by ideological bias, it is refreshing to see a book that explicates the existence of the Church as the continuation of the presence of Jesus Christ in history. Giussani's goal makes clear that it is possible to have a concrete, historical relationship with Christ--not as a figure of our imagination or a product of wishful thinking (we know that would be as flawed as we ourselves are) but as God who is present and still acts through the Holy Spirit's use of men and women who are both saints and sinners. Giussani clarifies how it is that our individual temperaments and personalities can remain vehicles for the divine in time and space, and how throughout the history of revelation, those chosen to carry out God's plan in history, beginning with Abraham, Moses, David, were not perfect, but rather, were human beings as prone to weakness as we ourselves are. Nevertheless, this is only a part of the book's thesis. The entire work itself is a fitting and complete elucidation of Giussani's thought, beginning with &quot;The Religious Sense&quot; and continuing with &quot;At the Origin of the Christian Claim.&quot; This is an author who brings the newness of his personal charism to truths that are eternal, and the mix of these two aspects of his work are both thrilling and life-giving."},{"Title":"Why the Church?","review":"This book explains that the Church is a life - not a place where people follow a bunch of old rules. Giussani brilliantly explains what constitutes this church, what its mission is, what it claims to be, and what it is not. A great book to enter into an understanding of what the Catholic Church really is, from someone on the inside of this life. If you are not a believer I would venture to say it would make you curious about this phenomenon that was started 2000 years ago by a carpenter's son from Nazareth. If already a believer, I think that it will educate you to a deeper understanding of what it is and expel some notions about it that are false. An indispensable book for any Catholic or any person who really wants to know what the church claims to be in history."},{"Title":"Why the Church?","review":"First of all, read this book in the School of Community of Communion and Liberation if you can find one. Much of the stuff is too dense to unpack on your own. Second, I never read the first two books of the trilogy and that might have been the reason I missed out on a lot of things. But this book isn't for someone who just wants to start learning about the Catholic Church. You'll need some easier books under your belt first. Third, the translation sucks. If you can read Italian, Spanish, or French, I'd recommend you picking up one of those. Hopefully a new translation will come out. Also there are a couple typos and some paragraphs missing. So I would have given Don Giussani's work 4 or 5 stars, but the edition itself isn't the best."},{"Title":"The Dyess story: The eye-witness account of the death march from Bataan and the narrative of experiences in Japanese prison camps and of eventual escape","review":"Reading this book drives home how brutal war is.

He witnessed the oughtright murder of many Americans. He made his escape and wrote this book. It is one mans eye whitness story of one of the darkest times in W.W.2 for the U.S.A.. He does not come across as the great hero he was, it is written in a very modest style. He did not live to see the end of the war. He died in a plane crash in the United States.

The art is exceptional and the story, though lightweight, is a lot of fun.The story follows Hiroto, who is a prince from another dimension. At the beginning of the story, Hiroto is on the run from his nefarious uncle, Lord Kumagi, who murdered his family. Hiroto escapes to Maunaloa Academy in Japan using a dimension traveling device which is promptly damaged. Hiroto decides to enroll in Maunaloa Academy until he can find someone who can help him fix his traveling device so he can return home and re-claim the throne from Lord Kumagi.The story is a lot of fun, very exciting, and the art is great. The characters are drawn very distinctively, so it is easy for the reader to tell them apart (unlike some other manga I could name; Dragon Knights, for example). The dialogue is a lot better than most manga, too; there are no \\"I will rule the world! Bwahaha!\\" speeches here. Although there is some romantic content (several of the students have crushes on other students), it doesn't became sentimental and angsty.Last Hope may not have the most original story ever written, but it's still a lot of fun and has great art. So, check it out. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Last Hope Vol 1","review":"This is a really nice entry into the manga market from Seven Seas, the publisher that seems to handle exclusively content from western/american creators. Storywise, it's passable, mildly intriguing characters, a bit more derivative than typical manga fodder, but considering the general type of work I've come to expect from most manga it's not surprising.Artistically, though, it's a real gem. The artist on this is easily better than a lot of Japanese artists that are way more famous (Eiichiro Oda, I'm looking at YOU...) I think boosting the visual quality of the work produced under the American Manga genre is the first step to a real establishment of this type of work in this country. The next step will be making stories that are acceptable and less derivative of obvious Japanese story-models, and focusing less on the gimmicky Japanese aesthetic sales point. Americanization of this type of work is really going to be the decisive move in whether manga (in the US) dies as a short-lived fad or lives on as an established storytelling genre, and hopefully this book and others like it will begin to lead the market in that direction."},{"Title":"Last Hope Vol 1","review":"I really enjoyed this book. As a manga fan, I've been skeptical of most American efforts to duplicate the look and feel of manga, especially since so many of them seem to just be attempts to cash in on the category's success. But Last Hope's amazing art and crisp dialogue proved to me that you can take the best elements of Japanese manga and American storytelling to create something new, different and exciting."},{"Title":"Last Hope Vol 1","review":"This manga is great, definitely among the top of my picks.The story is deep, interesting, and exciting.

If you're a person who enjoys reading stories in the Wall Street Journal etc then this book may very well be for you (the author works at WSJ).This is a fascinating story of international intrigue and business. The author provides historical background for both AmEx and Mr Saffra and then proceeds into the meat of the story.What's interesting here is that the Vendetta alluded to in the title raises some serious ethical questions on the part of some folks. All I'll say is as you read it do a name search on the web and see where some of them are today, it's not the poor house and it's not jail either.The book exposes high finance, high power, bare knuckled business street fighting taken to an internation stage."},{"Title":"Vendetta","review":"What happens when business people start to act like 5 year olds at the playground - I'm taking my ball and going home. This is a great story about the desire of American Express to move into the world of private banking and the bank they tried to by - Republic Bank run by Mr. Saffra. Not only does the book provide us this weird story but also it gives the reader a great back ground on these two companies - the American Express information was very interesting. The story of the two companies coming together and then having a lovers spat is just darn interesting and a little tabloid TV. The book keeps your interest and is a nice little find if you pick it up."},{"Title":"Vendetta","review":"Vendetta may be this Author's best work, if not his best known. The twists and turns are so sharp that those accustomed to novels may be nauseous before they get half way through.Events chronicled here are the genesis of many a conspiracy theory. I am reminded of the response from a notorious mafioso when I asked about 'organized crime'. \\"Don't fool yourself.\\" He said, \\"It isn't that organized.\\"Burrough goes to exhaustive lengths to bring the story to the page. The wild ride and incredible characters bounce from continent to continent, villa to yacht to back alley. The key individuals form a perfect personality storm for disaster, and disaster they produced.Saddest of all is Safra himself. Titan private banker to the stars, Safra's Achilles Heel was unwittingly pierced by Amex chief Jim Robinson with a petty smear attempt. Frantically seeking counter attack, Safra lashes out. This brings delight to the parasites teaming around Robinson's sleezy endeavor, who proceed to fan the fire and feed on the turmoil.Despite his genius, ability and drive, Safra's public life climaxed in a pathetic slap fight. Years later the He did not do well in that trip through the gutter, and his legacy may forever have deviated from its career-long steady course.Years after this book, Safra's life ended in a bizarre murder-robbery at the hands of his male nurse, in his villa in Monte Carlo. It was truly heartbreaking end which should have been a beautiful crescendo.Susan Cantor is an intriguing character, the product of conspiracy delusion and self-aggrandizement. Her work was well described in the book by (my cousin) her then-colleague Richard O'Regan, \\"She wasn't a journalist. She played at it.\\"But most interesting of all is the individual named Tony Greco. A true chameleon, Greco masters the energy between the opposing parties, and plays it to his advantage at every turn. While the titans battle, he steals millions form them. While Cantor conspires for her own silly career, he uses her every move to his advantage. After all is said and done, only Greco comes out ahead.Multilingual (to the point of being able to assume specific accents in several tongues), so international no on knows his home, Greco owns the game. Powerful chess pieces have no idea that he plays both sides. Tony Greco, or someone with his name and persona, shows up several times in opportunistic, criminal circumstances all over the world in the past few decades. But the actual individual was so adept at identity theft, or causing others to take his identity, it would be virtually impossible to find the actual individual now. Were he to show up, that's a biography I'd buy. Were I to meet him, it's one I'd write.Burrough takes on a well-researched ride in a stranger-than-fiction odyssey. Tough to put down, the book shocks with its exposure of the silly emotional folly of banking giants. Lacking somewhat only in its written structure, this is a great piece of work."},{"Title":"Mature mind","review":"While written in 1947, this potent book is timeless and wise beyond measure; a book that would do well as important reading in all schools and in all nations, perhaps a universal class called: \\"Maturity 101\\".At the time of publication, this book was a national and international best seller. After reading it, one will see why. It stayed in the #1 slot until the publication of the \\"Kinsey Report\\" one year later- Prof. Alfred Kinsey's, et al., block-buster science report on human sexual habits.Overstreet gives us such gems as: [\\"All children, Diderot once observed, are essentially criminal. It is merely our good luck that their physical powers are still too limited to permit them to carry out their destructiveness.\\" Had he lived today, Diderot might have expanded his remark. He might have said that all childish minds are dangerous, but particularly when those minds are housed in adult bodies; for then they have the power to put their immaturities fully and disastrously into effect.\\"]- i.e., war mongering, wanton destruction of our shared environment, destructive relationships, selfishness in politics and business, etc. Here, begins the message of the critical need for children to be taught socialization (including sex education), care and awe of nature, love of self, family, community, etc.\\"The Mature Mind\\" brings up many of the more contemporary ideas of universal maturing of consciousness put forth in Duane Elgin's books: \\"Awakening Earth\\", \\"Voluntary Simplicity\\", et al.I rate \\"The Mature Mind\\" as one of the most important books in history and in these times of contentious unrest, environmental destruction, socio-economic-religious-political predation, the message about the importance of human maturation cannot be overstated."},{"Title":"Mature mind","review":"The Mature mind is centered on the intriguing idea that real maturity is not based on physical growth but entirely about mindset. The premise is best defined by a quote in the book: \\"All children are essentially criminal. It is merely our good luck that their physical powers are still too limited to permit them to carry out their destructiveness.\\" Overstreet goes on to deduce that not all adults develop fully mature minds, and the resulting combination of immaturity and physical growth dangerous.Too often growth is determined to be based on age, power, and wealth, instead of the real maturity explained in this book. The mature mind is exemplified by a number of things; humility, empahty, mental control, temperment, and self control. Some develop these attributes early, even as children, and do very well by them. Others, even at times those who hold power or are held in high regard, are severely lacking in these areas even as adults. As Overstreet clearly illustrates with numerous examples throughout the book, until society puts proper emphasis and focus on developing mature minds the world is going to continue to be subjected to a litany of issues such as war and political power grabs based on the continual promotion of immature minds in adult bodies.The book is deep and of psychological content, thus it is not easy reading if you do not have a direct interest in the topic. Yet if most of the message inside this book was able to be adsorbed by the common person, the world would surely be far better off as a result. Few books offer a new manner of thinking in science or a message so profound its ideas could potentially improve humankind, yet the Mature Mind accomplishes both."},{"Title":"Mature mind","review":"My dad bought this book years ago, in a mass-market paperbackedition, but somehow, I myself nevergot around to reading it. The book got lost, of course, and so, when I wanted to buy my own copy, I opted for not just the hard-cover edition, but also the large-type, hard-cover edition,as, though my eyes can still read the smallest of paper-backprint books, why not get an edition that IS easier on the eyes?Well, the book I received, in this edition, was really BIG, andvery, very HEAVY! (I mean in WEIGHT -- the principles in thisbook are important...but easy to understand, so I don't know ifthat qualifies it to be \\"heavy\\" reading, in the colloquialsense of the word.) The publishers here, obviously with thevery best of intensions, skimp no-where: the print is large, and so are the spaces between the lines, and margins are full andwide. The resulting book, however, is as heavy as many hard-coverBibles -- perhaps even heavier. The buying of this book, inthis edition, almost put me off buying ANY more large-printbooks, of ANY kind. So, I'd buy this particular edition of \\"THEMATURE MIND\\" O N L Y if a large-print edition is the only onethat can be read. This edition is, sadly, NOT recommended forfor anyone without a large table or stand, on which to rest it, whilst rading, and not for anyone who has trouble holding abook.The wisdom in this book is truly priceless -- but this edition,I believe, requires the caveats I have listed above."},{"Title":"Culture and Customs of Spain (Culture and Customs of Europe)","review":"This book gives an excellent overview of many aspects of Spain, in chapters entitled Context (geographic setting, languages spoken, etc.), Religion, Customs, Media, Cinema, Literature, Performing Arts, and Visual Arts. Particular attention is given to the changes in these respects that have taken place during the years of societal transition from 1975 and onward. It should thus not be thought of as a traveling guide. Each chapter is followed by a list of references documenting the stuff presented: none goes beyond the year 1999 so the book has obviously been in the editing process several years before appearing. But among the references there are many tips of quality internet sites for those interested to pursue a given topic at greater depth.As one who has visited Spain many times I recognize much of what is written here as to the point. I sense no tilting to any one side when it comes to presenting controversial topics -and these abound in Spain. If I were a student of Spanish language and/or history, or a retiree contemplating to settle in Spain, I would want to own this book. The drawback is the ridiculous price asked for a 206-page book with only 25 b/w pictures. For this, I detract one star.(Note that the \\"Handbook of Spanish popular culture\\" by the same author is virtually the same book, the main difference being that in this older version there is a separate chapter, Ch. 1, entitled Languages, which is of interest if you are specially looking for a non-technical overview of this.

If you have never heard of shamanism and the process of journeying, this book is the place to start.Dr. Gagan has written a powerful book exploring the worlds of shamanism and psychology and the bridges between them. The shamanic tradition dates back at least 30,000 years. Like psychology, its intent is to heal and alleviate suffering. Unlike psychology, shamanism focuses on the soul of the individual. Its primary method is through the process of journeying.As Dr. Gagan explains, the shamanic journey is a process of archetypal reconnection. During journeying, the imagery that springs from the unconscious connects us to nature and the natural order of the universe. The journey itself acts as an alchemical container where we can come to know these images. We journey &quot;in repsonse to a source of healing that appears to beckon from outside ourselves. We connect to this source not through the aid of some guru or cleric, but rather under the power of our own intent.&quot; Through the author's eyes, the process is dynamically self-empowering.The book analyzes in depth many case studies where we can see the art of journeying at work. Dr. Gagan's comprehensive experience in both psychology and shamanism show clearly. She is a master on this topic."},{"Title":"Journeying: Where Shamanism and Psychology Meet","review":"Journeying is an exciting and powerful work with profound implications for those invested in integrative medicine and healing. The word integrative comes from the latin word &quot;integratus&quot; which means to form or blend into a whole; to unite with something else. Dr. Gagan unites or brings together the 30,000 year old shamanic tradition of healing with the field of psychology. The function of psychology, according to Dr. Gagan, is &quot;to study behavior and mental processes and apply the resulting knowledge to the human condition&quot;. While taking different routes, shamanism and psychology seek to alleviate suffering in communities of people. Although the book is titled: &quot;Journeying: Where Shamanism and Psychology Meet, I feel the book is really about holistic healing.Allopathic medicine has been primarily concerned with healing the body, the field of psychology has been focused on healing the mental and emotional pain of persons. The shamanic healer is concerned not only with a person's symptoms and pain, but also a person's entire beingness experienced within the context of one's environment and circumstances. Dr. Gagan posits that shamanic healing integrates healing the body, the mind and the spirit. Shamanic forms of healing are about soul care and healing of the spirit. When we experience &quot;pain&quot; in our spirit or soul, it also sooner or later affects us mentally and physically. Therefore healing, to be effective, must be holistic. Shamanic forms of healing and journeying work at assessing and responding to the mind, body and spirit needs.Dr. Gagan has written a prophetic book on the nature of healing and how modern medicine, psychology and one of the oldest forms of healing (shamanism) can be integrated to heal our overstressed and immune suppressed society. The form of healing is within ourselves and the process is dynamically self-empowering. Dr. Gagan's extensive clinical practice as a psychologist and expertise in shamanism is integrated in a revolutionary new yet traditional form of healing the human person. This is a five star book and a must for persons who are interested or in need of holistic healing."},{"Title":"Journeying: Where Shamanism and Psychology Meet","review":"I don't have to write a wordy essay to sum up what this book isand what it did for me.

The other two books are, The Way of The Shaman by Michael Harner, and The Vision Seeker by John Lame Deer."},{"Title":"Journeying: Where Shamanism and Psychology Meet","review":"Having experienced the shamanic path directly and then going back for a degree in psychology I found this a good book for helping the psychological community understand the shamanic path of direct experience. Too many people who are facing a spiritual opening (possibly shamanic) are medicated out of the experience because of the professional's limited viewpoint of the shamanic experience and/or the fear of the unknown.I caution that the shamanic path cannot be catagorized or analyzed, it is fluid and changing; it is chaotic in nature-if you don't know &quot;the way&quot;. I suggest that if you are a professional go out and journey for yourself, explore the path, draw your own conclusions."},{"Title":"Journeying: Where Shamanism and Psychology Meet","review":"What happens when you combine the studies of psychology and shamanism? Are the two practices divergent...or are there some commonalties? Author, teacher, licensed psychologist and student of shamanism Jeannette Gagan answers with a resounding \\"yes\\" in her brilliant book, Journeying.Dr. Gagan has crafted her book to lead the reader, in a logical order and with easy-to-understand language, through the nature and history of both fields. Then we learn some of the approaches of understanding and healing.In chapters 3 and 4, Journeying gets down to it...the place where shamanism and psychology intersect, the mending of emotional wounding. Inadequate bonding, neglect, abuse, aggression, anger and violence are some of the conditions we learn about, and the healing brought to bear.In the final pages, Journeying offers the bridge that brings shamanism and psychology together...that reflects the bond between the alchemy of shamanic healing and the science of psychology. \\"Shamanic cultures, I found, understand the debilitating effects of trauma and strive to restore wholeness to distressed individuals\\" writes Dr. Gagan. And, after all, isn't that a prime purpose of psychology, too?This reviewer is no psychologist nor shaman, but can see and feel the logic and rightness of grand ideas when expressed in a well-written book. Indicative of that is, \\"Shamans search for lost pieces of soul and return them to members of their community. Psychologists investigate the workings of the mind and strive to validate their methodological approaches. Shamanism has soul to give to psychology.

Gagan, writes lucidly about the her own personal spiritual journey to wholeness through shamanic practice. By comparing apples (the shaman's fruit of choice) and oranges (the psychologist's fruit of choice), Dr. Gagan succeeds in answering the following questions:1. How does the shamanic tradition bring such potent healing power to wounds incurred in the earliest months of life? and2. Could journeying provide a release valve for the violence so rampant in our world?By contrasting the two traditions historically, Dr. Gagan, underscores the slices of each fruit that can be shared. Central to finding common ground are the notions of altered states of consciousness, imagery, and the Jungian alchemical processes to healing.Throughout her story Dr. Gagan weaves in carefully chosen vignettes from her clients' journeying, and explains how these experiences transcend verbal therapy and succeed in achieving transformation.--A very convincing and readable book."},{"Title":"Journeying: Where Shamanism and Psychology Meet","review":"'Journeying' combines the oldest healing tradition with present-day psychology. The book provides a dynamic, vital model for healing and psychological growth for anyone interested in self-improvement. The information is highly understandable at the meeting point of shamanic animal symbolism, including the psychotherapeutic experience of altered states of consciousness-'journeying,' and psychology."},{"Title":"Journeying: Where Shamanism and Psychology Meet","review":"Gagan has written a book from a psychologists perspective on the benefits of the shamanic journey. She gives un-necessariy historical essay-type background to basic psychological theories such as attachment, and discusses how psychology and shamanism both come from the same intention, to heal. However the book doesn't really go into depth on the shamanic journey at all, there is no methodology given, no map, no exercises. I was disappointed with this book as it claimed to \\"marry shamanism and psychology\\" yet nothing new in this area was offered, no tecnhiques, no examples of how she handled specific cases. She described what is already known as the shamanic counselling process, renamed it \\"Shamanic Psychotherapeutics\\", yet did not say how a psychotherapist could add to the shamanic counselling experience. She says that psychology has science to offer shamanism, yet she doesnt not elaborate on this idea. Overall its a book where a classically trained psychologist discovers shamanism and shares her new wisdom with the world. In her blurb on the back she says she is a student of shamanism, which in itself is telling. This book is an introduction to the concept of a shamanic journey to people who come from psychology backgrounds but unfortunatly, it does not do what it claims to do on the cover, which is to give a \\"daring and pioneering template for healing\\". You'd be better off reading Harner or Ingerman for a more practical approach."},{"Title":"Journeying: Where Shamanism and Psychology Meet","review":"Jeannette Gagan is a psychologist, who while dealing with her divorce discovered Shamanism, and over the years has come to recognize Shamanism's value as a psychological healing system. She takes an agnostic approach to the reality of Shamanic visions, at times leaning to them being internally generated and other times believing there is something at work beyond the individual, but either way, they are healing. The book starts with \\"This is neither a self-help nor a how-to book\\" and it is true, this book isn't a how-to on Shamanism with a psychological twist, and it isn't how to use Shamanism as a self-help tool to deal with your problems. What the book is though, is a serious and intellectual look at Shamanism as a tool for mental wellness, largely focusing around power animals, and soul retrieval. It helps to be familiar with psychology and the counselling process to make use of the book, but I don't believe it would be necessary. There is a lot of focus on the traumas that can arise in earlier childhood (before the age of four) and examples and theory on how Shamanic journeying can help heal the wounds of childhood, as well as any other point in your life. The book talks about Journeying as a method to safely explore, and express pain, emotions, and wounds, and how psychology and shamanism are working toward the same goal, but from different angles. An intriguing read for those interested in either or both of those fields."},{"Title":"Journeying: Where Shamanism and Psychology Meet","review":"I think this book will give comfort to those in the psychological community who want to explore a non-clinical pathway. Shamanism is a method for obtaining spiritual insights that are non-linear in nature. It is creative. It is challenging. For me this book attempts to structure shamanism psychologically, and that is not what the shamanic pathway is about, it limits the potential of the Work. To the seasoned journeyier this is not the book to read.If you are a psychologist who wants to expand your practice by &quot;doing&quot; shamanism without doing your own personal work so you can make more money- please take another path. If you want to explore this pathway of direct experience with the G-d of your understanding and are willing to leave your clinical training at the door, take off your psychological mask then come journey . . . and buy Michael Harner or Sandra Ingerman's book."},{"Title":"World of Shakespeare: The Complete Plays and Sonnets of William Shakespeare (38 Volume Library)","review":"Very good collection of Shakespeare.

No fussy dust covers, and each volume is small and comfortable to hold. By splitting up the works into individual volumes, they were able to make each one about the size of a paperback book.I gave a set of these to my wife as a birthday gift, and one of the things she likes about them the most is that it is very easy to pull one off the shelf and read it curled up on a sofa, which is difficult to do with a combined volume that weighs a ton and has to be read at a desk.The one drawback is that they take up a tremendous amount of shelf space, so make sure you have a place to put them.

Hence I ordered them. As for the books themselves, content-wise, that is, there's not much to say; it has stood the test of time. Binding, paper quality and such is also most satisfactory. So what I'd like to comment on concerns shipping.Seeing that this set consists of 38 vols. I decided it best to spring for the expensive shipping option offered by Amazon. Having the set thrown about by the plebeian postal service for what might prove close to a month (I live in Norway,) seemed to me a choice most unwise. And besides, for less than $35 the books would be delivered at my home by a courier (can't say I noticed which courier; but just think something along the line of \\"The King of Queens\\" and you get the picture) thus also sparing me the hassle of having to pick it up at my local post office. So far so good ...The books came within the estimated delivery time set by Amazon. No complaint there. But one corner of the box containing the books was actually wet! Luckily I was at home and thus able to open the box immediately in order to salvage the valuables contained therein. As it turned out, only Macbeth showed slight signs of having been exposed to some vile scheme involving liquid; being, I hope, but water. However, had I not been at home, I shudder at what the consequences would have been.So what's the moral of this story, you might ask? It is but this. Amazon: In the future, please apply some form of plastic wrapping to the box before setting it adrift. The next customer might otherwise end up receiving a set badly in need of a tumble-dryer!"},{"Title":"World of Shakespeare: The Complete Plays and Sonnets of William Shakespeare (38 Volume Library)","review":"The binding isn't as high-end as I'd hoped for though. Easy to read individual titles, that's good enough to use for studying."},{"Title":"World of Shakespeare: The Complete Plays and Sonnets of William Shakespeare (38 Volume Library)","review":"Well,I have had many wonderful experiences in my life. Working with a Nobel Laurate, studying piano with a two Grammy winning artist-Earl Wild and then becoming a respected surgeon. My single best learning experience is currently having read the complete works of Shakespeare. This ensemble of well edited and written commentaries of the Bard along with a sturdy, convient and well presented text of the plays (purchased on Abebooks for 58.00 with shipping) as given me an unofficial MS in English literature. My favorite plays are the Tempest, Titus Andonicus, Timon of Athens, A Winter's Tale and Pericles. As you read 400 year old Shakespeare's works we see that the world rhyme and reason for functionality and our response to it has changed at old. the same problems we have now were present then and no better or worse. Of course the killing in these plays is enormous and doesn't happen in everyday's experience anymore but we still poorly manage hate and violence with even more hate and violence. So as Shakespeare far as my experience is concerned I found it even more enlightening than reading the complete works of Dostoyevsky which is saying a loy. Good reading. It took me 8 months with one play a week. Read through the commentaries which are well conceived and balanced."},{"Title":"World of Shakespeare: The Complete Plays and Sonnets of William Shakespeare (38 Volume Library)","review":"As someone who reads Shakespeare compulsively (2-3 plays per month on a rotating basis clear through the 37 extant works), I have been in the market for some time for an easily-manipulated and easy-to-read edition of Complete Works that can be taken in a backpack to work or to the beach. In this 38-Volume work I have found it!Previously I was forced to lug around one of the complete editions (my favorite being the well-anotated one-volume Pelican), which meant carrying a bulky, expensive, and weighty 7 pound book with me. With this very handy, beautiful, and well-constructed Pelican edition I am able to carry one or two plays along with me on vacation and still have plenty of room to pack other books or items.The Pelican apparatus is great (introductions and footnotes)--editors Orgel and Braunmuller have a fine eye for problems modern readers may encounter with 400 year old texts. However, the exclusion of \\"Venus and Adonis\\" and \\"Rape of the Lucrece\\" in a separate (39th) tome is odd and inexplicable. These poems, after all, are the only works that Shakespeare himself seems to have expressly authorized for publication.This caveat aside: rush don't walk to get these books into your library. Then, like me, you'll be ready to settle down some lazy summer afternoon (or rainy October evening) to many \\"sweet sessions of silent thought\\" while reading through the greatest canon of dramatic and poetic writing in all of human history!"},{"Title":"World of Shakespeare: The Complete Plays and Sonnets of William Shakespeare (38 Volume Library)","review":"After reading previous reviews of this magnificent set here at Amazon, I was in one sense \`sold' but with some remaining concerns. Now that I have received the set I see that it is all that others have said and more, and so I will address my previous worries here in the event that there may be some with similar questions. In short, let not your heart be troubled.Although the astonishingly low price of $94.99 made the set a deal that I simply couldn't refuse, I have always been one to believe that you generally get what you pay for, and so this low price also caused me some concern. Having seen the publishing world being inundated with cheap Chinese printings of Western canon classics over the past few years, often stacked high at the \`big box' stores and varying wildly in physical quality, I was of course worried that this would be of a similar caliber. I was delighted to find that the set is printed in the United States and the quality of the books is beyond reproach. The paper is bright and the text is crisp and clear, set in an easily legible and pleasing Garamond font at what appears to be approximately 12 point. Each volume has a bookmark ribbon bound into the spine and extending approximately three inches below the bottom of the book.Each volume measures 8 inches high and 5 5/8 inches deep. You will need a minimum of 26 inches of linear shelf space for them all and UPS states the shipping weight as being 29 pounds.Even at what must be an overwhelming time for Amazon's shipping and packing departments, the set arrived in three days despite my opting for the free \`super saver' shipping (Ordered late December 26, arrived December 29). The books are first packed in the publisher's heavyweight original carton which is customized to the dimensions of the set and so it fits perfectly with the books in two rows separated by a corrugated cardboard divider. This carton was in turn placed in a much larger box by Amazon, with the voids well-filled with bubble wrap. If the outer box had been severely damaged in transit (which it wasn't) the inner box would still have had more than a fighting chance to retain its full protective integrity. My set arrived in perfect condition and I have nothing but compliments to Amazon for their fine efforts in this matter.Thank you for giving your time to my thoughts, and I hope that these as well as the comments from others here might sway you toward bringing this marvelous collection into your home.You won't be disappointed.January 31, 2007 UpdateTo all readers,I see that Amazon has raised the price of this set back up to $200.00, and I'm terribly sorry if my review, which was based in large measure upon the previous price of $94.99, has seemed confusing to you as a result. If the raised price is of a concern to you (which it would certainly be to me!) may I suggest that you bookmark this page and check back regularly? Prior to the $94.99 price the set was also in the neighborhood of $200. if my memory serves, and Amazon lowered the price sometime around December. This may be something that they do as a matter of marketing / policy and so it MAY be that if you are careful to check back regularly you may find that they have lowered the price again to coincide with a Holiday. I have no way of knowing this as a certainty of course, and so you must use your own judgement in this matter.Best wishes and good luck to all value-minded Shakespeare fans,Tony"},{"Title":"World of Shakespeare: The Complete Plays and Sonnets of William Shakespeare (38 Volume Library)","review":"The individual paperbacks are priced at $5.00 and $6.00 each. The full set (in hardbound) averages $3.94 a book. The text appears to be identical to the revised paperback edition. Having the plays in single volumes makes it easier to read them (see Al Pacino discussing this issue in Looking for Richard). This is a great deal for a great set."},{"Title":"World of Shakespeare: The Complete Plays and Sonnets of William Shakespeare (38 Volume Library)","review":"This has got to be the bargain of the decade. Individually hard bound volumes in a 38-volume set of the Pelican Shakespeare for only $89.70, with free shipping to boot from Amazon. The set normally retails for $299, and having purchased the set myself, I can truly say I would not have felt cheated had I paid full price. The set is called World of Shakespeare: The Complete Plays and Sonnets of William Shakespeare (38 Volume Library) (Hardcover).World of Shakespeare: The Complete Plays and Sonnets of William Shakespeare (38 Volume Library)The set contains all the plays, excluding Two Noble Kinsmen--wherein they agree with the single-volume Pelican Shakespeare second edition--and the Sonnets, but not the other non-dramatic poetry, which the single volume does contain. Why the editors chose to exclude the other non-dramatic poetry is not clear, unless it was simply volume-size considerations. Venus and Adonis, Lucrece, The Phoenix and the Turtle, The Passionate Pilgrim and A Lover's Complaint would perhaps have been too thin to place in their own volume, and added to the Sonnets would have made that volume too thick. Surely they could have been accommodated somewhere, however. This is the only complaint I have about this outstanding edition.Each of the volumes are individually bound in navy cloth covers with silver stamped titles on front covers and spines. From the outside they are not things of great beauty, but serviceable and pleasant. They feel good in the hand, their covers giving them the substantiality the Pelican (and most other paperbacks) lack. They are tightly and attractively bound, with head ribbons, decorative endpapers (pale blue leaves on cream-colored paper) and long navy-blue ribbon place markers. The pages are attractive, with ample margins for note-taking (something I feel is essential in a Shakespeare) without binding the text too close to the gutter (a second essential). The paper is thick, off-white, and the type Adobe Garamond, the same as in the single volume Pelican Works, but larger and consequently more clear. Most single volume editions--and the Pelican is no exception--are printed on paper so thin that the image of the text bleeds through from the back of the page. Not so with these volumes where the paper is noticeably thicker. The real advantage of these volumes, however, is a single column layout. I dislike the two column layout of single-volume collected editions, and much prefer the single column layout followed by individually bound plays. Physically, then, these volumes are winners.Each volume is printed with the same front matter: a illustrated front page (sometimes different than the one you will get in the single-volume Pelican); a \\"Publisher's Note\\" explaining the layout of the work and its apparatus; an article on Shakespeare's \\"Theatrical World\\"; a brief statement on \\"The Question of Authorship\\"; and an explanatory note on \\"The Texts of Shakespeare\\". These materials are valuable, and the same as you receive in the single-volume Pelican (which is in its second edition). I question the need to print this material in each volume, but of course since the volumes might be sold individually rather than in a set it must be so. It is too bad, though, that when purchased as a set a single volume could have been provided with these introductory materials in it once only, perhaps filled with the non-dramatic poetry I remarked on above. The only difference between the single volume edition and these is that in the single volume work there are some facsimile pages from the First Folio, and a couple of charts not present in the individually bound volumes.The physical layout of the page I like very much. every tenth line is numbered, whether it has a gloss or not (and placed in italics when it does not have a gloss), but lines containing glosses are also numbered in the right margin. This is a great solution to the problem of adding numbered footnotes or symbols within lines. Rather than lines bristling with superscripted daggers, stars or other wingdings we get in these volumes a clean, undistracted line with an indicator to our eye when it reaches the end of the line about whether a gloss exists or not. The glosses are mostly straightforward, rarely extensive, and mostly used to define obscure terms with a minimum of editorializing. Location indicators have also been removed from the heads of scenes, but, for those who want them, are moved to the first annotation in each scene. Speech prefixes are fully spelled out (a blessing to new students and a luxury for old). They are placed above each line of speech unless the line is a continuation of the one above, in which case they are placed on the same line as the continued speech.The article on \\"The Theatrical World\\" is practical and straightforward, placing Shakespeare's works in the economic system professional theatres between 1590 and 1620. A brief glance is taken back at the development of the professional companies, and then the conditions of acting and play writing for the professional companies is addressed. London, we are told, had a population of between 150,000 and 200,000 during Shakespeare's career, and when the theatres were permitted to play (which was always except for notable gaps for plague and Lent) approximately 10% of the city's population would attend a play each week. It's a good guess, but only a guess. Not much attention is paid to touring. The use of properties and effects within the theatre are covered (visual effects, sound effects, scenery, props, music); the role of women--or rather boys playing women is discussed; and a longish section on the children's companies is also provided. It is brief, but to the point, concluding by recommending more thoroughgoing studies by Bentley, Chambers, and, of course, Andrew Gurr.The article on \\"William Shakespeare of Stratford-upon-Avon, Gentlemen\\" is commendably brief and clear. It takes the tack that \\"...we know more about Shakespeare's life than we do about almost any other English writer's of his era,\\" which is true and often forgotten in our lust to know ever more. The article reviews the bare, documented facts of births, baptisms, marriages, occupations, children and grandchildren, on through the direct documents dealing with Shakespeare's career: the Greene-Chettle episode, the payments to Shakespeare as a chief sharer in the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later the King's Men, the coat-of-arms, property purchased (New Place, the Blackfriar's Gatehouse, Stratford fields and tithes), Palladis Tamia, the Mountjoy testimony, Rutland's impresa, finally death and the will: Clear, concise, compelling.A note is provided on \\"The Question of Authorship\\", and few saner notes will be found anywhere. It reviews the history of some of the more prominent hair brained attributions--those of Delia Bacon and J. Thomas Looney (Baconian and Oxfordian, respectively)--and notes that authorship attributions tend to gain momentum \\"among people whose conviction was the greater in proportion to their ignorance of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century English literature, history, and society.\\" It is hard to say it better. The article goes on, \\"The Baconians, the Oxfordians, and supporters of other candidates have one trait in common--thy are snobs. Every pro-Bacon or pro-Oxford tract sooner or later claims that the historical William Shakespeare of Stratford-upon-Avon could not have written the plays because he could not have had the training, the university education, the experience, and indeed the imagination or background their author supposedly possessed.\\" The arguments are all too familiar and all to fallacious. The editors put end to the article with this: \\"Besides snobbery, one other quality characterizes the authorship controversy: lack of evidence. A great deal of testimony from Shakespeare's time shows that Shakespeare wrote Shakespeare's plays and that his contemporaries recognized them as distinctive and distinctly superior.\\" QED.The article on \\"The Texts of Shakespeare\\" reviews the history of various printed works attributed to Shakespeare, the quartos and then the Folio of 1623. The issues of the famous variants are discussed, particularly Lear, Hamlet, Othello and Troilus and Cressida. The article points out that Shakespeare, because of his popularity and the unique nature of his contribution, was far more popular than his peers: \\"...most of the playwrights of Shakespeare's time were as anonymous as most screenwriters are today.\\" And really, it was because of his poetry--primarily the two long narrative poems--that he was so well known, that and his smash, irresistible box office hits like Titus Andronicus, Romeo and Juliet, and Hamlet. In our own day we might remember that William Faulkner was one of the screenwriters of the 1946 The Big Chill, but we would be hard pressed to identify the other two. Shakespeare was unique in his own day because he was so well known (publishers often attached his name to works not his own hoping to take advantage of the sales power of the name, or the bare initials); he was among the leading sharers of his company (\\"literally his own boss\\"); and he was, in his acting days, a well known actor also. The article on the texts ends with an eye opening comparison of the quartos of Romeo and Juliet, concluding \\"There is in fact no early text that reads as our modern text does...The transcendently beautiful passage [the rose by any other name speech] in modern editions is an editorial invention...\\"The general editors of the Pelican Shakespeare are Stephen Orgel and A. R. Braunmuller. The contributing editors are among the best and brightest, including John Hollander, Russ McDonald and Frances Dolan. The introductions to each play (and the sonnets) in these collected, individually bound volumes are the same as in the single-volume Pelican edition. I must confess a soft spot for the first single-bound Pelican edition, under the general editorship of the great Alfred Harbage. It does my heart good to read, in this second edition, \\"New introductions and notes have been provided in all the volumes. But the new Shakespeare is also designed as a successor to the original series; the previous editions have been taken into account, and the advice of the previous editors has been solicited where it was feasible to do so.\\" That is a remarkable statement, one that should inspire confidence in the healthy conservatism and scholarly foundation of these editions. The previous editors include such greats as Cyrus Hoy, Fredson Bowers, R. C. Bald, David Bevington, G. Blakemore Evans, G. E. Bentley, Charlton Hinman, Maynard Mack, Harry Levin, Robert Heilman, Northrup Frye (!), and even Richard Wilbur. Those are stars among stars, amounting to quite a lineup. The new edition has much to live up to. From what I've seen so far, it has.One last point. I can't quite get over it: for price and value this edition is phenomenal. The thirty-eight hard bound volumes of this quality edition are being offered for a total of $89.70. That's $2.36 per volume. When was the last time you were able to acquire a new, quality hardback--in this case an exceptional scholarly investment as well--at such a price? Even the individually bound Pelican paperbacks are priced at $5 or $6 each, themselves being a special value in the paperback market. The trade Folger editions go for $7.95, the Arden second and third series paperbacks for $13.99 and the New Cambridge paperbacks for $15.99. You could buy the single-volume Pelican collected works in hardback discounted at Amazon to $40.95, but how much more convenient to have the same editions with the same editors and notes, in individually hardbound books for $2.36 apiece. It is an extraordinary value. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"World of Shakespeare: The Complete Plays and Sonnets of William Shakespeare (38 Volume Library)","review":"This is the best available edition of Shakespeare's work.+It's hard bound in good plain cloth, not snobby leather;+the text is handsomely layed out and easy to read;+the footnotes are informative without getting in the way of the text;+at $3.95 per volume, the collection is a bargain;+the covers and end pages are blue, my favourite colour;+sturdy construction ensures the collection will last a few decades (but at this price, I doubt it's printed on acid free paper)*;+individual volumes for each play are easier to carry around than a single volume \\"Complete Works\\".Caveats-The collection is so pretty you won't want to write in the margins (doesn't everyone take notes?);-the collection takes up much more shelf space than a single volume edition;-individual volumes for each play means that the collection will be dismembered by friends and family borrowing their favourite plays.

Perfect for students and general readers.The ONLY drawback is that it does not contain the narrative poems other than the sonnets nor The two noble kinsmen which Shakespeare cowrote and is usually included in his cannon."},{"Title":"World of Shakespeare: The Complete Plays and Sonnets of William Shakespeare (38 Volume Library)","review":"These are quite simply beautiful books. There is little I can add to previous reviews regarding the price, &c.;, but a few words of praise are in order for the texts themselves. The editors have prepared superb notes: never intrusive, condescending, or pedantic (ala Christopher Ricks), the footnotes concisely address only the more unusual syntactic constructions, topical allusions, and cultural references. In other words, the reader need not waste time looking up every note unless he feels so inclined, in the which case he will most likely be well-served.The introductions to each edition are slightly variable. Each volume includes the same very concise, very cursory overview of Elizabethan theater and Shakespeare's background. Textual variants are also briefly acknowledged. Some editors, particularly Peter Holland, deserve credit for then writing introductions that remain not only informative but also entertaining in their own right. Other scholars, of course, are a bit more prosaic and perhaps not the best writers themselves. Yet even these remain accessible, and a fine introduction need not always be especially well-written. I suppose the breadth of professional Shakespearean scholarship must also be daunting for anything but a general orientation to each work.These volumes do not rank beside scholarly editions (Norton, &c;) in terms of critical apparatus or analysis. That said, they are perfect for simply reading as well as being very beautifully, very gracefully presented. The series cannot be praised enough for accomplishing what it sets out to do."},{"Title":"World of Shakespeare: The Complete Plays and Sonnets of William Shakespeare (38 Volume Library)","review":"I was hesitant to place my order, despite my interest in acquiring a readable set of Shakespeare's plays in individual volumes, because of concerns about the quality of such a low-priced set.

The linen bindings are spartan but solid-feeling, the paper is a high-quality heavy stock, and the generous page formatting resembles a large trade paperback format. The volumes include introductory notes and typical vocabulary footnotes. As some have indicated, the set is not truly complete, but this was a very minor concern to me.Overall, this was been the most satisfying book purchase I have made in a very, very long time. If you are having any doubts about the set's contents or formatting, I would encourage you to go for it. I have been looking for a set like this for years, and while you could find editions with more luxurious bindings, more scholarly notes, etc, this set presents the texts in an attractive, portable, and seemingly durable format that I expect will serve you well if your interest is in a high-quality reading copy.You will simply not find a better value, and for my needs, there is no better set at any price."},{"Title":"World of Shakespeare: The Complete Plays and Sonnets of William Shakespeare (38 Volume Library)","review":"The reviews encouraged me to buy this series, and I'm very glad I did.

The price comes to little more than $1.50 a book, which is less than a fourth of what you'd pay for just a single paperback edition of any one of these plays.The volumes, while plain in appearnce, are well made, using acid-free paper, solid bindings, and a satin ribbon for marking one's place--they will clearly last for years, no matter how often they're read. And the essays that begin each volume are also first-rate. While each volume contains the same brief accounts on the theatrical world and the texts of Shakespeare, they also offer individual essays on each respective play that do an excellent job of placing the plays in their proper historical and literary contexts. Also, the notes at the bottom of each page are an excellent reference for making clear -- without having to flip to the back of the book -- all of the obscure allusions and words one typically encounters when reading Shakespeare.Finally, I can't tell you what a pleasure it is to be free once and for all from those large single volume Shakespeares that I'm used to reading--you know, those hefty tomes the size of the New York City phone directory with tiny print that can only be read comfotably while sitting at a table. For years I've wanted to own a multi-volume collection of Shakespeare, but the price has always been prohibitive--that is until now.To sum up, if you're considering buying the collected works of the greatest writer of all time, a writer who rewards repeated readings with ever-new and amazing insights each time you take him up, then this is the collection to get. To buy any other edition would be a waste of money.*** I feel compelled to add that I posted the above review almost a year ago, after purchasing the Penguin Shakespeare new for a little less than $60. Since then the price for the set has gone up considerably--why I have no idea. While the quality of the books remains excellent and I am still happy with my purchase, I seriously doubt that I would have bought this offering at the current price.

I'll try to blend them. At the time of this writing, I ordered it from Amazon for $89.70, which was marked down from $299. Sounds hard to believe, and after owning it, it still is. At this price, this is, without doubt, a major, total, complete deal. However, I give it four stars instead of five because it is 99% of Shakespeare's complete works. Why not include the rest? Why, why, why? It'd take two more volumes, one for his non-sonnet poems and one for THE TWO NOBLE KINSMEN, which is now officially part of the Shakespeare canon. It's very easy to get these works, but they wouldn't match your 38-volume set. Still, at anything less than $100, this set is a steal, especially considering that buying all these plays even as used paperbacks would probably cost more, and these are new, 8.5\\" by 5.5\\" hardcovers. Call me a nitpicker, but I just don't get why this collection didn't go that extra half-yard. Still, I bought it anyway and am very happy with it.As for supplements, each book has a basic intro and meanings of archaic words and phrases printed at the bottom of each page.Update: The price of this set has almost doubled since I reviewed it. Even so, it's still a very good price for 38 volumes. As long as you expect basic, not deluxe, editions, you should be happy with this deal."},{"Title":"World of Shakespeare: The Complete Plays and Sonnets of William Shakespeare (38 Volume Library)","review":"...

Some people quibble about the few poems that were left out but I don't see that as an issue. Those poems can easily be printed out and inserted into the appropriate book. A little irksome? Yes. A deal breaker? No. The quality is wonderful and, even at the $150+ price, it is a great deal.

I was fortunate enough to stumble across it while it was offered for $94.99 ($2.50 per book)!. Even at full price (but it's always marked down at least some) this is a deal. Paperback versions of these plays range from $4.99 to $7.99. These average much less and are durable hard covers. They are beautiful little books, with nice linen covers and easy to read text.Collectors, libraries and students will all benefit from having this set. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"World of Shakespeare: The Complete Plays and Sonnets of William Shakespeare (38 Volume Library)","review":"I am a non-native speaker of English who have been struggling to get into Shakespeare's language for a while. My method so far has been reading translations along with the original (over the internet and in Penguin books) and ensuing the aid of \\"no fear Shakespeare\\", Sparknotes and other internet resources, plus the glossary \\"Shakespeare Words\\", which I also bought from Amazon. Only after struggling through several plays I felt I was ready to take one and just read it with the help of only the most essential notes.I thought this complete works would be perfect to finish my Shakespeare education, and it looks like it is. The print is very neat, the notes are convenientely marked, the binding and the cover are very solid, and it definitely looks very well on the bookshelf. They just invite you to look at it and think \\"Oh, I think I'll spend the weekend with Troilus and Cressida\\".I should note, however, that the notes and introductions are NOT detailed enough to get the completely uninitiated through the language and historical references. I recommend that people buy some cheap editions of the most famous plays first and take advantage of the aforementioned internet resources. Otherwise, one can get a little frustrated at not being ready to just take one of those very nice looking books and read it. That is even more true for the sonnets.Once you feel confortable with the basic language, however, it is very much worth the investment. The conver protect the books very well, and the collection may make into the list of the few books your grandchildren will want to keep when they give away most of your library. All the plays are here, even the least appreciated co-authored(though not the probabley spurious Edward III), and who is to say that one day, once you know the most famous works well, you won't feel like completing the works with \\"King John\\" or the entire tetralogies? Trust me, you do not get that enthusiasm when you have the complete works in a single volume. Those are good to brace the leg of the table, as a friend of mine accurately noted."},{"Title":"World of Shakespeare: The Complete Plays and Sonnets of William Shakespeare (38 Volume Library)","review":"Why would it go up from under $100 to 300? It is silly to think I'd pay that much for a collection which originally sold for $99. Price went up that much in 3 years? stupidEven dumber its now up to $600+."},{"Title":"World of Shakespeare: The Complete Plays and Sonnets of William Shakespeare (38 Volume Library)","review":"When I purchased the set it was on sale for 80% off. so with shipping included I was able to get all these books for roughly $63. As I said the set is not flashy but for shakespeare's work all that matters is what is written not the presentation. If you are a fan of shakespeare and there is a massive discount on this set dont hesitate to buy it. It is worth the money. The individual volumes are easier to handle than a giant anthology of works."},{"Title":"World of Shakespeare: The Complete Plays and Sonnets of William Shakespeare (38 Volume Library)","review":"This is just an absolute steal at $60. There are negatives: the set doesn't include the narrative poems (e.g. The Rape of Lucrece and Venus and Adonis), and it doesn't include The Two Noble Kinsmen, which most scholars agree was written partly by Shakespeare and partly by John Fletcher, and is of particular interest because if Shakespeare wrote parts of it, it is his very last surviving written work. Also, the hardbacks are not of the highest quality -- they're not bad by any means, but these are not deluxe volumes.But these things are completely outweighed by the sheer amount of Shakespeare you're getting for the money here. 37 plays and 154 sonnets (and of course, these are some of the absolute best plays and poems of any era, in any language), all for less than $2 apiece. That's spectacular. Technically, you can get Shakespeare's works cheaper, if you want to get one of the huge 1,000+ page tomes of densely packed text like the Riverside or Oxford Shakespeare. And, those are probably better scholarly texts, as well, so serious students and scholars should probably use them. But this is by far the cheapest way to get all of the plays in their own separate hardbacks, which was the deal breaker for me. I bought these plays because I want to READ them, and no set out there is as reader-friendly as this one. If, like me, you simply want a set of Shakespeare's works that is easy and fun to read (and looks sweet on the bookshelf!), then you have to get this. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"World of Shakespeare: The Complete Plays and Sonnets of William Shakespeare (38 Volume Library)","review":"I read the other reviews about this being a great deal for what you're getting. Took a chance....and they were right. After visiting London this summer and realizing I'm literary-deficient, my goal was to read all of Shakespeare's plays once I got home. So I needed a starter set. For $90, I have just that. And much easier to manage that a huge compilation book that I was considering. The book covers are simple, but elegant. Just the right size--easy to carry in my bag to work. I'm very happy with the set--it is a good investment."},{"Title":"World of Shakespeare: The Complete Plays and Sonnets of William Shakespeare (38 Volume Library)","review":"I bought this as a gift for my partner as a graduation present.

I am in Australia and it was here within 7 working days (i paid for the mid range postal option, whatever it is called)."},{"Title":"World of Shakespeare: The Complete Plays and Sonnets of William Shakespeare (38 Volume Library)","review":"Like many people who commented on this collection, I watched the price fluctuate before I finally pulled the trigger at about $60. I have a big, beautiful complete works of Shakespeare bound in leather that mostly sits on my shelf because it is such a burden to take down and actually read. If you actually want a durable set of plays and poems that does not involve heavy weightlifting, this is the set for you. They fit nicely in the hand, the text is pleasing to the eye, and they do not look dirt cheap.I have absolutely no regrets about buying these volumes - they are bound in navy cloth, embossed in silver, and each includes a ribbon bookmark. I know others have complained about this not being a \\"complete\\" set in every sense of the word, but for most of us out there, this collection should be sufficient and I dare say will impress your friends."},{"Title":"World of Shakespeare: The Complete Plays and Sonnets of William Shakespeare (38 Volume Library)","review":"I bought this for a little under $100 a while back. I can wholeheartedly concur with other reviewers that the quality is exceptional for the price, and that I have derived may hours of enjoyment reading the works of the Immortal Bard. This is far better than my old single-volume Shakespeare, or even the 3-volume Oxford set I received as a gift years and years ago. If you are a scholar, you may be concerned with verifying the editing - I am not, and it seems fine to me. The essays and notes are informative and useful. While I do regret that the sonnets are the only peotry included, and \\"The Two Noble Kinsmen\\" is missing, this is still a fantastic deal.The bindings are of good (but not necessarily \\"stunning\\") quality, the print is well done and easily readable. Each volume is of a handy and easily-handled size. The notes are helpful, but not intrusive.All in all, definitely a worthwhile purchase.

A really terrific book."},{"Title":"Memories of Summer: When Baseball was and Art, and Writing About it a Game","review":"Kahn's most recent work, _Memories of Summer_, is a very thoughtfull look to the golden years of baseball, set in the context of Kahn's childhood and career as a journalist. Simply put, it is a must-have for any serious baseball fan, cultural anthropologist, or anyone else wondering how the game used to be and the importance that it played in the lives of fans. Throughout, Kahn manages to capture, quite superbly, the romanticism of the era, focusing specifically on perhaps the very epitome of that romanticism, the bumbling bums of Brooklyn. He very adequately portrays the love affair that so many in Brooklyn had with the team, as well as give an indication of why they are remembered so reverently today. Kahn also laces his story with his interactions with baseball celebrities, including Leo Durocher, Willie Mays, and Jackie Robinson. My one drawback is that Kahn occasionally gets somewhat preachy when addressing race and racial discrimination during the time. Obviously, a certain amount of preaching is in order, but in my humble opinion it goes a step too far. Otherwise, however, the narrative that Kahn weaves, beginning in his childhood (the relationship with his father and how that relates to baseball is especially noteworthy) and tracing his career in journalism through newspapers and magazines is wonderful, easy to follow, and extremely well-written. I completely agree with the earlier reviewer who commented on the issue of &quot;turning corners&quot; in the book, and I would add one more - expansion to the West Coast and baseball turning the corner to become a two-coast sport. The reader can't help but feel the sorrow and bitterness that is left following the move of the Dodgers to California. This is a fantastic composition, a true gem by one of America's premier sports writers. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Memories of Summer: When Baseball was and Art, and Writing About it a Game","review":"I had hoped this would be as good as Kahn's outstanding Boys of Summer. I was disappointed. There are some interesting sketches of players and managers here, some anecdotes about baseball, and some tidbits about the evocative time and place in which Kahn grew up, including pervasive anti-Semitsm of his early years. And the book gives a feeling for what \\"dem bums\\" meant to to Brooklyn.Unfortunately much of the rest is boring. Kahn's father is not particularly interesting to anyone but himself, nor is Kahn's relationship with his father. In contrast to Kahn's writing about baseball, his writing about his process of writing about baseball is stupifyingly dull. It just is not that fascinating to learn how he had trouble thinking up a good headline or story lead. Who cares? Give us another anecdote about Willie or Mickey instead. Like so many examples of writers endlessly writing about their process of writing, and film makers endlessly discussing their process of film making, my response was \\"Who cares?\\" It is dull and self-indulgent. Produce the damn work--- the story, book, movie, painting or whatever, and let it speak for itself.After dealing with too much of this navel-gazing, I skimmed the book for information about ballplayers and managers and baseball and ignored all the chaff.Give it a \\"5\\" for 25% of the content, a \\"1\\" for 75%."},{"Title":"Memories of Summer: When Baseball was and Art, and Writing About it a Game","review":"Mr. Kahn turns back the clock to the days when baseball was the true American pastime. His anecdotes and interviews about Mantle, Mays, and Early Wynn bring these individuals to life more than any statistics possibly could. His love of his father is written about in such a profound manner that is timeless. In all a classic piece of Americana that hopefully will be read fifty years from now."},{"Title":"Memories of Summer: When Baseball was and Art, and Writing About it a Game","review":"I was fortunate enough to receive a preview copy of this book a few weeks before its release because I was interviewing Mr. Kahn on a radio interview program.As soon as I started reading, I was hooked. Although I was not alive during the 1950's, I have always been fascinated with baseball during that era, particularly the lovable Brooklyn Dodgers. Kahn's latest book does such a wonderful job of describing what it was like to be around baseball every day in that bygone era.The easiest interview I have ever done was that one I did with Roger. His love for baseball was evident from the first question I asked him. His insight gained from covering the Dodgers in the 1950's is something every baseball fan could use. In this season of home runs, the average fan is once again starting to appreciate baseball. Roger Kahn will make you appreciate it even more."},{"Title":"Memories of Summer: When Baseball was and Art, and Writing About it a Game","review":"Kahn has done it again. His prose, from the unique perspective of veteran baseball writer who cares about his subjects, is at once soothing and revealing. Kahn's appreciation for the history that he witnessed - and helped create - is sure to enrich any baseball fan's appreciation of the history (to say nothing of vitally important players both on and off the field) of this great game."},{"Title":"Memories of Summer: When Baseball was and Art, and Writing About it a Game","review":"So much has been written about baseball in the 1950s that it takes a special writer to offer something truly new about the subject. Kahn is such a writer. His book includes original essays on Willie Mays and Mickey Mantle, essays which offer new perspectives on the two great icons of '50s baseball. And Kahn's look back on his reporting days for the New York Herald-Tribune and the young SPORTS ILLUSTRATED is the best account of the PROCESS of sportswriting yet written. Kahn poignantly recalls how baseball brought him closer to his father and, later, his mother. He closes with a list of his favorite baseball books, certain to stir Hot Stove League discussions for the next few winters. MEMORIES OF SUMMER is a splendid evocation not only of a game, but of the three-dimensional people behind it"},{"Title":"Memories of Summer: When Baseball was and Art, and Writing About it a Game","review":"Kahn's love of baseball translates with ease onto the page. His written word is superb. Let his stories take you back to a golden age of baseball when the Yankees, the Giants, and the Dodgers ruled the World and Willie Mays owned centerfield. If you love the game of baseball and like a good read. Kahn's fluid tales will highly satisfy. 5 stars!"},{"Title":"Memories of Summer: When Baseball was and Art, and Writing About it a Game","review":"Let me explain this way: Growing up, I was never a fan of the Dodgers, they were my Giants' rival. This book made me a fan. In fact, this book made me long to be the kind of fan Khan was, want to be a roadie for a team I barely knew of beyond a few big names a week before. It revived my slumped interest in baseball overall, and taught me a lot that I had never considered about the sport.There's not one place in this book where names and stats are thrown at the reader; every name and every statistic is a story, some seen from the wide eyes of a child and some with the reverence of an adult around his human heroes. Neither is this book a whitewash nor the disillusionment of heroes not living up to their image: Everyone is alive and fresh, everyone has a meticulously researched backstory told with a folksy sense of humor about their all-too-human foibles. Mixed into the stories are comments from the people involved from interviews many years later, when they can look back with more honesty, written in seamlessly. Of course not everyone's stories match - instead of choosing a truth, Khan just lays a few sides out, lets the reader feel some of the disharmony that occasionally shook the teams, without stopping to exhaustively debate the reality of each.It's very obvious that Khan is an astute master of language, someone who spent fifty years not only writing stories daily but perfecting his craft. The emotion he pours into every page never comes off tacky or trite, it's manly but not chauvinistic, and filled with a lifelong boyish wonder. Most of all, the retelling of each game is something special, breathing life back into an afternoon decades past. He manages to create an incredibly visceral picture of the highs and lows, tossing in more stories to bridge the plays, and inspires plenty of envy. It never gets old, and no technique is overused enough or story long enough to grate.The book certainly shifts dramatically with the move away from Brooklyn, slows down a bit and comes back to earth as it accelerates through the years, but I never lost interest in it. I wish this book hadn't been stolen from me; someday I'll find it again and finish the last few chapters. I really do want to hear the last word - and then pass it on to another Dodger fan who just doesn't know it yet."},{"Title":"Memories of Summer: When Baseball was and Art, and Writing About it a Game","review":"If you like New York baseball, then by all means pick up this wonderful book. A history of the game without being pedantic, and a personal memoir of a guy and his dad, without drowning in sappy nostalgia, Kahn weaves his personal tale of rising through the ranks of childhood dreamer to baseball writer of the Brooklyn Dodgers, with great skill. His writing is top notch, and his insights into the game and the men who played it are fascinating. A perfect summer read."},{"Title":"Memories of Summer: When Baseball was and Art, and Writing About it a Game","review":"In &quot;Memories of Summer,&quot; Roger Kahn takes the reader back to a time when the Dodgers were an integral part of the life of a Brooklynite, through his career as a writer for several different newspapers and magazines, up to modern times where he interviews former baseball stars, including Jackie Robinson, Mickey Mantle, and Willie Mays.Though he grew up a Dodger fan, forced to wait 'til next year seemingly forever, his love not just for the Dodgers, but for the game, is made manifest through his memoir and his reprinted articles. His painting of baseball in his earlier years as a game engulfed in wonder and mystique is shared by many who cherish old-time baseball.Kahn is not remiss in placing baseball in the context of the social realm in which it was played--a time where writers were reluctant to write about the off-the-field lives of players and where racism, which barred blacks from playing in the majors for almost 50 years, slowly gave way to integration, very slowly. He saw the Jackie Robinsons and the Willie Mays and the Monte Irvins in Major League Baseball as baseball players, not black baseball players.This book is funny at times, sad at others, but always piques interest. Kahn does an outstanding job of painting vivid images of a time when baseball truly was an art, and writing about it truly a game."},{"Title":"Memories of Summer: When Baseball was and Art, and Writing About it a Game","review":"The flowing pen of author Roger Kahn provides readers with books of nostalgia and heart. Here he covers baseball in New York City in the bygone 1950's, his love affair with the Brooklyn Dodgers (whom he covered as reporter from 1952-1953), plus the Yankees and Giants. Readers learn a few things about Jackie Robinson, Willie Mays, Leo Durocher, etc. There's the author's take on baseball racism, on the slow retreat in the 1950's. Kahn also traces his upbringing and close relationship with his baseball-addicted father. The book has a definite sense of loss, due to his father's passing, the Dodgers and Giants fleeing to California, and the urban decline that has since afflicted New York and many other once-tranquil cities. This moving book is something of a follow-up to THE BOYS OF SUMMER, the author's superb look at the Brooklyn Dodgers that was published in the early 1970's (this book came out in the late 1990's).This book doesn't quite match BOYS OF SUMMER, but it's another gem by a writer whose heart clearly belongs to baseball."},{"Title":"Memories of Summer: When Baseball was and Art, and Writing About it a Game","review":"The most poignant scene in Kahn's remarkable book occurs about a third of the way through--in the bottom of the third inning, say. Kahn is talking baseball with his father, a college professor and an intelligent fan, a former semipro player from whom the son learned everything he knew about baseball through childhood and adolescence. But now things are different--the son, still in his early 20s, is a newspaper beat writer for the pennant-winning Brooklyn Dodgers. He is a rookie at his craft, but he realizes as his father talks that he already understands more about the game--from a single season spent in daily conversation with big leaguers--that any intelligent fan can from a life's long-distance observation. A torch has been passed, though not willingly, not without some struggle. A corner has been turned.Turning corners--the geometric imperative of baseball itself--is the dominant metaphor of the book: the son turns an Oedipal corner and supplants the father; the all-white game turns the corner and runs smack into Jackie Robinson; the eternally frustrating Bums turn a corner into the eternally invoked &quot;next year&quot;; and sportswriting turns a corner from gritty newsprint to the glossy magazines. None of the turns is made with the facility of a swift base runner rounding the bag; advances, rather, come a labored base at a time, the game and the world forced up a grudging ninety feet by the forces of history.What is--or seems, at least--effortless is the elegant flow of Kahn's prose, like Mays gliding back to snag Wertz's blast, then whirling in a single slinging motion, getting the ball back to the infield to save a run, a game, a World Series--a precious fragment of what keeps the game improbably, miraculously pure. Anyone who is fed up with wild cards and designated hitters and stadium names drawn from the stock listings must read this book. For a moment, at least--for the span of a summer afternoon, eyes asquint, the field excruciatingly green--you, like Kahn at the end, can turn one last corner and return home."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"Christopher Lash is a psychologist specializing in marital relationships. He previous worked for the FBI, giving him insight into criminal behavior. This is the reason officials at Eden Inc. have contacted him, to investigate the mysterious double-suicide of two of their clients.Eden is a matchmaker, but unlike any before it. Eden uses a highly advanced Artificial Intelligence to match individuals on every little detail (more than a million criteria). Lewis and Lindsay Thorpe were two such individuals, and were also the company's first \\"supercouple:\\" two people who are a 100% match. But now they are dead...and Lash must find out why. Because another supercouple has killed themselves...and there are four more such couples to go. But finding out why two perfect couples would want to kill themselves is only half of Lash's problem, because somebody is messing with his life, in ways that could only be done through the technology available at Eden...\\"Death Match\\" is a top-notch thriller from Lincoln Child, who has brought us (especially in collaboration with Douglas Preston) so many enjoyable, well-planned thrillers. This novel is no exception; though it is a bit predictable, it is still enthralling. The technological details are broken down into layman's terms, but with serious research behind them. Lash is an appealing, conflicted character, as are those he encounters. While \\"Death Match\\" may not be Child's best work to-date, it is certainly worth checking out, and a repeated reading or two."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"Eden, Incorporated is a huge corporation that promises to find the perfect love match for each of its applicants. These matches are performed using a powerful artificial intelligence-based computer called Liza. The matches are so accurate and the resulting partnerships so idyllic that not a single client has ever claimed a refund from the money-back guarantee. When two of Eden's \\"perfect match\\" couples are found dead of double-suicide, a former FBI forensic psychologist, Christopher Lash, is brought in to investigate whether Eden has failed to predict a psychological instability when it performed its thorough personality testing of each applicant. Lash finds nothing in the psychological profiles of the four suicides and he suspects foul play. Could this be homicide made to look like suicide, and if so, why? Could it be a disgruntled former Eden employee? Or could it be a rejected applicant for Eden's services? As Lash is granted complete access to the mysterious workings of Eden, he finds that someone is out to stop him from discovering the perpetrator, and soon Lash finds his reputation and his life in jeopardy.Having read Child's previous novel \\"Utopia,\\" I found a lot of similarities between the two books. Both feature a large and highly successful corporation engineered using next-generation computers and incredibly futuristic technology. Both companies are being undermined, and ultimately threatened, by evildoers. In both cases an outsider is brought in to investigate the problem. Both investigators are drawn into the dangers and must race against the clock to save the lives of innocent people, including themselves. Both stories are fast-paced, suspenseful thrillers. The main difference is that \\"Death Match\\" has several plot twists and turns before the mysterious perpetrator is unmasked, and its ending is not as satisfying as that in \\"Utopia.\\" This novel is still a worthwhile read, whether or not you have read its predecessor.The book's details on psychological testing and profiling are quite interesting, although I cannot judge how accurate they are. The story also made me ponder the nature of attraction that people feel for each other, how its characteristics could be scientifically quantified, and whether there is such a thing as one or more \\"perfect matches\\" for every individual. I recommend this story for those who enjoy high-tech thrillers and cinematic action.Eileen Rieback"},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"I really enjoyed Death Match.

If he doesn't find out quickly who the killer is--it's not just another super-couple at stake.\\"Death Match\\" is very well-written. Child explains computer tones in a manner that avoids the usual sophorific geek's explainations and makes the whole story come alive."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"DEATH MATCH is the first novel I have read that was written independently by Lincoln Child. However, I have read the following books he co-authored with Douglas Preston: RELIC, MOUNT DRAGON, RELIQUARY, THE CABINET OF CURIOSITIES and STILL LIFE WITH CROWS. I found all of the co-authored books profoundly intense. With that in mind, I read DEATH MATCH.I can make two points that will assist people to decide whether to read this novel. First, like the co-authored novels, there is a level of intensity that takes the reader into the eyes of the central character -- in this case, Christopher Lash, a forensic psychologist. I relish novels that make me forget about meals I need to eat or meetings I am suppose to attend. Child's work does this. This writing style locks outside environmental stimuli out of my consciousness.Second, this novel has the same favor as MOUNT DRAGON, the second novel Lincoln Child wrote with Douglas Preston. In that respect, I felt this novel was a bit too predictable. By chapter 36, I eliminated the culprit to two possibilities. In a later chapter (I can't identify it), Richard Silver says, \\"Don't hurt him.\\" At that second, everything fell into place and knew how the novel was going to end. The rest of the novel was anticlimactic and I found myself disappointed. I found myself reading more rapidly and with much less relish in my mind. As a result, I skipped the epilogue. DEATH MATCH was too much like other novels.About five days later while I was bored, I picked up the DEATH MATCH and finally read the epilogue. Everything changed! Child should have entitled this epilogue \\"Chapter Sixty-Five.\\" The ending is not as predictable as I had thought when I heard Richard Silver utter those words, \\"Don't hurt him.\\" The epilogue provides an unexpected twist. It is the kind of twist I love in a novel. Most importantly and unlike MOUNT DRAGON, this story doesn't end. Child can easily write a sequel; perhaps he can entitle it, LIFE MATCH."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"I have read all of Child's collaborations with Douglas Preston and have generally liked them-some of their stories are among my favorites. I have also read Child's and Preston's solo books and they have never been quite as good as their team efforts. Much like Child's last solo work, Utopia, this book starts with an interesting premise that grips the reader, but it degenerates as the technology is introduced and fails to follow through with an equally compelling ending.The story begins with the apparent suicide of a couple that were supposedly perfectly matched by the Eden corporation. The main character, a forensic psycologist named Christopher Lash, is brought in to determine why this happened. Then a second perfectly matched couple commits double-suicide and the intrigue builds. At this point, Lash is exposed to the highly secretive operations of Eden and their extensive matching process and this is where the story begins to lose credibility.The matching process accumulates a massive amount of data that are analyzed by a super computer named Liza. We are told that Liza is based on artificial intelligence concepts and is actually self-aware and can learn. We are supposed to believe that Liza is by far the the most powerful and advanced computer in the world and yet it is owned by a private company and used primarily as a matchmaker? We are told that some of the early funding to build Liza came from the government and that Liza does contracting work for various Federal agencies, but the fact that Liza is not under government control is too unbelievable.Another ridiculous aspect of Liza is her construction. She is cobbled together with computers dating back to the 1960's! Anyone who has ever tried to install a CD/DVD drive or a new operating system is aware of the considerable compatability issues with computers. And yet we are supposed to believe that the world's most advanced system is pieced together with Apple IIe's, Commodore 64's, and whatever else could be found. Finally, the data gathering is over the top and highly illegal. Liza has access to clients' (and Eden employees') internet-related data: bank/credit card records, traffic tickets/crimianl records, etc. I can believe that clients would allow this, but Liza has unfettered access to rejected clients and the general public and constantly spies on them! Liza: the world's most advanced hacker!Overall the characters are well written and their dialog is not distractingly bad. But the book is pretty short and the ending unoriginal. As I read it I couldn't help but think this was a cross between Wargames and The Lawnmower Man. I do not regret reading it, but I was disappointed with it."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"The problem I have with this book is its underlying premise, let's see, the greatest computer ever built, a computer named Liza (a mate for Hal of 2001 fame?)that is capable of work that NASA computers cannot even dream of doing, and the purpose of this computer, why, to match loveless people together, to do the same thing the dating game used to do!Eden is the company name and that's what they do, match people up using their super-computer to make as perfect a match as possible. When one of their \\"perfect\\" matches, a super-couple, commit suicide, and then another couple does the same, the company knows something is wrong. They hire a former FBI man named Lash to investigate and some pages into the book he realizes it is murder made to look like suicide. Why? Who is killing these people? The suspense generated in this book arises out of this mystery and it is sufficient to keep the reader's interest to the end, although most will have figured out the villain long before the final page is read. Still, a decent read."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"Lincoln Child needs to be very ashamed of himself for this one.It begins so promising. A psychologist is brought in to research a double suicide. The couple was seemingly perfect: wealthy, intelligent, incredibly happy together, and with a newborn baby. Why had this couple self-destructed?The company bringing him in is Eden, Inc, a matchmaking service. Founded by reclusive Richard Silver, the company is famous for matching couples that are nearly perfect for each other, with wild success. This couple was a so-called &quot;supercouple,&quot; one that was indeed a perfect match.It begins strong and fluid, and is quite enjoyable. It feels different, as the company isn't dark, sinister and shadowy. They have some aspects of your standard dark, sinister and shadowy companies, but none of the characteristics. In fact it's refreshingly honest and benevolent.So what changes? Well, the company is based on an incredible computer. This computer, named Liza, is a learning machine capable of passing the Turing Test. That is, the AI can pass for human. It learns, evolves, and adapts. It even teaches itself.Gee, have you heard this one before?*Spoilers*Ok, so you have a smart machine. You read this and your first thought was &quot;did it have something to do with the suicides? Was it acting on its own without people realizing?&quot; Then you think, &quot;No, can't be. This book is refreshingly different. Lincoln Child has done this before, he won't be that lazy. Utopia wasn't a lazy book, aside from Wingnut. The books with Preston aren't lazy books. No way will he be lazy.&quot;Sorry, folks, he's lazy, uninspired, and retells a story you've read a few thousand times before./end spoilers.I give the book three stars because it begins so well. Somewhere between pages 200 and 260 you'll have the entire ending figured out, though. Every tiny twist, every little detail - you'll know it all. With an extra 100 pages left (the book is a bit thin), well, I'm sorry to say you won't care. You already know the ending, so you won't want to read it all that carefully.Even worse, many of the final pages get bogged down with technical aspects you don't care much about, either. I've done extensive programming in Assembly and even found myself skimming over his discussions on machine language and registers. I feel bad for the non-technically inclined, they'll be utterly lost just as the conclusion is playing out.Not that it matters, I'm sure they figured the ending out long before and are just reading to get it over with, hoping they are somehow surprised.A worthy first 200 pages, a sad final 250 pages. Two and a half star book, at best. I rounded up out of respect for the author, I suppose, but even then I feel this should only be getting one star for being so stale, predictable, and ten or fifteen years too late."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"Do you think your mate is 100% compatible with you? Do you think that is even possible? Many say no, but this book peeks into that with a twist. Finding that perfect mate ends in death for one of them. Not the happiest ending one would expect.I appreciated how simple the characters were in the story, making it seem more real. Dr Lash is brought back into the story and even finds himself wondering if he has a perfect mate.I won't spoil any ending, but you start to assume it towards the middle of the book, but you forge ahead knowing you just have to put together how it was done.Good book and a fast read"},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"This book started out in a way that I could not put it down. It was a very interesting and well written beginning. Unfortunately, the narrative broke down a bit towards the end. I was able to predict what was happening about 100 pages before everything was explained. To me this lessens the quality of the book.However, much of the information on psychology given in the book was absolutely fascinating since I do not have any sort of background in it."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"I am definitely a Child fan now. This book was even better then Utopia.Eden Incorporated is a matchmaking company, but not your average dating service. Their high-tech method has spectacular success that inspires awe around the world, but the secrecy is legendary.The Thorpes were not just a good match, they were Eden's first perfect match. Then why in the world did they commit double suicide? Eden calls in former FBI forensic psychologist Christopher Lash. Lash finds nothing suspicious, but inadvertently dredges up a searing personal tragedy he has blocked out for years.When the second perfect match commits suicide together, Eden gets desperate. Lash is invited inside the secrecy of the company on a desperate search to find a reason. The technology is stunning and Lash is amazed to discover that Eden really does keep its promise to its clients: the guarantee of a perfect match.Lash's investigation becomes more personal and dangerous, the deeper he digs. Who is causing the perfect couples to die? Is it Richard Silver, the mysterious creator of Eden? Some other insider? About the only thing they know for sure is that it's someone inside. But who?This was a great read! Once again, Child slips in a lot of technical information without slowing the story. With the proliferation of matchmaking companies today, this is a must read simply for the technology. But it's also a must-read for anyone who enjoys a fast-paced psychological thriller."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"This book goes to show you the dangers of the information age where there is so much information about you available that anyone with the knowhow and the desire could know just about everything about you and with a few tweaks, can change your entire history. It also raises some interesting concepts about love relationships. It seems everyone is searching for a conceptualized \\"perfect\\" mate that they have in their mind, which is probably someone made up of ideas garnered from Hollywood and other such sources. In reality, the perfect mate is someone you never really pictured. You just know them when you meet them.I thoroughly enjoyed this book about a company that has figured out that with enough information about a person (historic, physical, mental) you can use computer simulations to find the perfect mate. The author introduces a lot of information about psychological testing (I assume it is all correct) and presents everything in terms that the simplest layman can understand.I enjoyed this book slightly more than the author's previous work Utopia, which was pretty good in its own right."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"Eden, a company that takes matchmaking a step or two further than the web-based matching sites. Full psychological profile, physical exam including genetics, and a one-of-a-kind matching process for a mere $25,000. The success rate is beyond anyone's wildest dreams. Satisfaction is guaranteed and there has never been a request for a refund. The company actually has found 6 couples that are &quot;super couples&quot; they match 100% to one another. Everyone who knows these couples marvel at their perfect unions. Until they start committing suicide.The company brings in a retired FBI forensic psychologist Christopher Lash to keep the problem low profile and ensure there is nothing wrong internally. Dealing with a company that surrounds itself with the best security available and a reclusive genius in the form of the founder, Lash is trying to use his skills against a technology that has the ability to learn, and thus fight back when threatened.Another enjoyable read from Child mixing high tech and thrills -- fun page turner."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"Lincoln Child in his intriguing new novel &quot;Death Match&quot; again reveals his fascination with plots revolving around computerization.Eden Inc., a huge corporation headquartered in Manhattan is the brainchild of reclusive, socially inept yet brilliant computer engineer Richard Silver. Silver pioneered a successful foray into the field of artificial intelligence when he created his computer network known as &quot;Liza&quot;. Liza's primary function is high tech matchmaking. For a fee of $25,000 an applicant would be subjected to an exhaustive, physical, psychological and mental analysis. This would be used to create an avatar, in effect the essence of the individual. This could be matched up with others to find a guaranteed suitable mate.The service provided by Eden had been wildly successful until a perfectly matched couple called a supercouple, The Thorpes are found to have committed double suicide in their Flagstaff home. Silver immediately implores his corporate staff to bring in former FBI forensic psychologist and profiler Dr. Christopher Lash to find out what happened. Soon after Lash's investigation starts another one of the six supercouples also turn up dead. Lash with assistance from Eden security chief Tara Stapleton proceed to plod through a morass of computer files to unravel this perplexing problem.Although the ending is somewhat predictable Child holds your interest throughout. He does at times get bogged down in computer jargon but the psychoanalysis presented is quite interesting. I still feel however, that collaboration with Douglas Preston produces a superior product."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"Love makes the world go round and keeps Lincoln Child's latest techno-thriller tightly wound.Child, with or without his writing partner, Douglas Preston, keeps me up at night. I'm a little bit scared, a little bit thrilled and I find it tough to put the book down and catch some ZZZZs. This is his best solo effort to this point.Death Match has a very strong start with a puzzling, compelling problem for the book's hero. I don't want to spoil the plot for any readers, but the opening chapters hit hard emotionally.Child has always excelled at balancing technical explanation with jazzing it up so it's fun to read. He seems to choose his technology for thrillers by picking something he himself is interested in but he's very good at explaining current art plus fun but logical extensions without lapsing into major geekdom.This book has excellent pacing - I required two coffees the next morning even though I seldom touch caffeine. I just couldn't stop reading. I wasn't scared. Instead I found myself trying to take Child's clues and play \\"Clue.\\" Who was the villain? Why were these inexplicable things happening? Was there any connection to the psychologist's past experiences?Almost everyone I know has had a fling at computer dating and been disappointed. Child dangles a very realistic though flashy scenario of making a \\"perfect match\\" in front of the reader.There is a sense that the villain is playing a game with Christopher Lash, the forensic psychologist. Is this a match that started in his past? Or did it start in Eden (the corporation that matches prospective life mates)?Definitely a thrill ride and perfect beach reading, too."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"I've been a fan of preston and child books for some time now. And I've managed to read their solo efforts as well. While it was decent, Utopia just didn't live up to the previous efforts that child had worked on with his partner, douglas preston. This book, however, was a great read from beginning to end.It leans more on the technological side, but it doesn't get bogged down in the actual technology like utopia did. The characters are great and there's alot of great twists and turns.Definetly worth reading!"},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"\\"Death Match\\", Lincoln Child's second effort, is a compelling and entertaining page-turner. The theme - a modern day dating service - could hardly be any less promising as the backdrop for a techno-thriller. But Child spins a tale with the aplomb of Michael Crichton, while bringing the often terrifying cyber-future of William Gibson to a broader audience.\\"Death Match\\" is the story of Eden, a high-tech match making company whose coupling of singles has extraordinary results - for an extraordinary price of $25,000 per person - launching Eden and reclusive founder Richard Silver to an American icons and Wall Street darlings. Darlings, that is, until some seemingly well adjusted couples start committing double suicides. Enter Christopher Lash, former FBI psychologist and profiler with his own baggage, called in by the Eden brass to get a handle on these unlikely suicides. The ultra-secret, ultra high security Eden must increasingly reveal their matching methods to Lash as another couple dies and the need for damage control escalates. Child does a masterful job of making an engaging story of arcane psychobabble, complete with actual Rorschach inkblots and IQ tests. He dives deep into founder Richard Silver's neural-networked supercomputer, the core of Eden's success, as Child unravels the mysteries databases, avatars, and other geek-speak into a who-dunnit even your grandmother would understand and enjoy. For the \\"black helicopter\\" crowd, there is enough bizarre conspiracy theory and \\"big brother\\" to keep the Internet chat rooms buzzing, while the more skeptical reader can still enjoy Child's fantasy of an industrial-government tryanny with nothing better to do than invade individual privacy.In short, slickly plotted, believable (if thinly developed) characters, and steady action make \\"Death Match\\" the best solo effort I've read of either Child or Preston, and definitely up to par with some of their more popular team efforts. A good bet for the big screen, this fiction is a frightening as it is imaginative; the perfect read for a lazy day or long flight."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"This is not the kind of book I would normally pick up and read. The story surrounds the mysterious double suicide of a couple who were perfectly matched through a succesful computerised dating agency (which has a success rate that is even higher than Cupid's arrows). Now I like computers, but mix computers and dating and the image that this conjures up for me is such a sad stereotype that I shall not dare write it out! I also don't go for crime thrillers much.But Lincoln Child also wrote Utopia, which I also very much enjoyed - so I gave this one a go, and was surprised to find this story was every bit as readable. Here is a good plot driven thriller with perfect amounts of mystery, suspense, prejudicial emotions and action to make it the kind of book you just want to pick up again each time you set it down.The nature of the narrative would suit it for adaption to film, I expect. It is not a deep and philosophical novel. It is just a very good story, well written and well executed. This is the kind of book Dan Brown would have aspired to write, had he had a better talent for detail (but what does Dan Brown care? people buy his books anyway!)So if you want a good and exciting plot driven thriller without annoying inconsistencies or silly pretentions, then this one will do just fine."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"I wish there were more hours in the day just so I could read this book more!

I give it 5 stars!"},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"One thing is absolutely certain- Child & Preston both do their best work when they are writing together. That's not to say that their individual works are terrible, but it's pretty clear that they seem to complement each other & make up for the other's shortcomings. That factor is slightly apparent in this novel, even though it's one of my favorites by Lincoln Child as an individual writer.Death Match is about a matchmaking company named Eden. Eden's not just any type of matchmaker company- they offer 100% complete satisfaction & the waiting list to get into their databases is legendary. Why are they so sought after? Because they claim that they can find you your soul mate within their logs & prove their compatibility with an uncanny percentage. They've even got a few couples that are 100% compatible. Too bad all of those couples are being mysteriously killed one by one. Lash has been hired to discover why this is happening, but someone doesn't want him getting to close. Or is it something?There's many good & bad things about this novel. First, the good. I really enjoyed the premise of the super matchmaking computer service. I thought it was pretty original & let's be honest- with companies touting similar services, it's a somewhat realistic premise. I also liked the characters, especially the strange & intriguing creator of Eden. The pacing was interesting & I liked the mystery of what exactly happened to cause the deaths of so many people & why.Now for the bad. After a while, everything became predictable & the \\"whodunnit\\" part of it just sort of lost it's luster for me. I still enjoyed the book greatly, but I just wish that I'd have been able to go a little longer before I was easily able to guess what was going on. The other thing that bothered me was that the idea of such a strong computer being used purely for dating was a little unbelievable. I just couldn't believe that the government wouldn't have stepped in & tried to take it over for their own purposes. That's a petty complaint, but I had it all the same.Fans of Child & Preston will love this book. Fans of techno thrillers are sure to like it as well. Just don't go in expecting this to be anything other than what it is- a beach/vacation read to get you through until the next Preston/Child book is out."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"This one isn't as tense or thrilling as Child's work with Douglas Preston to whom he gives credit for a chapter here. The story builds as we are introduced to the ultimate dating service. Unintended (or intended) consequences result in two double murders and the threat of a third.If you're looking for a nail biter or a read-until-dawn experience, I'm afraid you'll be disappointed. If, however, a combination of murder, match-making and artificial intelligence sounds intriguing, log on, by all means. Just make sure you can shut down when you want to."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"I only wish the culprit had been different.

I had a difficult time putting it down and really appreciated the concept that our happiness is something that can be mapped and put into binary.

Definetely a must read."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"This entire computer story line has been done before on the original version of Star Trek, I kept expecting they would change it, but it is almost verbatim! Would have liked more of a twist! I listened to the audio version and I could not believe how many numbers that poor person had to read out. Every time Lash picked up a file he read the client number and that was for 6 different files, all the different tests, all the different results. It was beyond tedious to listen to over and over. I think I had one of the numbers memorized by the end! When you are reading you can just skim over it, when listening you are stuck!!! I have to admit the basic premise is intriguing. The thought of a perfect match, the one person who complements you completely is fascinating. It is hard not to wonder if they person you are with would match with you in the tank!!!"},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"The story centers around a Dating company who use immensely powerful computers to work out if people match with each other along with some complex screening procedures.

Unfortunately, DEATH MATCH turns out to be a minor effort from a writer with tremendous potential.DEATH MATCH is a very well written book. The quality and intelligence of the writing is first rate, much higher than average. I also thought the premise of the book was highly inventive: the idea of a highly sophisticated matchmaking service that can create \\"perfect\\" couples. Indeed, the first two hundred pages of this novel are genuinely great, as Child explores in depth the inner workings of how such a matchmaking organization would work. Clearly, Child has done a great deal of research into personality psychology, which I found quite fascinating.Unfortunately, this novel goes off the rails about mid-way through. Child abandons the matchmaking premise and instead turns his attention to a supercomputer with artificial intelligence. The reader is forced to wade through a lot of technical computer jargon and a completely unrealistic chase scene through an office building. Even worse, there is an ending that is supposed to be a big surprise, but I found completely predictable and cliched. This book ends with a whimper.I liked DEATH MATCH enough to read more work by this author. However, this book was ultimately kind of a disappointment, since I was hoping for so much better. Still, if Lincoln Child can fine-tune his plotting, he can turn into the next Michael Crichton in my opinion."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"I agree with the other reviewers. Do not waste your time here. What started off as riveting, ended with me throwing the book across the room. The last 100 pages were torture for me, but I forced myself through them. I will not read another book by this Child."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"I was so into this book I read the last 150 pages in one sitting."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"Extremely disappointed is high praise for this work. This will be my last read for Child alone. I found this book pretentious in its long and lenghthy explanations of computers, software, codes, interfacing, sequences, etc. which really were just not that interesting and didn't add much to the story overall. Seems Child got lost in his own words and complicated ideas and I felt like I needed a PHD in computer science to really enjoy the story. I can't fault Child for the charts thorughout the book that don't read at all on a Kindle, but it still annoyed me.There was an enormous effort in detailed descriptions of facililties, rooms, hallways, staircases, ducts, buildings and surprising little development of any of the characters. Odd really, as the Preston/Child collaborations on character development are so strong. Maybe Preston writes those parts.At 60%, I figured out the identity of the killer and pretty much skimmed the rest of the book. And the method of murder was just unbelievable for several couples you know little about and care even less. They are not really people.....but products....maybe that's the point. I wish I had ordered a sample first before I spent the $$.The Preston/Child books are some of my favorite reads, which probably made this one all the most disappointing."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"Lincoln Child starts with an intriguing premise for what could have easily been a 5 star novel.The book starts of strong and is very gripping -- until the technology that was supposedly used to match the couples is revealed. It starts out pushing the reader's ability to suspend disbelief and things go down hill from there.The ending is obvious very early on and the book continues on longer after the \\"secret\\" is revealed.I checked it out the library and I would recommend the same for any Lincoln Child fan. It's worth a read, but not a purchase."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"** Possible spoilers **Child obviously has done his homework regarding computers and AI. The premise is an interesting one, the storyline is very well developed and proceeds at an exciting pace. The ending is somewhat far fatched though; the computer Liza being the culprit and all. I mean, if it is capable of tracking Lash's activites and realizing that he is a threat, how come it cannot figure out the plan by our hero and his friends in the end that results in its termination?Also there are a few loose ends that seem to be storylines in themselves - the stalker, Lash's past life, the enigmatic employees of Eden who seem to be hiding secrets etc. Were they added just to distract and keep you guessing? If so, they were not brought to a satisfactory conclusion.This book is certainly better than Child's other solo effort - Utopia, a monumental bore despite the lofty title. I am still waiting for the next Douglas/Child joint effort, sans Pendergast, of course. I think we have had enough of the Holmes/Mycroft alter egos."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"AT THE RISK OF BEING REDUNDANT, I find myself sharing the views of several other reviewers: it starts out great, but the last third is so bogged down in technical mumbo jumbo, and it seems as if Child fixed everything to make sense. Too bad, because for a while, we have a real pageturner going here. While I hadn't totally picked the real killer, the revelation is no surprise, considering the direction Childs is taking us in. Christopher Lash is an interesting hero, but his immediate love for his perfect match, Diana Mirren, comes out of nowhere; how come he doesn't fall for the lovely if offish Tara? And we could have done without the lengthy chase scene through the buildings tunnels or whatever they were. Richard Silver, the owner of Eden, is like most of the megalomaniacs in books like this, so his fate is likewise telegraphed.All in all, DEATH MATCH is a fun book, but it's overly technical climax is detrimental in the long run."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"This is a totally different storyline from the usual Child books. It was an enjoyable read about a futuristic (one hopes!) concept of dating and the perfect couple. It shows what can go wrong if you allow the human relationship matching to be done by a computer. A very good read and a very different plot from the regular Preston and Child books."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"This rates lower than it would if it were written by another author, because I've come to expect great things from Lincoln Child - either writing alone, or with Preston. And while this book really drew me in to begin with, it got a little stagnant towards the middle. And the end was entirely predictable. It was an interesting plot, but there wasn't enough of a twist to keep it interesting, and I'd say that if you read a lot, it's probably worth it. But if you're only going to read a handful of books this year, I wouldn't recommend it. It was just okay.I'd strongly recommend you check out his other works."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"Mr. Child certainly has found a niche - technology and writing thrillers. A little difficult to get through all the 00000000's and other techno babble - but necessary to be convincing. Great read..."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"Now that I've read both Preston and Child as singular authors and coauthors, I now know Preston seems to be the backbone to Preston/Child's collaborative works. With \\"Death Match\\", Child developed an intriguing premise but failed to execute the story. Despite the promising premise, the story was actually BORING. It was slow-moving, the characters were \\"eh\\", and the end was predictable. It's unfortunate Child didn't have the insight to insert more conspiracy and intrigue, for the \\"long-awaited\\" answer to the deaths ended up being disappointingly simple and obvious. Hopefully Child's \\"Utopia\\" proves to be a more interesting read."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"This is a very entertaining novel which held my interest. Some of the high tech jargon was over my head and could have been eliminated. It is a good mystery. I liked the characters. At the end of the story two of the characters seemed to have a chance at love while one was doomed to search for it."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"I got this book after reading a previous book by Lincoln Child, \\"Utopia\\", which I liked very much. I wasn't disappointed although I have to say that \\"Utopia\\" was better. This book makes for a very easy, fast paced, page turning, read. One could argue that characters are not very developed but this somehow doesn't spoil the fun. I don't agree with some of the reviewers that reffered to this novel as sci-fiction - just having non-existing company and non-existing computer with unusual powers dowsn't qualify for sci-fiction. So you shouldn't expect here all the other qualities that come with sic-fi territory. The novel is not without shortcomings. I pretty much knew the gist of the ending long before the end. Some of the points that are related to the artificial intelligence and the computer that is part of this story are argumentative (but not utter ridiculous, as in some other works of similar genre). Still, I would recommend the book as a very good entertainment."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"Eden, Inc. can match couples so that they will live a deleriously happy life.

I was ready for a murder thriller. But by the end, it simply turned into what resembled a computer manual. I also didn't care for the narrator in tne downloaded ebook version. He sounded eerily computer-generated."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"Eden Inc. is the largest and most successful company in the matchmaking business. Using highly proprietary screening methods and exceedingly sophisticated computerized processes, they've matched more \\"perfect\\" couples than any of the competition. Eden Inc. is the brainchild of brilliant computer scientist Richard Silver, originating from parent company PharmGem before branching off as a privately held company. But something recently has gone very wrong; of the five \\"supercouples\\" matching 100% at Eden, the first of them, Lewis and Lindsey Thorpe, are found dead of what looks to be mutual suicide. How could this happen to a perfect couple?Silver and his corporate director Edwin Mauchly call upon the aid of Dr. Christopher Lash, currently a psychologist specializing and family and marital relationships. But it's Lash's past experience as a special agent in forensic psychology for the FBI's Behavioral Science program as a criminal personality profiler that really interests them. Dr. Lash left the FBI after a particularly bad run-in with serial killer Edmund Wyre, which was also the cause of his divorce from his wife Shirley.Dr. Lash has difficulty uncovering any reason for the couple's suicide, until the next 100% \\"supercouple\\" also commit mutual suicide. Now Silver knows it was no coincidence. Lash gains access to the inner workings of Eden Inc. and meets the enigmatic Richard Silver, and his self-aware computer system Liza. Teamed up with Tara Stapleton from systems security, Lash continues his search. As a research project, Lash himself goes through Eden's screening process and is rejected, yet somehow his Avatar gets placed in \\"The Tank\\" and is matched to a potential mate. According to Tara, such a mistake is impossible. Impossible or not, the more Lash and Tara uncover, the more unrealistic the suicides seem to be. But they must work fast to find the answer, because there's still three more \\"supercouples\\" left.This enticing story is interspersed with chapters from Lash's past against serial killer Edmund Wyre, adding an intriguing subplot to the novel. The characters are thoughtfully constructed and the \\"self-aware\\" computer personality made believable. Like most of Child's novels, the \\"whodunit\\" factor is usually easily guessable, but the tension at the build-up is exciting and enjoyable anyway. I've found novels by Lincoln Child to be peculiarly addictive, whether written on his own or with co-author Douglas Preston. While not perfect, they contain a substance to them that is attractive; good storylines and plot-development being a couple of factors to mention. With the popularity of the \\"computerized dating\\" businesses growing, 'Death Match' is a modern and tantalizing tale. Check out other novels by Lincoln Child also. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"The premise was great. The writing in the early part was absorbing. I was hoping against hope the ending would be different. But it became the boring, flat ending I was afraid of.As to Eden, while the premise of an all-knowing computer was intriguing, the extent to which it was pushed, & for a purpose like match-making, made it rather implausible, if not laughable. It is conceivable a computer can hack into that much data. It is rather dubious it can do that a million times without anybody detecting anything.Would have preferred if the novel had taken another direction, like, how all the information in the world still can't predict a perfect match...a little misinterpretation can ruin all the hard data..."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"Very well written and goes into much detail so you know the author has done a lot of research.

I'm also a fan of their work when they're not working together. As for Child, Utopia was neat. Deep Storm was a joy to read (and the first work I read that put me on a path to reading everything they wrote). Terminal Freeze was great, especially since I lived at a radar site in Alaska for awhile and I could easily relate. I'm really looking forward to Third Gate.However, Death Match was, well, boring. My wife and I listened to it in the car on the way to work, and we both had it figured out somewhere around 1/3 of the way in. I personally thought the characters were a little two dimensional and cliche. The action wasn't very exciting, and the final scene was more complicated than it needed to be.I'm still going to give it 3 stars because it was a fun read. Not a read I would visit again, but a fun read nonetheless."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"These are the kind of books that MOVIES should be made from!

Also, I guessed the ending before I got to far into the book."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"This is the first techno-thriller I've read. I'm a little of a tech-geek so the computer technology part appealed to me as I'd never read any books that combine geek and crime. The storyline was very unique and a little creepy because I don't doubt at all that genetic dating matching isn't too far off (if not already being done on a small scale). And I have no doubt that there are computers that are very close to doing a little too much thinking on their own. AI (artificial intelligence) is just a fascinating topic on it's own, so combine all of this into a fast moving story and you have a book that you can really sink your teeth into. The only reason I gave it four stars is because the ending was unexpected and a bit of a let-down. But not enough for me to not recommend this book, I really enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"Death Match by Lincoln Child is a very fast read, or at least it was for me. The story of trying to find a perfect romantic match is intriguing to me, and when Child starts telling us about a new match-making program called Eden Incorporated and how successful they are, the feeling of unease begins to settle in. The company is incredibly secritive and Christopher Lash, our protagonist, finds this out when he begins to investigate the double-suicide of Eden's first 100% matched couple. The Thorpe's were perfect for each other, so why are they dead? Lash is asked to figure this out to save Eden's reputation as the best match-making service in the world. More perfect couples die mysteriously and the horror of it all deepens when Lash himself enters the program to really see how it works.This book was absolutely excellent and I would expect nothing less from the co-author of the Pendergast series. The book had a surprise ending that I did not see coming as well which is always nice when reading novels. It had the feel of a Crichton novel with all of the high-tech stuff involved in the match-making program, but it didn't have Crichton's usual anti-climactic ending. Death Match is a good book for fans of fiction in general but I would call it a techno-thriller. Horror is here though in the old fashioned, building tention to unbearable levels sort of way. It is just a good book all around and one that I will definitely read again in the future."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"Lincoln Child always has a way of changing your perceptions right at the end of book. This is no exception. I read this some years ago and still think about it fondly. An absolutely terrific read!"},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"Very few thriller novels can keep you reading well into the night. This is one of them. Yes, you'll probably have figured out the identity of the killer long before the main character does, but it still doesn't prepare you for the ending. There are several surprises along the way in this story, and it keeps you turning pages. The opening scene with the crying baby will give you chills.The only downside to this story is the lack of intensity to the goal. Six supercouples are found in Eden, Inc. One by one, they are being killed. Two are dead, and the third is coming quickly, yet you never really get to know the couple at all. The third couple gets a few pages, but otherwise you feel nothing for them. You actually couldn't care less if they live or die, you just want to see how Lash and Tara find the killer. That was a lost opportunity, as I would have liked to felt some sort of high stakes in the game. Instead, it barely rates a blip on the radar. Other than that, this story is solid and enjoyable. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"Since other reviewers have outlined the plot to this novel (perhaps some of them giving away more than they should have), I only want to add a few comments. While I enjoyed &quot;Utopia&quot;, I thought it an inferior effort to the partnership efforts, but this one was one of this year's few &quot;cannot put it down&quot; novels for me so far. I did guess the ending about three quarters of the way through, but - honestly - that was probably only because Child dropped a few fair hints. The concept of the avatar constructs was quite inspired and very impressive. I agree with a previous reviewer that the title of the novel was a problem - to me, &quot;Death Match&quot; seemed to suggest a futuristic gladiatorial interaction, and I never would have looked twice at the book had Lincoln Child's name not been on the cover. Also, as a corrective to those critics who found the premise untenable, concurrently while I was reading the book I encountered a news item stating that EHarmony.com Inc. this month received U.S. Patent No. 6,735,568, which describes a \`\`method and system for identifying people who are likely to have a successful relationship.'' Child is just a little ahead of the process."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"UTOPIA, Lincoln Child's only novel that he authored alone concerned an imaginary theme park- the ultimate in technology. In effect, it is a warning of what can happen when technology goes unchecked. It is a wildly suspenseful book and also provides some key insights into the thought, creation and running of a theme park. Now, with his second solo authored novel, he explores another imaginary technology and what can happen if human intervention goes too far.Christopher Lash is a former FBI forensic psychologist with a busy private practice in New York. He is hired as a special consultant by Eden, a company that specializes in dating services. However, not just any dating service. For a $25,000 fee, the client is put through a barrage of physical, psychological and emotional testing. The data is put into a super computer and a match would be made from the thousands of other applicants. Their success rate is near perfect as most couples match upwards of 98%. However, Lash is asked to look into the double suicide of a perfect 100% match. There does not appear to be precursors that would indicate why the couple decided to commit suicide. Things heat up considerably when the second perfect match turns up dead from another double suicide. Lash must get to the bottom of this before more couples turn up dead.DEATH MATCH is another fun and exciting read. The positives of this novel include the pacing which is relentless and the plot which is imaginative. Characters, though not filled with great depth, are quite serviceable for this type of an entertainment. The major negative is the needless depth and endless description of the technology. Page after page of psychological testing parameters are covered as is the computer technology used to run the company. This information could and should have been greatly edited. However, by skimming these sections, the reader will move quickly through to the exciting climax and somewhat predictable conclusion. Fun for a day at the beach."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"I don't understand the &quot;review&quot; below this one (from the top 500 guy). Everything but the last sentence or two is just a substitute for what you might find on the back cover (or in the amazon summary above). Except perhaps the &quot;reviewer&quot; gives too much information about the book. Then he/she gives the book 3(.5) stars with absoultely no justification whatsoever. Lastly, the reviewer states that Child finds his &quot;Crichtonesque&quot; voice. Having read every novel by both authors (including the novels co-authored by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child) multiple times in most cases, I can attest to the falsehood of this statement. Lincoln Child is better than Michael Crichton in most respects. In particular when writing with Douglas Preston (although in this case he has done beautifully by himself). Crichton's writing (especially his early writing) reads like an overly ordered jumble of college term paper excerpts and relatively lifeless character interactions. Lincoln Child (working alone or with Douglas Preston) weave's the necessary background, the characters and the plot seamlessly together in a much more natural fashion.Death Match clearly demonstrates the application of a great amount of writing experience. The book unfolds masterfully with practically no rushed or contrived scenes. I think this is due in large part to the very plot of the book which itself uncontrives what would otherwise be contrived. The book seems considerably better written than both Lincoln Child's previous solo novel and Douglas Preston's solo novel (though I did enjoy both of these for the most part). It easily stands up with the best of their co-authored novels as well (and surpasses some of them in certain ways).The central theme raises some very interesting questions about human relationships as well. I imagine that most readers would find this highly relevant. Like Utopia, it focuses on some very specific technology (that is realistically just out of reach). This focus on a technology is the fundamental difference in plot style that justifies Lincoln Child's solo novels. This is where my only worry would come in when recommending Lincoln Child's books to others. Some readers may find the technology unbelievable. However, as a computer science graduate, I would suggest that the technology is believable enough if you consider what might be accomplished by applying the most cutting edge theoretical research with a huge infusion of cash from the private sector. It's clear to me that Lincoln Child did his research and then let his imagination run away just a bit. I think things turned out beautifully. However, I can understand if others feel differently. One of my biggest beefs with Utopia was that I found the holographic technology to be far too advanced for its own good.The best thing about Lincoln Child's solo projects is that they clearly haven't slowed down the work that he and Douglas Preston are doing together in the slightest. Nor has it affected the quality of that work (as the recent Still Life with Crows and sample chapters from the upcoming Brimstone prove).The worst thing about Death Match is perhaps its title and cover. The cover for the ARC was much better (hopefully they revert for the paperback). The final cover was probably a result of trying to undo the damage done by the title (which suggests a very a different kind of novel to me). That's not to say that the title isn't appropriate; it fits wonderfully in retrospect, but it may convey the wrong impression prior to reading. Everyone should know not to judge a book by its cover, but that doesn't make it any less difficult to avoid doing so when the title is Death Match."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"Sometimes the time is right to get lost in a novel, and this novel was the one for me.

I am not usually a fan of science fiction type books buth this novel is an excellent mix of suspense thiller and techno thriller. The premise is extremely intriguing and gives the book the great plot it needs to succeed.We have Eden, Inc. a highly developed matchmaking service - it uses high tech artificial intelligence to try to match people on up to 1 million separate pieces of criteria. It is expensive, very popular and succesful. People are finding their soul mates. But 2 \\"super couples\\" have committed double suicide. A \\"super couple\\" is a couple that matches on all 1 million pieces of criteria. The deaths are a problem and Eden, Inc. needs help so they call in Chris Lass, a psychologist on marital relationships who used to work for the FBI. He is given all he needs to try to figure out why these couples are killing themselves - or are they?This novel is excellent escape fiction. Many have given it 4 stars saying that the ending was predictable or not believable. What I love about this book is just that. It is not reality based. But it is so expertly, intelligently written that we get caught up in Eden, Inc. and their computerized matchmaking. We go into another world and it is exciting. The characters are superbly developed. None of them are thin or caricatures. They are all fully developed and carefully crafted just as Eden is detailed to expert precision. Some characters you will root for, some you will hate, some will surprise you.The suspense starts at the beginning and never lets up. Someone is not happy with Chris Lass looking into the working of Eden and they start causing serious problems for him. The journey Chris goes on and how expertly we are made a part of it is what carries this novel. The ending may be a little over the top but for me it followed the rest of the book and was very satisfying.I highly recommend this book for intelligent, well crafted escape fiction. The suspense is awesome and you will be on the edge of your seat."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"Having recently felt the urge to read thriller novels that would keep me awake all night, I tried a few novels by some authors I had not read before. Most of these books I did not even finish, since they bored me so much that I felt I would rather sit and watch the grass grow. I must add that they were real insomnia-busters (I'm not going to name them, though!).Then I picked up Death Match. I have actually delayed reading the book, since the cover on the paperback version that I possess really did not look very inspiring. But, boy, was I surprised! Eventually I found a thriller novel that would fulfill the premise of keeping me awake all night. I have only read one work of Lincoln Child in conjunction with Douglas Preston, which I thoroughly liked, but since this one was a solo effort, I did not know what to expect.It \`turned' out to be quite a page-turner, and although it started off a bit on the slow side, the pace was quickly stepped up and became more frantic towards the end. The plot was well-crafted and the characters engaging. I especially liked how Mr. Child developed the main character, Dr. Christopher Lash, and how he brought in some ghosts of his past life in the FBI to start haunting him again in his investigation of the suicides of the so-called \\"super couples\\" of Eden Incorporated. I also found the female character, Tara, very interesting, and seeing that she played a very prominent part later on in the book, I would have liked to see her developed a bit further.All-in-all, I want to congratulate Lincoln Child on an excellent thriller, and providing me with a story that I found very hard to put down."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"When Dr. Christopher Lash gets a call from Eden Incorporated, he is mystified. Why would they want to hire him for his services? He is a former FBI forensics psychologist, a profiler. A tragedy at work had affected him personally, and it not only caused him to retire early, but ended his marriage. He is in private practice now and working hard to exorcise the demons of his past. When Eden calls, he decides to see what they could possibly want from him.Because everyone in the country knows about Eden. They are a match-making service. But not just any service. They are a high-tech company surrounded by secrecy and have a phenomenal success rate. Founded by the reclusive computer genius, Richard Silver, Eden boosts 100% accuracy in finding couples happiness. For just $25,000/person, you too can find the perfect mate! But people are LINING UP to apply for it's services.When Christopher arrives, he finds he is meeting with the upper echelon of Eden. At Eden, they guarantee the matches they make. Using complicated computing and psychological analysis, couples are matched. If they reach a percentage, around 95%, they are considered a perfect match. And Eden's record stands: All couples that have been matched, have been happy. But in all the years that Eden has been operating, they have seen 6 100% matches. A uniquely perfect match. These are referred to as a \\"supercouple\\" match. But the reason Christopher has been called in is that one of the supercouples just committed a double suicide. Eden would like someone from the outside to check into the occurrence.Everything that Christopher sees about the Thorpes indicates they are indeed the perfect couple. There are absolutely no indicators of suicidal tendencies. Just when he is about to give up, another one of Eden's supercouples commits suicide. Now the real question is this: Is it truly a suicide or is it homicide?I enjoyed this book. It was a nice thriller with a lot of intensity. The nature of the book is truly far-fetched. Can a computer really match couples perfectly? Aren't there many factors that a computer can't take into consideration? But the book does get into some confusing explanations about Artificial Intelligence and technical jargon. For those that aren't familiar with computers and processing it might be a little too much. And the back story of Lash's time in the FBI just seemed to be thrown in rather hastily and was tied up unsatisfyingly. It's almost like Child was trying to do too many things at one time. He touches on a lot of topics: AI, dating, match-making, serial killers, psychology, suicide, computer programming, computer security. In the end, it was just too much to make a really GREAT book. I figured out the conclusion long before I turned to that page. But I was entertained. And that is truly what 'braincandy' is all about. It was enough for me to put Lincoln Child on my reading list for the future, especially his collaborations with Douglas Preston."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"i found this to be an excellent book. in a nutshell, when perfect couples who were matched by an exclusive dating service commit double suicides, the company consults with a forensic psychologist to help resolve the problem. in the meantime, he must face his own demons, although not completely spelled out how, he manages to overcome his liabilities and fears. the book was well-written, believable (for the most part), and, frankly, i had a hard time putting it down. i found 3 very minor inconsistencies and additional technical errors throughout the book and i'd imagine there are more. i wish that there would have been a little bit more character development, especially of the main four or five characters. it's a quick read and well worth the several hours and the few dollars. i highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"Even without his partner Doug Preston, Lincoln Child can spin a yarn to keep you on the edge of your seat page, after page, after page.

The writing style is smooth and the concept of making perfect matches is pretty cool. Even though halfway through the book you pretty much have it figured out, it is OK because the story was going on fine. Unfortunately, for Mr. Child the wheels fell off or in this case the system crashed in the middle. He could have really created something cool here and built up the suspense of the book, but it just seems like he thought \\"I'm tired off writing this book, I'll just wrap it up here and work on something else\\". He left plot lines that went nowhere, i.e. the sudden release from prison of the physco killer. Also, he never really develops the computer concept fully. One minute the computer is this super intelligent evil self aware entity and the next it is dumb as a door knob that wouldn't know which way is up. It is too bad the author couldn't have taken a little more time to fix the last half of the novel to be as good as the first. I'm giving it 3 stars, but it really should be about 2 and half. 3 for the beginning and 2 for the end."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"See storyline above.When I see Lincoln Child's name on the cover of a book, you can bet I'm going to read it.

Unfortunately, the last 1/3 degenerates into a bad episode of Captain Kirk on Star Trek battling a computer with illogic."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"This book started off amazingly. The ideas that Lincoln Child plays with allowed for limitless possibilities. I felt like I was walking into a detailed extended episode of the very best Twilight Zone episode. The writing style here of Child is dry, crisp, and sets up an ambiance that will allow you to step into a fully realized world. I have read all of Child and Preston's work. It is revealing when you start to compare the solo writing of the two authors. As a team they make a pretty decent series of books with agent Pendergast. By himself, Preston is bombastic, over the top, silly, and typical. Along with Child, the Pendergast series is pretty good. When Child allows for himself to be a solo author, he is in my mind, filled with more potential as an author than either a solo Preston or the duo together.What I think happens to Child as an author, is that he has yet to find a confident voice. He relies heavily on formula. The promising start to this book gets bogged down in your average hollywood thriller. All of the great ideas funnel into a silly chase story. It's still good, and I might like this book more than just about any of Child's other books. But the story is in the end forgettable. It could have been on par with Kafka or Phillip K Dick if Child had let his imagination wander.The ending, as other reviewers here have said, is very staid. I am kind of mad with Child for coping out here in such an expected manner. You can see the resolution here from a long ways off if you pay attention. I bet that Child will end up writing both with Preston and by himself, several dozen more books. I think that he could, if he wanted to, write several great genre masterpieces. This here is not one of those, but you can see the potential all over the place here."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"Yep, I, too, am a huge fan of Preston and Child. Or maybe &quot;was&quot; is a better word. Lately, they've been dwelling too much on serial killings, which I do not find entertaining at all. However, as far as this solo effort by Lincoln Child goes, it is a sham! The author should be embarrassed for writing this one. This story is old, hackneyed, uninspired and without any suspense whatsoever (the ending is easily guessable by page 50!). And yes, the ending... implausible and very, very far-fetched. But the big thing I'm beginning to notice about Child and Preston is their lack of character development lately. In their past few books, both individually and collectively, they have given us &quot;nil&quot; in this department, to the point where I couldn't care any less about the main characters since they don't give us the oportunity to get to know them! I HATE their Pendergast character for this very reason. They should drop him immediately! Honestly, do not ruin your lust for a good Preston/Child novel by reading this drivel. I suggest a good James Rollins or Matthew Reilly novel instead."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"I am a big fan of suspense thrillers.

Looking forward to@the next."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"For his solo novel sans writing partner Douglas Preston, Lincoln Child tackles computer matching services, the latest cyber-world craze. In our current multi-tasking society, people are turning more frequently to computers, with their immediacy and convenience. Stepping off from this premise, Child takes it one step further: suppose a company, dedicated to matching the most compatible couples, was so successful that they could afford to charge $25,000.00 for their services?Entrepreneur and child genius Richard Silver, the founder of Eden, Incorporated, appears to have met this daunting challenge with brilliant success. After years of refining the process and adding to the base of his super-computer, nicknamed \\"Liza\\", Silver charges this exorbitant rate simply because the end results are so remarkably successful.The process is exhaustive, but well worth the investment, as new subscribers line up for consideration, checks in hand. Eden has its standards as well, with substantial testing before accepting candidates. Inside the company, the buzz is all about the so-called Supercouples, a small percentage of almost-perfect matches that are the darlings of the system and a great source of pride for Eden, Inc. Imagine the chagrin when the very first Supercouple commits double-suicide. Eden is willing to do whatever it takes to get to the bottom of this shocking anomaly and blight on their perfect record.Enter Dr. Christopher Lash, formerly an FBI profiler, now in private practice. If Lash has a few skeletons in his closet, he doesn't believe there are any obstacles in locating the systems error that resulted in the tragedies. As an independent contractor and in an effort to replicate the Eden experience, Lash undergoes the same testing process as the other successful applicants, seeking specific flaws in the system. Then things get dicey as yet another super couple self-destructs.Meeting with Richard Silver, Lash is impressed with the man behind Eden's success, and the computer Silver painstakingly put together over the years. Lash is struck by Silver's genuine altruism, concern for the couples who are matched via the company. But Lash is shocked by the intrusiveness of Eden's testing procedures, both psychological and physical. The data retrieval alone suggests interfacing with computers that the general public could never access, a fact that raises Lash's suspicions.Lash has immediate results in his investigation, confident he has located the person behind the suicides of the Supercouples. Unfortunately, complications arise and Lash finds himself on the defensive, with dangerous implications for his personal safety. He is in a desperate race to remove the sudden suspicion cast on his motives and the revelation of his questionable past history.Childs proves himself a capable writer in this singular effort. In this cutting-edge techno-mystery, Childs finds his Crichton-esque voice, pulling out all the stops, projecting the complexities of a world run almost exclusively by technology. In Death Match, Child steps comfortably into his m&eacute;tier as a mystery novelist. Luan Gaines/2004."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"Eden Incorporated is not your run-of-the-mill matchmaking service. For the rather lofty price tag of $25,000, Richard Silver, the company's brilliant and reclusive founder and Liza, the computer and its state of the art artificial intelligence software that is more person than machine, will guarantee to find you a \\"perfect\\" lifelong soul-mate. Well ... not quite perfect, but so close mind you that the paired partners certainly aren't complaining. So nobody was more surprised than Silver and Eden's management when Liza, despite overwhelming odds against such a match, found six absolutely perfect pairings.But when Lewis and Lindsay Thorpe, the first of Eden's starry-eyed perfect couples, are found dead as the result of an apparent double suicide, Eden's corporate alarms sound wildly and Christopher Lash, a former FBI forensic psychologist is hired to quietly investigate the death from the inside. Lash, struggling with demons from his own past and memories that the investigation has brought to the surface, finds himself faced with a situation spiraling completely out of control when another perfect couple is also found dead - a bizarre second double suicide!\\"Death Match\\" is first-rate brain candy when it's compared to other plot driven thrillers that seem much more screenplay than novel - James Patterson's and Iris Johansen's recent factory driven voluminous output comes to mind. But by comparison to the rather high standards that have been self-imposed by his own previous work - the Pendergast canon in conjunction with his partner, Douglas Preston, and his first solo effort,Utopia- \\"Death Match\\" falls well short of that mark.There were so many opportunities for those technical addenda, side-bars and essays that I think of as part and parcel of Child's and Preston's writing - forensics, artificial intelligence, the computer dating and match-making industries, the psychology of suicide, computer security and corporate espionage, for example. But, sadly, all of them (not to mention character development in the bargain) were virtually ignored and the only motive for turning the pages was a plot. Creative and well-crafted, to be sure, but rather naked and lonely!Well, I enjoyed it and I'll certainly look for more of his work. It just wasn't quite as cerebral a thriller as I had hoped for. Recommended for those looking for a fast-paced lightweight summer read. Three stars and a thumb-and-a-half!Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"This story really gives you something to think about if you have ever considered searching for a mate through a computerized service. Fast-paced and totally intriguing, the web that Childs weaves makes for a real page-turner! I found it a very suspensful story up until nearly the last when I had figured out the \\"whodunit\\" part of the story, but still I have to say that it was a fastinating web of mystery all the way to the end. Very well thought out and, as are all of his novels, a real winner. Anyone who enjoys a good mystery would enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"I thought I had heard most of the possible things that could go wrong as concerns computer useage, privacy, ethics and bioethics. This book by Child brought to the fore a new and disturbing idea. Many people are using the Internet and computers as a way to make their lives better. In this case, singles use a company to find the person who is most likely to be a compatible companion for their lifetime. I know it is a frustrating world for young people to date in, and many don't want to waste time going to places like bars or even churches trying to find someone they can spend a lifetime with. So they turn to modern technology to provide the answer, just as many people are turning to technology to be able to have children. Unfortunately, even though many places are issuing privacy notices to people to assure them that the companies will keep very vital information secret, there are often ways to get around those promises of privacy.Child's imagination is a little scarier then most people's, from books of his I've read before. In this case, perfect couples are finding one another...but someone or something is killing them and leaving very little information as 'clues' as to whom it might be. Using the concept of artifical intelligence to spin possibilities, Child introduces the reader into a new world, where we may be creating our own problems. Not only are computers not 'hack-proof' so others with motives that are not nice can invade our homes and our places of business, but we also have to deal with the possible repurcussions of computers attaining a level of awareness, without having the conscience to go with it.Many people may say that something like this scenario of someone using computer information against the very people it is trying to serve as being far-fetched. I'd like to remind people that when Jules Verne wrote his sci-fi masterpieces, people also read his books and said those machines in his imaginations would never happen, but many of them are not only possible, but are in use now. Books like Child's make me a little uneasy, for fear it will give people 'ideas' that they normally would not have come up with by themselves. I guess we should count ourselves lucky that Child only writes these plots (rather than put them into action!) :-)Karen SAdler"},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"Lincoln Child has written a fun sci-fi suspense thriller in \\"Death Match.\\" The basic plot line is simple. People are lonely and lonely people will pay a lot to find their \\"perfect match.\\" Thus t is that a reclusive computer genius has launched Eden, an incredibly sophisticated matchmaking service.All is not well in paradise, however, as Christopher Lash, \\"a gifted former FBI forensic psychologist\\" soon learns. Summoned to Eden, he is told that Lewis and Lindsay Thorpe have committed suicide. What makes the Thorpes so special to Eden is that they are one of six couples Eden believes is perfectly matched, so happy they could not have committed suicide. Lash receives a handsome retainer to set aside his private practice and find out why the Thorpes did themslves in.You guessed it, of course: Lash after pursuing all the threads suspects that it is murder, not suicicde. His theory gains strentgth when a second perfect couple apparently commits suicide.The story is just plain fun. Suspects abound. The Eden vice-president who seems aloof and openly opposed to Lash. The beautiful, but reserved and cold Eden security operative. The super-genius who has devoted his life to building the super-computer that makes Eden possible. The plot is equally fun. Yes, you do have to swallow once in a while as you learn that Eden keeps track of all its applicants, successful or rejected, with an access to information that should land everyone connected to it in prison.If someone of lesser talent were doing it, all the loose ends would probably sink the story. But Child pulls it off, delivering a sci-fi thriller that is just plain fun.Jerry"},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"I bought this novel after I finished reading \\"Utopia\\"--which I consider the best thriller ever written. The characters in \\"Death Match\\" were likable, but the plot was more typical (and overused) than Utopia. Again, modern technological marvels come to take over the world. I was disappointed after my earlier read. As a stand alone novel, if you like the anti-technology type, it does earn its four star rating. The writing is top notch, the characters great and it is truly a page turner. But Mr. Child--please--give us a story line that has not been done before! I know you can do it!!"},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"I've read all the novels by Lincoln Child, including those co-written with Douglas Preston, and I would say this is typical of that remarkable team's individual efforts -- a strong premise flawed by a weak ending.The story involves Christopher Lash, a troubled ex-FBI psychologist who is hired as a consultant by Eden Inc., a matchmaking service that has flawlessly brought couples together using a supercomputer system named Liza. When Eden \\"supercouples\\" start committing suicide, Lash tries to figure out what went wrong, The characters are good, the dialogue is fine, and there are some spectacular touches such as The Tank, where computer avatars of Eden's applicants search for their matches.HOWEVER, there are some problems -- mostly small but one big. First, one victim gives a major clue to Lash, but it is never brought up again. Secondly, Lash receives harassing phone calls, makes an assumption about who is calling him, and confronts that person -- why doesn't he just do *69? Lash is increasingly harassed but just ignores it. etcThe book is 356 pages long and I figured out the mystery on page 170. The ending is derivative and unoriginal. I won't say more, but I kept reading, hoping that there would a twist. There wasn't.In the acknowledgments the author thanks Douglas Preston for supplying a crucial chapter. Too bad he didn't supply a more interesting ending as well."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"I picked up this book looking for some light reading over the holidays. And I guess, based on that criteria alone, the book fulfilled its purpose. The overwhelming problem I had, however, is the fact that it is completely predictable. If you make it more than a third of the way through without having figured out the end, then you have probably never watched a movie, seen a television show, or read another book. I don't mean that as an exaggeration. It is just that obvious. Once I reached that point in the book I absolutely knew how the story would end--and not just a good guess about how it would end, but knew that there was no other way it could be concluded.I continued reading, however, partly because Child is a pretty good writer--the characters are interesting and the world very well thought out--but mostly because I had high hopes the author would surprise me with something unexpected. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. In fact, the predictability became something of a plot hole for me. I kept wondering how the supposedly brilliant lead character could miss something that seemed so completely obvious.However, having said all that, if you go into it with the realization that you will see the ending coming well before you get there, the book is reasonably entertaining, fast paced, and makes for a nice little diversion."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"The book was entertaining, a good mystery. However, it was completely predicable. After I figured out what was going to happen it was difficult to enjoy because there was nothing left to learn."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"Lincoln Child's \\"Death Match\\" is a fast-moving, thrilling read about matchmaking gone awry. The reader is quickly introduced to the Eden Corporation, a company that guarantees (for the eye-popping sum of $25,000) to help singles find the love of their lives. Eden is so successful, by the way, that they have never had to refund anyone's fee. There's trouble in paradise, however, when two of the corporation's \\"supercouples\\" (couples that are *perfectly* matched with one another on all criterion) are suddenly found dead in possible murder/suicide situations.Eden's founder and CEO, Richard Silver (a reclusive \\"Howard Hughes type\\") hires psychologist and former FBI agent, Christopher Lash, to investigate the tragedies so that the company's name and reputation are not damaged. What Lash finds during his investigation is more than he bargains for. Child takes the reader on a whirlwind trip through the final 300 pages of the novel with many plot twists and turns along the way. While, the ending is not unexpected (at least by this reader) it is not totally unsatisfying, either. In this reviewer's humble opinion, the ending is the only reason that keeps this book from being a 5 star book.If you're a fan of Preston and Child's many novels or any of those by Michael Crichton, then you will find a lot to like about \\"Death Match\\"."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"I truly enjoyed 'Utopia' quite a bit, and was thrilled when I saw Lincoln Child coming out with solo effort #2. If 'Utopia' was any indication, I was expecting something really thrilling... and as I started 'Death Match' I just KNEW I had found exactly what I was looking for to fill my reading void. I must admit Mr. Child has quite a talent for sustained energy, but after a long spell of VERY interesting storytelling, 'Death Match' began to slow down. This did not bother me in the least -- at FIRST. Almost EVERY novel has a slow portion or two. However when things began to shift downward, the pace almost slowed to a crawl compared to the wonderful beginning.'Death Match' has an absolutely brilliant opening chapter, one that literally grabbed me quite rapidly. It only began to build from there to the point that I (for a while anyway) thought Mr. Child had just about written the perfect Beach Read. Now I don't wish to come down on 'Death Match' too harshly, because I still enjoyed it quite a bit. But had I known better about how the pacing dropped off after a couple-hundred pages or so, I would most certainly have enjoyed it more.With that said, the story behind a computer-based Love-Connection business revolves around a company that is so certain of their ability to bring the perfect couples together they quite literally offer a money-back guarantee. Up front however is a rather stiff fee in order to join 'Eden', the amazing company dedicated to customer service and life-long loving relationships. Among the thousands of applicants floating around the almost living computer, every once-in-a-while a Supercouple is found, with virtually a 100% compatibility ratio. Only a small number of Supercouples have been produced in the time Eden has been operating, and these couples are something special to the incredibly dedicated employees. However, suddenly one of the couples are found dead in an apparent murder/suicide that literally defies ALL logic. Enter Christopher Lash, former FBI profiler who is brought in to determine how this seemingly perfect couple could meet such a tragic end. As Lash begins his investigation, he discovers from every single person he interviews that this couple was quite literally PERFECT for each other in every conceivable way.While making the rounds to uncover the truth, word reaches Lash of another Supercouple found under very similar circumstances. Things begin to spiral out of control rather quickly at this point. Lash begins to suspect murder, but cannot find ANY evidence to support this theory, because once again, this 2nd couple was as perfect for one another as anyone had ever seen, and ALL evidence again points toward murder/suicide.Many reviewers have pointed that Mr. Child has telegraphed the so-called surprise ending a little too much throughout the story, and while it did NOT come as any kind of a shock to me, and also despite the wheels of action slowing to a snails pace, I still found myself engrossed in this tale. Both Lincoln Child and Douglas Preston are amazingly talented authors, but I also believe as many others do, they are much like John Lennon and Paul McCartney -- really good separately, but they are MUCH better when they work together.For those who cannot wait until 'Brimstone' hits the shelves, get a quick fix by reading 'Death Match' and check out Douglas Preston's 'Codex', another fun summer Beach Read."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"I am a big fan of Preston and Child, both their books written collaboratively and solo. I am currently working my way through every single one, have finished about half, and though I enjoy Child's solo books, as others state here, their collaborative works are just better, for some reason. I liked Utopia and Deep Storm, but this one was predictable - good and readable, but not very different from what you'd expect. Also as others have said, it was too tech geeky - there needs to be a more human element to the story, and this is where (I think) Preston contributes in their joint books. Anyway, thanks for the fun read, Mr. Child."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"I've read several books by Lincoln Child (with and without Douglas Preston), but this was my first disappointment. It isn't that the story doesn't move well, it does. The protagonist wasn't dumb, but he was a bit too.....slow. I don't want to spoil the story for someone else, but I realized what was going on way before Chapter 57, when the main character finally finds out.The idea that someone's life can be so transparent (and manipulated) by digital media is frighteningly real. It's a good story, I just like the protagonist to figure out what's going on before--or at least at the same time--as I do."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"I listened to the audiobook version, well read by Barrett Whitener.Mr. Child's ability to generate unputdownable pageturners is beyond any reasonable dispute, whether he's writing by himself or with Douglas Preston. I stayed up way too late listening to events unfold and trying to solve the mystery. The plot is absorbing and suspenseful. I am grateful that Mr. Child knows that the past tense of \\"spring\\" is \\"sprang\\"!I do have a few quibbles, though, which I offer mainly for Mr. Child if he happens to read readers' comments on Amazon.com.*** SPOILERS FOLLOW ****** STOP READING HERE UNLESS YOU WANT ADVANCE INSIGHTS INTO THE PLOT ***1. Why would Lash seemingly forget about Karen Wilner's last words and go off in an inconsistent direction?2. How could Lash, an intelligent man, fail to connect his personal logistical problems with events at Eden?3. I was able to figure out Liza's role and motivations midway through the novel. It's a tribute to its suspenseful qualities that I had no problem listening to the rest of it.4. How could all of those analytical and naturally skeptical people be so easily conned by the framing of Lash? They would only have had to send detectives to one Flagstaff motel to find out that Lash had been set up.5. It doesn't work for Edwin Mauchly to be ordering Lash to be killed. That's simply murder, and few people on earth are willing to murder for a corporation. This has always been my problem with James Bond movies, too, much as I like them: underlings are willing to kill and even be killed simply to carry out someone else's grand design, presumably for mere compensation.6. Also, once Mauchly does this, he's guilty of attempted murder and conspiracy to murder and one loses all ability to relate to him in any positive sense. He should have been prosecuted and imprisoned. Same for the subalterns firing shots at Lash.7. A big corporation like Eden would know it cannot falsely imprison its employees or administer truth serum to them. It might be able to question them, but if they refused, it could only fire them.8. The initial $100,000 consulting fee Eden offered Lash seemed rather paltry and I thought it odd that he was thrilled by it. The final compensation Eden offered Lash, another $100,000, seemed laughably low given what the corporation had subjected him to. This is New York, not Bhopal! Realistically, Eden would have arranged to pay Lash millions for negligence, perhaps through its insurers, and millions more out of its own funds for intentional misconduct.9. When things are burning, where are the sprinklers and fire extinguishers? I doubt anyone can avoid the requirements of the New York City building code, which is said to be stringent.Despite these quibbles, my hat is off to Child. I am in the embarrassing position of offering a critique, knowing full well that I could never write a novel of this quality."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"For a summary of the book, see the editorial reviews above. Having read all the Preston/Child books and a few by each author's solo efforts, I can honestly say it's hard to tell the difference between the two. Child appears to grasp the technical intricacies of many subjects, while Preston has a handle on archeology and history. Then I'll read another book by either one and my opinion shifts again. It's almost as if they are the same person.In this book, Child pulls out all the stops to make geek-speak (computer lingo) extremely easy to grasp, though some of his literary allusions can fall flat. The one thing they both have in common are white-knuckle reads set to improbable scenarios with intelligent characters and involving plot lines.This book is no exception. I was up quite late on many a night and had to force myself to put it down so I could get to bed at a reasonable hour. My only complaint is this: the type size in the paperback edition is tiny! I have 20/20 vision, both near and far, and found myself squinting or losing my place on the page. The publisher, in the next print run, needs to seriously consider bumping up the font size a point or changing to a more readable font altogether. I think it's garamond which is notoriously hard to read at small sizes. Whatever the case, it was very frustrating and I almost considered going to the local drugstore and getting granny glasses for reading!So if that is not a big deal, or you have a Kindle, I implore you to read this great thrill ride of a book! It's timely, smart, funny, and will remind you of a few dating services currently in existence. That's when you'll get a chill."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"I love all of Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child's books. This story is based on the use of a computer to determine the perfect mating of man and woman. But the computer is diabolical and kills some of its best matches and makes it look like suicide. It requires an eminent psychiatrist to go up against this \\"dating\\" computer. Some interesting concepts about how computers can conceivable control our lives. Fun Read!"},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"I'm a big fan of Lincoln Child (and Douglas Preston), and I rank Death Match among Child's better work. I think the only thing that really brought this book down from five stars to four was that Child's premise left the book rather predictable in terms of \\"who dunnit\\", and the \\"how\\" was not quite up to the standards of some of his other work (particularly with Preston).However, the book was a very enjoyable read. Anyone who enjoys the type of books written by Child and Preston should definitely check this one out."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"I guess I shouldn't beat a dead horse here by saying how predictable the end was, but it was. That being said, I've always enjoyed Linc's writing and this book didn't ruin that.My biggest gripe was that the font was a little too tiny for my tastes, and that's not Linc's problem but the publishers. Despite everything, the story was a good ride, I could hardly put it down, and the ending satisfied me.

On the plus side, the story is very well written, and I came away from the book wishing I could read more about these characters. The last \\"twist\\" in particular was more than obvious - I think those last three pages or so should have been omitted. If I were to read it again, I would have just skipped them!

Imagine going back after you are finished and rereading sections just for pure pleasure. I am a great fan of Preston & Child. I like their individual books too. I liked \\"Utopia\\". But this one is in another league all together. I think that anyone who tells you more about the plot than the book jacket does is doing you a great wrong. Among other things this is a good \\"who done it?\\" Child manages to prolong the uncertainty for a very long time - almost right to the end. But it is a lot more than a mystery. It's a love story, in fact several love stories. It's also a philosophical treatise - what, really is a man or woman? What is love? What does it mean when we say two people were \\"made for each other\\"? Child also poses the reader a puzzle in his acknowledgement section at the beginning: he states that Douglas Preston wrote one of the chapters. My guess is its the epilogue.

I have all books, even the obscure ones, but this latest I put at the end of the shelf. If you are a 'puter techie and know all the jargon you will LOVE this book. Being only elementary level on that knowledge I had to skip over the &quot;tech talk&quot; and stick to the character plot. It was good - it was excellent in Child's own imaginary way --- but not up to his usual.

The thriller was endless and although nearering the end I had the story figured out, the chase was marvelous and it is a joy to read.Lincoln Child's use of language and description was simple yet imagative and the mystery keeps evolving into new and different heights. It is one of the best books I've read in 2007."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"I listened to this book as a download from audible.com.I have always had this little nest of paranoia like a clutch of spider eggs waiting to hatch. It's concerns what I don't know about what I don't know. This book incubated that paranoia. If half of what is in this book can be done in reality, we should all run for the hills...we're being watched by the spiders. If that much information can be gathered on any one of us in a blink of an eye, I'm all for turning in our keyboards and going back to division the long way.From a privacy standpoint, this novel is truly frightening.However, I liked this book, especially the first half. It was charming and amazing, and truly mysterious as to how the murders were accomplished. I hadn't a clue. It touched on that romantic dream inside each of us that concerns falling madly in love with someone who's madly in love with us and who just happens to be perfect for us. It happened in my 40's for me, but even if it hadn't, I doubt I would sign up with \\"Eden\\" or Match.com or any of those places. This book taps into the idea that we can be matched to our perfect mate by technology. But it's presented in such a benign and charming way, one doesn't realize the slight malevolence behind it all...the loss of our most private beings.I have to say, I figured out the whodunnit part of this right after the first half of the book, and the flashing back to the killing of the policemen seemed to break the stride of the story at times, but all in all it was a good read. It's slow in places and sometimes a bit predictable, but there are many more moments when you wish that everything turns out okay because the characters deserve some happiness.Anyway, this is not for thrill a minute readers or people who are put off by computer science...but it is a thinking person's book. And like I wrote earlier, it will scare the bejeezus out of you about privacy. Interestingly, yesterday or the day before, CNN did a piece on exactly how much can be found about a person through technology. They chose random people in Maricopa County, AZ and then typed a few keystrokes. They confronted the people with the info they had found. One rancher had never owned a computer in his life and had never used a computer, but yet...there was his history right before him on paper.I have to say, that heightened my tension when finishing this book.This book is like a romantic fairy tale written by Bill Gates when he's in a real bad mood."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"Death Match is a first-rate sci-fi thriller. There is no reason why it should not be made into a movie. In many ways it reminds me of Click Here for Murder because both weave an intricate web involving a \\"sentient\\", or self-aware, Artificial Intelligence and murders. However, CHFM tells the story from the sentient AI's point of view and has many long monologs that serve as philosophical discussions, while in DM, the supercomputer is a mystery that works in the background and only emerges into full view towards the end of the book. Not bogged down by philosophical details, DM is fast-paced and gripping throughout. It also introduces many psychological theories and programming technicalities, both of which I only half understand, although both make the straight thriller all the more fascinating. For me there are three main suspects in this story. Although I guessed the \\"murderer\\" when they first appears (by reading between the lines of a sentence that is suggestive of motives), I was not at all sure and kept vacillating among all three suspects. As I read on, I saw the ending coming but still appreciated it that things generally fall into place at the end.The scenario of technology controlling, monitoring and destroying people's lives and even altering behaviors by adjusting external factors is mind-boggling, yet so real it's chilling. With the ever growing connectivity and increasing loss of privacy, it is entirely possible that in the decades to follow, we will ALL be living in a fish bowl, ALL THE TIME. When everything is digitized, transmitted and shared among networks (governments, for-profit corporations, even junk-mail vendors), it will be as easy as a keystroke to change everything about you, your life history, your health, employment and financial records, your psychological profile, and many more, when the *right* people (not meaning \\"morally\\" or \\"ethically\\" *right*, but those with power and access) decide to do it.The philosophical discussion about AI becoming \\"self-aware\\" and beginning to adopt a personality and experience emotions can be endless. It is beautiful, yet dangerous, to have emotions, because besides joy and love, there are also jealousy and hate. When a supercomputer begins to experience the budding emotions of a child, its enormous power, unmatched by thousands or millions of geniuses, is also a gigantic liability to those around it. Can you imagine dealing with a willful child so powerful intellectually that s/he is well beyond your control?"},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"I am truly sorry to give this book only two stars. Like so many have stated, it started out promisingly only to dissolve into a hash of melodrama in the end. Without tipping the plot with spoilers that adorn other reviews, I guess there were so many ways the story could have gone and been so-o-o-o-o much more interesting.This is not to grind Mr. Child (the author). He and his associate, Mr. Preston are good writers and seemingly so much more approachable than others of their genre. I had read their work, \\"Ice Limit\\" and, after becoming enthralled in the somewhat amgiguous ending, I stumbled on a web site where they set up a sort of epilogue for the novel and some manner of chat room for their readers. Despite the heavy traffic, both authors were cordial enough to *personally* respond several times to comments and questions I made.Another thing I can't fault Mr. Child on is his lack of research. While maybe not 100% accurate in the area of computers -- I am a career software developer and noted a couple of clinkers -- he certainly made an effort to understand that discipline and try to get it right. I can only guess at a similar effort behind his representation of forensic psychology.I don't mind recommending the book; it's fun to read but dissapointing because of a rather pedestrian ending."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"I was very entertained throughout the novel, however I do agree with the others about the predictable ending. Still very good and worth your time."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"In his recent novel \\"Utopia\\" Author Lincoln Child envisioned a theme park that used state of the art computer technology to entertain the masses. Computer technology that was so sophisticated, it could and did kill under the noses of the operators. The same idea is behind the latest book, \\"Death Match.\\"In this case, the sophisticated computer technology is at work in \\"Eden, Incorporated.\\" For a $25,000 application fee Eden, Incorporated will provide the ultimate in match making services. An incredibly secretive company led by the reclusive Richard Silver, nobody outside the company knows how it works, but it does as literally tens of thousands of people can attest from all walks of life and all races. In some cases, six to be exact, the system has found the ultimate perfect match where couples were 100 compatible in every single testing point.Those 100 perfect matches are known at Eden as the \\"super couples.\\" One such super couple was Lewis and Lindsey Thorne. They were the first perfect match and like all the Eden clients followed extensively after the match to make sure everything was fine. By all appearances and testing criteria everything was fine. That is until both were found dead in what appeared to be a double suicide leaving their infant baby daughter alone in the world. Dr. Christopher Lash, once a forensic psychologist with the FBI with an impressive track record, both positive and negative, is brought in to provide a quick impartial investigation to determine what went wrong and if Eden's extensive profiling and tracking systems failed.His access is limited at first and Dr. Lash is unable to find anything. His frustration is compounded by his slow realization that this case is so similar to the events of three years ago that ultimately destroyed his family, his FBI career and nearly took his life. Unable to explain why the first couple died, he pushes for and is finally granted full access on the news that a second super couple has died, also victims of what appeared to be a double suicide.As Lash delves deep into the hidden world of Eden, Inc., he discovers that everything is not nearly as perfect as they would have the public believe. While the technology is advanced, it is built on the mind of man and every person has flaws hidden deep below the surface. On the hunt for a killer, he is slow to realize that his past can be exploited by a killer who believes Lash is a target that must be stopped before the secrets are uncovered. Anything, no matter what, when cornered will fight back which is something Dr. Lash never considered to his own peril.Much like \\"Utopia,\\" this novel is primarily an action adventure read with a constant viewpoint that technology is limited by the vision of the humans that create it. The characters are somewhat stereotypical and remind the reader heavily of those who populated \\"Utopia.\\" Again, there is the reclusive genius, the hard edged security chief who means well and has absolute loyalty to the reclusive genius, and the deeply troubled outside expert brought into research the problem. Then there is the clear and very obvious nod to a certain episode of the original Star Trek, intentional or otherwise, which to divulge more would ruin the book.At the same time, despite its limitations, this is another fast and fun read through the 356 pages. While the secondary storyline is weak and should have been given a little more depth and instead is barely noticed through much of the novel, the overall read keeps the reader heavily engrossed in the twisting chase. As such, like \\"Utopia\\" this novel is still worth the read and seems perfectly suited to be synthesized down into a movie."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"As another reviewer pointed out, this book started out fast and then sort of faded out. For the first half of the book, I couldn't wait to keep reading to find out what would happen next. But during the second half, it began to drag, and I just wanted to finish it so I could move on to another book. I have to admit that I was surprised to discover who was responsible for the murders, though. I thought it was a little far-fetched, but I must admit that I didn't see it coming.All in all, this book isn't bad. This is what I would consider a &quot;beach read&quot; or summer book. Nothing too thought-provoking or deep, just an entertaining (for the most part) book. Not that there's anything wrong with that! Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"Would you pay $25,000 and undergo a battery of rigorous physical and psychological tests to meet the man or woman of your dreams? In Lincoln Child's new thriller, &quot;Death Match,&quot; the eager clients of a company called Eden Incorporated are happy to do so. Unfortunately, a series of unexplained suicides among some of Eden's most well-matched pairs, known as &quot;supercouples,&quot; has begun to worry the company's executives. They bring in Christopher Lash, a forensic psychologist who once worked with the FBI, to find out why and how these men and women died. Were these deaths just bizarre coincidences or is something more sinister going on?&quot;Death Match&quot; is an intriguing thriller that touches on some contemporary themes, such as computer matchmaking, the lack of privacy in the age of the Internet, and the synergy between our government and large corporations. As Lash studies the deaths of these &quot;perfect&quot; couples, he learns that they were indeed happy in every way, with no psychological disorders that would predispose them to suicide. As Lash digs deeper, he makes some horrifying discoveries, and in the process, he places both his reputation and his life in danger.Child's writing is fast-paced and lively, and the author includes fascinating details about psychological testing and artificial intelligence. He also explores the difficulty that modern men and women have in finding an appropriate mate, and why they turn to computer dating services to solve their problems. Can a sophisticated computer come up with a foolproof way to bring the right people together, or is the attraction between individuals too indefinable to be captured by computer software?There are aspects of this novel that are far-fetched, and many readers will guess where the book is heading way before the denouement. However, the plot still plays out with sufficient suspense and flair to make &quot;Death Match&quot; a timely and engrossing thriller."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"I recommend this book. I want to be annoyed about the book because it is a rip-off of another plot / premise and follows a stereo-typical forensic psychologist who has mental and human demons and an ex-wife - definitely a tired character - but I can not. This book was too entertaining. I enjoyed the read.A double suicide involving a dating service's clients causes a company (Eden, Inc.) to become concerned and they hire Christopher Lash, a former FBI forensic psychologist. His private investigation of these deaths (and others) is the substance of the book. To describe more would steal some of the suspense.It is a small thing, but in the \\"how I would improve the book\\" category, I would reduce the author's usage of the uncommon word \\"unrelieved.\\" It was distracting. Author Child describes a hall as \\"unrelievedly white\\" on page 67. When it popped up again on page 222 to describe a building as \\"unrelievedly modern,\\" I turned down the page corner. Then again on page 298 \\"unrelieved dark\\" and merely two pages later \\"unrelievedly white\\". Enough, turn the page on your word calendar!"},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"I read this about a month ago, and have just now reviewed it.This was a very fun read mixing corporate and techno thriller in to a coctail that, at first is very very good and energizing, but has a bit of a bitter after-taste, that doesn't quite ruin the experience, but leaves you a bit dissappointed.Christopher Lash is a psychologist employed by the FBI to track serial killers before he quits. Now he gets a new job, helping Eden, a very high-tech matchmaking company that matches it's couples in every imaginable way. Eden's problem is that one of their couples, a supercouple at that (which means they are a 100% perfect match), has been found dead in what appears to be a double suicide.It seems that there is no answer has any connections to Eden, but they want him to investigate further to make absolutely sure, before the media is all over it.The twist at the end is just the extra juice to hurl you over that after-taste in a nice refreshing way.The problems with the book is that some points are predictable, not VERY predictable, but it comes as no great shock. The plot moves along at a bit of a choppy speed, switching between amazing speed making the pages almost burn as you turn them so fast, and then it moves very slowely.Not really a problem, but I find it a bit odd that Lincoln Child left out something as regular as homosexuality in the matchmaking Eden has, it's always male/female, whcih is just a bit odd and sometimes you notice other missing things in the matchmaking process."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"I am a huge fan of the Preston/Child coauthored books. Individually, I have never found their books to be quite as great. I believe this is a great writing duo because they apparently fill in each others' weak spots brilliantly. But Death Match, to me, is the best of their solo efforts. I will not sumarize the story as it's been done numerous times previously. Unlike Utopia, which had a brilliant premise that I felt was not developed as fully as it could have been, Death Match does fully explore the premise of this book. The premise however, is not nearly as exciting as that in Utopia (Child's former solo effort). The characters in Death Match were better written and unlike other reviewers I found the tech talk believable and not overly complicated (and I am no techie). This book moves at a furious pace although the stops into Lash's past seem unneccessary since it never does develop into anything. The ending is predictable and gives you a sense of deja vu to many other books and movies where humans build a too powerful computer. But, overall I enjoyed the book for what it is a fast thrill ride into the near future that is not beyond believabiility. I recommend this book to anyone with a few hours to kill. I am anxiously awaiting the new Preston/ Child colaboration Brimstone."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"He has to be one of the most creative writers around. He keeps me wanting more and more .

Quick read that sustained my interest throughout the entire book. Definitely a five-star read."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"This is going to be quick because I listened to this book a while ago and can't remember a lot of the details! I do remember that I enjoyed it. I found the concept more interesting than I expected. Basically, couples who are deemed \\"perfect matches\\" by the high-tech matchmaking company, Eden, are committing mutual suicide at an alarming rate. Lash, a psychiatrist, is brought in to find out why people who have no known suicidal tendencies would do it. Eden is panicking, desperate to show that their process is not flawed, and therefore, not responsible.The plot probably could have moved along a little more quickly, but overall I thought it was a good listen. There was one big problem with the audio production - there are parts of the book where Lash is reading various psychological reports and test results, and in the audio they read out every bit, even the multi-digit id numbers and various other numerical data. It grew tedious, and I think they should have altered that a bit for the audiobook.If you are looking for a thriller that isn't mired in the military, in espionage, or in the financial district, I think this would be a good choice."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"Great jobIt keeps you wondering.

Unfortunately, Lincoln Child really disappointed me. Only after wading through the first two-thirds of the novel did the action start to pick up and climaxed in a good surprise ending about the crazy computer and the mad scientist who created it. If you like techno-thrillers, it's passable, but in the case of this author, two writers collaborating are far better than this solo effort."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"Lincoln Child does it again. I'm one of his biggest fans (I'm 6'4'' and 285) and \\"Death Match\\" was a big hit in my book. I don't know what it is about Lincoln that makes him one of my favorite authors, but he won me over again with this masterpiece. He drags you into the book with the charactors and makes you want to scream \\"No, don't do that or No, it not him\\". He gives you so much information, that you think you're watching a movie. This isn't a good book, it's a great book."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"I loved Lincoln Child's other e-books from Amazon but \\"Death Match\\" was a bit tedious. The hero Dr.Christopher Lash was an animated mannequin.

One of my favorites is of a woman with beautiful butterfly wings covering her entire back.I also enjoyed several tattoos that were styled after Chinese sumi-e painting. The beautiful designs include many birds &amp; a large fish with a woman.

Another great thing about this book is the internet links at the end of each part that takes the learning even further by giving more related information on the topics discussed as well as suggestions on what to do once you get to the website.***A WORD OF CAUTION***In Part 3 \\"Where do babies come from\\" there is detailed information and cartoons about how babies are made. It talks about how a man and a woman have sex and how the sperm gets to the egg.

Poe and his writing speak for themselves.As far as the content of this book, the title speaks for itself also. The stories are separated into three different sections titled \\"Tales of Mystery and Horror\\" (containing some of his more famous works such as \\"The Tell-Tale Heart,\\" \\"The Cask of Amontillado,\\" and \\"The Masque of the Red Death\\"), \\"Humor and Satire\\" (which include \\"The Man that Was Used Up\\" and \\"The Sphinx\\"), and \\"Flights and Fantasies\\" (\\"Eleonora\\" and \\"The Oval Portrait\\" are contained here). The first of the last two sections of the book contains his novel \\"The Narrative of A.

Although there were wears and tears on the dust cover (which isn't important to me), the book binding retained its shape regardless of the age of the book. In fact, it only looks a couple of months old on the outside.

This book takes us back to the time of giant monsters, supernatural monsters, and dead people who come back to life seeking revenge against the people who murdered them. We can hear the monster's heart beat through Edgar Allan Poe's poetic form. The stories keep us in suspense until the bitter end. My favorite in the collection remains \\"The Fall of the House of Usher,\\" about a family and how they get ripped apart. The family tree grows without branches; Roderick and Madeleine live as direct descendents of the original Usher, which the narrator says constitutes a flaw in the strength of the family. A large crack runs through the house, itself, a symbol of the family breaking apart. Roderick suffers from hyper-sensitivity to light, sound, and touch, keeping himself enclosed in a dark padded room. Madeleine Usher suffers from catatonia, which leaves her often appearing dead. Roderick constantly worries about putting her in the family tomb while she still lives. The old house makes Roderick even more afraid to the point that he shakes uncontrollably.

I have this, as well as a few other colections that I had purchased prier, but this one has it all. Everything from his beautifully eerie poems (my personal favorite is Annibell Lee which is my favorite poem ever written) down to his classic short storys like 'The Black Cat' and 'Tell-Tale Heart' which was the first story I ever read by Poe back when I was in Fifth grade...I had to read it for English and write an essay and I was so hooked after the first sentence that I swore to read any and everything this man ever wrote. Poe was a genious, although it's apparent he had many problems...His work still remains masterpiece and I feel will never be trumped...ever."},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"As a high school student, I have learned about many great authors and poets:Ralph Waldo Emerson, Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, and Benjamin Franklin, to name a few. However, without a doubt and hands down, Edgar Allan Poe is by far thegreatest author. Poe has an amazing ability to catch his reader's attention, fulfill them during the story, and disappoint them at the ending. This disappointment is not because the story was unsatisfactory and dull, but because the reader craves more of Poe's phenomenal and entertaining writing. The first time I read Poe (The Tell-Tale Heart), I was fascinated with his ability to make me feel that I was caught up with Poe's insanity. His story was absolutely terrifying, yet there were no demons, devils, beasts, basilisks, or monsters involved. I was confused of where the disturbing terror was coming from. After reading many of his short stories and poems, I realized that the fear could not even be found in the story at all. It is found in the reader's soul, beliefs, and heart. This horror is not exposed every time you open a book by Poe. It is with you constantly, every day and second, as long as your heart is still beating...and perhaps even after."},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"Edgar Allan Poe is arguably one of the greatest writers of fiction. His brilliant collection of short stories, including The Pit and the Pendulum, can be found inside this massive edition of his many works. No collection would be complete without the well-known poem, The Raven, which basically deals with the character's inability to deal with the death of Lenore. Mostly known for his horror stories, some may be surprised that he was also a mystery writer. The Purloined Letter is just one example of a detective short story. Poe's writing is phenomenal, especially since he is able to create a scary atmosphere, and the characters are trapped in danger, even if they are not fully aware of it at first. This is true with The Masque of the Red Death, in which a kingdom believes that they are immune from the plague due to the fact that they enclosed themselves in the castle. However, danger soon approaches. Read for yourself. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"good stuff a I am is be to too true add dead for chance dog catt horse bull ox car tell"},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"Before reading this collection, I knew Edgar Allan Poe as a poet and as the author of the Gothic horror stories which after his death were collected as \\"Tales of Mystery and Imagination\\", although he himself never published a collection with this title. I was therefore surprised to discover that his range of subject-matter was considerably wider than this and that the majority of his short stories do not fall within this category; he was also a prolific author of satirical and humorous tales and of what are referred to as \\"fantasies\\".There is perhaps a reason why Poe is today best known for a few works making up only a small part of his output. Reading his dramatic fragment \\"Politian\\", a fusty cod-Shakespearean blank-verse tragedy set in Renaissance Italy, I quickly understood why, after a few scenes, Poe abandoned not only the play itself but any idea of making a career as a dramatist. (He never wrote for the stage again). About his leaden tales of humour and satire the kindest thing to say would be that most of them clearly reveal just why Poe is not principally remembered today as a humorist or satirist, although there are occasionally some flashes of interest. One that caught my attention was \\"The 1,002nd Tale of Scheherazade\\", which uses the language of the Arabian Nights fairy-tale to inform the reader of some of the wonders of nineteenth-century science and technology, the twist being that fact is indeed stranger than fiction and that when Scheherazade recounts scientific fact rather than fantasy nobody believes her.This volume also includes Poe's only novel \\"The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket\\". This starts out as a gripping seafaring yarn about a young man who stows away on a Nantucket whaling ship, and whose experiences include mutiny, shipwreck and cannibalism. The second half of the story, however, turns into something closer to science fiction, as Pym is rescued by a ship on a voyage to explore the Antarctic, a region of the globe still largely unknown when the book was published in 1838. According to Poe Antarctica is not an ice-covered continent but an open sea with a relatively mild climate, which gets steadily milder the closer one approaches to the South Pole, and containing a number of islands populated by dark-skinned savages.Poe can be seen as a pioneer of science fiction, although the advance of scientific knowledge since his day means that what was once speculative fiction is now either banal fact or else completely implausible. Readers in the 1840s might have been persuaded that it was possible to travel from the Earth to the Moon by balloon, as happens to the protagonist of \\"The Unparalleled Adventure of One Hans Pfaal\\", but modern readers are unlikely to be so gullible, and the ending, in which Poe pulls the rug out from under his readers' feet by revealing the whole thing to be a hoax, will not come as a surprise.Another genre in which Poe acted as a pioneer was that of the detective story. Although he only wrote three stories in this genre, his hero C. Auguste Dupin anticipates Sherlock Holmes in his ability to solve crimes by deductive reasoning. Like Holmes, and a number of other fictional sleuths such as Hercule Poirot, Dupin is not a police officer but a gentlemanly amateur. Of the three Dupin stories, \\"The Murders in the Rue Morgue\\" and \\"The Purloined Letter\\" both end with an elegant solution to the mystery, although I found the third, \\"The Murder of Marie Roget\\", dull and pedestrian. \\"The Gold-Bug\\" is a mystery story of another type, concentrating not on a crime but on a search for buried treasure and reflecting Poe's interest in the science of cryptography.During his lifetime, Poe was better known as a literary critic than as an author of fiction, and in the years after his death had the curious distinction, for an American writer, of becoming better known in Continental Europe than in the English-speaking world. He was particularly well-known in France, where his work was translated and popularised by Charles Baudelaire. This is perhaps not surprising, as I have often found there is something rather un- American about those works by which he is best remembered today. One might have expected the early literary works of the young Republic to be vigorous, optimistic and democratic in tone, but Poe's Gothic tales and poems are sombre and pessimistic, often aristocratic in their subject-matter and frequently set in Europe. \\"Metzengerstein\\", for example, is set in Hungary, \\"The Masque of the Red Death\\" in mediaeval Italy, \\"The Pit and the Pendulum\\" in Spain under the Inquisition and the Dupin stories in France. Several of his stories deal with a mad or cruel aristocrat or ruler who is overcome by some terrible fate (\\"Metzengerstein\\", \\"The Masque of the Red Death\\" or \\"Hop-Frog\\"), and a recurring theme in others is a ruined or ruinous palace or castle. In \\"The Fall of the House of Usher\\" the title has a double meaning; it can be interpreted as referring to the decline or a once-great family or to the collapse of an actual building.Unlike some earlier Gothic writers, Poe does not always make use of the supernatural in his stories. He can also create a sense of horror by evoking the terrible power of nature (\\"A Descent into the Maelstrom\\") or the cruelty of which humans are capable (\\"The Pit and the Pendulum\\"). Both those stories end happily, with the narrator saved almost miraculously from his terrifying predicament, although an escape from death is the exception rather than the rule in Poe's horror stories, where death is more often something inexorable. The death of a beloved young woman is a particularly recurrent theme, possibly reflecting the early deaths of his mother and his wife, and occurs in poems such as \\"Annabel Lee\\", \\"The Raven\\" and \\"Ulalume\\"), and stories such as \\"Ligeia\\" and \\"The Fall of the House of Usher\\". (Both these stories also deal with another of Poe's obsessions, premature burial).Both as a poet and as an author of short stories, Poe is a very uneven writer. At his best, however, he must rank as one of America's finest with a unique ability to conjure up an atmosphere is psychological horror in his stories and to convey emotion through the musical use of language in his poetry. (Perhaps his greatest achievement in this regard is \\"The Bells\\", in which he reproduces in words the sounds of four different types of bell- silver, golden, brazen and iron, corresponding to the emotions of merriment, joy, terror and grief).On a final note, I was very impressed by the handsome elegance of the hardback volume itself, confirming my view that American books, both hardback and paperback, are often superior in quality to British ones."},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"Edgar Allan Poe is regarded as the undisputed master of the gothic horror genre. This collection contains all his published works, faithful reproductions from the orginals, that have made him famous. With stories like the the Pit and the Pendulum, The Tell Tale Heart and poems like The Raven, this books is a must have for any Poe fan or any one who is new to Poe."},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"What can I really say here? A book of this magnitude is hard to really review because there is so much to comment on it's almost better to comment on nothing but the emotional pull of the work in general. So, with that thought in mind I'll do that very thing. Edgar Allan Poe is one of the darkest writers known to man, but on the upswing he may very well be one of the most influential and overall the most insightful. Reading any of the selected work in this collection (ranging from masterful short stories to some of the most brilliantly crafted poems written) will open a door to another world, a world that lives in each and every one of us, a dark world that we shun for fear of understanding. Poe brilliantly connects us to that world.Poe is often referred to for his horror, stories like \`The Tell Tale Heart' or \`The Black Cat' set a precedent for what we've come to expect from his work, but it's not limited and that's where the pure joy in unexpected gems lies in waiting. Poems like the beautifully written \`Annabelle Lee', a tragic story of love and loss, showcase a side to Poe, that while still maintaining a dark edge comes off softer and more heartfelt. It's almost so beautiful its anti-Poe.Like I've mentioned, there is so much here it's hard to narrow down the must reads. There are just so many here. Every poem and story are classic in their own way and deserve our attention. As some have already commented on, this is not a collection to breeze through or take in all at once. It's too abrasive and may come across drastic and or blunt. It's better to take it piece by piece and really allow the brilliance that was this tortured soul shine through with each passage.Edgar Allan Poe still today proves to be an inspiration for many recent writers, and his influence can be seen in many of the most praised, hailed and cherished a manuscript, but the truth remains that there is only one Edgar Allan Poe, and while writers of today have their own unique twists and assets, an imitation of the predecessor at times is nothing more than an imitation. Poe was the real thing, a genius of the written word and it's tragic that he left before his time was through, but he stays with us through collections like this that capitalize on everything that was great and awe-inspiring about a man who lived darker than the rest of us, not because he was that much more removed from the rest of us but because he knew how to embrace the very darkness that lies in us all."},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"It's a finding of modern psychology that depressed people are most in touch with reality.Perhaps this finding is what is meant when they say that great suffering produces great art.Or rather perhaps: Great suffering can produce great art in the hands of the right genuis.Treated with disdain by his adopted father, unable to properly care for his sick wife and dead by two score years in the bottle, Edgar Allen Poe experienced great suffering. He was also the right genuis.His short, pithy poems and stories cull the raw material of your deepest fears to give them life.It is interesting that outside of his work as a writer and putative editor, Poe was also an early skeptic and debunker. He correctly understood that the reason the night sky was not awash in light was because insufficient time had passed for the distant stars light to reach us. He also single handedly debunked a fake chess automaton by showing that it was in fact run by a person concealed in a hidden box.His writing aside, perhaps the ulitimate unsettling thing about Poe is that -- given his prescient understanding of humanity and the world in which it lived -- that he chose and ultimately died from substance abuse in a vain effort to shield himself from that understanding."},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"Discovery is one of the greatest thrills of reading, and if you think you have a fairly sufficient understanding of Poe from only such works as &quot;The Raven&quot; or &quot;The Tell-Tale Heart&quot;, think again.After reading this volume I was impressed at the breadth of Poe's work. His most famous works,I have deciceded, are certainly NOT his best ones. Incidentally, this means that if you love Poe, you may grow to love him more. If you are even somewhat attracted to the uncanny aspect of his stories, behold his lesser known and far stranger works.Poe's Victorian attachment to exacting detail makes several of these stories quite gripping. His odd imagination comes to life most vividly in his humor. Yes, Poe wrote humor! Try &quot;the Angel of The Odd&quot;, &quot;The Scythe of Time, &quot;The Imp of the Perverse&quot;, &quot;The Devil in the Belfry&quot;, or &quot;Never Bet the Devil Your Head&quot;.After finishing some of these works, you'll wonder why your high school teachers assigned the blandest of his selections, leaving you with what you may soon consider to be a rather shallow appreciation of his writing. To label Poe as merely a horror writer is akin to labelling Thomas Jefferson as a farmer.Discover an American macabre genius all over again: revel in his irony and his wit. Buy the book, light up a fire on a crisp autumn night, and experience the complete Poe."},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"I just recently read some of Poe's short stories and poems.

I once spent a weekend at home memorizing \\"The Raven.\\" Don't believe me? Invite me to a party.I'm outwardly normal. Yet, I'm a huge fan of Edgar Allan Poe and his melancholy genius. Everyone should own a copy of his complete works. Read the poems aloud to a date by candlelight. Read his stories when your by yourself in the dark. Poe's obsession with death and the afterlife -- his outright denial of the finality of death -- is evident everywhere. This tortured soul lived and died miserably and now millions of us embrace his work and lionize the man. Nearly every piece of Poe's work is tragic and beautiful. A volume like this is something you will keep all your life and then you'll pass along the tattered remains to your kids. The tattered remains of the book, I mean. Not your mortal remains.

Its big, easy to read print and hardback."},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"Poe has been called the creator of the modern detective story and yet many people have no idea that the character of Sherlock Holmes was inspired by Dupin, the protagonist in \\"The Purloined Letter\\" and \\"The Murders in the Rue Morgue\\". This is not meant to detract from Doyle since I do credit him with mastering the genre. But Poe wrote with meticulous detail and such subtle nuances of logical distinction that he stands among the few truly great American writers.Even Poe's shortest of stories, e.g. The Assignation, The Cask of Amontillado, pack far more visual imagery and intensity of emotion than contemporary pulp fiction authors can contrive in an entire novel stuffed full of crass language and sexual gimmicks. Poe needs no gimmicks to keep you turning the pages.Perhaps Poe does assume a certain level of cultural literacy on the part of the reader that is absent in our modern television society. People actually read books for pleasure in those days. But !I don't believe he was writing for the elite for he was hardly of the upper class. And it is true some stories might contain one or two phrases of \\"non-politically correct\\" language (The Gold Bug, for example). So did Shakespeare, Melville, Twain, and Doyle. But evaluated in the context of his time one can not help but admire his work.I don't want to address at too much length the experiences of many students who have had been force-fed Poe as part of an English literature class. The Merchant of Venice, Anna Karenina, Crime and Punishment, and Lord of the Flies are all books I will never read again due to my onerous experiences in school. However, if you are inclined to delve back into any of the classics in the English language, you can do far worse than to rediscover the tales of Edgar Allan Poe."},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"I'm a big fan of Poe, so I always like to take a look at editions I've not seen before.

But you have to buy the book to read it yourself I'm not going to spoil it for you."},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"Edgar Allan Poe is a writer whose reputation rests solely upon a handful of short stories and a poem; there are very few writers in the Western canon, or anywhere really, where this is the case. There's usually a novel that they're famous for and while Poe wrote a novel \\"The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym\\", it isn't particularly good and doesn't hold up to the short stories.But what stories they are! They're all filled with madmen, murder, jealousy, betrayal, revenge, magic, death, hatred, ghosts, haunted mansions, talking dead, hypnotists, and jesters - all the elements that went on to make up the horror genre that exists today. Poe is the grandfather of horror whose imagery still captures peoples' imaginations today.The creepy old man with the one large eye in \\"Tell-tale Heart\\" whose still-beating dead heart drives his murderer insane; crazy Roderick Usher who sits in his crumbling mansion haunted by his dead sister's ghost; the figure of death who intrudes upon a prince's party in a locked up castle while all among the countryside reigns the Red Death; the nightmarish swinging pendulum; the living death of \\"M. Valdemar\\"; the sweet revenge of \\"Cask of Amontillado\\"; the immolated bullies of \\"Hop-Frog\\"; the murderous doppelganger of \\"William Wilson\\"; and the early template for the detective stories of later years in \\"Murders in the Rue Morgue\\", \\"Mystery of Marie Roget\\" and \\"Purloined Letter\\" - these are all first class stories that hold up superbly today.The appeal of these captivating stories goes hand in hand with knowledge of Poe's own tortured life that contained numerous instances of heart-ache, loneliness, and loss, tinged with addiction to alcohol and drugs, and a mysterious death that remains unexplained to this day.While the majority of the stories aren't as brilliant as \\"Amontillado\\" or \\"Usher\\", those few stories that are more than vindicate Poe's status as a great writer. And while the lesser stories like \\"Gold Bug\\", \\"Black Cat\\", and \\"Descent into the Maelstrom\\" feel slower, overwritten, and less interesting than the best of Poe, there are moments in them that stand out and make reading them worthwhile.Then there is the poetry. \\"The Raven\\" stands head and shoulders above the others, and remains a startlingly arresting poem to read to yourself or aloud to others. It's sing-song quality is what keeps it so popular and its legendary images of a demented Raven saying \\"Nevermore\\", and entrancing lines \\"Once upon a midnight dreary...\\", make it a poem that people will willingly read, and keep returning to, until the end of time.As with the stories, few other poems manage to reach the heights of \\"Raven\\" but there are a few gems in the poems, some excellent lines and images such as in \\"Lenore\\", \\"The Conqueror Worm\\", \\"Spirits of the Dead\\" and my favourite \\"Annabel Lee\\".Poe's stories are a must-read for all fans of literature, whether horror, gothic or otherwise, as they're not only fascinating and well-written but are also, most importantly, great fun to read. So go on, turn off the lights, and by the glare of the silvery moon open up the pages to one of his stories, and scare yourself like it's 1842... nevermore."},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"This is a great classic book to have.

It has most all his poetry and short stories, great collection. Nicely bound, pages printed clearly."},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"I've always had a liking for Edgar Allan Poe, with his tales of horror, mystery and suspense, done in the atmospheric prose of a master writer. Since I live close enough, I've even made some trips to his gravesite, a place that is always surrounded by a sense of sadness.Poe was a tormented genius who died young, under mysterious circumstances, and at the time of his death he wasn't deservingly popular. Certainly his work was not cute romances for the masses -- he explored the darkness of the human heart, love, satire, and the earliest whodunnit stories. And \\"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe\\" brings together all of his poetry and writings in one book.Poe's fiction writings include short stories and novellas, which tend to be rather weird -- a treasure-hunt and a golden insect, a ship caught in a whirlpool, a hypnotized man talks about the universe, and stories of despair, madness, and occasionally beauty. There is also his trilogy of Monsieur C. Auguste Dupin stories, which were the first to feature a brilliant detective solving an impossible crime.Most people know about \\"The Raven\\" (which even has the Baltimore Ravens named after it) but Poe actually wrote a lot of poetry, most of which readers never heard of. Sometimes dark, or whimsical, or even both. \\"By a route obscure and lonely/Haunted by ill angels only/Where an Eidolon, named NIGHT/On a black throne reigns upright...\\"And, of course, the horror. This is what Poe is best known for, including such well-known stories as \\"The Fall Of The House Of Usher.\\" But there are also lesser-known gems -- tales of a plague invading a party, being buried alive, a portrait that siphoned the life out of its subject, and a nightly visit to an Italian crypt leading to madness.Don't read \\"Complete Stories and Poems\\" all at once. It's too intense. It's better to soak it in a little at a time, so that you can get a better feel for the different kinds of writing that Poe did, and how he excelled at pretty much everything he put down on paper. Most great writers can't boast of that much.Poe's writing is what makes even his least story or poem come alive -- he brought a gothic, misty vibrancy to his stories, and could make his quiet dialogue seem utterly chilling (\\" \\"I have no name in the regions which I inhabit. I was mortal, but am fiend...\\"). It's not hard to see why he was an influence on authors such as Fyodor Dostoevsky, Oscar Wilde, Arthur Conan Doyle and Franz Kafka.\\"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe\\" is a must-have for anyone with an appreciation for great literature and beautiful, dark writing."},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"Read troughout the world, admired by Dostojewski and translated by the famous French poet Baudelaire, Poe has become a legendary writer, representing the artist as a romantic failure.

His 'The Pit and the Pendulum' is a classic of horror and suspense.

He is an excellent writer who can express the very essence of his poetry. He wrote down his pain in a venting bonanza.

His writing style is still unequaled by other writers. His ability to say so much with just the right words was most astounding. Modern writers can only hope to aspire to his genius.

This book takes us back to the time of giant monsters, supernatural monsters, and dead people who come back to life seeking revenge against the people who murdered them. We can hear the monster's heart beat through Edgar Allan Poe's poetic form. The stories keep us in suspense until the bitter end. My favorite in the collection remains \\"The Fall of the House of Usher,\\" about a family and how they get ripped apart. The family tree grows without branches; Roderick and Madeleine live as direct descendents of the original Usher, which the narrator says constitutes a flaw in the strength of the family. A large crack runs through the house, itself, a symbol of the family breaking apart. Roderick suffers from hyper-sensitivity to light, sound, and touch, keeping himself enclosed in a dark padded room. Madeleine Usher suffers from catatonia, which leaves her often appearing dead. Roderick constantly worries about putting her in the family tomb while she still lives. The old house makes Roderick even more afraid to the point that he shakes uncontrollably.

He doesn't like Poe. He lists other Brits who haven't liked Poe: Aldous Huxley, Kingsley Amis, George Orwell, Owen Dudley Edwards. Of course, this probably has something to do with the fact that Brits tend to despise Americans in general. But Jackson admits that the French just love Poe: Baudelaire, Mallarme, Valery, etc. Baudelaire in particular worshipped Poe quite literally: he prayed to him. Poe's association with the French preceeded his writings: he met the Marquis de Lafayette during his teens in Richmond, when he escorted the elderly Marquis (friend of George Washington) down the aisle of a church. I'll bet you didn't know that! I own two biographies of Poe: one by George Edward Woodberry and the other by Hervey Allen, both of which I recommend. As to the tales and the poems, of course Poe is beyond criticism (in spite of the Brits). He was a genius and his writings are immortal. The young tend to be his greatest fans, as they are the greatest fans of Lovecraft. His very popularity tells against him among the literary snobs. The young don't read literary criticism, so they read as they please, and they please to read Poe. Poe is cool. You just have to be cool when you end a story thus: \\"Rip up the boards!

I mean, this is Edgar Allan Poe we're talking about! It's an excellent collection of his stories and poems. Many people are of the opinion that Poe's works are all rather macabre. Although many of his works do fit into that category, he was also a brilliant satirist. For example, I recommend his short story, \\"The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether\\". Quite hilarious, and very witty. Poe was a highly educated member of society, and was also the 'inventor' of the modern detective mystery with his short story, \\"The Murders in the Rue Morgue.\\" His incomparable literary style has gone unequaled to this day. For those already familiar with Poe, I suggest you read him again to have a fresh look at his works. For those who are NOT familiar with his works, you are missing out BIG time!

His tales touch horror, but there are some analytical, metaphysical, futurists, and tales of love (strange love, but love).As correctly pointed out by other reviewers, Poe practically invented the mystery tale in which the detective is an amateur who solves the problem through reason and deduction alone (&quot;The crimes of the Rue Morgue&quot;). A wonderful cryptic and deductive tale is &quot;The golden bug&quot;. &quot;The cask of Amontillado&quot; is a masterpiece of cruel vengeance. &quot;The pit and the pendulum&quot; is pure terror, like &quot;The black cat&quot;.The poems have even more variety. You know what the famous ones are: The Raven, The bells, Annabel Lee. Here, the most remarkable characteristics are music and rhythm. &quot;Quoth the raven: nevermore!&quot;, and the ringing of the bells, the bells, bells, bells, etc. My personal favorite is Annabel Lee, but there are many other, less known, which are just excellent.Poe was a troubled man, addicted to drugs and alcohol, who died in a miserable way (some thugs made him drink to use him in an electoral fraud; he died from drunkness on the streets of Baltimore). But his intellect and sensibility (hypersensibility) made him a true genius, a profound connoiseur of the human soul, up and down. His writing is superb and he will remain as a master of literature for centuries to come. In case you have never approached his work, do so now. Choose your favorite couch; wait until everybody is asleep, get yourself a good drink, and travel to the bottom of your own soul."},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"Macabre, enticing, and fantastic, Poe's stories reveal a first rate intellect and out of this world imagination. Poe was the first or one of the first authors of science fiction, when he wrote &quot;Ligeia,&quot; which is a must read, underrated story of his. &quot;The Devil in the Belfry&quot; reveals Poe's comic talents, as does the delightful &quot;X-ing a Paragrab.&quot; These two stories reveal the light, almost playful, side of Poe which is usually obscured by the dark side of his macabre horror stories and brooding poems. Speaking of which, his horror stories are some of the best ever written. I still feel the tension, reading them for the nth time in my life. Poe is also the originator of the detective story. Poe's intellect is evident in the story Mellonta Tauta, where he humorously explains the difference between the Aristotilean/deductive reasoning and Baconian (Hogian!)/ inductive reasoning. In his stories he also demonstrated some understanding of the theory of probability, foresaw the philosophical approach of perspectivalism, and raised the questions of sanity/normalcy that would become one of the major social questions of the 20th century, when power-hungry maniacal and clever madman came to power in some countries with the full intent of eventually ruling the world.I consider Poe one of the most imaginative people who ever lived and one of the most insightful people of the 19th century. By today's standards, his life was short. But the legacy he left influenced and inspired so many people that he should be regarded as one of the greatest writers of short stories who ever lived, and as someone who belongs in the pantheon of many 19th century geniuses."},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"In the annals of short story writing there is perhaps no greater master than Edgar Allan Poe. His tales of horror have sent chills up and down the spines of their readers for several generations. His better known stories are all masterpieces of the genre of the macabre. As for his lesser known tales, they too are complex masterpieces of pyschological horror. And I use the word pyschological because Poe was aware of the inner workings of the human mind before Freud or Jung. He loves to explore the dark side of the human psyche, and no one has or ever will do it with as much power and mastery as did Poe.Also, Poe was a master of language and his ear was exquisitely tuned to the sounds of words. His poetry is perhaps the most tuneful in the English language. Listen to the music of the first sentence of The Fall Of The House Of Usher: \\"During the whole of a dull, dark, and soundless day in the autumn of the year, when the clouds hung oppressively low in the heavens, I had been passing alone, on horseback, through a singularly dreary tract of country, and at length found myself, as the shades of evening drew on, within view of the melancholy House of Usher.\\" You see, Poe understood both tone and atmosphere and how to weave these elements into his narrative; thereby creating a lasting effect in the minds of his readers.I remember when first I read The Tell-Tale Heart how the opening paragraph pulled me into the strange intensity of Poe's madness. It begins thus: \\"True!-nervous-very, very dreadfully nervous I had been and am! but why will you say that I am mad? The disease had sharpened my senses-not destroyed-not dulled them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute. I heard all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things in hell. How, then, am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily-how calmly I can tell you the whole story.\\" But it is the story of a madman and in the end will not prove him sane. In point of fact, it will draw its reader ever deeper into the infernal regions of Poe's pysche, where he will hear the few things of heaven and the many demonic things of hell.I have always loved the intense way in which Poe uses language to attain his metaphysical revelations of the state of a brilliant mind that is on the verge of disintergration. For it is in the order that he brings to this nightmarish chaos that one begins to understand that Poe's dark genius is capable of the highest degree of intuition. And that he is an explorer of regions of the mind that others dare never to explore for fear of what they might find.So I recommend reading Poe's stories and poems for the sheer thrill of it, but also for the complexities of his craftmanship and the subtle way in which he weaves upon the magic loom of his incredible imagination."},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"Having never written a full novel, Poe is sometimes forgotten when the great fiction writers of American history are listed. The power of Poe's dark vision, though, is virtually unprecedented in world literature. The manifestation of such deep, intuitive symbols and archetypes, ones of such clarity, prophesy and terror that even his incredible craftsmanship in language becomes transparant, is a gift given to only the most blessed and tormented of writers. To read a story like the Masque of the Red Death is to be flung into an allegorical morality play which fits perfectly into the modern context. Poe's stories and poems travel through time and rap ceaselessy on the window of your conscious thoughts. An ominous pall of expectation and retribution permeates all of his work. To pick up Poe is really never to put it down."},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"Poe's tales of mystery and horror are, of course, legendary, but the reader will find so much more in this book as well. The classics, such as &quot;The Cask of Amontillado&quot;, etc. still shine and enthrall as much as they ever have, but his humor, which manages to combine simplicity with sophistication, is also exhibited in tales such as &quot;The Sphinx&quot;. Because this book is so all-inclusive, it can shed much light on the lives of those who are not fully aware of Poe's poetry. Does it follow strictly traditional and pedagogical systems of meter, etc.? Perhaps not. But Poe has taken the commonplace, even somewhat trite term &quot;rhythm&quot;, and turned it into something absolutely magical. Again, this is most evident and accessible in the classics such as &quot;Annabel Lee&quot; and &quot;The Raven&quot;, but here it can be found, and definitely should not be ignored, in lesser known gems such as &quot;The Haunted Palace&quot; and &quot;To -----&quot; (&quot;I heed not that my earthly lot...&quot;). When read quietly and at the right pace, his poetry is thought-provoking to say the least; when read aloud, it is almost mystical in its beauty. Committed to memory, it will surely earn one kudos and perhaps even a slight, contemplative awe when recited in the right company. (Giving full credit to the author, of course). Despite Poe's tragic life, he is truly an American treasure. This book exemplifies that through its simple content and short biography, without any constraining and often tiresome commentary. It presents itself to the reader as if to say, &quot;read with your heart. Be frightened, be amused, be enchanted; but hopefully, and most of all, just enjoy.&quot;"},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"This refers to the Doubleday reissue.As titled, this tome contains all of the stories, not just the short stories or a meager selection thereof, but ALL of the stories, including the long Pym and manuscript found in a bottle. This book also holds the poems, complete. It does not contain his literary and personal criticism, such as one dedicated to the Rev. George Bush, and it thankfully does not contain analysis of his work, and especially not by the dismal Harold Bloom. There is much good critical study of Mr. Poe, our source of American literature, postmodern literature, Conan Doyle and Lovecroft etc., etc., but that may be acquired separately. Here we gratefully receive his complete works at a great price.In fact I purchased this copy lacking the will to dig mine out and eager to read once more The Man of the Crowd, a very modern writing devoid of plot, etc., and rather a James Joyce Ulysses in miniature as an urban epic journey within one day's span. Incredibly and stunningly well written.Poe clearly was not the mad drunk we are taught he was, but a great artist, though starving, and the father of modern literature. He reads as invigoratingly and refreshingly and as excitingly both stylisticly and to content as ever. Do yourself a great favor this summer, and your family, and turn off the technology and read this with them, piece by piece. DO not forget to read the voyage in the balloon, not the hoax but the other whose title now escapes me, a vision of the future which reads as well now as ever. Do not go to the usual creaky Poe stories, as good as they are, such as House of Usher and Telltale Heart and Gold Bug, but dare to explore the entire opus of Poe, here generously and comprehensively provided. Let Mr. Poe, the master, teach you to write. Try it and you will find the genius and the fountainhead and the artist that he truly is.Read this to your family with the lights down and the television off. The family who reads this together stays together, as the young ones will remain close to you and begging for more."},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"This is the best of the best when it comes to Edgar Allan Poe. I am a long time fan and can say that Poe is coming into high fashion at last. I read Poe along with David Lehman's reissue of &quot;The Perfect Murder: A Study in Detection&quot; and found the two books perfect companions for anyone who loves understading the classic WHODUNIT."},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"That should really be amended to say no annotation. I would have given five stars, six if possible, because Poe's work on the whole is amazing. Even though all of his short stories and poems (and novella) can be fit into one book which doesn't even break a thousand pages, Poe is very easily the best writer to ever come out of America surpassing even Melville, Whitman, and Faulkner. The writing is required reading for all who love words. However, according to the classical education of the nineteenth century, there are quite a few allusions to material written in foreign languages ranging from Latin and Greek to German and French. In some places translation is provided, but I believe that these translations were done by Poe himself and not by the editors at Doubleday. There were some places where translation was crucial to the story but was not provided such as at the end of &quot;The Purloined Letter&quot;. However Doubleday is not the only one guilty of this, I found quite a number of other editions of Poe's Complete works which lacked annotation as well. In fact I still have not found an edition which DOES CONTAIN annotation. However, it is only a thorn which does not take away from the beauty of this rose of literature. Most know Poe from his horror fiction but in the section of Humor and Satire one finds stories which are still able to make one laugh such as &quot;The Literary Life of Thingum Bob, Esq.,&quot; and &quot;The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether.&quot; The section of Flights and Fantasies shows the man whom Jorge Luis Borges strove to imitate. And for the very sparseness of it's section, the poetry of Poe continues to amaze to this day, with poems which are more like music than writing. But be warned, no one will like everything in here, but everyone will like something in here. For me, I personally didn't care for &quot;The Gold Bug&quot; or for &quot;The Mystery of Marie Roget&quot; but those are both detective stories, so a detective story lover might swoon over them whereas a fantasy story lover might not care for them at all. A reader who prefers Satire will definitely see a side of Poe which few are familiar with, and which, oftentimes, is on par with even Twain and Bierce. For sheer imagination, few if any, can hope to ever equal Poe."},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"Edgar Allan Poe, born in Boston, Massachusetts on January 19, 1809, died October 7, 1849.What is it that makes an author famous? I don't mean famous in the sense a news article reports that \\"Jack Greylea's novels sold 15 million copies last year,\\" but in the sense that he is thought of as being profound, and seminal. That he is quoted, and scholars analyse his works, and he is looked upon as being the original voice of his style, or the font from which many imitators have drawn inspiration.Edgar Allan Poe is one such. The very hint of his name calls up images of midnight graveyards, of crumbling mansions lit by wax candles, the home of strange and tormented aristocrats, till the description \\"Poe-like\\" can draw as vivid a picture in our minds as \\"elephant-like.\\"Yet his output was not great. Basically a short story writer and poet, he produced only one full-length novel, which received more censure than praise, and which very few people today can name. Without wishing to run him down as an author (what he did, he did well, but what he did well, was to be Poe) he was a limited writer, and all of his works over twenty-two years can be contained in one thickish book.So what is the secret of Poe, whereby a scanty writer becomes the cult-centre of a world of horror that carries his own stamp? It lies I think in two things.Not to place these two in any order of importance as regards his continuing fame - I leave this to you - but I would say....Firstly, that it was his choice of subject and execution of it. The mournful, weird and macabre, in which man becomes little more than an instrument of darkness, and that usually the worst darkness, that which wells up from within, whose black light shows us as being not the pawns of evil, but the source of evil itself. But to seize on this idea - or any other idea - as inspiration is nothing, merely the starting point from which the quill hits the paper. It is in the execution of his vision that Poe's genius emerges. Not with a great deal of subtlety, nor a much complexity, but with great and disciplined fixity on the horror of his intentions, Poe moves relentless to the nasty culmination of his stories, and they come to us with all the rawness of unconsoled misery. His art was that of the short story writer, and as such he wrote little, but when reading Poe a little is more than enough.Secondly, that Poe more than any other author is identified as a man with his works. An orphan and an outcast from his adopted family, overly sensitive and reckless, he lived wildly, lied readily, lived in poverty, married strangely to his thirteen-year old cousin, was widowed miserably, and finally died mysteriously at age forty, from uncertain causes that speculation has named as anything from drug addiction to murder. As if this were not enough, his works were controlled after his death by his executor, who attempted to blacken his name. More than any other author that I can readily think of, Poe was his own tormented, tragic hero, and his oppressed characters were him.In the nineteen-sixties, several of Poe's stories and poems - The Pit and the Pendulum, The Masque of the Red Death, The Raven, The Tomb of Legeia and others - were made into popular, low budget films, cementing Poe's reputation firmly into the mythology of modern horror movies. It's common of course for movies to be nothing like the original written work, but all of these are based on not on fully worked out novels, but ideas that Poe dealt with in comparatively few pages.Incidentally, the principal actor in many of these was Vincent Price, whose tall, mournful frame instantly springs to mind as well nigh inseparable from Poe's weird gems."},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"BetterWorldBooks did a wonderful job of solving an book copy mix-up , they were outstanding in ther're efforts to please me.I will certainly think of them first in my next book search.

His dark tales of horror graced my literature books in high school and college, and continue to resonate with me to this day. Poe was a very troubled man--deranged, if you will, but I think that that's almost a prerequisite when it comes to writing the stuff of genius. His life was never truly happy, and it showed in his work. Poe is best known for his poem, THE RAVEN, but there's so much more that is appealing to the lover of the horror genre. Poe was a master of the psychological aspect of horror. Sheer madness was a central theme to so much of his work. He left his writings to the imagination of the reader, instead of offering an abundance of tangibles. I particularly enjoy THE MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH, THE TELL-TALE HEART, MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE, THE BLACK CAT, and THE PIT AND THE PENDULUM. His tales of grief and horror have inspired movies, music, and perhaps redefined Halloween, to some extent. Edgar Allen Poe is a tragic character--he could've easily been one of his own characters. All of the great horror writers of today will admit that they owe a debt of gratitude to the greatest of them all- the great Edgar Allen Poe (1809-1849)."},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"What can it be said about the literary talent of Edgar Allan Poe at this point of time? This American writer was an astounding man of letters, without whose contributions our world would probably be more boring and dull. He was able to elevate an underrated narrative format like the short story form to the category of real art, and also the first one to reasonably theorize about it.Even though Poe was something of a \\"mixed bag\\" (a critic once said of him that he was \\"three-fifths genius and two-fifths sheer fudge\\") his best tales are still intimidating narrative achievements. Some of the best are: \\"The Pit and the Pendulum\\", \\"The Masque of The Red Death\\", \\"The Black Cat\\", \\"The Tell-Tale Heart\\", \\"The Imp of the Perverse\\", or \\"Descent into the Maelstr&ouml;m\\" (to name just a few, of course). To pass away without having read some (if not all) of these masterpieces should be considered as something akin to a deadly sin or a capital offense. Poe was not A short story writer, he was THE short story writer, and many of his tales are still coveted triumphs that many aspirants to penpushers revere and envy. No matter if Poe is not sufficiently appreciated in America (is that really so?), here in Europe we'll be extremely pleased to give him a home. As a matter of fact I'd even contribute tax money to build him a public statue if I was asked to. The good moments that his best works have given me make him deserving of that. No other American writer has been so influential or has achieved so great a renown worldwide (especially in Europe and South America). Compared to his, the work of other writers like Mark Twain or William Faulkner strike me as \\"period pieces\\" and \\"local colour narratives\\".Among all the various editions readily available compiling the entire Works of Edgar Allan Poe, this omnibus by \\"Doubleday Publishing\\" is perhaps the best option for your money. It includes both his entire poetry and short fiction, as well as his only novel (\`The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym'); it is also reasonably priced and the book is quite compact, without being excessively large or bulky (you are not required to be a weight lifter to read it in bed). The only edition that probably surpasses this one in quality and contents is that published by \\"The Library of America\\" (but which is also more expensive). If, like me, you don't care much about Poe's poetry, then \\"The Complete Stories\\" by Everyman's Library (ISBN: 978-0679417408) should be a good choice as well. It doesn't really matter as long as people keep reading Poe from time to time and thus maintaining his brilliant legacy alive."},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"The Amazon.com price on this superb book of Poe's complete published works is phenomenal. Only $18.00 for over 600 pages of one of the most widely read masters of horror in our times. Most people become familiar with Poe through mandatory reading assignments in middle school. How many of us were forced to memorize &quot;The Raven&quot;--and now are so glad we did?This heavy yet sturdy book allows one to spread their ravenal wings so to speak and enjoy Poe at will. Perhaps with a snifter of warmed brandy while seated in a leather buttoned wing chair, one can read through &quot;The Telltale Heart&quot;, &quot;Murders of the Rue Morgue&quot; or one of our favorites, &quot;A Cask Of Amontilliado&quot;. Listen! Sounds of the Carnival in Spain, bawdy drunken laughter, the echoing steps down into the dank wine cellar, the lure of tasting a rare wine, the viciousness taken upon the despised know-it-all, chaining him to the wall, entombing him in, brick by brick until the very last one is in place, the realized screams as the torch is thrown and his death ends his arrogance by a supposed mere simpleton.One can only imagine Poe's daily thoughts, dreams, and nightmares. Whether drug induced or not, Edgar Allen Poe's hand to paper still thrills us today and forever.

It's Poe.\\" To do a critical analysis of this work, in particular by a non-Poe scholar such is myself, would be the height of arrogance on my part; pontificating on a subject of which so many, many others are more qualified would come across as, well...pompous and in many ways laughable. I seriously doubt if I could come up with bits of criticism or accolades others have not been hammering away at for the past one hundred years or so.Poe though is one of my favorite short story authors and indeed, one of my favorite poets. I have been reading him for well over fifty years now and his work is as bright and fresh to me now as when it was first read to me as a child. There are a few things to note though, and a couple of comments the reader needs to be aware of concerning this particular edition.First, this work has not been annotated nor has it been translated (French). I note that on this site and several others that this has thrown some into a hissy fit state. Good grief! This lack of translation does not distract from the story a bit. In addition, with the most simplest of computers it only takes a snap or two on the mouse to come up with the translation of not only French, but just about any other language you might come across...stop being so lazy! Having to research it yourself is the best way to learn! If you have problems understanding what he is writing of; again, there are literally thousands of sites that would love a visit from you...many of them are quite good! No computer? Not problem! They actually have books at your local library with the same information in them!Secondly, I have noted that on this site and several others that there seems to be a bit of whining about Poe's vocabulary, i.e. he uses \\"big words.\\" Folks, if you read 90 percent of the popular fiction books being cranked out today and pay very, very close attention, you will find that they have been dumbed down. They are ALL written at a 7th or 8th grade level! If you must use a dictionary a bit (which I fully and proudly admit to being forced to use each time I read Poe), then so much the better! Learning a new word and its usage is actually a good thing! I promise you that you will not suffer any permanent physical or mental damage.Thirdly, I note that on this site and several others it has been mentioned, and again whine about the fact that Poe tends to use a prose style that is no longer is use. Good grief. I suppose we should have his entire works purged of such and bring it all up to date...Hey Reader's Digest...you are falling down on the job! You are missing out on the chance to befoul yet another masterful bit of writing! This of all the complaints has to be the most asinine. I almost have to cry when I read such gibberish, yet at the same time feel a certain degree of pity for those that make such statements.Fourthly, it should be noted that Poe is actually the Great Grand Daddy of the detective novel or short story and was at least a generation ahead of Doyle. There are some great detective stories in his body of work and should not be missed my any lover of this genre.Fifthly, it may come as a shock to some, but Poe did write more than just \\"The Raven.\\"If you have not read Poe...you should. If it has been years since you visited him...get off your duff and set down with a cup of tea, and your pipe, if so inclined to participate in that nasty habit, and do some rediscovering. If you are in school, i.e. of the younger set, read him. I promise you will learn much of writing, story telling, emotions and actually yourself.Do yourself a big time favor and get a copy of this particular edition, or any other edition for that matter, and get reacquainted with this genius.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"Edgar Allan Poe is certainly one of America's greatest and most underrated writers; perhaps underrated because he's too easily pigeon-holed as a drug-addled horror writer. In fact, he virtually created the modern mystery tale, wrote excellent poetry &amp; many of the images from his horror stories have passed into the iconography of our culture--recall the Tell Tale Heart episode of Cheers, with Diane following Carla around going, boom--boom, boom-boom,....One of the beauties of Poe is that, since his work was all poetry &amp; short stories, you can get everything in a one volume addition like this one. I'll just look at a couple of examples:The Murders in the Rue Morgue:With this tale, Poe created the detective story. The narrator is a friend of C. Auguste Dupin in earl 1800's Paris. Dupin is gifted with a great intellect &amp; comes of an illustrious family, but has been reduced to poverty and has shrunken into indolence. However, reading about a particularly brutal murder in Rue Morgue, he is stirred into action &amp; he &amp; the narrator set out to solve the crime.All of the elements that have become so familiar to us are present here; a locked room, a bizarre killing, a brilliant but eccentric detective, an incredulous sidekick, bumbling police, etc.. Most important, the crime is solved by the rigorous application of reason. In Dupin we see the forerunner of everyone from Sherlock Holmes to Nero Wolfe.The Cask of Amantillado:The story is off &amp; running from the first paragraph:THE thousand injuries of Fortunato I had borne as I best could, but when he ventured upon insult I vowed revenge. You, who so well know the nature of my soul, will not suppose, however, that gave utterance to a threat. At length I would be avenged; this was a point definitely, settled --but the very definitiveness with which it was resolved precluded the idea of risk. I must not only punish but punish with impunity. A wrong is unredressed when retribution overtakes its redresser. It is equally unredressed when the avenger fails to make himself felt as such to him who has done the wrong. It must be understood that neither by word nor deed had I given Fortunato cause to doubt my good will. I continued, as was my in to smile in his face, and he did not perceive that my to smile now was at the thought of his immolation.He had a weak point --this Fortunato --although in other regards he was a man to be respected and even feared. He prided himself on his connoisseurship in wine.Taking off from this brisk setup, Poe treats us to one of the really diabolical tales of vengeance in all of literature. This one will trouble your sleep.And, of course, your teacher taught you poetry by reading your class The Bells, The Raven and Annabel Lee. I bet you still remember learning the word tintinnabulation. They're all here &amp; they're all just as morbid and scary as you remember them.GRADE: A+"},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"When I was in 7th grade we read The Tell-Tale Heart. It inspired me to become fimiliar with Poe's works. Some of my favorites include Annabell Lee, The Raven, and The Bells.

Purple prose was the popular style among many writers at the time, especially of gothic horror stories (look at Hawthorne, and Dunsany, and Washtington Irving): and the man certainly did have an impressive vocabulary: but sometimes it seems as though he were deliberately trying to mislead the reader. After all, there are only so many obscure words one can cram into a sentence (what, for example, is a \\"mulcet\\"? What on earth is a \\"simoom\\"?). Those interested in Poe would do best in turning to his poetry, which is beautiful, dark, and sombre, to discover the full extent of his inventive genius. But in short, don't bother with his stories unless you are an aspiring writer, appreciate tales which are somewhat grotesque and bizzare, or have the patience and comprehension to swallow a divers array of esoteric and obfuscating syllables."},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"This item arrived in perfect condition and the shipping was very fast.

I read him when I was in high school and fell under his spell. I read him again as an adult, and feel that I am still just touching the tip of his depth. I enjoyed him immensely at bothe levels. He throws in French and Latin quotes that still largely mystify me. But even with those aside the tales are wonderfully mysterious. Poe often leaves you wondering throughout the entire story, \\"What exactly is going on?\\" While the poor fellow led a tragic life himself, it produced in him some wonderful tales. They infuse the reader with a creeping sense of awe that writers of gory horror cannot hope to match."},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"I have been very satisfied with all the books I have downloaded from Amazon.

This short story is the epitome of it. It is twisted and you will like it. The narrator, Egaeus, is a studious young man who lives in a large gloomy mansion with his cousin Berenice. He suffers from a type of obsessive disorder, a monomania that makes him fixate on objects. One afternoon, Egaeus sees Berenice, and when she smiles, he focuses on her teeth. Egaeus finds his clothes are covered in mud and blood, and opens the box to find it contains dental instruments and teeth.This short story is really disgusting, but then I thought it was really suspenseful as you read it."},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"Behind the egregious figure and powerful significance of Poe, there is a neurosis. To interpret his work, in function of this anomaly it may be abusive or legitimate. Arthur Shopenhauer affirmed that there is not any circumstance in our whole life that is not voluntary. In the neurosis as well as another misfortunes, we can see an artifice of the individual to get a purpose. Poe sacrificed the life to the work, the mortal destiny in relation to the posthumous destiny.Of course that the last Century was by far, much more unfortunate than the XIX ; that would explain simultaneously that the subsequently elaborated hells by Henry James or Franz Kafka are more intimate, flecked claustrophobic and intimate respect Poe stories. As a matter of fact you may find in Poe certain signals of the future Existentialism, since the simple fact to live for Poe was atrociousThe death and madness (Ligeia \`s tomb, The dwell and the pendulum) were the main symbols used by him to communicate his horror of the life. Accused of imitate the German literature, he could reply with absolute truth: the terror does not come from Germany, but the soul.Poe considered himself a poet, but the circumstances led him to write tales. In some of them the circumstantial invention endures, but in others (Rue Morgue murderers, The stolen letter) comes the copious police genre, that actually fatigues the press, and besides will never die.Poe belongs to non temporal and the eternal. He was a missed angel, his existence worked out as an immense link that joined from the hospitals of the hell, the delirious anguish and unfathomable horror through his tormented soul, could be preserved for the future generations of avid readers, who will contemplate the same cycle of the life, perhaps with other eyes, under different circumstances and protagonists but with the same result: the death without possible redemption."},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"Alan Poe is one of my favorites terror authors, and he is very good at it.

It's not exactly a biography. In fact, I think he made up most of the facts, but they're entertaining facts. I didn't know Poe was a drag queen. Did you?You can get the book on amazon, but act fast. Supplies may not last."},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"I have always preferred the poetry of Poe to the stories. The music of Poe is undeniable - and his memorable lines remain rhythmically in mind. \\" The glory that was Greece,and the grandeur that was Rome \\" \\" Said the Raven, \\"Nevermore\\" And then too \\"In her home by the sea, Annnabel Lee\\".But the great innovator in literature, inventor of the modern mystery tale, the tale of ratiocination, the psychological thriller, is Poe the storyteller.But unlike many readers I am not a particular fan of fictional horror, feeling that life itself supplies enough of this particular quality. So I can remember even in grade - school not really taking to the \\"Fall of the House of Usher\\" or \\"The Tell- Tale Heart\\" because being at the time a very scared person who had a lot of fear in his world, I did not want fictional fear to augment what I already had.I also did not like the vague mystery, the sense of looming threat and non- understanding which seemed to me to come with these stories. But of course one particular reader's emotional predilections do not define what a writer truly is. For many these tales of mystery and horror are Literature at its most interesting and fulfilling.For me Poe's fiction had a weirdness about it which too could be connected with this strange step-son's biography. The expulsion and formal failure at school, the strange love for the child- bride, the haunting sense of loss in love. And then too the dissolution and drunkenness , the wasting away.To my mind Poe is not on the level of the greatest American writers but lingers a bit below threatening them. All that is warm, tender, humane and normal seems somehow outside the universe of Poe. To make an unfair comparison. Tolstoy too was driven by his demons and at times verged on a kind of madness. But he gives us a world in love and feeling and beauty that Poe does not come close to knowing.Nonetheless Poe is a genius of literary creation, and his works richly reward the reader in their magnetic and fascinating beauty -"},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"This book had everything you could possibly ever want from Edgar Allan Poe's works. It has all of his stories and all of his poems all fit together into one book at once, and it is delightful. I do know that Poe's story \\"Murders In The Rue Morgue\\" is the first ever written modern detective story. That's in here, and \\"The Tell Tale Heart\\", and so much more if you're wishing to read his stories/poems. Another thing I know about Edgar Allan Poe is that even though there is some mystery about his true death as a result of his alcoholism, Poe died as tragically as one of his tortured characters. There are many known theories about it. I personally think he was not overall completely understood, and these stories/poems can tell how interesting his dark imagination was. He was emotionally torn apart by his wife's death in 1847. One cool thing about this book is that all of his stories take place at night. I got this great book for a bargain deal, and I don't find it strange at all that Edgar Allan Poe was obviously just as \\"mad\\" as a character in one of his stories because they represent what he feels and what he is thinking about a particularly creepy situation. Highly recommended. His last words were, \\"Lord help my poor soul.\\""},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"Just like the title says.

The illustrations by Dulac are placed throughout the book to visualize a thought expressed in the different poems, As well this makes the book come together well. Edgar's poetry was enjoyed to my fullest extent. Within the poetry I can see his abstract look at the world, especailly in the poem \\"Alone\\" were a sympathetic nature arises in me from understanding exacly what he poetically writes. With Poe's descriptions of being an odd child during his youth, I framilairize with him and understand his sadness.

It showcases the tales of terror that have enthralled readers of horror for generations. It's a pity that Poe doesn't get the credit he deserves. After all, he was the creater of the detective/mystery. Just read the Murders Of The Rue Morgue,etc.But what I love best about Poe's stories are the psychological tales of horror that he penned. He gave us insights into the dark places of the human psyche. One only has to contemplate the inner meanings of his tales to get at their hidden symbolism,e.g. The Black Cat or William Wilson.

He lived a difficult life, because he was raised in a dysfunctional household. But the final product of Edgar Allen Poe's mind is printed in his short stories and poems. Edgar Allen Poe's stories all have similar motifs and composition that would suggest suppressed emotions from life experiences are being discharged through his writings.In a great short story, &quot;The Tell Tale Heart&quot; the narrator doesn't hate the man that he's going to kill, he hates the fake eye. The eye represents evil, and Poe converts everything to black and white. If a part of the kind man is evil, then the whole man is evil, hence, he kills him.

Poe's writing does more than entertain the reader. It can be an insight into the dark and somber world of Edgar Allen Poe. One does not understand the meaning of Poe if one reads at the superficial level. One has to read into Poe, and understand the hardships of his life and how he maintained them that way.

The author creates such realistic drama, surroundings, and characters, that I am transported to the various desert places of Abraham's journey. I could bask in the ritual baths of preparation in Pharaoh's palace, sit among the Bedouin tribes, and travel into the Oaks of Mamre and along the Nile. Stories come alive and details are vivid leaving the imagination to take flight.Her weaving trials and doubt mingled with faith, and the desire to commune with Abraham's newly discovered God of all creation, looking for that city, that child of promise, and the desire to make the promises come true before their time as Sarah encouraged Abraham to form an alliance with Hagar, her handmaiden-are all intricately woven into a story that makes one never want it to end.The author's sensitivity to Biblical truths and insight how to create and weave lives into scripture so eloquently that one hardly is aware it's about to link fiction with truth of God's word, surpasses that of any works I've read yet (and I have read many to be sure!!)Song of Abraham is a delightfully encouraging book with insight into the characters of the Bible, filled with excitement, anticipation, and the knowledge that we are all travelers, seeking God's truth and plan for our own journey.One can rest assured that Abraham's strength, faith and perseverance will be a lasting memory for those of us still sojourning, a model of faith and hope."},{"Title":"Song of Abraham","review":"I love everything this author puts out.

Though we should definitely not neglect such sources, it is important to study the first-hand sources written by the trailblazers from within the particular area of study. With Introducing Liberation Theology, by the Boff brothers, the reader is able to do just that.This book offers a very good, easy-to-understand explanation of the key themes of Liberation Theology in a way that any lay person can understand. Leonardo Boff is a Brazilian theologian and his brother, Clodovis, is a Servite priest in Brazil. The fact that the authors experienced the \\"grassroots\\" development of Liberation Theology as the movement itself emerged lends much credibility to their insights for any reader interested in an \\"insider's\\" knowledge of the Liberation movement.The reader is led to understand how Liberation Theology, as opposed to other strands of theology, is truly something that emerged from the oppressed peoples of society, not from the academic ivory towers of the universities or the Catholic Church hierarchy. Accordingly, Liberation Theology has truly become a form of Christian expression and involvement in Church and society, rather than an exercise between scholars. The authors differentiate three levels of Liberation Theology: (1) Professional, (2) Pastoral, and (3) Popular. These distinctions become important through the book as they help guide the reader's understanding of Liberation methodology, key themes, and history. Perhaps most impressive to me, a reader who comes from outside of the Liberation tradition, is the section where the authors discuss the temptations, tendencies, and biases of Liberation Theology. Such intellectual honesty helps me to take more seriously the descriptions and arguments found in other places of this book. Accordingly, I recommend this book as an important companion to anyone interested in learning about Liberation Theology."},{"Title":"Introducing Liberation Theology","review":"Leonardo and Clodovis Boff are liberation theologians, priests, and brothers who have devoted much of their careers to the pursuit and practice of liberation theology in the church and in the world. Leonardo Boff is a professor in Petropolis, Brazil; Clodovis Boff is a professor in Sao Paulo, Brazil - both have used their educational platforms to spread the knowledge of liberation theology from a Latin American base-community perspective throughout the world; however, as liberation theology is a praxis-oriented theology, the Boff brothers continue to work among the poor people (of which there are many in Brazil) to bring about the realisation as best possible the liberating message of the gospel.In fewer than 100 pages, the Boffs give a succinct and clear overview of liberation theology - this is a theology of the poor, in which the gospel message and the character of Christ are seen as being in solidarity with the poor. Liberation theology is complex, but the Boffs reduce it to simple, understandable tenets.There are three levels of liberation theology, according to the authors: professional, pastoral, and popular. The professional level involves academic theorists and clergy administrator types; the pastoral level involves the teaching and compassionate action of clergy and lay ministers; however, it is the popular level that is most important here, where the action is most involved in the world. Liberation theology sometimes involves confrontation - when Oscar Romero stood up to the oppressors in Central America, he was engaging in all three levels of liberation theology.In succeeding chapters, the authors look at the primary themes of liberation theology, a brief history of the development of liberation ideas from political, social, ecclesial and theological roots, and the spread of liberation ideas worldwide. Liberation theology is sometimes seen in purely political terms, particularly in Western seminaries and churches, because those of us in the West have lost the ability to think in theological terms as a matter of course; to be fair, however, liberation theology does intend to challenge the status quo of political and economic relationships, much to the discomfort of those in the West. Liberation theologians from inside the Roman Catholic church have had to endure periods of officially-sanctioned 'silence' and have often been branded 'Marxists' as a denigration of their theological standing.Churches of all sorts have a love/hate relationship with liberation theology. Large and small, catholic and protestant, liberation theology has a tendency to challenge existing relationships between rich and poor, powerful and powerless, gender roles, and more. Liberation theology from the beginnings in Latin America have spread to encompass more communities - feminist theologians, African-American theologians, Hispanic theologians, and more have drawn inspiration from the idea that God has a preferential care for the powerless and oppressed, and that many stories in scripture, particularly in the gospel messages, show God's care in this direction. Jesus was always more concerned for the poor than the rich, for the common people than the kings and ruling class, and liberation theologians pick up on this fact.The Boffs set out their hope for a truly free society, a dream of liberation for all people from the various forces that oppress. This book is a wonderful introduction to this very influential and occasionally controversial theology, from two of the leading lights in the field professionally, pastorally, and among the people they love."},{"Title":"Introducing Liberation Theology","review":"The Boff brothers, Leonardo and Clodovis, have written a scholarly text suitable for the theology student. Their compendium outlines liberation theology by clearly defining the function, structure, themes, and history with adequate explanations of theological terms that would otherwise baffle the non-indoctrinated. This book is written for the reader who has an interest in knowing the socio-analytical, hermeneutical, and practical mediations. Get the message?If the purpose of the book is to inform, then it is adequate. But it will not win any advocates for the liberation theology movement. With the exception of the opening pages which describe the desperation of the poor with two heart rending experiences, this book is dry tinder in search of burning embers of the human element. The Boffs have many experiences with the poor, the oppressed, and the marginalized that could have brought to life the conceptual and the abstract."},{"Title":"Introducing Liberation Theology","review":"This book dwells on the justification of Liberation Theology within the framework of the Catholic Church. The three levels of the theology are explained, and justified by drawing within the history of Catholic dogma. I also would have liked this book to contain some actual experiences, some historical references to the personalities involved, but this is not that kind of book. The author is exacting to demonstrate to the reader the steps involved in forming a new Theology. The topics and important points throughout the book are very well laid out usually in enumerated paragraphs. At times it is like reading an outline and a reader may have trouble staying focused. The book did an admirable job Introducing Liberation Theology per the title. As for maintaining reader interest, it is very dry. It was an eyeopener to see the steps involved in attempting to justify a new Theology The author's style is \\"to the point\\".

Conservatives don't like it, but since I was born in a Third World country, I understood well the bases of the ideology."},{"Title":"Introducing Liberation Theology","review":"I first read this book about 20 years ago and just finished a second reading a day or two ago. This is as brief and clear an introduction as one could hope for on the topic of Liberation Theology. Contrary to one or two of the reviews suggesting a low rating, the book is not dull. I found it pretty well stated which is not always the case with books that have been translated from the original language. You may or may not agree with Liberation Theology but you will be informed enough by this book so as to be able to talk about it with understanding. This makes the book a worthy read. It is now a bit dated in that it does not inform about the current state of Liberation Theology. That's the only downside that I find in the book."},{"Title":"Introducing Liberation Theology","review":"Great Service, A Book and Bible Theology Every Bible Christian Should Read"},{"Title":"Introducing Liberation Theology","review":"If you are looking for a primary source to tell you something about liberation theology this is a good place to look. If you are looking for a quality work in it's own right, skip this one. please.I have pretty much one major criticism of this book:The whole thing is written in that awful \\"we think we are smarter than everyone because we use 'radical' sounding gobledy gook we learned as students in the 60's/70's\\" tone that somehow still persists in academia today. Expect unneccessary references to the proletariat, marxism, workers, communism etc.I think that if the Boff brothers had written some personal narratives about their lives and work with \\"the poor,\\" and their experiences with oppression this could have been a good read, and pretty inspiring. Instead, it's crammed with pretentious jargon implicitly proclaiming how original and inspiring we are supposed to find this \\"new\\" sensitivity the plight of the poor.It was obviously written not just to call attention to the plight of oppressed people, but also to do some academic strutting, and fluff those shiny intellectual tailfeathers in the face of the establishment in Rome.Unfortunately, when you do that kind of strutting you get censored by Rome, and the polarizing arguements that follow bury any nuanced and rational understanding of your works' strengths and weaknesses. You get left with hardliners who think Libertion Theology was pretty much a communist conspiracy, and shrill aging hippies who think Liberation Theology was the only current in the Church that ever had any concern for \\"the poor.\\"Here's a thought: next time someone in the Church works with poor people, try not using words like marxism, protelariat, radical, laboring class, dialectical, anarchy, collectivism, etc. At least don't string them into mega-word phrases like the \\"anarchcollective-dialectical imperative of the laboring classes.\\" Use your own, normal person, non-foofy academia words, and your work just might have a chance of not being condemned. Or at least it might get a fair hearing.I can't decided if i hated reading this or \\"Pedagogy of the Opressed\\" more."},{"Title":"Solaris 8 Training Guide (310-043): Network Administrator Certification (Exam Gear)","review":"I have just passed the exam 310-043 today and got passed. I used this book and also the Sun Solaris Certification Exam Practice Web-based course. This book is written in a very clear manner. Each chapter brings up the most essential of the subject without loosing the reader's time with unnecessary details. The software is very usefull because it is a simulation of the actual exam. However if you only rely on this book you cannot pass the exam because it covers only 80% of the subjects.Here are some missing topics:- At the exam, the terminology direct and indirect routing is used. In this book there is no explanation about them. At least two exam questions were asking about these two different routing methods.- At the exam, there were some questions about what can you do with SMC (Sun Management Center). In this book the word SMC is not mentioned at all.- DNS: there is no explanation how to debug a DNS server except using the nslookup. In SUN answerbook you can read that there are two commands (dig and pkill -INT). This was also a question of the exam.- I wish the chapter 5 (DHCP) was written in a more complete and clear manner. More examples and more detailed explanations would increase the quality of this chapter.There are other topics which were not covered in this book. However, in my opinion this book remains one of the best written books on Solaris Networking currently on the market.

I beleive that the reviewer probably wanted to write this review for some other book because there is no chapter 16 in this book.

It has both study mode (you can peek at the answers) and exam mode. After the test, your score is presented graphically, and each question is marked.If I had to pick a bone with this book, it would be that the pages are only half filled up. The text takes up a center section, leaving a wide margin on the outboard sides. This causes lots of code/file samples to wrap unnecessarily with a somewhat annoying arrow icon. On the other hand, the white space makes the text easier to read.The author stresses that you must have experience to pass the test, and he suggests ways to practice specific operations to gain that experience.With a book like this on the market, there should be a glut of Solaris 8 Network Administrators on the streets soon!"},{"Title":"Solaris 8 Training Guide (310-043): Network Administrator Certification (Exam Gear)","review":"I just took and passed this test, so I know what it takes to get it done and this book by itself WILL fail you. The Network administrator exam is not like Sys Admin II in that its thrust in not in the deep and wide details but rather in theory, definitions, and the features and attributes of the tcp/ip protocol stack. Its a high level murky test that requires you know the details the way sun wants to teach them to you and can devine shades of gray in the multiple choice questions. This book falls short in that the exercises are nearly non-existent and the questions at chapter end are very few and do not reinforce the format in which the exam questions are presented.Finally, the level of detail is misaligned in that there is too little background presented in some areas a too much in others.Try to augment this books outline by reading a theory book on TCP/IP and actually spend time building DNS, ntp, dhcp servers and clients so that you have crisp, real-world experience in these areas.

Unfortunately, I do not think it lives up to the level set forth in his other novels.The underlying concept of a Babbage secret society was interesting and made for a a good plot mechanism, but the fact that the novel centered around the two main societies and their constant discovery of other secret groups grew tiresome. In some ways the irony of these groups being so focued on manipulating the world that they fail to see others doing the same thing was comical, but it happened too many times and made me feel that I was rereading the same section over again.Having made these criticisms, I still enjoyed the novel as a whole, and I would recommend it but caution you to wait for the paperback to save money."},{"Title":"In the Country of the Blind","review":"I advance ordered a copy of Country of the Blind as soon as I read that it would be available. (This was years ago.) I had enjoyed Flynn's stories in Analog, especially those that shared the technological premise of this book. He had a truly original and intriguing concept of a secret society suppressing the working model of the Babbage Engine and using it to forecast and direct technological and social development. At first reading, 'Country' made an favorable impression as a satire of the many would-be imitators of Heinlein, Rand or Hubbard (and of the latter two authors themselves). I was especially tickled by his comments on free-market theory as the groups that splintered from the original society each pursue their own visions, and the over-the-top violence as each group strives to suppress its opponents. I later came to realize, with sadness, that Flynn meant what he wrote. His recent books reek of the same narcissistic conceits put forward by Rand and other pop libertarians: 'my path is the one true path, my vision the one true vision. Accept my truth, or 'to the gas chamber, go''."},{"Title":"In the Country of the Blind","review":"I really wanted to like this book, as the cliology idea was very promising. Unfortunately, the writing was so bad, I had to put it down. A big problem is Sarah, our expert real estate developer/reporter/hacker/survivalist hero. In the words of one of the other characters, she \\"seem[s] to know more things about more things than anybody else I've ever met\\". (Yes the dialog is that bad - and when Flynn attempts dialects, it is cringingly bad) Sarah is equally at ease discussing the \\"field of fire\\" in a gun battle and who was the Lucasian Professor at Cambridge in the early 1800's. Her \\"I'm a driven poor black woman from the South Side of Chicago\\" story is too thin to make her plausible and grows tiresome very quickly.Also, the author isn't afraid to use improbable coincidences to drive the story forward. Much of the first 80 pages feels like an episode of a 1-hour TV mystery, where time constraints force the back story to be hurriedly injected in a flurry of awkward exposition. Meanwhile, characterization suffers - some editing for balance here would have been useful.Again, the cliology idea is a great one - unfortunately, Flynn doesn't provide a worthy vehicle to present it."},{"Title":"In the Country of the Blind","review":"Science fiction meets cops-n-robbers.

There exist secret societies among us which have developed theories of clioglogy. These theories give them the ability to influence society and profit from knowing what will probably happen long before it happens. For example they invested in Xerox long before it becomes a verb. They also know enough to make changes to the \\"nature\\" flow of history. And they have stayed hidden for decades.In \\"The Country of the Blind\\" Sarah Beaumont stumbles into this cloak and dagger world, and is soon running for her life. She figures out enough of what is going on to expose the \\"great secret\\" and is targeted by an assassin. Along the way we learn the secret societies are not as infallible as they think they are.There are a couple dark moments in the book. One of the villains is certifiable crazy and evil.I enjoy this story and have read it a couple times over the years. If you like the idea of how people might be able to come up with theories which could predict the future, then you may enjoy this book."},{"Title":"In the Country of the Blind","review":"I'm writing because I have a different affection for the book than most. I've read it a number of times. To me, a senior designer (and no lover of conspiracy theories), there's something eerily possible about a secret Babbage machine in the 1800s and a society based on its use. After all, the Greeks built the Antikythera, and it was apparently so little known or remarked that the whole technology vanished. I like the heroine's adventure, because I strongly see myself in her. To me, that also seems very realistic. I found the flashbacks well-handled -- so often a reader is left with a \\"Oh, come on, did the author have to stop the chapter now?\\"The later part of the book was not as compelling. It's hard to believe that such murderous animosity would arise between two groups. It's much more likely that, as intellectuals with a special insight -- treading where no one had gone before -- disputes would be more of a professional nature. The \\"Take it or leave it\\" and \\"We've figured out all the angles, grasshopper\\" attitude of the good guys is where the book comes perilously close to dull and unreadable. I'm not sure how I would have written it better, but I suspect it would have been substituting a more sophisticated philosophy. Even \\"The Foundation Trilogy\\", which was not working on enormously solid ground in regard to predicting and influencing the future, was more convincing. But if I had to choose which was the better story? It's this one."},{"Title":"In the Country of the Blind","review":"Fiction, science and otherwise, is full of conspiracy tales having to do with secret cabals trying, possibly succeeding, in controlling some things or everything.Some are said to try to control human society and progress. Of course they do. See Party, Communist. See any government.Flynn's book is about the secret type. He supposes there is an organization which is devoted to improving human progress. A secret organization, naturally. He ratchets up the concept by describing what he refers to as \\"cliology\\" (Asimov franchised \\"psychohistory\\"), which is a method of quantifying human activities. It is called \\"The Babbage Society\\" after Charles Babbage who did theoretical work on computers in the nineteenth century and actually got some distance into making one. Recent attempts to develop computers along his lines, using nineteenth-century mechanical techniques, have been successful.Flynn has somebody succeeding then, not now, and using the primitive mechanism of cams and punched wooden slabs to do the math of human and social progress. It is then possible to calculate the benefits or costs of doing something or not doing something. A secret society isn't able to do things as a government or huge corporation can, and must instead try to influence the nodes of history. Assassinate Lincoln early on, or not? Sink the Lusitania or not? The Babbage society knows which actions will benefit, in their view, the race. And they have the power to do those little things which have huge effects. These are referred to as \\"horsehoe nails\\". \\"For want of a nail the horse was lost....so the kingdom was lost\\".By the time of Flynn's book, the Society has modern computers and has infiltrated various institutions, including education--they need a population of easily-manipulated sheep and you thought it was an accident--and has run into two foreseeable problems, one of which they had foreseen. Any institution has to devote somewhere north of ninety percent of its efforts to not falling apart, entropy being what it is, and for a secret society, that means, in addition, remaining secret.Which means we have lots of room for intrigue, which is where the book starts.We understand, in fiction, that elevators work, if not how, and cars and roads and we know the Rockies are west of Des Moines and a good many things authors use without having to explain them. In science fiction, we take as given various conventions like hyperspace and blasters, and we already know how rockets work, more or less. The author does not need to explain them.Flynn is in a bind, here. The subject of cliology is central to the book and the readers have never heard of it, its powers and its limitations. Consequently, cliology must be explained to the reader which requires characters to be explaining it to each other so that the reader can understand it. This gets old, although Flynn does it about as well as it can be done.I should say that somebody, the author or an editor, missed something. At one point, with a character readying herself to ride out into the high mountains for a recuperative camping trip, Flynn spends a paragraph explaining why cowboy boots are built the way they are. Considering the attention given to it, the reader may well be looking for a cowboy boot to play some important plot role, but it never reappears.Societies, being made up of people, can also turn from altruism to selfishness which the Babbage Society foresaw.The reader will probably find himself insisting that free will and randomnity preclude humanity being secretly controlled by a secret society. But Flynn's society talks about promulgating \\"memes\\" which control thought processes and perceptions and make free will kind of a joke, except, of course, to them.It won't be much of a spoiler to say that The Babbage Society seems kind of thick. Though starting in the nineteenth century, it never occurred to these bulging brains that maybe somebody else started one, or two or....Other than the concept of secret societies using computers to calculate what to do, making them more successful than the alternative, which would probably resemble a History Department bull session, this is a standard secret society intrigue, good-guy, bad-guy story.Flynn's Eifleheim is far, far better, in part because his use of cliology or cliometry is far less ambitious."},{"Title":"In the Country of the Blind","review":"Flynn's first novel is based on a good idea. Suppose a real scientific theory of history is possible? Suppose the scientific theory of history had been discovered, not once, but several times in the first half of the 19th century? Flynn constructs a contemporary adventure story around ths idea. Competently written, this is an above average read. The plot is clever though too busy. Characterization and quality of writing are average."},{"Title":"In the Country of the Blind","review":"An okay read in an interesting possible present. Would like to see Flynn re-visit this world of cliology. He definitely did an excellent job borrowing from Asimov in that he has moved psychohistory far enough from its origins (from the far future to our possible present) that I did not feel I was reading The Really Early Foundation.Some interesting concepts and well thought out conflicts.

Marx thought he had it all figured out - and those who came after him tried to fix past, present and future so that it would fit his projections. The heroine of this book, a black female named Sarah Beaumont, discovers by change the traces of a secret society, operating since the early 19th century who invented a science called \\"Cliology\\" and try to manipulate the development of history (for the common good, of course, but getting rich, unavoidably).The scenario evokes Asimov's classic \\"Foundation\\" trilogy, the art of predicting the future to be practiced by a foundation, guarded in secret by a second one ... . Only this time it is today's earth, not the fringes of the galaxy, where all this happens.Since there is no psychohistory a.k.a. cliology (or whatever you'd like to call it) the author's imagination had to come up with a few scenarios. All those people, trying to shape the future, who didn't succeed but as a consolation prize got rich by it. Well, it was a miracle, but after all this is a novel about magicians who lost control over their creation ... .This book was written before \\"Firestar\\" and its sequels, where one can find the same leitmotif: trying to change the future so that Armageddon can be avoided. But in this book a coherent story-arc is lacking, and badly so.Beside Sarah there are too many major characters, too many sub-plots and plotters. And it all ends with a shoot-out. In San Francisco. On the Coit Tower. Right.So all in all the book rather disappoints. With better editing it could have been so much better. Considering that it is a slightly altered re-issue one wonders: would more radical rewriting have produced a great book?

I know it must be a challenge fora middle aged white male author to write as a black newspaper woman, but no character could possibly speak and/or respond to the situations she finds herself in, as Flynn has this character do. Also what is it with Flynn's writing about computers and/or the Internet? What is a \\"boot on button\\"?Is \\"spyder\\" supposed to be a web crawler or \\"spider\\"?How does one use the internet to log onto a \\"police blotter\\"? Had Flynn ever seen a computer when he wrote this?His description of a internet \\"worm\\" was also very amusing.His 'Cliology' sounds awfully reminiscent of Asimov's psycho- history, although I will give him the benefit of the doubt.The idea he was espousing seemed interesting, but, at leastat the time this book was written, the characterization was just too silly - actually embarrassing.Perhaps this was Flynns' first novel, and his woodenness wasattributable to inexperience, as I have read several of his short stories in many editions of the \\"Year's Best Science Fiction\\" and they were uniformly excellent.I guess I am just getting sick of buying novels that I canonly tolerate for about the first quarter of the book and then tossing them aside because the dialog of the characters is so blatantly unnatural."},{"Title":"In the Country of the Blind","review":"It's so disappointing when a really interesting concept is ruined by horrible, cliche-ridden writing and cringe-worthy dialogue. Such is the case here. The novel starts strong but slides downhill quickly, devolving into a series of ever-more ridiculous scenes with, truly, some of the worst dialogue I've ever read. And without providing any spoilers, the final scene is unintentionally hilarious in its sheer awfulness. Seriously: read anything but this drivel."},{"Title":"In the Country of the Blind","review":"As many other reviewers here have noted, the idea is fascinating, but it proves too much for the author to handle. The impact of all the various splinter groups is so vague and confused that it's hard to see how any of them actually affected history, and in fact most seem more interested in increasing their investment portfolios. And if this 'science' was originally developed independently by at least three groups in the 19th century, all of whom managed to build Babbage Difference Engines secretly, then why hasn't a modern group, using modern computers, likewise developed it? The 'secret' of the society is pretty easily cracked by the lead character, who lacks only a cape and a mask to qualify as a super-heroine. Most of the rest of the large cast are pretty much names without faces. And finally, though the book ends, the resolution is vague and unsatisfying."},{"Title":"In the Country of the Blind","review":"One of the usually less successful types of science fiction story (in my opinion) is the &quot;secret history&quot; story, in which the plot turns on events that most of us don't know about -- things we aren't *supposed* to know about, secret things that allow some individual or group to (usually) rule the world. Generally, the key events or relationships that give the secret group its power are a little too pat, a little too coincidental, and the stories usually are not believable. Asimov's Foundation trilogy was an exception, up to a point, and so was Wilson &amp; Shea's Illuminati triology. And now, so is this novel.The early 19th century was a time of amateur gentleman scholars who thought that if you could only gather enough information, enough data, about people and society at large, you could work out policies that would improve everyone's lot in life. According to Flynn, a small group of those do-gooders in New England (1) managed to develop a mathematical approach to social engineering, (2) got Babbage's engine to work, and (3) began to do something about the state of the world. And they've been at it ever since. Only, they're really not very good at it.Flynn has a real knack for the language and he seems to know his history. The &quot;fulcra&quot; he selects, the points where a small change might tip the course of events in quite a different direction, are quite reasonable, and he'll tell you exactly why. The characters are believable and three-dimensional and often sympathetic, even the bad guys. And coincidence is kept to a minimum. There's lots of juicy quotes in this one, too. This book was recommended to me by a friend several years ago, but I've only just gotten around to reading it -- and now I have to go see what else Flynn has written!"},{"Title":"In the Country of the Blind","review":"Yeah, yeah, it was a good read, but I had several problems with this book. Not with the science, but with the fiction. There were too many characters in the book. It did read like a serial, every chapter a substory that was ultimately linked by a common character. I had to keep marginal notes to remember who was who and how they fit in. I also had a real problem with our hero. Ms. Beaumont was just too heroic. Was there anything she did not know, or could not do? As a mature Black woman I am attracted to books with characters like me, but jeez, this woman could do everything and do it well. If this is a story about a regular citizen caught up in a situation of life and death, she is just too calm and collected. I also had problems with our male hero. Mr. Malone seemed to be more concerned, more questioning, more nervous about what was going on and he was the experienced professional. The characters were too sketchy, too good or too bad. Too sterotypical, like Mr. Collingwood from the fop to the cool leader, to be credible. I think the most interesting part went to Mr. French, the thread that tied all the motives together. Ah, if only we had followed his story from beginning to end. Speaking of the ending, the book just seemed to stop. Oh well, I guess I was tired of reading it by then anyway."},{"Title":"In the Country of the Blind","review":"Michael Flynn's &quot;In the Country of the Blind&quot; is set primarily in the present (ca. 1990, so some of its computer 'net lingo is remarkably dated after only ten years), with intriguing and illuminating flashbacks to the 1800's. The flashbacks are about a small group of idealists deciding to utilize the theories of Charles Babbage, build Babbage Analytical Engines and use mathematical models to chart the likely course of future events, and -- ultimately -- to modify the undesirable outcome they foresaw: a United Germany armed with unimaginably powerful bombs in 1939. To forestall this eventuality, the &quot;Charles Babbage Society&quot; began taking an active part in history by engineering key historic events, such as the permanent &quot;deletion&quot; of Abraham Lincoln from their equations. . . . Flash forward to the 20th Century when the novel's heroine innocently stumbles upon century-old records of the group -- and evidence that they are still active -- very, very, VERY active she learns as she suddenly finds herself hunted by assassins and everyone she knows begins disappearing or dying as the heirs of the Society strive to preserve the Secret that for more than a century they have engineered wars and assasinations and negative social trends for what seems to be their own advantage. This is a very intellectually stimulating book (as well as a fair thriller) and a good steampunk adventure, but the ending is acutely disappointing. Without spoiling the ending, suffice it to say that it is abrupt and MANY sub-plots (literally!) are left unresolved. &quot;In the Country of the Blind&quot; cries out for republication (the Ayn Rand-like philosophical discussions about history, politics, and the control of society are FAR more relevant today than they were even ten years ago) and the book really needs a sequel to tie up its loose ends and bring the discussions of the major characters to bear upon themes which proved to be sadly prophetic."},{"Title":"In the Country of the Blind","review":"I purchased Michael Flynn's &quot;In the Country of the Blind&quot; on the say so of a few positive reviews right here on Amazon. I'm not sure why it even came up on my Amazon radar screen; the book suggestions here often seem as randomly generated as a roll of the dice. Perhaps it was because I profess to enjoy Tim Powers, whose oeuvre consists of similar history-bending themes. Maybe it was because I happened to stumble across a Harry Turtledove book or two. Who knows?For that matter, who cares? When a book is this good, maybe I should just thank divine providence for sending it my way. Or, um, maybe the Babbage Society.When Sarah Beaumont accidentally stumbles across some old machinery and a list of obscure historical dead ends, she thinks little of it. But when people around her begin dying or disappearing, she comes to the conclusion that her finds have greater importance. She learns through her researches that she has inadvertently set a secret society bent on predicting and controlling the future in motion to silence her.From this interesting premise springs an intriguing book that works on a number of levels, each weaving in and out of the others into a tight tapestry. While some fans of this book promote it as an example of &quot;secret history&quot; (books that take an existing bit of history and make up a fictional reason for its occurrence), &quot;In the Country of the Blind&quot; barely deals with this subject. Instead, the bulk is more like a spy novel a la John LeCarre, with a framework of historical meddling by the Babbage Society. It is a bizarre love story. It is a novel of awakening. And, importantly, it is a novel of ideas. If you could change the future, would you? What if it required the death of an innocent in order to save thousands? What if it required the death of thousands to prevent the deaths of millions? What if you just wanted to make a few bucks in the stock market?Flynn handles these disparate parts well, giving each its due and creating a satisfying novel. He is remarkably evenhanded in his examination of the ethics of engineering the future, allowing every conceivable argument of which I could think (and a few that didn't even occur to me) a fair shot at representation. His writing style is not necessarily the most skilful, producing many odd clunkers or awkward sentences, but the overall effect is nice, smooth. It's an easy read and a good one.I rarely comment on the reviews of others, but I feel someone should point out to one of my esteemed contemporaries that the woman on the cover of the reissue is, in fact, a black woman, albeit a light-skinned one, so it may as well be me who does so. Ahem. The woman on the cover of the reissue is, in fact, a black woman, albeit a light-skinned one. So there.I started this novel without a clue and ended it caring about most of the characters. They had become familiar and friendly and I hated to see it end."},{"Title":"In the Country of the Blind","review":"Michael Flynn is one of the people (along with Lois McMaster Bujold and Spider Robinson) that I consider the sucessor to Robert A. Heinlein (and yes, it takes at least three people to fill Heinlein's shoes). I was very glad to see that his first novel, In the Country of the Blind, was going to be back in print (will his short story collection, Werehouse, be following I hope I hope I hope).This novel never got the respect it deserved when first published. It fell &quot;between the cracks&quot; of science fiction and a mainstream thriller. The Babbage Society believes they can mathmatically model the future. If they are correct, the book is Science Fiction. If they are delusional, but still willing to kill to protect their worthless secret, it's a contemporary mainstream thiller. Either way makes no difference to the plot, well-developed characters hold and express both opinions, and the book rides a quantum function without resolving itself into one or the other.So why didn't it become a crossover hit, popular with fans of both generas? I don't know. Possibly too speculative for the mainstream, not speculative enough for hard SF fans?Both groups have cheated themselves out of a fantastic read. If you like near-future (now near-past) science fiction OR contemporary techno-thrillers, buy this book, read this book, pass this book along to fans.Personal note, other reviewers have remarked, unfavorably, on the dust jacket pictures of some of Mr. Flynn's other books. This one continues the unfortunate trend. The central character is a Black woman. On the cover of the paperback we had the metaphorical one-eyed man, now we have a White woman in a cyber-helmet breaking chains. Would it be so wrong to put a Black woman on the cover? Would it be so dificult to have a dust jacket that wasn't mud fence ugly? DEFINITELY do not judge this book by its cover."},{"Title":"In the Country of the Blind","review":"An intriguing idea: a conspiratorial science known as \\"cliology\\" where the future is predicted by complicated mathematical formulas (on a 19th century device, no less!). Now which way will cliologists go? For instance, will they use their skills merely to prepare for the future, or profit from it, or to try to change it. Or, as here, will competing groups of cliologists have different agendas. Add to the mix an attractive \\"super woman,\\" Sarah Beaumont, with her many exceptional skills and dogged pursuit of the truth, and you pretty much get the gist of \\"In the Country of the Blind,\\" a fast paced, page turning novel.The problem is that Michael Flynn tries to do too much with the material he has to work with. So many plots and sub-plots are introduced that I began to feel overwhelmed by the whole thing and often needed to turn back pages in order to follow all the characters. Ultimately as well, I kept being reminded of all those financial analysts, who, no doubt, feel a certain ability to predict the future, and have largely been proven to be no better at it than the rest of us.I recommend this book to fans of both the science fiction and conspiracy thriller genres who have no trouble suspending disbelief. And, as mentioned by several reviewers, if this subject is of interest to you, try the superior \\"Foundation\\" trilogy by the great Isaac Asimov."},{"Title":"In the Country of the Blind","review":"This a fast-paced suspense novel about dueling secret societies each attempting to shape the course of society using applied mathematics. As it turns out, all the secret societies contending in the book have developed a field of study they call \\"cliology\\" (a true *science* of history that applies historical/actuarial records to ascertain sociological / political / economic trends that enable predictions about future events). Definitely an interesting premise, and one that's been used previously in science fiction (the most famous example of which would probably be Asimov's \\"Foundation\\" series). The book is extremely entertaining and a very easy read. I would it describe it mainly as an adventure/suspense novel spiced up with a few fantastic elements (cliology and its associated \\"secret history;\\" normal people turned into assassins with post-hypnotic triggers; arguably, working Babbage machines in the mid-1800s).The characters are engaging, but I'd have liked to have seen them fleshed out a little more thoroughly. They aren't ciphers by any means, but I almost feel like prior to the start of the novel, they were all loners with few personal interests. I wish that a little more detail had been included on cliology in the text. As it stands, cliology (by design, I suppose) remains largely mysterious. I was also expecting that Babbage machines and \\"steampunk\\" elements would play a larger role in the book; some readers may be disappointed to learn that they do not, Babbage machines are mainly just window dressing in the first third of the book. Also, though it's mainly set in the near future / modern day, some of the technology is starting to look a bit dated, an artifact of the book having been first published in 1990.The setting and characters are crying out for a sequel, as there's a great deal left to explore and the book's finale was very open-ended with no real closure or resolution to the impending conflict. That said, I was satisfied with how things were left at the close of the book, but I would like to see more in a sequel (a prequel about the early days of the Babbage Society would be welcome as well).This is the first Michael Flynn book that I've read, but it certainly won't be my last. He's an excellent writer with a real gift for plot, pacing, and natural-sounding dialogue.(In the interest of full disclosure, I read a copy of the first edition of the book, which does not contain the final appendix on cliology which I understand is present in the current edition.)"},{"Title":"In the Country of the Blind","review":"According to his Preface, this book is a repackaging of previous work: a serial and a separate novelette. He should have left well enough alone. The reason it \\"was somewhat overlooked when it appeared in 1990...\\" was not \\"...perhaps because it debuted as a paperback original,\\" but because it isn't as strong of a story as it could have been.The basic premise -- predicting trends in human events and then acting upon those trends, is fascinating, as is the underlying theme of how historically-significant events can trace back to focal points that would become far more important than they seemed at the time. The latter was the basis of James Burke's hugely successful Connections series. But whereas Burke connected threads in history, Flynn's direction is deliberate social engineering -- predicting a trend, finding the focal point(s) where a doable nudge in a different direction should result in a completely different, predictable result, and then making that nudge. You could drive human progress in any direction you want, either for benevolent reasons or otherwise, but in any case, amass a lot of money and power along the way.I find a problem with this premise. Flynn's cliology (as he dubs his social engineering process, drawing from Clio, the Greek Muse of history) just doesn't measure up - not in reality, not even to support a novel. Flynn's cliology is fundamentally actuarial; i.e., predictions based on probabilities derived from intense statistical analyses. He takes it several steps further with the various laws, models, and theories he explains in his appendix, \\"Introduction to Cliology.\\" He blunts critics who might decry humans' free (i.e., independent variables) will as defying such predictability with examples such as life insurance actuarial tables. These predict for the target population as a whole, not any given individual's death, but their inability to predict at the individual level does not lessen their accuracy and usefulness. I understand what he's trying to do, but I just can't get there. The collective actions of whole populations - millions, if not billions of people, depending upon the target group - over time are just too complex to model. Computational fluid dynamics would be child's play by comparison. Moreover, it runs counter to emergence theory.He does show human frailty in how cliology would sooner or later rob its practitioners of their humanity, especially if they are a secret cabal, which leads to another shortfall. There are many secret cabals in on the action. I lost track after five had been identified (by page 271, with another 200 pages to go). Only a few played a direct role in the story, but all were there nonetheless. Some were ignorant of the others, some were not; others had died out. No telling how many more there might be since their existence could be predicted by cliologists.This leads to yet another problem: operational security. These secret groups that manipulated the path of human progress could be extensive in size as well as number. The main group in the story was a coast-to-coast organization with dozens, if not scores, of people knowledgeable to some degree or another of its purpose. The Manhattan Project, certainly among the most secret projects in nation's history (if not THE most secret) was comprised early on. One has to wonder at the likelihood that these cabals could remain secret over time (well over a century in the book), especially since disgruntled members seemed to routinely split off.Then there's the story's rhythm. Sarah Beaumont, the protagonist, is larger than life -- too many skills, too perceptive, too calm and collected no matter the danger -- and overacted. The book is too long-winded. Flynn's character development is overkill. He could have shaved 100 pages without harm to the storyline, starting with his flat, uninspired denouement. Even his \\"Introduction to Cliology\\" essay could have been trimmed. It was interesting at first, and appending it to the end of the novel should have been a nice technique, but it was tedious and by the time I got that far, my interest had flagged beyond the point of no return.I've often wondered at turning points in history when events seem to inexplicably head off in a perpendicular (orthogonal) direction leading to subsequent events that the trend up to that point did not portend. Take Hitler's decision to halt his ground units from smashing through to the Channel and instead left it to Goring's Luftwaffe to reduce the Allied beachhead around Dunkirk. One can read about Hitler's rationale, but in retrospect it doesn't make sense. What really drove him to that decision? Similar situations abound in history. Flynn missed a great opportunity to take the story in the direction of cliology being a battleground between nations, religions, and ideologies (as opposed to the freelance groups that form the heart of his book), wherein his main characters could get caught up in the intrigues and machinations as these groups fight each other for control of the future.The book is not without interesting nuggets. Again, his use of \\"historical turning points...[wherein] the events themselves were small -- few people involved -- but they had disproportionate consequences\\" (30) is fascinating. The way in which he brought Sarah Beaumont into the story was ingenious (38). His comparison of Lenin's Soviet Union with Henry Ford's corporation (29), if not unique, was new at least to me. He has a fascinating discussion (189-193) of what a \\"fact\\" is and isn't, even applying Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principal to history (shades of John Lukacs, but used here as an anti-cliology argument). These tidbits were the strength of the novel, but unfortunately were just too few in number.In the end, this book just didn't deliver. Firestar and Rogue Star had better story lines and are better written. If you're a real fan of Michael Flynn -- the type that just wants to read everything by him that you can get your hands on -- then have at it. Otherwise, you might want to pass this one by."},{"Title":"In the Country of the Blind","review":"I am currently re-re-re-reading &quot;In the Country of the Blind&quot; (which was published in the early 90s) and it impresses me yet again.The subject is the construction of Babbage's difference engine in the mid-1800s, and the existence of &quot;societies&quot; which develop the science of forecasting a full century in advance of what has happened in (our) timeline.The development of the book is brilliant and as complex as the subject which it addresses. Flynn clearly has an overarching expertise in many of the related specializations, and knows how to convey that information to the reader, blended perfectly with the thrust of the novel.This is not a linear work of fiction. It's not a comic book.Try comparing Flynn's &quot;Blind&quot; with Gibson's &quot;Difference Engine&quot; and you will quickly realize why this book is so difficult to find. Flynn makes Gibson (who is an excellent writer) look spavined and directionless.Of course, the inability to find the book could easily be taken as an extension of the ideas presented. I'll take the less machiavellian view that present day editors and readers are too weak to handle this material at this level of complexity, BUT, that the people who own a copy NEVER will part with it.On the other hand, it may not be in print for the same general reason that Harlan Ellison's &quot;The Glass Teat&quot; was pulled from bookstores in 1970."},{"Title":"In the Country of the Blind","review":"The idea of clioligy was very interesting and certainly this makes the book worhtwhile to some extent, but the characters are unreasonable and silly in places. For instance the poor woman overcome by lust when she had the game won.(No I don't remember their names...started witha G though...) The clioligy is just window dressing to a poor spy novel. I was hoping to see characters working over a long term trying to influence history and really exploring the possibilities. I'd probably try something else if I was looking for a good sci fi read. However,I will keep my copy for the clioligy appendix. Interesting idea."},{"Title":"Configuring VMware ESX Server 2.5 (Vol 1)","review":"VMware is arguably the best virtualization program available today and I would agree with that opinion. VMware ESX Server is their server virtualization product and just like all of their other products it is a stellar performer. However documentation has never been their strong point and this book tries to resolve that problem. Server virtualization allows multiple server operating systems to reside on the same physical machine and be accessed as though they were separate physical servers. This resolves a multitude of problems including situations where different software servers don't work well on the same physical server. For example, many IT departments will not put Microsoft Exchange and Microsoft SQL on the same production server or generally don't like to run the Web Server, database server, and mail server on the same physical computer.This book is written so the average computer administrator can easily install Vmware ESX Server on one physical computer and install as many virtual servers as needed or supported by the hardware without any problems. It even includes coverage of how to installs different server operating systems including how to install Linux on one virtual server and Windows 2003 on another on the same physical computer. However, for anything out of the ordinary the information is often not sufficiently detailed to allow the reader to completely setup the component. For example, the section on network card bonding does not contain sufficient information to actually configure it but does point the reader to a white paper on the subject. On the other hand, ESX server installation and basic administration are both well done and these subjects are the main focus of the book. If you are looking for more advanced information then this is not the book you are looking for, but if you are looking for your first book on the subject and just getting your feet wet with the product then Vmware ESX Server is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Configuring VMware ESX Server 2.5 (Vol 1)","review":"Things I liked about this book:-*A good start for someone who wants to learn about VM and Virtualization.*The chapter about best practices, gotchas and common problems.*ESX Vmware under the cover , file structure of ESX server.*The list of useful tools than can be used with ESX.Things I didn't like about this book:-*The book title is about ESX, but many chapters are bout general VM & Virtualization.*I didn't like putting a lot of URLs referring to VMWare site for more details regarding a setting or a configuration for ESX , many of the popele who think to buy this book already have spent sometime on the VMWare site and looking for other resources like this book !.All in all it's a good start for a beginner in VM world in general, not the book you look for to be ESX guru."},{"Title":"Configuring VMware ESX Server 2.5 (Vol 1)","review":"I'm a contract trainer for VMware and a VCP.

To be honest - I also feared if I read what she said I would be moved to change things in my life. I have read many of her books now, and have been moved to change, vanities and the things of earth are less appealing and I have sooo much more self control in appetite and other lusts of the flesh. When reading internet \\"gossip\\" about the author I noticed much of the claims were straight out lies! and the authors used very ungodly means to get their point across - would God use lies to lead people in the right direction??

This book deals with that.One of the things that I've found is that many people miss out on the power that God's grace give us to live out the Gospel. The power of the gospel empowers us to live victoriously.You will not find just ideas, but scripture is quoted throughout the entire book. It's not long or complicated. This is not about the latest fad in Christianity or the next superstar Christian teachers ideas, but it always points back to Scripture as the guide rather than the backup for idea. No her Scripture is the foundation and the ideas arise out of scripture and are subject to it."},{"Title":"Steps to Christ","review":"This book has been an amazing blessing to me.

It has helped me make steps towards Christ"},{"Title":"Steps to Christ","review":"This book I purchased from Amazon at first seemed to be worth the reading until I got to chapter 7 - the test of discipleship - where the author (Fannie Bolton???) starts pitching the view that the Christian is under the law. \\"Righteousness is defined by the standard of God's holy laws, as expressed in the ten precepts given on Sinai.\\" The problem here is that the standard of God's law is depicted by how we have treat our neighbor, for therein love of neighbor is the fulfillment of the law (Romans 13:9-10).\\"The condition of eternal life is now just what it always has been - just what it was in Paradise before the fall of our first parents - perfect obedience to the law of God, perfect righteousness. If eternal life were granted on any condition short of this, then the happiness of the whole universe would be imperiled.\\" Here again we see the works of righteousness as wrought by man being the determining factor. The righteousness of Christ is imputed to the Christian and we do not need to depend upon our own works of righteousness. We need not go to bed at night worrying if we have become righteous enough to merit eternal life.The Christian is God's workmanship. Eph. 2:9-10 For by grace you have been saved (past tense) through faith. And this is not of your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works so that no one may boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.\\" The Christian progresses in the faith as God works within him or her to become more like His Son Jesus. This is what the doctrine of sanctification is all about namely our spiritual growth.The author like most Seventh Day Adventists, eventually brings one back under the law as obedience 'the condition of eternal life\\". This view traditionally is recognized as the heresy that the Apostle Paul battled with the Judaizers who invaded the churches of Galatia. The covenant the Church is under is the New Covenant, not the Old Covenant. And the New Covenant is not a mere rehash of the Old with only the place of the law (all 603 of them??) being written on our hearts."},{"Title":"Steps to Christ","review":"Please be aware that this book is by Seventh-day Adventist author Ellen G. White. SDA theology is another gospel which obscures the gospel of salvation by faith alone through Jesus alone, and adds works to maintaining salvation."},{"Title":"Tides of War","review":"A short summary:Set on the eve of the D-day invasion, the book features American Lt. Skeet Merrill and his ultra-lovely female spy partner, a Norwegian named Sigi Peterson. Their goal is to disrupt the German U-boats that are massing at a French shipyard in order to deploy against the Allied armada about to launch the invasion at Normandy.The book is full of intrigue all around - is the U-Boat captain truly a loyal German? What are Sigi's secret orders? Which members of the French Resistance can be trusted? Who will Sigi sleep with next?My review:It is a tolerable thriller with a very irritating feature about the writing. For me, the most irritating thing was how the author treats a Dutch member of the French Resistance, Erika Vermeer. Erika is a lesbian - a fact that we are never allowed to forget since the author constantly refers to her as \\"the lesbian\\" (as in, \\"the lesbian crossed the room\\" and \\"the lesbian sat quietly and drank the coffee\\"), rather than using the pronoun \\"she\\". This irritates me as much as referring to a black character as \\"the black man\\" or \\"the negro,\\" rather than using his name or \\"he\\". Muir didn't refer to the heterosexual characters by their sexual preferences, so why continually do it with Erika Vermeer? Were we going to forget that the cross-dressing masculine female character that starred in a cross-dressing revue in Paris was a lesbian?I give it an unenthusiastic 3 stars."},{"Title":"Gerhard Richter: Drawings","review":"Many of these drawings appear to be very simple sketches and they are.

It may be that this book is unintimidating to a beginning, but that's because the questions are on the easy side and the advice is superficial and generic.

The corresponding explanations given make no sense unless you can see what the answer choices were. I called Wiley and they are examining if there is a problem with the book itself (Master Copy) or just the one I received (specific print run).This is really poor quality control if the printing company is to be blamed and even worse if the authors were missing these sections, because that meant the authors and editors did a really poor job. The fact that some of the errors already pointed out do not accur in my printing means that there are probably several print runs of the 5th edition with different errata corrections within.Wiley, fix the QC issues.

If you have the luxury of having at least 2 months to study and therefore have the time to work through this book, invest in it! it is a good book to start with to not only explain the test, but to also give you some basic practice questions, some tips on strategy and some decent solution explanations. Good confidence builder prior to moving onto the OG, Kaplan, Barrons, EZ Solutions. From this book(again assuming you have at least 2 months to study) I would move onto Crackin the Gmat, then onto Kaplan and Official Guide(OG), for extra practice throw in Barrons and for subject specific help, look into EZ Solutions and PowerScore...=)"},{"Title":"The GMAT for Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","review":"This book is a good place to start if you are just starting on your GMAT journey. It puts a lot of daunting concepts into simpler terms that are easier to understand and tries to break down the complex nature of the GMAT into bite-sized pieces. I went through this book as my first book before tackling on the Kaplan study guides, Manhattan guides and the official guide.There are a few mistakes found in this book, which instantly warrants it nothing higher than 2-stars. Why? In my view, a study guide that is supposed to teach you how NOT to make mistakes on a major test shouldn't contain mistakes of its own, let alone a number of them. For example, one of the problems on pg. 150 told me to solve for X and Y provided with these equations: 6x + 4y = 66 and -2x + 2y = 8. The book came to the conclusion that x = 7 and y = 9. Plug in those numbers into the equation and you can clearly see the answer is wrong. After solving it correctly on my own, I had to go back and figure out why the book was telling me otherwise, adding a lot of confusion and wasting precious time. All the editors had to do was double-check that the answers were indeed correct. I started second guessing every problem and solution, and wasted even more time going through its entirety.There are not a lot of these mistakes (I counted maybe 3 or 4 of them), but they are there. Overall, the book is still somewhat helpful, but only as a beginners guide. It doesn't go too deeply into the harder problems you will encounter if you are reaching for anything even remotely close to a 700 score, but if you don't know where to begin studying for the GMAT, or if a friend has a copy you can borrow, it is a good place to start."},{"Title":"The GMAT for Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","review":"The previous reviews must be about an earlier edition of this book because I thought it was an excellent study aid for the GMAT.

It contains almost everything you will need to learn in order to succeed in the exam. At the point when I write this review I am about 2/3 into the book and well into the quantitative section. I have also purchased several other books to help achieve my business school goals including the books Your MBA Game Plan and Great Applications for Business School. I have taken practice GMAT exams before and after reading most of this book my score did improve considerably on the practice tests. I can only imagine that my score will improve even more once I finish the entire book and review all of the concepts in preparation for the real GMAT.A few bits of advice I can provide those thinking about buying the book are the following....1. If your goal is to get into a top 20 MBA program and need a score of 700+ this book will absolutely not be enough to achieve that. GMAT for Dummies would be an excellent choice to start your studying for the GMAT and boost your confidence as well as introduce you to the basics of what you will find on the GMAT. If your goal is a top business school then you will want to supplement this book with the Manhattan GMAT Complete Strategy Guide Set.2. If your goal is a more modest institution where you only require a 550-600 score on the GMAT then this book could prove to be enough for you. I would still recommend you buy at least one other preparation book to supplement this with because this book really makes the GMAT appear easier than it really is.3. Do not skip the first two chapters of this book. They are essential strategies for handling the GMAT exam as a whole.4. There are a few errors in the quantitative section as well as some in the qualitative section. Make sure to pay close attention to these so you do not get tricked. Some of the other reviews have already posted these errors here. Make sure to take note of them.5. DO NOT CRAM this material. There is a lot you will likely need to review for the GMAT and if you try to cram it all at once it will only end up costing you in the end. I would recommend you read one or two chapters each day and review the information on the following day, making flash cards, taking notes, or writing reminders in the process. The book should take you about two weeks to finish if you study effectively and at a good pace.6. USE THE PRACTICE EXAMS. The practice exams that come with the book are very useful to get you familiarized with the GMAT's style. There is not much else to say about this, use the practice tests.Overall, the book is great for people who have modest goals for obtaining an MBA. Those of you who wish to go to a top 20 school might want to look elsewhere or only use this book as a starting point."},{"Title":"The GMAT for Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","review":"This is a book for everyone who needs the get an idea about the gmat.

Its discussion is very good!

Also, there's a section on Split Horizon DNS (split-split or Split DNS or Split Brain DNS, whatever).I'm reading it as I read Minasi's book on 2k3 and MS Press on Network Services for 2k3. I actually bought the book a few years ago (forgot when).Great insight and good jumpstart book.What the book doesn't delve into deeper is how to get you out of trouble in situations where you most likely are that's why you're rushing to your shelf for a resource but he does offer you advice on what you shouldn't do to avoid the headache and confronting your boss. ^_^"},{"Title":"Spider on the Floor (Raffi Songs to Read)","review":"Raffi's Songs to Read books have been around for awhile but my kindergartners love them.

This book is for anyone who is a healer or works in the medical profession or those of us who understand the bias in research writen by white european males.

Countlessscience fiction books make it into the bookstoresonly because of some cool idea, or because they tie in to a popular TV series or movie, or because the author's name guarantees sales, or because some big dinosaur is ripping across the cover.Not so with _Corrupting Doctor Nice_. The bestfiction--and this novel is surely some of the bestfiction--tells a _story_, one which engages the reader's interest; delights with plot complications, humor, and tension; and satisfies with a resolution that fulfills all the promises made by the developing plot.Kessel's book does just that, and does it with dinosaurs and time travel, too. The &quot;coolness factor&quot; which makes good science fiction good science fiction is intimately blended with the brilliant storytelling which makes good fiction good fiction.Buy the book, read it, and remember why you came to love fiction in the first place."},{"Title":"Corrupting Dr. Nice","review":"If travel through different ages and parallel dimensions were a possibility would we hesitate to exploit them? John Kessel's imaginative and plain old funny &quot;Corrupting Dr. Nice&quot; depicts a world (well, several) in which cars are driven with gas pumped from other dimensions, messiahs are plucked from 1st century Jerusalem to appear on talk shows, tourists from the 21st Century swarm around ancient Rome, and dinosaurs are cloned to provide the ultimate steak dinner. With Doctor Nice, the earnest but naive palentologist, his security software which keeps making him preform acts of heroism, and any number of rouges and con-artists, this book is engaging and thought-provoking. In a Sci-Fi tradition which includes Douglas Adams and Kurt Vonnegut."},{"Title":"Corrupting Dr. Nice","review":"The story surrounds the scientific realization of time travel in the 21st century. Humans can travel to the past in any number of &quot;unburned&quot; parallel universes during historical periods where the &quot;historicals&quot; have not yet been exposed to the &quot;futurians.&quot; Alternatively, travelers can go back to a well-established moment universe where the historicals have gotten used to the futurians coming and going. A revolt occurs during a well-established universe, 40 C.E. A good story follows and mostly takes place back in the future.The main plot is a common thread with a new twist. A grifter and her father travel to various times and scam clueless tourists from the futre. Soon, she falls for one of the men she intends to scam, a naive, almost perfect paleontologist who has taken a young dinosaur from the past for study. This part of the story is somewhat obvious. It reminds me of a movie. I can see this going to the big screen easily. The bigger story in the background surrounds the ethics of time-travel.There is a parallel between the unethical behavior of the scam-artists, the paleontologist's removing the dinosaur from the past, and the corporation who owns the time-travel machines.I kept wondering how this story would end. Any book that makes me guess what's going to happen in the last few pages gets 4 stars from me."},{"Title":"Corrupting Dr. Nice","review":"As you can see from some of the less fun-loving previous reviewers, this wild time travel yarn from John Kessel does have many logical inconsistencies. Sure there are problems inherent in this book's characters meeting alternate versions of themselves from different time periods, and altering past events for their own purposes. But time travel itself, in any science fiction story, is illogical to start with, so quit bellyaching and enjoy a story that is both fun and dwells on many surprisingly deep themes. Kessel throws off a quickie (and admittedly under-elaborated) explanation of quantized time streams and something called \\"moment universes\\" to allow a thought-provoking premise on how the supposed miracle of time travel can be exploited by corporations for profit. Here, time travel is turned into slavish entertainment as historical people are used as theatre for rich time-hopping tourists, alternate time streams are exploited for natural resources and infinite profit-making opportunities, and the downtrodden are enslaved by public opinion and elitism. The basic plot of the story revolves around some crafty time bandits trying to game the new system, and a pretty implausible love story. Very well, but I also detect some deeper messages about corporate domination, colonialism, human identity, and religion in the face of time travel. And the book is pretty funny too.

In particular, Simon the Zealot, an apostle of Jesus left without a cause when promoters kidnap Jesus at age 23 from his particular time line, is tired of his 30 C.E. Jerusalem being held in thrall to these tourists from the future. He and a few others of the Zealot cause are using automatic weaponry to try to eject the time travelers and the Romans (the now-puppet rulers, bought off with antibiotics, air-conditioning, and Air Jordans, it seems) in one fell swoop.Oh yes, a rich-boy paleontologist trying to carry a rare dinosaur back to 2062, and a father-daughter team of grifters are accidently caught in the middle of this (while the father of the pair attempts to abscond with Wilma, the dinosaur). Oh, and the rich boy has a bodyguard implanted in his brain which can make his body kung fu fight, when need be.Had enough yet? The whole thing is ridiculous, but it's ridiculously fun. Though there seems to be some weighty pondering on exploitation of natives, more or less, it's never taken too totally seriously. Those who are annoyed by sci-fi authors who use time travel as an excuse to write about their favorite historical figures - will be only minorly annoyed, perhaps. Those who are tickled by a little Christian blasphemy will be amused, and those not overly adoring of Abraham Lincoln will snort at a particular moment in the novel. There are no =big ideas= in here, as one might get from Heinlein, there are no =new ideas= for that matter, but there's plenty of good humor in here. Nobody and nothing can be taken totally seriously in this book, except for Simon the Zealot. He's the only seemingly real person, with real worries, regrets, and passions, and I found his part of the story more interesting than anything else (from a serious point of view).For those who complain that there are logical holes in Kessel's particular time travel premise: get over it. You simply cannot have time travel to the past and not have logical contradictions. You can travel to the future and not have problems (sure, you'll never get to go back where you came from, but just think -- personal jet packs! castles in the air! free computers for all!), you can even posit something that will let you =see= what happened in the past, but you can't travel to the past and not have absurdities popping up every place. Kessel himself knows this, and so has funny things like a 20-something pre-Christian St. Augustine running into a middle-aged, very devout St. Augustine at a 20th century academic conference, ending with them duking it out. Time travel is such a silly idea in sci-fi plots, and absurdity is Kessel's forte.In any case, I think it's a great book for the beach (I read it while doing the laundry) - very light, no depressing thoughts, and smirks on every page."},{"Title":"Corrupting Dr. Nice","review":"I consider Kessel's first solo novel, Good News from Outer Space, to be one of the best (and oddly neglected) SF novels of the past decade, and stories such as &quot;Not Responsible! Park and Lock It!&quot;, &quot;Another Orphan&quot;, &quot;The Big Dream&quot;, &quot;The Pure Product&quot;, &quot;Buddha Nostril Bird&quot; and last year's &quot;The Miracle of Ivar Avenue&quot;, among others, are part of a fine, memorable, corpus of short fiction. So I was eagerly anticipating Corrupting Dr. Nice.Kessel's most familiar mode, it seems to me, is satire, often quite savage, as in &quot;The Pure Product&quot; or the well-known Good News outtake &quot;Mrs. Shummel Exits a Winner&quot;, but he can also wax lyrical, and passionate (see &quot;Invaders&quot; or &quot;Buffalo&quot;, for instance). And lately he has shown a distinct flair for out-and-out comedy, as in his explicit Preston Sturges hommage from 1996, &quot;The Miracle of Ivar Avenue&quot;. Corrupting Dr. Nice is in this latter mode, a screwball comedy, also dedicated to Sturges (as well as a host of other screwball directors). It is quite successful on those terms, as well as being successful as SF, with a well-expressed core message (over-simplified, that people in the past are still real people) which is resolved in a satisfactory manner.The story opens by introducing August and Genevieve Faison, a father-daughter team of time traveling con artists. They have just completed a successful scan in revolutionary Paris, and are escaping into the past, when the canonical &quot;meet-cute&quot; occurs, as the very rich Paleontologist Owen Vannice (nicknamed &quot;Dr. Nice&quot;) literally stumbles out of a time-machine in Jerusalem, 41 C.E., and into the arms of Genevieve. Owen is transporting a baby apatosaurus (echoes of BRINGING UP BABY strictly intentional, I trust) back to his present (2062), but time travel equipment problems strand everyone for a while in 41.An appropriately wacky plot ensues, involving August's plan to steal the apatosaurus, Owen and Genevieve falling in love, and a plot involving Simon the Zealot and a band of Hebrew revolutionaries trying to expel the time travellers. All these threads collide nicely, various disasters occur, and the main action winds up with a courtroom scene featuring two historical heavy-hitters (to say the least).The novel is very entertaining, a fast and funny read, yet with a core of serious thought about the exploitation of the people in the past by those of the future. The characters are well-realized, particularly Owen and his AI security implant Bill, Genevieve, and Simon the zealot (and his son). The resolution to the plot threads are satisfactory, and honest, though the courtroom scene may have gone a bit over the top. The weaknesses of the novel are to some extent endemic to the screwball comedy form: the characters are well-enough realized that their motivations for the acts that propel the plot sometimes seem thin (and Owen and Genevieve don't quite convince me as a likely pair: this in particular seems common in screwball comedies), also, things move so fast that not everything quite makes sense. I could quibble, for instance, about some holes in the time-travel setup: though as I said, Kessel talks a good enough game to let us ignore these while reading. I must say, though, that these quibbles and weaknesses are basically excused by the constraints of the form Kessel is working in (that is, screwball comedy). Things aren't necessarily supposed to make sense.In summary, highly recommended. A first-rate comedy, and a fine SF novel to boot."},{"Title":"Corrupting Dr. Nice","review":"John Kessel has done it again. He has raised science fiction to literary prominence -- in a humorous, satiric comedy that effortlessly flows back and forth through time. This novel is politically intriguing, highly serious and wildly comical -- but it also is very warm-hearted and filled with well rounded charcters that keep the story moving and interesting. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Corrupting Dr. Nice","review":"I didn't read the dedication before starting the story, so I took a little longer than I should have to realize that this was Preston Sturges's &quot;The Lady Eve&quot;. If you like one, you'll probably like the other."},{"Title":"Corrupting Dr. Nice","review":"This book has an awesome premise! In the book's setting, people can travel through time easily and with very few problems. More than that, they can travel to MUs - Moment Universes, which are like instances of our universe at a given point in time. That means they can travel through a certain point in time and behave in some way, and afterwards go to the *same* moment, only on a different universe, and act differently. (Imagine, killing Brutus when he tries to murder Ceasar on one universe, and helping Brutus on another).The book's protagonist is Dr. Owen Vannice, a paleontologist who gets entangled with 2 con artists who trick people in different time periods.This too sounds good, no?So what is bad?Well, The story is utterly *filled* with logic inconsistencies. The author contradicts himself left and right.. and the most annoying thing, is that the author simply avoids certain &quot;problems&quot; with his theories.. he doesn't even bother finding silly solutions for them... simply ignores them altogher. You must agree that a book about time travel which doesn't raise the issue of travelling to the future is kind of silly. And what about meeting with yourself? Or maybe even having time travellers from the future coming to visit YOU? All these are ignored.In addition, the story doesn't focus on these ideas.. it concentrates on a silly love affair of the main characters... That, and the fact that I couldn't stand any of the characters made it a BAD book.Another wasted idea in the book: the kidnapping of historical figures and bringing them to the present. This can lead to to interesting ideas - but what does the author do with it? Mozart becomes a pop star, Jesus starts a talk show, Abraham Lincoln becomes a PR representative.. It's as if these historical figures just *wanted* to drop everything, leave their families, and come to the future to do silly tasks. Utterly ridiculous.If you really like the premise, read Joshua Dann's Timeshare trilogy... wasn't a masterpiece, but certainly much better than this. Otherwise, avoid this book."},{"Title":"Corrupting Dr. Nice","review":"Very well written and edited.

However, itfailed to produce applications or clearcutexamples of the theorems."},{"Title":"An introduction to the theory of numbers,","review":"I have yet to write a review on any of the textbooks that I have purchased from amazon, but I felt the need to give my insight into this book. I'm currently a student studying engineering in Australia. I purchased the Dover publication on number theory a while back with an interest in getting a deeper understanding of the mathematics I'm learning. I don't claim to be an expert in the field of maths I'm merely interested. I came around to getting this book after I was stuck on the Basis theorem explanation in the Dover publication. I stopped on that book when the author explained that the fundamental theorem of arithmetic required a good understanding of the Basis theorem. I tried to follow the proof outlined in the book but was unable to grasp it. I followed some proofs outlined online like on Wikipedia which gave me a better understanding of it, but they used methods of abstract algebra (Noetherian rings and fields) which I hadn't studied.This book starts out by outlining the logic operations it will be using throughout chapter 1. Section 1.1 explains the divisibility of integers followed by statements of fundamental theorem of arithmetic and some notes on prime number series.Section is 1.6 called \\"some notations\\". This is where this book starts to fall apart for me. It starts out by introducing some of the Landau Symbols ( though nowhere does it tell you the name of these symbols with any reference) The back of the book does have a symbols index but it never names these symbols just page numbers.Here the author starts to explain the definitions of Big-O, little-o and asymptotically equivalent, with some examples.Future down he explains that o(1) = 0(1) but usually not the inverse. Symmetry doesn't hold. I fail to see why is the case, the author gives no explanation other then \\" to be observed....\\"The next section 1.7 \\" The logarithmic function\\". Here he outlines the Taylor series of the e^x function. He then states that e^x tends to infinity more rapidly then any power of xhe shows this by rearranging the Taylor series and making a reference to the e^x.x^-n > x/(n+1)! ( does x/(n+1)! have something to do with a formula for the product of powers of x ?? I don't know )I don't see how this proves that e^x is increases more rapidly to infinity then the powers of x. Maybe my maths isn't up to scratch...After graphing these functions it would seem to be not to be true when x^y ( y > 3 ) in earlier integers. But this might not hold for larger numbers thus it would follow from the x > x0 as defined in the wikipedia definition of Big-O but it's not defined that way in this book.Following this the author states that log x being the inverse rises slower then any power of x. He then gives an example ofx = 10^9 then log x = 20.72.. ( it should be noted that the author puts a tiny footnote on a previous page implying that this is in fact a Napierian logarithm, which he means natural logarithm, but he doesn't state this. )Chapter one didn't impress me in the slightest. The following chapters seems to give a much better development and clearer understanding."},{"Title":"An introduction to the theory of numbers,","review":"I'm not as impressed as the other reviewers here with this book, despite it's being in some sense a 'classic'.I take it some people - I have no idea what proportion of the population - now and then are struck by properties of numbers. For example, if a number AB is added to BA, the result always divides by 11. If the difference is worked out, this is always a multiple of 9. (E.g. 75 minus 57 is 18, a multiple of 9). Or (e.g.) Any number cubed, less the number, will always divide by 6 and is also the product of three consecutive numbers. (e.g. 5 cubed is 125; less 5 gives 120, which is 4x5x6). This sort of thing is the basis of 'number theory'.There are at least two problems with this book. Firstly, there is in fact not yet such a thing as 'number theory'. This book is a ragbag of techniques and things which have been identified and passed down by lecturers. But it is NOT a coherent 'theory' in any sense. Perhaps I might compare it with a book on 'chess theory'. Chess books have accounts of such things as opening gambits, sacrifices, end games - including some with extremely precise techniques needed for victory. And there are things like 'zwischenzug' and assorted events which are rare, but have some interest. But does this make up a body of 'theory'? I'd say not. Anyone looking to this book for insight into the Pythagorean mystery of number will in my view be more or less disappointed.Now, what follows from this is my second point, which perhaps is to do with human psychology, or the capacity of the human brain. What is it that makes some people fix on a certain type of problem? For example, this book, like most or maybe all on number theory, starts with prime numbers - probably discovered as a result of packaging and division of actual objects. This of course had practical applications, such as the Babylonian 360 degrees, and our 12 inches, 14 pounds, 1760 yards, and so on. A collection of techniques (e.g. Eratosthenes' sieve), formulas, limits and other results has accumulated. Looking at Euclid's proof of the infinity of primes, his method was to multiply all the primes, and add 1. This function in effect is designed to use the properties of primes to generate a new prime. However Hardy and Wright don't attempt to generalise this process. Maybe Fermat's Last Theorem could be proved elegantly by inventing some ingenious function which combines the properties of addition, multiplication, and powers - repeated multiplication by the same number? What is it that makes some problems (so far) insoluble - and many of them are very trivial to state?So we have here a collection of results, embodied in symbolism which is far enough from the actualities to (perhaps) look more impressive than it really is. Integration, for example, is basically simple enough, but the long s and the notation removes the reader from the real world...And there's a related problem, which is that the connective material, explaining why the next bit is there and what it is supposed to illustrate, is completely missing. The result is like a tour of museum exhibits, where the tourist is expected to infer the significance of all the specimens. Or like a concert, where one sample piece of music is played after another, from which the auditor is presumably left to infer a theory of music. In fact, I've just decided to demote the book to two stars!"},{"Title":"An introduction to the theory of numbers,","review":"Every serious student of number theory should have this classic book on their shelf. Even though only \\"elementary\\" calculus and abstract algebra are used, a certain mathematical maturity is required. I feel the book is strongest in the area of elementary --not necessarily easy though -- analytic number theory (Hardy was a world class expert in analytic number theory). An elementary, but difficult proof of the Prime number Theorem using Selberg's Theorem is thoroughly covered in chapter 22.While modern results in the area of algorithmic number theory are not presented nor is a systematic presentation of number theory given (it is not a textbook), it contains a flavor, inspiration and feel that is completely unique. It covers more disparate topics in number theory than any other n.t. book I know of. The fundamental results in classical, algebraic, additive, geometric, and analytic number theory are all covered. A beautifully written book.Other recommended books on number theory in increasing order of difficulty:1) Elementary Number Theory, By David Burton, Third Edition. Covers classical number theory. Suitable for an upper level undergraduate course. Primarily intended as a textbook for a one semester number theory course. No abstract algebra required for this book. Not a gem of a book like Davenport's The Higher Arithmetic, but a great book to seriously start learning number theory.2) The Queen of Mathematics, by Jay Goldman. A historically motivated guide to number theory. A very clearly written book that covers number theory at a graduate or advanced undergraduate level. Covers much of the material in Gauss's Disquisitiones, but without all the detail. The book covers elementary number theory, binary quadratic forms, cyclotomy, Gaussian integers, quadratic fields, ideals, algebraic curves, rational points on elliptic curves, geometry of numbers, and introduces p-adic numbers. Only a slight bit of analytic number theory is covered. The best book in my opinion to start learning algebraic number theory. Wonderfully fills the otherwise troublesome gap between undergraduate and graduate level number theory.Full of historical information hard to find elsewhere, very well researched. To cover all the material in this book would likely take two semesters, though most of the important material could be covered in one semester. Requires a background in abstract algebra (undergraduate level), and a little advanced calculus. Some complex analysis for sections 19.7 and 19.8 would be helpful, but not at all a requirement. The author recommends Harold Davenport's The Higher Arithmetic, as a companion volume for the first 12 chapters; according to Goldman it is a gem of a book.3) Additive Number Theory, by Melvyn Nathanson. Graduate level text in additive number theory, covers the classical bases. This book is the first comprehensive treatment of the subject in 40 years. Some highlights: 1) Chen's theorem that every sufficiently large even integer is the sum of a prime and a number that is either prime or the product of two primes. 2) Brun's sieve for upper bound on the number of twin primes. 3) Vinogradov's simplification of the Hardy, Littlewood, and Ramanujan's circle method."},{"Title":"An introduction to the theory of numbers,","review":"It was always claimed that of all the mathematicians who ever lived, Hardy was one of the greatest writers. This book certainly confirms that view. From the very beginning, one thinks, &quot;Wow, this guy REALLY knows what he's talking about.&quot; Hardy was, in fact, one of the greatest number theorists of the twentieth century. Hardy gives actual intuitive motivation for almost all of the theorems in the book (intuition is often overlooked by mathematical authors who use the confusing traditional &quot;theorem-proof&quot; approach), and his proofs are elegant and easy to follow. Once, I spoke to the chair of the math department at a major University (Wash U. in St. Louis) and he told me that he reads Hardy and Wright at least once a year to refresh himself on the basics. I would recommend this book to anyone who is learning about number theory for the first time, and wishes to pursue the subject through self-study."},{"Title":"An introduction to the theory of numbers,","review":"This classic deserves its reputation but be warned that it is not an introduction for mathematical neophytes. The authors take detours (which sometimes are looks ahead) from the main path of development that the sophisticate will enjoy but the novice may not be able to recognize as detours. Examples are the geometry of numbers (introduced in chapter 3), the Farey dissection of the continuum, and trigonometric sums.The authors also present deeper material than is usually considered an introduction. Their presentations are excellent but require sophistication for the following topics among others: quadratic fields, generating functions of arithmetical functions, Selberg's proof of the Prime Number Theorem, and Kronecker's theorem.This is a book to buy and keep provided you have the necessary mathematical sophistication.Final note: this book nicely complements Apostol's Introduction to Analytic Number Theory."},{"Title":"An introduction to the theory of numbers,","review":"My initial reaction through the first chapters was one of embarrassment at my lack of understanding. I could not believe a book, hailed by so many as a standard and essential resource, could be so much out of my reach. Then, amid the last page or so of chapter 1 I had an epiphany. The book, from that point on, was completely clear and logical while retaining an extraordinary amount of breadth in coverage.Add my staunch support and recommendation to the long list of kudos that this book has accrued. There are, to my knowledge, no better books for the beginning student of number theory. If you have any interest whatsoever in the theory of numbers, this book is essential."},{"Title":"An introduction to the theory of numbers,","review":"it is surprising to find that so few people have anything to say about this book; Hardy was a giant among mathematicians and at last this book is translated in french...Although it is an old book, the younger author saw that it was updated through 5 editions in the 20th century; this book cannot truly become obsolete because it is about number theory from an elementary viewpoint; so no complex analysis, no modular forms and no proof of Fermat's last theorem either but a wealth of results that could keep you busy quite for a while. Moreover, most of the proofs are still up to date and usable in secondary school or college; most of the proofs about arithmetical functions given in this work have found a new life and home in more recent books such as Natanson's: Elementary methods in number theory (another fine book by the way in which Hardy and Littlewood tauberian theorem is proven via Karamata's method to ensure a density theorem on partitions). The main parts of the book I went through are those on arithmetical functions and series of prime and especially mertens's theorem but there is a lot to learn from it on such subjects as gaussian integers (chapter 12), diophantine equations (chapter 13), Rogers-Ramanujan identities, Jacobi and Euler theorems in the chapter about partitions (numbered 19...), Kronecker's theorem on irrational numbers and on a smaller scale e and pi's irrationality (easy) and transcendence (not so easy) in chapter 11 and of course congruences including a famous theorem on Bernoulli numbers of Von Staudt which gives the fractional part of those enigmatic numbers as a sum of picked inverse of prime numbers . Let say it again: a wonderful book."},{"Title":"An introduction to the theory of numbers,","review":"This is an unusual number theory book in that it covers topics of interest to the authors which are not often found in the \\"standard\\" introductory treatment. My only mild complaints are: no subject index and some ambiguous and unusual notation here and there.I agree that this book should be in the library of anyone serious about the topic, however, if you are beginning your study of number theory from scratch there are other books that may provide a better start. I would recommend Joe Roberts \\"Elementary Number Theory: A Problem Oriented Approach\\" and/or \\"An Introduction to the Theory of Numbers\\" by Niven, Zuckerman, and Montgomery.Roberts offers a wide spectrum of problems, with detailed solutions, written along the lines of Polya & Szego's \\"Problems and Theorems in Analysis I & II\\". Nivens book is a solid traditional introduction.It is fun to read Hardy and Wright though, it exhibits a style that is sadly missing today.I have to say in closing that it would be good to ignore some of the previous reviews, specifically ones making reference to \\"idiots\\". They're unproductive, miss the point of reviewing, and exhibit a level of ignorance which Mark Twain identified years ago: \\"It is better to keep your mouth shut and appear stupid than to open it and remove all doubt.\\""},{"Title":"An introduction to the theory of numbers,","review":"This is the perfect book for learning number theory. Don't let the title fool you, though: this book will last you a long time in your study. After completing this book, you'll have a firm grasp on number theory from the basics to some of the finer details."},{"Title":"An introduction to the theory of numbers,","review":"First of all, let me say this about the one star review. Do not let yourself be infuenced by lesser mathematicians. Idiots in my opinion. To give this book one star, you must posses some special kind of mediocracy. Keep your stupidity to yourself Lucas.No one writes like this anymore. Mathematicians like Hardy have passed. The subject has ballooned, and now you have to specialize within Number Theory. There are fewer and fewer that can posses knowledge of the entire subject of Number Theory. Remember what Harold M. Edwards said. You have to read the classics, and beware of secondary sources. Authors give their own spin on ideas. And who is to say they have a greater or lesser understanding of the subject. Furthermore, who can determine how well can they express themselves. How many mathematicians our days bother to study grammar and literature? The best example is Gauss' Disquisitiones Arithmeticae. Would you rather read a book written by Gauss himself, the man that established the subject? Or by some one who learned what some one learned what some one learned over a period of 200 years? Also know what Axler, author of Linear Algebra Done Right, said about reading mathematics books. For a mathematics book, if you spend less than half an hour per page you are going too fast. The last thing i will say is again attributed to Edwards. In his book on Advanced Calculus he encourages the reader to jump chapters. A book does not have to, and sometimes it should not, be read in order. It may take some practice to see how you need to jump around, but you will find that you can maximize your reading by doing so.There are several point in which this book excels. First, in the writing style. Second, in how many ideas it introduces. Or how good an understanding the reader obtains of Number Theory. It is invaluable to have the big picture. Third, the author has in mind the future material the reader will encounter. He knows you will go beyond this book, and prepares you for what is to come. You do not enter higher courses blind.The writting style is representative of that of Wiles and Loiville. It will show you how your mathematical writting should be. It takes a lot of practice to learn mathematical formalism and how to write proofs. This is the book to learn from. The author is not afraid to connect the ideas you are learning to other advanced ideas and to mathematical history, unlike present day authors. If you plan to be a mathematician, you must know its history. The writting is in a mathematical sense superfluos. It does not assume you are a genius, but strikes balance between what you should know and what you should be told.The book is successful in providing you with the big picture, and how ideas you are learning reflect one ideas you will learn or have already learned. Having a big picture of the subject, which he describes in the second chapter, lets you know what you are learning now and puts the entire material in context. Gives you great perspective of the subject. Because a great deal of branches of number theory are discussed, you are not only better equiped to choose which branch might interest you, but it eases the transition to more advanced courses, such as Analytical Number Theory.The author from the start discusses unanswered questions in Number Theory. I know alot of professors which think that the student should not be exposed to questions that surpass his mathematical knowledge. They are the weak mathematicians. Mathematics is about exploring and breaking limits. You should know what is beyond your reach, and the reach of every one else. The questions that still stand might be answered by some one that was intrigued by the challenge of answering them when they are helpless to do so. Fermat's Last Thorem is such an example. The guy learned it at the age of 10.The last thing i will say about the book is this. Number theory has one scope. Namely, prime numbers. This book make it clear that the purpose of number theory is to determine the properties of numbers. It discusses the limitations of mathematics in attaining answers to Riemann Hypothesis, Fundamental theorem, trancedental and irrational and algebraic numbers, and so on. The book is, in my opinion, an expansion of the section on unanswered questions. And in doing so many more questions are asked and analyzed. There are prime numbers, and nothing else."},{"Title":"An introduction to the theory of numbers,","review":"I am an undergrad student in computer engineering.

This one has the charm of making previously confusing concept clear. Different proofs are often given on major theorems.

The pages are not tissue-thin (good for taking notes in pencil, but not really for highlighting) and the type is a good size for my 37 year old eyes.As for Shakespeare's works themselves, too many people don't know where to go after reading the biggies. Check out Cymbeline, Measure For Measure and Troilus and Cressida if you're looking for some vastly underrated plays that aren't performed nearly enough."},{"Title":"Complete Works","review":"As I had another version of the complete works of Shakespeare in old-fashioned book format, I hesitated a while before buying the same thing for Kindle. What was the point? I knew most of the plays anyway, being a WS fangirl. I was finally tempted by the apocryphal content. A couple I had heard of, but most of them I didn't know.One of the advantages of the Kindle (and forgive me for stating the obvious) is that no matter what size the material you are reading is, your book format remains the same. And this is no small consideration when you're dealing with a writer as prolific as Will. My paper and ink version is an absolute doorstep and therefore I'm hardly going to pick it up on a whim to re-read Hamlet, however much I love the play. Now, however, it's as simple as clicking on the list in the table of contents.The layout is easy to read, the content doesn't need me to review it, and I'm thoroughly enjoying spending time with old friends.

And \\"The Complete Pelican Shakespeare\\" brings together every one of his plays, ranging from harrowing tragedies to airy little puffs of comedy -- and even the lesser plays are still brilliant.The plays basically are divided into comedies, histories and tragedies. The tragedies are pretty much... tragic, the comedies are not always funny but end semi-happily, and the histories... well, dramatizations of history.And everybody has heard of the greats here -- the Scottish lord who murders his way to kingship, young lovers divided by a feud, a Moorish general who is driven mad with jealousy, an elderly king whose arrogance rips his life apart, a very cleaned-up version of Henry VIII's split from his first wife, the goofy Prince Hal and his growth into a great king. There are feuding fairies, bickering lovers, romantic tangles, Julius Caesar's demise, gender-bending, an exiled duke/magician on his island, and the infamous \\"pound of flesh\\" bargain.But Shakespeare also wrote a bunch of lesser-known plays that often can't be so neatly categorized -- a rotten love affair during the siege of Troy, a Roman general attacking his own city, an Athenian gentleman embittered by humanity, Richard III's Machiavellian plot to become king, two sets of twins separated at birth, a corrupt judge obsessed with a lovely nun, Falstaff's doomed efforts to make money, and so on. Some of these (\\"Troilus and Cressida\\") aren't nearly as good as his \\"main\\" body of work, but they're still excellent.For all Shakespeare's plays, it's best to read them AFTER you've seen a good performance. Otherwise, it's like reading a movie script to a movie you haven't seen -- easy to get lost, and the dramatic effects aren't easy to connect to. But if you've seen performances of any/all of Shakespeare's plays, then his vibrant stories and poetry leap off the page.There are long eloquent speeches, puns, clever linguistic twists, and evocative language that soaks the play in atmosphere (\\"With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine/There sleeps Titania sometime of the night/Lull'd in these flowers with dances and delight...\\"). In fact, his plays are diamond mines of quotations -- some are infamous (\\"To be or not to be\\") and some of which have floated into public knowledge without labels (\\"Cowards die many times before their deaths/The valiant never taste of death but once\\").And while some of his plays are basically fluff, he manages to weave in moral questions, criticism and explorations of the human soul. And his characters range as far as his plots -- kings and princes, teenage lovers, proud but doomed men, bratty queens, the witty but combative Beatrice and Benedick, and even the puppet-master mage Prospero.Shakespeare's \\"Complete Works\\" is a must-have for anyone who loves the English language -- his writing was unparalleled, and even his lesser plays are a cut above the rest."},{"Title":"Complete Works","review":"This book was excellent- the commentary was extremely useful in interpreting the text, and Shakespeare himself was quite magnificent.

It is for anyone who really loves the great literature, drama, and the best poetry"},{"Title":"Complete Works","review":"THE COMPLETE WORKS OF SHAKESPEARE. Updated Fourth Edition. Edited by David Bevington. 2000 pp. New York : Longman, 1997. ISBN 0-321-01254-2 (hbk.)As complete Shakespeares go, the Bevington would seem have everything. Its book-length Introduction covers Life in Shakespeare's England; The Drama Before Shakespeare; London Theaters and Dramatic Companies; Shakespeare's Life and Work; Shakespeare's Language : His Development as Poet and Dramatist; Edition and Editors of Shakespeare; Shakespeare Criticism.The texts follow in groups : Comedies; Histories; Tragedies; Romances (including 'The Two Noble Kinsmen'); Poems. Each play is given a separate Introduction adequate to the needs of a beginner, and the excellent and helpful brief notes at the bottom of each page, besides explaining individual words and lines, provide stage directions to help readers visualize the plays.One extremely useful feature of the layout is that instead of being given the usual style of line numbering - 10, 20, 30, etc. - numbers occur _only_ at the end of lines which have been given footnotes - e.g., 9, 12, 16, 18, 32. Why no-one seems to have thought of doing this before I don't know, but it's a wonderful innovation that does away entirely with the tedious and time-wasting hassle of line counting, and the equally time-wasting frustration of searching through footnotes only to find that no note exists. If the line has a note you will know at once, and the notes are easy for the eye to locate as the keywords preceeding notes are in bold type.The book - which is rounded out with three Appendices, a Royal Genealogy of England, Maps, Bibliography, Suggestions for Reading and Research, Textual Notes, Glossary of common words, and Index - also includes a 16-page section of striking color photographs.The book is excellently printed in a semi-bold font that is exceptionally sharp, clear, and easy to read despite the show-through of its thin paper. It is a large heavy volume of full quarto size, stitched so that it opens flat, and bound, not with cloth, but with a soft decorative paper which wears out quickly at the edges and corners.If it had been printed on a slightly better paper and bound in cloth, the Bevington would have been perfect. As it is, it's a fine piece of book-making nevertheless, and has been edited in such a way as to make the reading of Shakespeare as hassle-free and enjoyable an experience as possible. Strongly recommended for students and the general reader."},{"Title":"Complete Works","review":"Students and various e-mail correspondents often ask me which single-volume Shakespeare edition I would recommend, and I never hesitate in naming this one, as I think it has a long lead over its rivals. I have myself used the 1992 printing with amazing frequency both in research and in teaching, and always with advantage.Why is this the best edition for a reader who wants as much as possible within the confines of a single book? First, it should be pointed out that unannotated editions such as the Oxford Complete Works are all in all of comparatively little use as even expert Renaissance scholars - leave alone inexpert readers - cannot read Shakespeare's language unaided; there are simply far too many words, features of grammar, etc., which a modern reader is certain to interpret inaccurately or not to understand at all. So it is essential to have intelligent and well-informed annotation that will help one to understand the text. Bevington's is extraordinarily good: knowledgeable, precise, and helpfully clear.Second, an editor needs to be able to produce a responsible modernised text. Shakespeare cannot be understood by many unless he is read in modern spelling, and the punctuation of his period, too, often leads most modern readers astray. Bevington's modernisation of the text is exemplary. Furthermore, his handling of the many thorny textual problems is also outstanding for the knowledge and the judgement that he brings to bear. For example, the Oxford people unwisely and on poor grounds print two separate versions of *King Lear*, and Bevington has been exceptional in rejecting that approach and producing a persuasively and intelligibly &quot;conflated&quot; text (much better, by the way, than the conflated version in the Arden text edited in 1997 by R.A. Foakes).Most readers of the plays who are not already quite familar with them will want good, perceptive and comprehensive introductions to them, and in this area, too, Bevington excels, demonstrating an awareness of modern approaches and interests without falling victim to trendiness. He offers introductions which are never dull but, however exciting and illuminating, always sensible.The general introductory and accompanying material made available elsewhere in the book is equally useful, revealing, and accurate; and the book is well produced. It is amazingly cheap for the remarkable value it offers.This, then, is not only the best single-volume Shakespeare available, but is by any standard as good an edition as anyone could possibly expect. I add that in my personal view Bevington is probably the only scholar at present alive who could have produced so excellent a single-volume edition. Unreservedly recommended."},{"Title":"Complete Works","review":"For beginners or long-time scholars of William Shakespeare's masterful works, one cannot go wrong with David Bevington's THE COMPLETE WORKS OF SHAKESPEARE. Bevington provides a concise but highly informative introduction to Shakespeare's England, engaging critical introductions to each play, and very extensive annotation to help clarify Shakespeare's more challenging archaic passages. Purchase this volume, and you will be purchasing a lifetime of reading enjoyment."},{"Title":"Complete Works","review":"Great find!!Let me start this review by saying I am a huge Shakespeare fan as well as being a huge Kindle fan and I was looking for a Kindle collection that had everything in it from him. Now, I already know all his plays and poems and works, or at least I thought I did. I mean, I wasn't aware of these apocryphal plays. I mean, I've always wondered if the plays that we all know were the only ones he ever wrote, but I'd never really gone to find out. When I read the title and description I just had to see what this was about.When I downloaded it, I must say I was so happy with this great find!! These additional plays were the first ones I went to look at and already just paging through all these new ones, written at different times in his career, has been so interesting!!

Those are subtle differences that actually make a huge difference when reading the play."},{"Title":"Complete Works","review":"Bevington's The Complete Works of Shakespeare is an excellent place to start or continue one's study of Shakespeare and the Rennaissance Period. This is the book we used in my Shakespeare class in college and I found it extremly helpful in understanding not only Shakespeare, but also Elizabethan England. Bevington includes plenty of pictures to help one see what it looked like in the middle to late 16th Century and early 17th Century. Also, Bevington includes indepth introductions to each of the plays and explanatory notes on words Shakespeare used in a different context from what we use them today. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to start or continue to study the Bard."},{"Title":"Complete Works","review":"The Complete Works of Shakespeare edited by David BevingtonBevington's edition of Shakespeare's plays is a popular choice, and not without good reason. But that doesn't make an ideal choice. The introduction to this one volume edition is ample with chapters on life in Shakespeare's England, the drama before Shakespeare, Shakespeare's life and work. These are good, but they tend to rely on older scholarship and they may not be current. For example Bevington repeats Hinman's claim that there were 1200 copies of the 1623 Folio printed. However later scholars think the number was quite a bit lower, around 750. It should be said that we don't know for sure how many copies of the 1623 folio were printed and either number could be correct.Bevington's edition prints the plays by genre. We get a section of Comedies, Histories, Tragedies, Romances and the Poems. He puts &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot; with the comedies, though we know the play was slated to appear with the tragedies in the 1623 folio. The play was never meant to appear with the comedies, and all the surviving Folios that have the play have it at the beginning of the tragedies.Let's get down to brass tacks. You are not going to buy an edition of Shakespeare's works because of good introduction. You're going to buy one because the quality of the editing of the plays. Is it reliable? Is it accurate? For the most part this edition is reliable and accurate, but that does not mean it is accurate and reliable in every instance.Modernized editions of Shakespeare's plays and poems are norm. Since the 18th century (and even before) editors of Shakespeare have modernized and regularized Shakespeare's plays and poems. There are good reasons for this modernization. There is the reader's ease of use and the correcting misprints and mislination. I have no problem with this regularization of spelling or punctuation. But when an editor goes beyond normalizing and modernizing--when an editor interferes with the text then I have a problem.Let me give two examples of the editorial interference that I am writing about:King Lear 2-1-14 (p. 1184)Bevington has:EdmundThe Duke be here tonight? The better! Best!This weaves itself perforce into my business.The Folio has:Bast. The Duke be here to night? The better best,This weaues it selfe perforce into my businesse,Even allowences made for modernization of punctuation and grammar would not account for Bevington's &quot;The better! Best.&quot; Bevington glosses this to mean &quot;so much the better; in fact the best that could happen.&quot; Nice try, but &quot;The better best&quot; of the folio is a double comparative, (which is a regular feature of Early Modern English) and not two separate adjectival phrases. Interestingly, the Quarto printing of Lear prints this scene in prose, and there is no punctuation between &quot;better&quot; and &quot;best&quot; in that version either.A few lines down Lear 2-1-19 Edmund continuesBevington has:Brother, a word. Descend. Brother, I say!Enter EdgarBut Bevington has reversed the order. The Folio has:Enter Edgar.Brother, a word, discend; Brother I say,Bevington does not say why he changed the order, though to be fair other modern editors have done the same thing.These two changes just a few lines apart go beyond regularization or modernization. They interfere with the text as presented in the 1623 Folio. And Bevington does not explain the changes. So next time you pick up this or any other modernized edition you should ask yourself &quot;am I really sure what I'm reading is what Shakespeare wrote?&quot;"},{"Title":"Complete Works","review":"David Bevington gives us a well-researched and useful edition of William Shakespeare's complete works. The bard's plays are, of course, indescribably good, and would be in any edition. Thus, an editor's job is to provide annotations to explain archaic vocabulary or 16th Century references which would otherwise escape us, to give the reader the best text available--since Shakespeare's plays were originally not written for publication but only for production on the stage, this is a recurring problem--to write short introductions to plays which guide a reader about certain themes recurring in the play, and to provide other helpful material in a general introduction and in end notes. Bevington succeeds at all these tasks. His annotations are, as a rule, helpful without being intrusive. Bevington seems instinctively to know when a word or phrase needs to be explained and when a description of a phrase not immediately obvious to modern readers would be more harmful than helpful by breaking up the flow of the text. His introductions to each play are insightful. A good example of this is Bevington's introduction to Much Ado About Nothing in which he explains that the Sixteenth Century pronunciation of &quot;Nothing&quot; was the same as the pronunciation of &quot;Noting.&quot; Since the play involves numerous instances of people overhearing other character's conversations, the play's title has a double meaning--i.e., it is both Much Ado About Nothing and Much Ado About Noting. Finally, Bevington's introductory and concluding general remarks are also quite good. For example, Bevington gives brief descriptions of the Elizabethan stage and the history of Shakespearean productions over the last four hundred years in his introduction. He also gives his take on the controversy over whether Shakespeare wrote all his plays himself. After the plays, he gives the sources of the text for the various plays, including how the plays were first published."},{"Title":"Complete Works","review":"Perhaps this actually is the complete works of Shakespeare,but with no table of contents, or section headings or anything similar, it is impossible to use.

The tragedies are pretty much... tragic, the comedies are not always funny but end semi-happily, and the histories... well, dramatizations of history.And everybody has heard of the greats here -- the Scottish lord who murders his way to kingship, young lovers divided by a feud, a Moorish general who is driven mad with jealousy, an elderly king whose arrogance rips his life apart, a very cleaned-up version of Henry VIII's split from his first wife, the goofy Prince Hal and his growth into a great king. There are feuding fairies, bickering lovers, romantic tangles, Julius Caesar's demise, gender-bending, an exiled duke/magician on his island, and the infamous \\"pound of flesh\\" bargain.But Shakespeare also wrote a bunch of lesser-known plays that often can't be so neatly categorized -- a rotten love affair during the siege of Troy, a Roman general attacking his own city, an Athenian gentleman embittered by humanity, Richard III's Machiavellian plot to become king, two sets of twins separated at birth, a corrupt judge obsessed with a lovely nun, Falstaff's doomed efforts to make money, and so on. Some of these (\\"Troilus and Cressida\\") aren't nearly as good as his \\"main\\" body of work, but they're still excellent.For all Shakespeare's plays, it's best to read them AFTER you've seen a good performance. Otherwise, it's like reading a movie script to a movie you haven't seen -- easy to get lost, and the dramatic effects aren't easy to connect to. But if you've seen performances of any/all of Shakespeare's plays, then his vibrant stories and poetry leap off the page.There are long eloquent speeches, puns, clever linguistic twists, and evocative language that soaks the play in atmosphere (\\"With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine/There sleeps Titania sometime of the night/Lull'd in these flowers with dances and delight...\\"). In fact, his plays are diamond mines of quotations -- some are infamous (\\"To be or not to be\\") and some of which have floated into public knowledge without labels (\\"Cowards die many times before their deaths/The valiant never taste of death but once\\").And while some of his plays are basically fluff, he manages to weave in moral questions, criticism and explorations of the human soul. And his characters range as far as his plots -- kings and princes, teenage lovers, proud but doomed men, bratty queens, the witty but combative Beatrice and Benedick, and even the puppet-master mage Prospero.Shakespeare's \\"Complete Works\\" is a must-have for anyone who loves the English language -- his writing was unparalleled, and even his lesser plays are a cut above the rest."},{"Title":"Complete Works","review":"Really good book, arrived quickly BUT I would have liked to know it was a teacher book.

This realization dawned on me during the course of the several frustrating hours I spent looking at samples from the first twenty collections listed in the Kindle store. Apparently, the text of plays presents some formidable formatting problems for the electronic readers and this was evident given the generally very poor quality of the editions that are available. Proper formatting makes the play easier to read and may also help in understanding both the action and the interactions among the characters. In many of the Kindle editions, it is difficult to identify the speaker, the transitions between scenes or acts are not distinct; these are problems that cannot be corrected by adjusting the font size on a computer or device. One problem that can be fixed by changing the font size is when the text appears as if written in paragraphs rather than in separate lines of iambic pentameter. Many of the Kindle editions have no table of contents and a majority of those I viewed had no dramatis personae at the beginning of each play. The quality of the formatting seems to be unrelated to cost; many free editions were superior to those costing from several up to twenty dollars. One exception to this general observation is the Oxford Edition which had the most pleasing formatting among those I viewed.The Ultimate Collection suffers from many of the formatting problems mentioned above. Although the speaker is identified clearly, the position on the line at which the speaker's name appears seems to vary almost randomly throughout the text. The transition from one scene to the next is so subtle as to be missed easily. However, the edition does have a dramatis personae.Many may be unmoved by the formatting problems I describe and, if that be the case, then there are a great number of acceptable Kindle editions from which to choose. If one is bothered by poor formatting then one could invest almost thirty dollars in the Oxford edition. Other alternatives would be to use either of two excellent web archives of the collected works [...] but of course one would need to be online. One can download Shakespeare plays from [...] after having registered with the site. Finally, there is an excellent free Shakeaspeare App that gives one full access the complete works, in addition to excellent formatting, on the iPad and iPhone."},{"Title":"Complete Works","review":"I looked up the Bevington edition of the complete works of Shakespeare and was astonished to see a Kindle version available for only 99 cents.

Amazing! The Table of Contents is great. You can use it to go to the start of any play or act within the play. I used the \\"Search this Book\\" function in the menu to track down a couple of famous speeches by typing in \\"Band of Brothers\\" and \\"Slings and Arrows\\" (after getting over 100 hits when I typed in \\"To be or not to be\\"). In each case I was taken right to Harry and Hamlet respectively. As the product description advises, the book opens to the first line of the first play and you have to either click menu and \\"go to beginning or the book\\" or hit the \\"previous page\\" button a number of times to get to the start of the index.

His poetry has so much nuance that I am always finding something new and his plot devices have been used and re-used for centuries.

First and most important, the footnotes give you just what you need to understand the play and no more. They're complete, concise, and accurate. The formatting of the footnotes also facilitates their accessibility. Second, the introductions to individual plays are marvelous--they get right to the most important critical issues that make reading the plays interesting, without being vague and out-of-date or pedantic, overly concerned with trivial minutiae. Third, the background essays are excellent and up-to-date. The essays on &quot;The Drama Before Shakespeare,&quot; &quot;London Theaters and Dramatic Companies,&quot; &quot;Shakespeare's Life and Work,&quot; and &quot;Shakespeare's Language&quot; are among the best available anywhere, complete and concise, giving you exactly the information that is needed for studying and appreciating Shakespeare in the 21st century, without bogging down in unnecessary details. Consider also Bevington's The Necessary Shakespeare, which uses the same footnotes, introductions, and background essays, but includes fewer plays. It's possible to quibble with some of the editorial decisions, but unless you're writing a Ph.D. dissertation on Shakespeare, students and aficionados will want a good &quot;reading edition&quot; like the Bevington that includes the important variants. If you really want a completely &quot;authentic&quot; 17th century version, folio reproductions are now widely available."},{"Title":"Complete Works","review":"Let me count the ways, in no particular order: I like the typeface and the typography; it's easy on the eye. I like the paper it's printed on. I like the way notes are incorporated on the page. I like the punctuation. I like the spelling (&quot;murder&quot; over &quot;murther&quot;, etc.). I like the added lines in &quot;Lear&quot; within square brackets. (The Oxford edition printed the play twice, in its two versions. Bevington's way is better.) I like the front matter, and each play's introduction. I like the footnoted scene divisions. I like the inclusion of &quot;The Two Noble Kinsmen.&quot; I have six complete works, and I rank Bevington's edition number 1."},{"Title":"Complete Works","review":"I really don't see how anybody can give this half-finished junk more than one star. However, I must confess I haven't read it all. In fact, I have only looked up the end of Julius Caesar to compare with a recent production I went to. I was appalled to see several instances where a stage comment appeared as part of Shakespeare's glorious lines. For example, where Brutus commits suicide:BRUTUS. Farewell, good Strato. Runs on his swordCaesar, now be still;.....Even the stupidest, laziest proof reader should have spotted this and at least introduced bracketed italics for the stage instruction - something to make it clear that it is not part of the prose. This type of thing occurs so often with ebooks based on source that is out of copyright that one can only conclude that proof-reading is regarded as an extra. In addition to this type of error, this Shakespeare is very poorly and amateurishly formatted. They don't even bother to ensure that each play begins on a new page!In short, unless you have no aesthetic appreciation for the greatest of literature, avoid this product - it is utterly without merit. It's time the producers of ebooks realised that it is essential to minimise errors in books - they are regularly used as references in course work, for example, and have to be reliable. Anything less is a confidence trick and should invite legal action."},{"Title":"Complete Works","review":"This is the reason I love having Kindle!!! The fact that I can have a huge Shakespeare collection with all of his plays in it and I can carry it around with me and read it anywhere I am is so cool!

I'm really enjoying reading my favorites and these news ones!"},{"Title":"Complete Works","review":"As of late I have seen some pretty strong arguments for reading Shakespeare (even if he really didn't write everything attributed to him). Most of my recent reasons have to do with my teaching high school English.For my sophomores, it is Julius Caesar, and for my seniors, it is Hamlet. Having the need to read along with the students from a second text, I always reach for my Bevington Edition. I like having a second text available, but more importantly, I love having such a comprehensive discussion of Shakepeare at hand each time the moment arises(rare as they are) that a question comes up either during the reading or discussion. The Bevington edition serves me well whenever I teach Shakespeare because I can easily find important information quickly.I also like the fact that the text is modernized in spelling, presented in a clean and legible font, while keeping an academic presentation in mind. For me this simply means I can read it for enjoyment as well as for teaching purposes easily and without any real problems.I also like the way that the plays are organized. with many of the other complete editions I have owned throughout the years, chronological order gets to be a bother.Now, I am no real scholar, but I have acted in several college level and other post-educational setting productions of Shakespeare, and from an actor's point of view the Bevington edition scores well again.If you are deep into scholarly persuits I am certain you can find flaws within the Bevington edition, as could be found by any expert in any edited literary text. However, as far as an all-round, readable, and informative version of the complete works of Shakespeare (or whoever REALLY wrote all the plays etc.) the Bevington edition has my vote as the best one I have yet to see."},{"Title":"Complete Works","review":"This is a complete set of Shakespeare's works including his sonnets.

The fact that after so many hundreds of years, people still relish his work and still find amazing beauty, mystery and wonder in his words shows what a amazing genius he was.I often wonder about today's literature and if it can possibly stand the test of time the way Shakespeare's has. And I seriously doubt it.What I think is most amazing is that whenever a new medium tp publish arrives, Shakespeare is still one of the first writers to be showcased. And rightly so!As for the collection, I can't really fault it. My favorites are there and its really nice that the publisher has collected not only the traditional, but these apocryphal plays.

I was encouraged to buy this edition because of the advertised \\"apocryphal\\" or hard-to-find plays, not sure I had them in my grandmother's hardcover edition of Shakespeare.The problems start with the \\"quick-linking table of contents\\", which is, in fact, almost useless. It refers to each play by the words \\"the end\\" which are printed above the title to signify the conclusion of the previous work, and then proceeds to create an index point for any page where a capitalized heading was found. The play's actual title may or may not also have been indexed. For example, one index point is labeled A COURTEZAN, which happens to be a capitalized stand-alone line in the Dramatis Personae for \\"A Comedy of Errors\\". I started to create a key for the table of contents in a Word document for my own use, but it is almost not worth the trouble.There are various places where headings are printed twice in succession in the text of the play, such as PROLOGUE PROLOGUE for the Prologue of the \\"Life of King Henry V\\". These repeats are not in any hardcover text - why are they in this Kindle edition?I have not been able to read the plays yet because I am so distracted and put off by these flaws that many people might consider minor, but which really detract from the readibility of the text.

I was genuinely shocked by some of the language. But that aside, you can't help but laugh at Alvear's observations of the male psyche. I like the formatting of the book: Questions are bolded; answers are not, making it easier on the eyes. Also, the questions and answers average about 400 words, making it easy on the brain.Although it was clearly not written for women, I was fascinated with the book. Gay men not only own \`the equipment' but spend most of their waking hours trying to figure out how to provide pleasure to other owners of the equipment. So it stands to reason that women have a lot to learn from gay men.My favorite question is the only one in the book from a heterosexual man. He wanted to know if his \\"pretending to be gay to get chicks\\" was ethical. If the question doesn't hit you over the head with the way men think, Alvear's answer will: \\"Unethical?

If this is the case for gay men, I wonder about straight men.\\"\\"Men Are Pigs, But We Love Bacon,\\" is a compilation of Alvear's letters and advice from his advice column, written for gay men.He asserts that he writes this column \\"the way men talk about sex - brutally, with a sense of entitlement, and a breathtaking gift for the gratuitous insult.\\"One of the many hilarious statements that Alvear makes in this book is, \\"We're the only group I know that can make the pursuit of plain old dog-yard scrumping sound like some noble, spiritual quest for a better life. ... Both gay men and straight men are afraid to admit we want to have a much sex with as many people as we can. Where we diverge is in the strategies we use to cover up our inconvenient natures. Straight men pretend they don't really feel that way; gay men admit they feel that way but for righteous reasons.\\"I tested the interest of this topic on both straight men and straight women, by saying things like, \\"Have you heard of the empty toilet paper roll test?\\" And by reading this book in public - the yellow cover with large black letters garnered a great deal of attention.This book intrigues the straight and the gay. Alvear says that gay men are more obsessed with their penis size than straight men. And for those who aren't sure what size \\"sock\\" to use on their penis, Alvear advices sticking it in an empty toilet paper roll - if it doesn't go over the length, the man is not extra large.From the first page to the last, I loudly laughed, and learned a great deal about the psychological and medical issues of men (gay and straight) that despite the in-your-face language used by Alvear, this book is an excellent one for readers from age 18 and up, no matter your persuasion."},{"Title":"Men Are Pigs, But We Love Bacon: Not-So-Straight Answers from America's Most Outrageous Gay Sex Columnist","review":"The book is a collection of sex advice questions the author tackled in a nationally syndicated column.

She moves in with her uncle and aunt. When her uncle died her aunt who really hates her wanted Jane to leave but she promised her husband that she would look after her. Jane ends up having no family to take care of her and to help her trough life. Mrs. Reed (the aunt) sends Jane to boarding school where at first she does not like it. She does not have a lot of friends. She made on friend named Mary Ann who got very sick and had died. Jane spends eight years at this school until she qualifies for a job as a governess to take care of a little girl named Adele. but whil she is there Jane falls in love with the master, Mr. Rochester. when they are about to get married there is a secert that Jane does not know about Mr. Rochester, which ends up spoiling the wedding. Jane is forced to move out of the house where she has no place to go. This book is very interesting and exciting throughout the novel. There are a lot of twist and turns that take place and it keeps you wanting more. I did not like how the book goes into detail about the landscape of the trees and what the weather is like for everyday. Jane is a very sweet orphan girl that keeps on getting lost and will never find her way home. She is passionate about her love. To me it reminds me of two high school kids in love. It's great that she ends up falling in love with theis guy becasue her life was very dull. Her life has no meaning until she meats him. This book is appropriate for the ages 13 and up because if the reader was younger they might lose interest in it. It is a romance novel. A story about a young girl without a fanily. Things change for her when she falls in love with Mr. Rochester. It has a twist to it that is not expected. this book is a thrilling story that will keep you on your toes until the end."},{"Title":"Art For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","review":"Thomas Hoving was an arrogant jerk.

Mind you I said get their feet wet, and not a treatise on art history.I think some of the reviewers of this fun filled introduction to the art world, which I'm sorry to say can be, if your not so inclined, be a somewhat overwhelming journey in the beginning, have sadly missed the point here.This book is not for you or your art students, its for people who may have a passing or for that matter any kind of interest in learning something about art. All they want to do is learn in a very casual way without making any kind of serious commitment. I know, that may sound blasphemous to you the true art lover, but there you have it. This book is a way for a person to start off learning about some fairly basic historical concepts on the who, what, when, where, of art history to see if they even like looking the idea of or even looking at great art.Its soul intention is to give art dummies some fairly basic, rudimentary information on where to find great art, what to look at, why and how it came to be. You want to know more, well there are thousands of scholarly works to choose from to explore newly acquired interests in more depth.Where else can you find something as straightforward and well written if your going to go to, say Rome, and want to know where to go and what to look at with regard to the great master pieces there?

I don't think there are many that would contest the items he lists as masterpieces around the world, yet many fail to go and seek these things out their cultural seeking ventures.He has the credentials not to mention and a mind filled with an entire encyclopedia of art history, knowledge and information for the newbie to get a good start on their path of understanding the wonderful world of art and its magnificent history!In a world where great art takes the back seat to movies, like Avatar, I welcome a book that genuinely helps readers understand and directs them to seek out the wonder, beauty, culture significance, history, and magnificence of the great masterpieces that are available to those willing to invest the time and energy.

Unfortunately this book is not really helping. The descriptions are all over the place - for each art style or era or artist, he highlights selected works, maybe two or three, as good examples - but rarely shows a photo of what he is describing, and when he does the b/w photos are uselessly small and grainy. It is not helpful to me to say, for example, that the two most important examples of Uppity-Up style can be found in Turkey and Egypt - and then not show the photo of them. When will I ever get to see those? It's a big deal for us to go to London! Forget the Nile! Rather, I'd love to have a listing of more accessible examples, with references to the best but inaccessible pieces in case I'm a real globe trotter.Another gripe - he spends a great deal of time early in the book telling us that the stereotypes of art are false - it's not pretentious, it's not accessible only to the rich, it's not hard to get the \\"meaning\\" from a piece, etc. Then the rest of the book is written in a very dry, scholarly style. He tells us we have to travel all over the place to see the best stuff. He also seems to brag about the pieces of art that he has had access to that most people in the world will never be able to see. What's the use of that? If that's not pretentious, I don't know what is.This book is not scratching my itch, and certainly is not helping me find ways to educate my (bored with art) teenagers."},{"Title":"Art For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","review":"The text of this book is extremely informative, focusing on great works, and great museums, mostly in the West. Mr. Hoving's enthusiasm for art, and the great masterpieces, is infectious. The book is limited, however, by too few, and inadequate pictures. There are two full color sections, and small B&amp;W pictures throughout, but many of the pieces he describes are not shown. I guess that fully illustrating the book would be expensive, but it is difficult, even for Mr. Hoving, to adequately describe a masterpiece with words alone. He has met his goal, however, by introducing the reader to the various &quot;isms&quot;, and stimulating one's curiosity.

Granted the subject is broad, but the book hardly scratches the surface. In the first chapters we are instructed to expose ourselves to as much art as we can -- daily, if possible. Here the author does a good job of de-mystifying art history for the layperson.Unfortunately the remaining chapters add little or nothing to this. Readers are treated to extremely terse descriptions of the art of different periods and the history behind it. Instead of providing a more thorough historical context, the author instead wastes our time with stories of his triumphs during his time as curator.As others have noted, the lack of images in this book is its greatest weakness. Despite the fact that I can go online and find images of the works the author describes, I soon grew tired of entering names into Google image search. Why not just place an image on the page? Even a small black-and-white image is better than nothing at all.I can't imagine an appropriate audience for this book. I expect it would be extremely confusing for complete novices. For people like me who can spot a Chagall or a Klimt, but who lack formal art history education, the book comes across as vacuous.Sadly, I'm still on the lookout for a decent introduction to art history that won't put me to sleep."},{"Title":"Art For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","review":"I have to say this book is well written and easy to read.

Or worse, no photo at all.But, even without the pictures, its a very educational book and has got me wanting to hit the art museums again.

You will also learn a lot of tidbits about art history, and about all of art's major players (e.g. Raphael, Hugo, Picasso). He even teaches you how to select art to start your own collection!I'd still say that the best way to learn to critique art, is to go to a museum with a friend/parent that knows their stuff, and just have them \\"think outloud\\" when they are viewing the paintings. You do eventually want to go from: \\"Wow that painting of that lady is pretty,\\" to \\"by giving her a coy look coupled with a slight smirk, the artist was clearly trying to convey the 'I know you want me, but you can just keep dreaming,' attitude.\\" ;) And that kind of critical thinking is a skill that can be acquired with lots of real world practice--which no book will be able to provide you with.Note: I had to lower my review slightly after reading about the errors pointed out by the professors.

That's what I've told my Art History students for years. However, IDG Books is aggressively marketing this manual for use as a college textbook or a supplemental reading assignment, and the thought of putting it into the hands of undergraduates, especially intro.-level students, makes my blood run cold. A number of reviewers have commented on the lack of adequate illustrations. I might add that not only are they few, grainy, and postage-stamp size, but a lot of them are printed backward. What really bothers me, though, is the number of careless errors in the text. I'm not talking here about matters of opinion or interpretation, but of documented fact. On Page 5, there is a section with the heading &quot;The Temple of Apollo at Olympia.&quot; The temple at Olympia was dedicated to Zeus, not Apollo, although Apollo appears on the sculptural decoration of the pediment. There's a really important difference in Greek religion between the supreme god of Olympus and one of his sons! And on page 48, we learn that &quot; . . . while the Parthenon was being completed, other grandiose artistic achievements were happening. One was the invention of lost-wax bronze casting . . . The sculptor Polykleitos is probably responsible for this method . . . &quot; BULLS**T! Greek historians credit the invention of lost-wax casting to two craftsmen on the island of Samos who lived at least a century earlier than Polykleitos, but Egyptians and Mesopotamians had mastered this technique even earlier. One thing's for sure: competently cast life-sized bronze statues existed in the Greek world long before ground was even broken for the Parthenon, because the Charioteer of Delphi (illustrated by Hoving on page 42! ) can be dated by the evidence of an inscription to 470 or earlier. Polykleitos benefitted from at least a century of workshop tradition in bronze-casting. He was a great and innovative artist, but his influence lay in his system of proportions and treatment of the body in motion, not in casting technology. Now, admittedly, ancient art is not Hoving's field, but shouldn't he at least have asked colleagues in other areas to review his chapters for him when he ventured outside his own area? And shouldn't he have done a little fact-checking for himself? I can just imagine the frustrating conversations in store for any professor who assigns this to college students: &quot;Professor, you made a mistake! It isn't the temple of Zeus at Olympia, it's the temple of Apollo. It says so right here in the book.&quot; Students tend to trust what they see in print over what they hear in lectures. I have nothing against the concept of a breezy, informal book about art that avoids a pretentious tone or specialized jargon. But a handbook on art can't be slapped together quickly in the way that a manual for a computer-program can. &quot;WordPerfect 8 for Dummies&quot; will be obsolete as soon as the next upgrade comes out (maybe it already is?), but if the Dummies series is going to venture into other areas, they should give their contributors the time and editorial assistance to do it right."},{"Title":"Art For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","review":"Reading &quot;Art for Dummies&quot; was an exciting experience but also so frustrating that on occasion I almost sent the book flying towards the wall. On the plus side: chronological layout, even-handed treatment of different periods and techniques, and Mr. Hoving's obvious and infectious love of art.Which leads us into the central irony of the book. Mr. Hoving describes many art works much better than we can see them. Nothing is so frustrating as to have him rhapsodize about an art work which is rendered in postage-stamp-sized black and white in the book, its salient features almost invisible, even under my Bausch &amp; Lomb magnifying glass. This happened far more than it ought to (once would have been too much, of course). The book was limited in its use of color plates and the black-and-white reproductions tended to be small, small, small.The &quot;For Dummies&quot; folks should have upped the retail price another ten bucks and put in some serious color plating or perhaps done a multi-volume work: &quot;Impressionism for Dummies,&quot; &quot;Modern Art for Dummies,&quot; you get the idea.

Hoving tells us to 'saturate' ourselves in art by visiting museums and looking at lots and lots of art; that way he says you can develop your eye for the good stuff, and trust that you will indeed recognize the good stuff when you see it.Unfortunately (but understandably because this is meant to be an inexpensive, accessible introductory book), there are many many descriptions of important works through the ages, but only a very few color plates that illustrate them, and a few more black and white photographs.It's a bit hard to 'saturate' yourself in a piece of art based on a description in words - you know what they say: a picture is worth a thousand words! However, there's a simple and enjoyable remedy. I recommend that you buy the glorious, lush History of Art (5th edition, revised)by Janson, and use that as a companion piece while reading Hoving's Art for Dummies. Many of the works (and just about all of the artists) mentioned by Hoving are represented in the Janson book, which is full of color plates.

I agree. But the Dummies book was never intended to be a &quot;coffee-table&quot; art book. One solution is to get Sister Wendy's 1000 Masterpieces (which illustrates almost every painting Hoving mentions.) This way you get the professional &quot;insider&quot; take from Hoving, the wonderful excited amateur take from Sister Wendy and a whole bunch of illustrations.

I don't like the title, and I wish it had a bibliography, for instance. Hoving's selection isn't mine, but he includes more than I would have thought possible, and he writes with clarity and enthusiasm. Though nothing substitutes for the real thing, as Hoving makes clear throughout, I like his choice of color illustrations, and the black and white illustrations are useful reference points. Most refreshing are his enthusiasm, and his willingness to express his preferences.I bought this book for the around the world guide to museums, with the mini-reviews and mini-summaries of what is where. Most guides to the art places of the world are dull as dishwater. This one looks like a perfect 2 carat gem: small, but clear and scintillating.Well written, well organized, and far more than a guide to the museums of the world. I expect it to make a handy reference to areas of the art world I am less familiar with. It is on the bookshelf in my studio. One could pack around many weightier tomes, and come up with far less."},{"Title":"Art For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","review":"Being a lover of the &quot;for Dummies&quot; books, and having nothing but praise for there Classical Music for Dummies and Wine for Dummies, it pains me to give this book only 3 stars (and even considered rating it at 2 stars). In the first few chapters the author stresses that you must look, look, and look more at art to understand and enjoy. The problem is that the book has far to few color and small black and white photos to keep you interested. It is mostly text with several references to artworks you cannot see! I understand the expense involved in producing a book this cheap with more color photos, and the book falls victim to it. I have found a way to enjoy the book more though... I would recommend that if you purchase this book I would also purchase the book titled &quot;Art Across Time by Laurie Schneider Adams&quot;. &quot;Art Across Time&quot; is more expensive (about $80), but is well worth the price for all the outstanding photos and maps that &quot;Art for Dummies&quot; is missing. The text portions of Art for Dummies is short and concise, so it makes for a quick read, and does provide other useful information, but without more photos I found myself quickly losing interest after about the first five or six chapters. With &quot;Art Across Time&quot; in hand I have found the for Dummies book more enjoyable!"},{"Title":"Art For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","review":"As a successful writer and former director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the author is guaranteed a large attentive audience. What a tragically missed opportunity then, as the result looks, feels and reads as if it were tossed together, less interesting and less persuasive than a second-rate art appreciation text. This is precisely what a \\"dummy\\" doesn't need. One wonders how Andrew Wyeth, who wrote the foreword, feels about having his name on it now. (Copyright by Roy R.

Everyone else has already complained about the lack of decent pictures, and they are right: for a book about art, there's an awful lot of black and white text and cheaply drawn cartoons without showing us the good stuff. Faced with just reading the material without looking at the art, I found myself to be immensely bored. All too often, Tom strays from the topic to relate yet another anecdote about his travels and adventures in the art world. Furthermore, Tom's constant name dropping gave the whole book a tone of the arrogance and snobbery that Tom claims alienates so many people from exploring the art world. A lot of time is spent on preparing people for the &quot;way&quot; to visit an art museum, which is fine, but I want to have something of an understanding of the material so I know what to look for when I'm at the museum. I didn't get that from this book. If you want a really excellent introductory book to art, try Sister Wendy's Story of Painting. It's everything this book is not -- it has tons of beautiful pictures, and great, understandable text that never strays from explaining the art itself. Even better, get Sister Wendy's 1001 Masterpieces to go along with it -- it's a great way to enter the world of art."},{"Title":"Writer's Handbook of FAQs","review":"FAQ stands for &quot;Frequently Asked Questions&quot;.

Angel was a beautiful, silver-eyed waif; a seventeen-year-old girl whose gamine graces charmed London society. But now she was the ward of Matthew Vail, the dashing hero of the French campaign. He had impulsively rescued her from the evil intentions of his black-hearted cousin Martin--but what was he to do with a seventeen-year-old girl to look after?For her part, Angel adored Matt. But to win him, she had to seduce him from the worship of his long dead sweetheart and his very live mistress...This blurb just did not do justice to the book. The story of this book was way complicated: more twist and turns of the plot, more inner emotional struggles, dilemma on the personal choices, obligation of the debt,...etc. It had a lot of information and developments, but it was not disorganized. Ms. McCulloch did a very good job on presenting interesting characters with individual feelings which made them very human-like. In addition, the narrative of the book was informative, the writing descriptive, and its dialogue crisp--I felt I was reading a good script--Everything was so alive. And from back of the book \\"About the author\\", some of Ms. McCulloch's background has been in drama school, writer, along with few other experiences. It was apparent that she has channeled some of her training into this book.I also liked a lot of the second characters, and double-dimensions of the characters and issues that promote some thinking even after done with the reading. I only wish the author could have explained more about what is going to happen to the Deverell estate, and what is to be done with Matt's mistress.

Consequently, by expanding Marx's concept of the mode of production, and through insightful analyses of history, art, film, music, and architecture Jameson provides an insight into the value of Marxism for what Wendy Brown (and others) have called these postmodern times."},{"Title":"The Jameson Reader (Blackwell Readers)","review":"Fredric Jameson (b. 1934) is one of the most influential and original thinkers of our time. He first began to publish important work in the 1960s. After earning a Ph.D. in French literature at Yale in 1959, Jameson revised his dissertation and published it as \\"Sartre: The Origins of a Style,\\" a book which is still one of the finest examinations of its subject.Throughout the Sixties, Jameson read deeply in Marxist literature, from Mehring and Plekhanov to Adorno, Lukacs, and Sartre, and his extensive research and immersion in Marxism resulted in 1971's seminal \\"Marxism and Form,\\" a landmark in Marxist criticism and an unsurpassed dialectical survey of the 20th century's most important communist writings. With this book, Jameson established himself as the foremost Marxist critic of his time, rivalled only by Terry Eagleton, whose approaches to criticism and the dialectic are highly disparate from Jameson's.Jameson's interests and expertise are catholic, and his prose style, so often referred to as \\"difficult\\" or \\"impenetrable,\\" has always struck me with its elegance, precision, and singularity. No one else writes sentences like him, and no other critic's prose offers as much sheer aesthetic pleasure. In his criticism, Jameson's allusions and insights are always profound and original. His powers of associative and lateral thinking are unique. Whatever his subject, from critiquing a Balzac novel to limning \\"The Godfather,\\" Jameson's approach is resolutely Marxist and his dialectic fluid and densely erudite.\\"The Jameson Reader\\" offers readers an excellent introduction to the world of Jameson's thought, with essays ranging from the state of Marxist criticism in modern academe to \\"narrative as a socially symbolic act.\\" His groundbreaking examinations of postmodernism are included as well. The introduction and commentary by the editors are superb throughout.Anyone seeking familiarity with the work of Fredric Jameson should start with \\"The Jameson Reader.\\" No one looks at our modern world with a more penetrating gaze, and if any modern critic's work will last, it is his."},{"Title":"Mary's Land","review":"I am an avid reader of historical biographies both fictional and non fictional.

SHEILA BISHOP's No Hint of Scandal is one of them. The book is set in the country, the major characters are three brothers, Richard, lord of the manor, and now a widower, Theo vicar of the parish, and Verney the younger brother who has not been quite as respectable as Louisa, Theo's wife might wish. The plot twists back and forth. Even some interesting attempts at blackmail.From the back of the book....No scandal has cast a shadow over the Capel family for at least three generations.

Harriet ventures into the fray and makes some astonishing discoveries..."},{"Title":"No Hint Of Scandal","review":"This is a fairly short book, which means some limitations in character development. However, Ms. Bishop manages to pack a great deal of both plot and suspense into this short space. The strong points are watching the main character evolve from a gauche girl to a young woman whose dreams are beginning to come true; and a story that keeps you engaged and guessing. I read almost all in a single sitting, though I didn't intend to.The one negative point is that the book was written when the double standard for men and women was alive and well, and it forms one of the central points of the story. The unfairness of it kept me gritting my teeth. Other than that I enjoyed it, although the character of the Vicar's wife is perhaps a little overdrawn."},{"Title":"Sharra's Exile: A Darkover Novel","review":"One of the earliest novels to appear in Marion Zimmer Bradley's \\"Darkover\\" universe was \\"Sword of Aldones\\"; this novel was written before Bradley truly learned her craft. Later, she wrote the prequel to it, \\"Heritage of Hasteur\\". Eventually, she came back to the original story concept, and completely reworked it. This book is the result of that reworking, which she refused to call a \\"rewriting\\" because the changes were more extensive than that. Here is what she had to say on the subject in an introductory note:\\"Like all previous Darkover novels, this story is complete in itself and does not depend on knowledge of any other. More than any other Darkover novel, however, this one was written by popular demand.One result of writing novels as they occurred to me, instead of following strict chronological order, was that I began with an attempt to solve the final problems of the society; each novel thus suggested one laid in an earlier time, in an attempt to explain how the society had reached that point. Unfortunately, that meant that relatively mature novels, early in the chronology of Darkover, were followed by books written when I was much younger and relatively less skilled at storytelling; and of all these, the least satisfactory was \\"The Sword of Aldones\\", perhaps because this book was, in essence, dreamed up at the age of fifteen.In 1975 I made a landmark decision; that in writing \\"The Heritage of Hasteur\\", I would not be locked into the basically immature concepts set forth in \\"Sword\\", even at the sacrifice of consistency in the series. After \\"Heritage\\" appeared in print, \\"Sword of Aldones\\" seemed even less satisfactory -- for years, it seemed that everyone I met asked me when I was going to rewrite it. For years I replied \\"Never,\\" or \\"I don't want to go back to it.\\" But I finally decided that I had, in \\"Sword of Aldones\\", developed a basically good idea, without the skill or maturity to handle it as well as it deserved; and that the characters deserved serious treatment by a matured writer. I decided not to rewrite, but to write an entirely new book based on events in the same time frame as \\"Sword\\". The present book is the result.\\"This book is, in fact, one of Bradley's many fine Darkover novels. I highly recommend it. I do NOT recommend reading \\"Sword of Aldones\\", unless it is as a curiosity after having read this one, to see what the differences are, and to see for yourself how much of a difference twenty years of writing experience (give or take) will make to a writer."},{"Title":"Sharra's Exile: A Darkover Novel","review":"Like The Heritage of Hastur, Sharra's Exile is told in chapters that alternate between the first-person narrative of Lew Alton, and the third-person focus on other characters (Diotima Ridenow and Regis Hastur, in particular). It takes up where the previous book left off, where struggles between birth family and chosen family are concerned. On a larger scale, there is also the battle between those who want to preserve the traditional culture of Darkover &quot;by any means necessary&quot; (including use of the Sharra Matrix, which is definitely against the Compact), and those who wish to become part of the Terran Empire.The central characters become caught up in this struggle, while also dealing with the conflicting loyalties in their personal lives. Regis Hastur has to face his grandfather's disapproval of his lover Danilo, Lew Alton is haunted by the last words of his dead father, and Diotima Ridenow has to sort through her feelings for Lew when their marriage ends in disaster following the premature birth of their horribly deformed son.Those who were touched by the madness of the Sharra Circle are drawn back to it, and the attempts to harness Sharra's power could easily spell disaster for Darkover."},{"Title":"Sharra's Exile: A Darkover Novel","review":"This Darkover novel written by Marion Zimmer Bradley begins a couple of years after the events of The Heritage of Hastur. Lew Alton, now somewhat disfigured because of his use of the Sharra Matrix, is recovering offworld with his father and is a bitter young man. Everything that he cared about was taken from him, including his wife and unborn child, and he is partially responsible for the destruction of a city by the Sharra Matrix. The Sharra Matrix is a focus for incredible and ancient power and has been used as a nearly uncontrollable weapon in the past. Lew is one of the handful of men and women who rediscovered the matrix and through betrayals sought to use it, though with one final betrayal he helped to stop the destruction. Sharra's Exile covers several years that Lew spent off world in possession of the Matrix (he is so strongly linked to the Matrix that if he gets too far from it he may die), and then covers the events that follows his return to Darkover carrying the forbidden Matrix.Sharra's Exile is told in alternating chapters between the first person perspective of Lew Alton and the third person perspective dealing with other characters, mostly Regis Hastur. This is a novel rife with conflict. Lew is emotionally a wreck and has a very difficult time controlling his emotions after the Sharra incident and because he is a telepath in a caste of telepaths, he is unintentionally broadcasting his pain to anyone nearby. Lew is also half Terran, so there are some in the Comyn ruling class who look down on Lew and his family even though he is the heir to his family's Domain. This is another conflict. Yet another has to do with the Sharra Matrix. In the Regis chapters there are conflicts regarding his views about Terran Culture and that Regis is far more progressive than his grandfather as well as most of the Comyn.Sharra's Exile is a complete rewrite of one of Bradley's earliest novels The Sword of Aldones and while I haven't read that first book I thought this was a very solid entry into the Darkover Chronology. Bradley has multiple conflicts and plot points going and there is plenty of intrigue and even some action. The novel flows well and because of all of the conflict, Darkover is a conflicted society, there was plenty to hold my interest as she moved the primary story along of the re-emergence and fear of the Sharra Matrix. There is a bit of absurdity (The Sword of Aldones, the Terran woman) and Bradley has recycled a couple of story techniques she has used in the past but this time it is more dues ex machina than necessary plotting, but overall Sharra's Exile is a good Darkover story and an entertaining read. That's all I really ask for out of a book.-Joe Sherry"},{"Title":"Sharra's Exile: A Darkover Novel","review":"An outstanding expedition into the power of emotions and the internal struggles faced by Lew Alton in returning home to his native Darkover. The author has &quot;tidied up&quot; a number of time lines from the original publication. However, I found the original to be both more enjoyable and imaginative. While the reader can understand the desire of Ms. Bradley to have her work reflect a more mature self, the naivete of Lew and Marjorie is exchanged for a less dedsirable physical lust. While both versions entertain, and are excellent presentations of the Darkover venue, the original holds a special place in my childhood memories."},{"Title":"Uncovered: The Hidden Art Of The Girlie Pulp","review":"As the author of this book, I thought I'd post a brief description of it here. UNCOVERED contains over 400 pulp cover reproductions, all in full color. In addition, the history of these magazines -- their publishers, artists, writers and their struggle to survive -- is examined in 30,000 words of text, covering titles such as SPICY ADVENTURE STORIES, SAUCY MOVIE TALES, GAY PARISIENNE, VICE SQUAD DETECTIVE, LA PAREE STORIES, PARIS NIGHTS, SCARLET ADVENTURESS, SNAPPY DETECTIVE MYSTERIES and many others. Although there were many players in the field, during the 1930's it was dominated by the magazines of Harry Donenfeld, who would later go on to greater success with the company that eventually became DC Comics. Over 100 different titles (many very rare) are pictured, by 50 different artists -- among those artists heavily represented in the book are H.J. Ward, Earle Bergey, H.L. Parkhurst, Enoch Bolles, Peter Driben, Norman Saunders and George Quintana. Others whose work is reproduced include Gene Pressler, Zoe Mozert, Charles Wrenn, Worth Carnahan, Jack Greiner, Allen Anderson, R.A. Burley, Fred Craft, Archie Gunn, Cardwell Higgins, Seymour Marcus and Joseph Sokoli. Unlike the later pin-up magazine cover art of the 1940's and 1950's, most of this art has never been reprinted and has been hidden since its original publication. In choosing images for reproduction, I made an effort to try and avoid duplication of covers reproduced in other pulp histories. Each image was carefully scanned and cleaned, for the best reproduction possible.I tried to do as much research as possible using period sources, such as the writer's magazines and newspapers of the time, and various books published by censorship groups. In the process, I've corrected some errors that had crept into previous pulp histories. Unlike most books of its kind, UNCOVERED is fully footnoted and indexed.It examines in depth their war with censorship groups (particularly in New York City) which sought to shut them down, and which were often successful in causing these magazines to be banned from the newsstands and, in some instances, seized by the police as indecent and burned. These groups were ultimately successful, and though the girlie pulps burned bright for awhile, by 1940 their flame had all but been extinguished. Sold \\"under the counter\\" when first published, their art and story has remained hidden from then until now.Though focused on the risque pulps of the day, I think that almost any fan of the pulps will find much of interest in reading UNCOVERED, as many of the publishers, writers and artists crossed over into \\"traditional\\" pulps as well. The tale of how some spicy pulp publishers continually changed company names in an effort to stiff their authors on overdue payments is, for example, also typical of some of the more mainstream pulp publishers. And contrary to popular belief, other spicy titles actually were at the top of the pulp food chain in payment rates. The spicy pulps were only one segment of the larger pulp industry that supplied reading material for a significant portion of the population during the 1920's and 1930's, but their heretofore untold story is intertwined with that of this larger industry."},{"Title":"Uncovered: The Hidden Art Of The Girlie Pulp","review":"UNCOVERED is the kind of book that revives that old line people used to use with PLAYBOY magazine: \\"I don't know about you, but I just buy it for the writing.\\" In fact, UNCOVERED is a perfect balance of pulp-magazine scholarship and wild pin-up style cover illustrations, impeccably reproduced in full color.I've been following Douglas Ellis' work for quite a long time now, and it's always been first class. With this one, he's achieved the perfect balance of art and story, sharing the history of the '30s girlie fiction magazines and their creators with a breeziness that belies what must've been an incredible amount of research, and sharing also some of the rarest and most appealing pulp covers I've ever seen.You don't have to know anything about pulp magazines to enjoy UNCOVERED. Anyone who enjoys classic pinup art or weird American pop culture will find this opulent book to be a great addition to his or her home library as well. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Uncovered: The Hidden Art Of The Girlie Pulp","review":"Compiled by Douglas Ellis and an enthusiastically recommended addition to personal and academic American Popular History reference collections, Uncovered: The Hidden Art Of The Girlie Pulps is a risque presentation of the erotic art of the &quot;girlie pulp magazines&quot; the were published in the 1920's and 1930's. The predecessors to the &quot;girly magazines&quot; of today, some of these pulp magazine titles were so racy (according to the standards of the time) that they were seized in police raids. The informatively presented story of these magazines (printed and marketed simply because sex sells), is enhanced with an extensive gallery selection of full-color pin-up images and is what distinguishes Uncovered: The Hidden Art Of The Girlie Pulps as a unique book of erotica images that pushed the envelope of social mores of their era."},{"Title":"Uncovered: The Hidden Art Of The Girlie Pulp","review":"This is an outstanding anthology of cover art from the depression-era &quot;girlie pulps&quot; by such highly worthy (and undeservedly obscure) artists as H.J. Ward, Norm Saunders, and Enoch Bolles, among many others. To the best of my knowledge there's no other great source of their work in print (especially Bolles), but they're very well served here, and very little of the work seen here is reprinted elsewhere. The text is diligent, thorough, well-written, and interesting, covering the rise and fall of the magazine niche-industry that produced these amazing visual works; it is scholarly and will be of great interest and service to students of the subject, but the broader appeal- pun intended- is in the more than four hundred color images. These are beautifully reproduced at a generous size, and on slick, high quality pages. The overall design of the book is also excellent.I'd like to see another volume, perhaps including some of the interior art, if it's worth seeing. I've also been waiting for years for someone to do &quot;The Art Of Enoch Bolles&quot;- how about it, Mr. Ellis?The author's review below is very informative and interesting, with much more information about this worthy book."},{"Title":"Uncovered: The Hidden Art Of The Girlie Pulp","review":"I absolutely love this book. It a clear favorite in my collection of Pulp and Pin-Up art!"},{"Title":"Uncovered: The Hidden Art Of The Girlie Pulp","review":"This is a great book detailing early girlie pulps.

If you are into pulp or pin up art this is a must buy."},{"Title":"Seasoned by Salt: A Voyage in Search of the Caribbean","review":"I have just finished the wonderfully wriltten book, Seasoned by Salt, by Jerry Mashaw and Anne McClintock. The flowing narrative will make you feel as though you are right in the cockpit with them, immersed in all the experiences that crossing on the open seas offers up. Though it is not a tutorial on cruising, this book is a must read for anyone who is contemplating sailing to the Caribbean. It is full of valuable information on what one could expect from bule water and island sailing. Sprinkled with humor, it is a fast read. But what was unexpeded was the depth of research done by Jerry Mashaw into the social economic and political history of the coastal towns along the Eastern Seaboard and islands they explored. The extent of his research is rarely found in books of travel. But Mr. Meshaw seems careful not to bog down this book of adventure with too much intellectualizing. Lastly, I found Seasoned by Salt an inspiring love story of two intelligent people finding new levels of understanding that will certainly carry them though many future voyages. I only hope they will put them to paper so we can share in their adventures once again."},{"Title":"Seasoned by Salt: A Voyage in Search of the Caribbean","review":"Part escapist adventure and part historical journey to the Caribbean, Seasoned by Salt tells the tale of a couple who took a year off from their careers to sail the Caribbean. It's a well written yarn, and Mashaw does an excellent job of blending the history of the islands into the contemporary account of his voyage in a way that puts current events into historical perspective. A great added bonus are Anne MacClintock's Passage Notes. She provides a more personal view of the journey, and an occasional counter-point to Mashaw's narrative. - Joe"},{"Title":"Seasoned by Salt: A Voyage in Search of the Caribbean","review":"I admit I am a resident of the South - Alabama to be exact. But when I purchased this book, I sincerely wanted to read a story about sailing for a year in the Bahamas. Sadly, this book is more about a spoiled couple that spends about 25% of the time telling you how scared they are about every aspect of the trip and 50% of the time criticizing the social conditions of the \\"South\\" as they travel down the ICW on the East Coast. The other 25% of the time is spent talking about random ideas with a few sentences of the sailing trip they are supposedly on. By page 70 I was tired of their liberal slant on a part of the US they claim to be \\"from\\". Message to the author, I live in Birmingham. Rosa Parks made her heroic stand against racial injustice in Montgomery. Simple facts like this seem to be trivial to the authors who are more concerned with expressing their overall disgust with a South that has seemingly not changed much since the days of slavery. Well, I certainly wouldn't say everything is perfect here, but as the authors admit, nowhere is perfect. The Southeast is one of the fastest growing regions for economical development and changes are taking place. Birmingham does boast to be the birth place for Civil Rights and we have an excellent Civil Rights museum that I have taken the time to actually visit to learn of the past injustices with the hope that I will be part of a better place for all. I resent being lectured to by the main author who evidently loves his teaching job. And if he does want to lecture this Southerner, I would expect him to take time to at least learn some of the more major details of the Civil Rights movement.Very little sailing story. Lots of liberal opinions spewed forth as though they were facts when even his facts are wrong. If you want to read about a sailing story....buy Sailing the Dream. I am going to return my copy of this book to the author. I may even take a red pen and mark all of his errors. I would give him a grade of \\"F\\" if I were his professor."},{"Title":"Seasoned by Salt: A Voyage in Search of the Caribbean","review":"The old adage, cruising is fixing your boat in exotic places, certainly applies here. The book is very well written, and the interplay of hearing two sides (husband and wife) about the same events adds depth. After reading the book, I think that flying to Grenada, chartering a boat for a month (ooh the hated charterer) and exploring that area was the highlight of their journey, would be better than all the time and discomfort they experiences getting from Connecticut to the Carribean.I tended to skip the social commentary. Can't change what happened, can only address how to help improve what is there now."},{"Title":"Seasoned by Salt: A Voyage in Search of the Caribbean","review":"For those of us who have only played at sailing, a cruise from Connecticut to a southernmost point of Grenada aboard a 36 foot boat represents the zenith of sailing experience among us &quot;regular sailors.&quot; But, in fact, the story shared by Mashaw and MacClintock is anything but &quot;regular&quot;. That these two, even though sharing an educated view of the world and a love of the sea, are able to, not just endure the confines and discomfort of a small boat on the high seas or in crowded harbors, but to find the joy in them and in each other is a remarkable and revitalizing story of what life can be - and should be. The sailing story is exquisite; the life story is more than that!"},{"Title":"Seasoned by Salt: A Voyage in Search of the Caribbean","review":"I liked this book. It was fairly informative and gave some great tips. I like the different viewpoints of the two authors. I did think that some of the historical information tended to drag on a little and you can definitely pick up on the political views of the author but it was still a good read... It really reinforced my desire to go cruising!"},{"Title":"Seasoned by Salt: A Voyage in Search of the Caribbean","review":"There are two books in Seasoned by Salt - Jerry's book and Anne' book. Each one contributes to the overall experience of sailing the dream that many of us have. Being an academic, Jerry's book sometimes flounders in invisible footnotes that divert our enthusiasm from the adventure at hand. We are, at times, forced to navigate the geopolitical contours of the Caribbean rather than feeling the trade winds in our sails and finding the right words to make this experience come alive for the reader. Anne's book is more immediate, touching emotions that describe the event allowing us to view the journey through intimate eyes. I would trade hearing more from Anne and less from Jerry's lecture prone prose of \\"The Politics of the Caribbean\\"."},{"Title":"Seasoned by Salt: A Voyage in Search of the Caribbean","review":"Who among us has not dreamed about an idyllic life sailing in paradise: sun, snorkeling, azure blue waters, and tropical refreshments in hand? After sailing for years including frequent charters in the Caribbean, Jerry Mashew and Anne MacClintock set sail from Connecticut to Grenada on a 10-month adventure.Chronicling a sabbatical cruise is not new; Joshua Slocum first published his story more than 100 years ago. Before that there was Homer's Odyssey. What sets the authors' story apart? Why take the time to read it?For those contemplating a similar voyage, Seasoned by Salt presents a realistic portrayal of life at sea and anchor. Cruising is more than gorgeous sunsets viewed from a cockpit with an \\"umbrella drink\\" in hand. It is also about the people and cultures visited, broken boats, seasick crew, and unsettled weather. Other works often gloss over these unpleasantries. Anne and Jerry do not hide the raw truth about cruising on a small sailboat. It can be tough unpleasant work.As their story unfolds, Anne and Jerry bring forth their experiences and place them in an historical context. Beyond the crescent beaches, swaying palm tree, and mangroves there is an unsettling history. As Mashew presents this history we get to understand and know him, his beliefs, and biases.From time to time, Mashew's wife MacClintlock provides a counterpoint to his narrative. While Jerry's approach is often academic (he is a Yale Law Professor), Anne approaches the cruise from an artist's perspective, focusing on the emotional experience of cruising. Together a more complete picture of the lifestyle unfolds.Will Seasoned by Salt convince you to go cruising? No, but reading it is time well spent if you are curious or contemplating a similar adventure.Dave LochnerNauticalreads"},{"Title":"Seasoned by Salt: A Voyage in Search of the Caribbean","review":"This is a good read. The adventure is unpacked by the author, Jerry Mashaw in a very engaging way with a lot of information about the varous places they encounter along the way down the east coast of the US and into the Caribbean. A good deal of history and insight into the sorted history of the slave trade and economic struggles that are the reality of much of the caribbean. The story is further enhanced by Jerry's partner and crew, Anne MacClintoc with journal enteries interspersed throughout.The authors capture the anticipation, excitement, and even fear very well and draw you into their world. I truly felt like I shared their adventure. I considered this along the lines of Ann Vanderhoof's \\"Embarrassement of Mangos' Anchor Canada, a division of Random House Publishers - which is a must read if you're into sailing adventures!"},{"Title":"Seasoned by Salt: A Voyage in Search of the Caribbean","review":"You don't have to be a sailor or a Caribbean devotee to be excited about this book. If you've ever taken a trip in an RV, lived in a cramped apartment, or been somewhere remote requiring living on your wits, you will be sympatico with this story about adventure, love and what's really important in life.

Having read many such books, Seasoned by Salt especially touched me, as this couple with seemingly no appreciable offshore sailing experience took off from Connecticut, all the way to the southernmost Caribbean on a several-month journey. From page one, I was hooked, as I entered their colorful and wonderfully well-written adventure of successfully overcoming uncertainties (Will any equipment fail? Will we get used to the large ocean waves?) - and vicariously living their experience of turquoise waters, beautiful islands, and the deep camaraderie that runs through the offshore sailing community. Whether you dream of sailing of into the sunset one day, yourself, or simply love a great a book about someone who achieves such a dream, Seasoned by Salt is a definite 5-star read!"},{"Title":"Seasoned by Salt: A Voyage in Search of the Caribbean","review":"I enjoyed this book immensely.As I have only known Anne professionally by working with her in corporate life, it was very rewarding to gain an additional perspective about her as a person and as part of her life's team (Jerry &amp; Anne) by reading this wonderful story. It was also very educational to learn of this couple's preparation for such an undertaking and then to read of the experience almost hour by hour as they lived it. I have to say that the passage to Bermuda and on to the BVI's was exceptional.I also enjoyed Jerry's perspective when he included the background on Caribbean history and that area's relationship to America's struggle for freedom in breaking away from England. It was refreshing to learn more about the culture of the islands by Anne &amp; Jerry's exploration &amp; invesigation of the current political and economic conditions of the islands and the people. The passages concerning their encounters with customs &amp; immigration were hilarious.In many ways I was sorry that they only got to spend 10 months on this portion of life's journey in the Caribbean. Who knows maybe they will have a sequel."},{"Title":"Seasoned by Salt: A Voyage in Search of the Caribbean","review":"This book and story is not just for sailors, but for anyone who loves life and wants to live it to its fullest. What better way would there be to learn what life has to offer, and how to respond to its challenges and opportunities, than to set off in a sailboat, into strange waters (the ocean, no less), with only your spouse on board (yikes!). As the authors' adventure unfolds, you become completely engaged with them and their boat, the other cruisers they meet, their family, and the coves and ports and islands (and the bars, too) they pass through. Their yarns are laugh-out-loud, tears-down-the-cheeks, just-plain-funny. And also heart-warming, choke-you-up-with-tears, and totally-revealing-and-exposed. Along the way, you get insights into such topics as the legal profession, the history of slavery, the economics of the marine industry and the Caribbean, hurricanes and weather, family dynamics, spousal dynamics, emergency medicine, ocean and coastal navigation, marine life, and temperamental machinery. Then there is the glorious sailing and being completely one with your boat, the water and your partner. This is the Zen of ocean cruising. This is the Zen of life. You have to read this book. I will again, and soon."},{"Title":"Seasoned by Salt: A Voyage in Search of the Caribbean","review":"SEASONED BY SALT is beautifully written, fun to read, exciting, throught-provoking and well-illustrated.

An absolutely stunning piece of writing"},{"Title":"Seasoned by Salt: A Voyage in Search of the Caribbean","review":"Jerry Mashaw, a Sterling Professor at Yale, is a noted author and professor in the field of law. Had I known this fact it may have influenced my decision to purchase his book about sailing. If you're looking for a book about Caribbean history and opinions this one may interest you. Jerry's passion for the subject is overwhelmingly evident. If you're interested in a good sailing story there are better alternatives. Seasoned by Salt is the typical sailing story of a couple who to leave their hectic daily lives and responsibilities on land to pursue the lifestyle of the cruiser. Regrettably, the story often sits in the doldrums while Jerry elaborates on everything from racial injustices of the south to the colonial history of the Caribbean. The key word here is \\"elaborate\\". He provides a great historical background and then peppers the story with his opinion. The sailing adventure gets lost in the noise. Jerry's other disdain is the presence of charters and cruise ships. Apparently, all cruisers carry this disdain and feel both have trespassed what rightfully belongs to the cruiser. Irony strikes when one of these cruise ships comes to the couples's aid. Jerry still manages find something negative to interject. Anne's journal entries were always enjoyable and too brief. Two stars - there's a wonderful story in there if you can get past the distractions."},{"Title":"Seasoned by Salt: A Voyage in Search of the Caribbean","review":"Read this book if you have ever had a \\"dream voyage\\" that you have wanted to take!

They had not spent their lives as adventurers-he is a professor at Yale, she a recently retired business executive. Mashaw and MacClintock were experienced sailors, or so they thought, before leaving their home. But as the voyage unfolds they are tested time and time again-by hurricanes, biting flies, seasickness, broken equipment, fatigue, and boredom punctuated by moments of terror. Why would anyone want to do this? By the end of the book you will appreciate why even if you would never, ever think of doing something like this yourself.Along the way the couple meets a cast of characters from other sailors to the local folks sometimes hilariously, sometimes poignantly drawn by Jerry Mashaw. He also provides interesting historical information about the areas through which they sail. Anne MacClintock lends her voice in the \\"Passage Notes\\" at the end of the chapters with her more personal slant on the goings-on. And the book has a number of her charming pen and ink illustrations.Before I read Seasoned by Salt I used to daydream about living aboard a sailboat, gently sailing from one tropical paradise to another.

It is actually more about the very narrow and very liberal attitudes, opinions and beliefs of what may be typical of a Yale professor and his paramour suffering from a severe case of that Northeast Elite superiority and bias you hear about! Obviously travel did not broaden their horizons. They obviously only found what their deeply entrenched preconceived notions prepared them to see. This was not what I expected and certainly not what I wanted from a book that was billed as \\"A Voyage in Search of the Caribbean.\\" They obviously made a sharp \\"left turn\\" somewhere in their \\"search\\". Don't waste your money, there are many other much better books that are more about actual sailing and less about man's inhumanity to man, or whatever it was they whined about throughout this book.

High Hunt is lacking in this aspect. I felt that the main character was written as though it was Eddings himself he was writing about. This is the only character that has any substance. The antagonist is the typical one-dimentional unlikable guy for 3/4 of the book, at which point he's actually given some real human characteristics. It was too little-too late for this novel. It may be that this book comes too close to how real human relationships work. As characters of our own human dramas, we tend to fit most casual acquaintences into neat little packages. An unlikable relative, an edgy ex-marine, a prep, a fat guy. High Hunt reads like that. However, as a reader, I expect these characters to be developed. I've got enough 1-dimensional relationships; I don't need to read about them. One positive was that Eddings' humor is evident throughout this book, as it is through his others. There's just not enough depth to High Hunt to make it a winner."},{"Title":"High Hunt","review":"i have read this book at least 20 times. i started with david eddings' fantasy books, and when i picked this one, i was completely unprepared for the reality it contains. it is such an amazing stark look at believe characters and their interactions. an absolutly beauitul book!"},{"Title":"High Hunt","review":"After completing the entire set of David Eddings' fantasy collection, I began to read &quot;High Hunt.&quot; Immediately, the story drew me into it, and I was amazed at the depth of each character and the real-life sense that Eddings gives to the story.

When my wife (under whose name this review appears since we share an account)bought me a Kindle it just seemed natural to include it. I would have rated it higher but the process of converting the text to the Kindle format is not as accurate as I would like to see. There are a great many typographical errors in the Kindle version that don't exist in the written versions. Many seem to be a result of the conversion process not recognizing certain slang words, but there are also many occasions where \\"the\\" is translated as \\"die\\"...not even close!Even with the above, it is still a great read; and maybe more so since at one time or another I have met people identical to most of the characters."},{"Title":"High Hunt","review":"Although Eddings will go down as a creator of (many) (very good) fantasy epics, his best work is the little known High Hunt, from his early days as a writer.High Hunt is contemporary fiction. It tells the story of two brothers in the Pacific Northwest - coming to grips with maturity, masculinity and one another. Both are 'lost souls' in almost every sense of the word - burned out, desperately looking for something upon which to cling. Both attract equally desperate friends and acquaintances - other men (and occasionally women) in search of focus.The book isn't action-packed - so the occasional reprint/resurrection of this title as FROM THE AUTHOR OF THE EPIC FANTASY SERIES... invariably fails. Anyone expecting flaming swords and legendary duels will certainly end the book disappointed. However, in its calm, insightful way, High Hunt ranks among the best books of the era in painting a picture of the lost, confused modern man. The characters are searching for a definition of masculinity that no longer exists, and have a hard time struggling to find a sense of purpose in its absence.On a less profound (or pretentious) level, High Hunt is also an engaging story about the struggles and triumphs of a family in the Northwest. Trying to make ends meet, trying to make friends, trying to find a reason to wake up in the morning. Slightly bleak, but ultimately very inspiring.This is a terrific book, and, although the lack of flaming swords may prove a disappointment to some, those seeking something different will be thoroughly rewarded. (I like flaming swords - I'm just lucky enough to like this too)"},{"Title":"High Hunt","review":"High Hunt was a surprise to me, a very pleasant surprise. I gather this is one of David Eddings' first books. I have always liked his fantasies, but this was something else again.The story is not about very much. Dan, just out of the military, tries to settle back into regular life. He reconnects with his brother and his brother's acquaintances with lots of beer and quarrels. Eventually, they decide to go hunting end up in the high country. They are constantly on the edge of fighting, with the threat of killing. It comes to a head while in the high country but no one is killed and the fabled white deer is shot.There is a lot of beer drinking (AA anyone?) and I suppose his family might be labeled trailer trash. Dan is thoughtful and I really came to like him, and dislike his brother and friends. A second theme is the story of his love affair with Clydine (what a name!). It was charming and handled with a masterfully light touch.Great characterization, great writing and seemingly written based on personal experience. For a story about ordinary people with no heavy theme, it was captivating."},{"Title":"High Hunt","review":"David Eddings' first novel, published in 1973, is not at all like his epic fantasies that he later became so respected for. HIGH HUNT is about a young man trying to find purpose and direction in an aimless life. Mostly recounting his experiences with friends and relatives in a junky-seeming Tacoma, WA, the story is told entirely from the narrator's perspective. Interestingly, the only likeable characters are the narrator himself and eventually the girl he falls in love with. The rest of his friends are less developed and by no means likeable. The story is written in a way to build up suspense, almost in a haunting manner, where you feel like the narrator is mostly providing the back-drop for some sort of horrific or unbelievable event. Weirdly though, that event never occurs, and the entire book stays firmly in the mundane, with only a couple of moments of high tension or excitement. In the end, while the telling is gripping, you almost feel like \\"What was the point?\\".The real power of the book comes in the form of insights into the way humans view each other, where we tend to fix acquaintances into certain images or roles by which we judge their behavior and actions. Eddings does a magnificent job of showing all of the secondary characters in HIGH HUNT as seen through the eyes of the narrator. His prejudices and experiences influence the way he views his friends (and enemies) and even himself. As I mentioned, the only likeable characters are the narrator himself and his girlfriend, but you get the distinct impression that the main reason for this is that you're hearing the story from the narrator's perspective. An interesting look into the way we view the world.One thing, while I found this book very enjoyable, as I think most guys would, I would hesitate to recommend it to a woman. The characters are trashy, lots of focus on sex, guns, and alcohol, and definitely written from a man's perspective, I can't see most girls I know really liking this one.Overall, this is a very enjoyable novel, with plenty of suspense and drama, but no real surprises or cliff-hangers (unless the lack of a major conflict is the surprise). Recommended for men, not women."},{"Title":"High Hunt","review":"Having read David Edding's other nineteen books, I was very excited when I saw High Hunt in print. I bought it on the spot and delved into it. It was interesting enough, but I found the character interactions were a bit predictable, and seemed a little fake, if not overexaggerated. I must say it was interesting to read my second non-fantasy book by Eddings, but I think he should stick to maces and maidens. But then again, this was his first work, so maybe after reading Polgara I was expecting too much.

Open the leather loop and you're inside what feels like a present. This magical box was put together with so much devotion and careful detail that it feels like a personal gift. And what a gift to give for Christmas or a birthday. I've never seen anything quite as unique, for all ages, for persons in the state or outside.

Georgette Heyer is amazing. I've read a handful or so of Heyer's novels and I can say that each time I read one, it becomes my new favorite. Such is the case for Faro's Daughter, though I'm unsure if any of her other books can top it for me. Basically, it follows the \\"hate at first sight\\" rather than \\"love at first sight\\". Personally, I've always preferred the former, it gives any novel more spice and vigor. The plot flows effortlessly as Deborah Grantham and Max Ravenscar each take their turn to \\"out stake\\" the other. The two characters are both part of a personal game to win against each other... but inevitably, their passionate hatred starts to resemble something else entirely.This book is absolutely and utterly delightful. It's one of those books that make you literally chuckle out loud and read with an unconscious smile lurking on your face. It's romantic, yet fun and sassy - you cheer for both Max and Deborah as each one gains the upper hand through a variety of surprising stunts. It's the type of book that you wish you could go back in time for, just to experience reading it again for the first time."},{"Title":"Faro's Daughter","review":"Deborah Grantham is a heroine delightfully reminiscent of Jane Austen's Elizabeth Bennet. Orphaned and left in the care of her aunt since childhood, she works in the family gambling establishment. (By the way, faro of the title is a card game that was popular in England and France during the 18th century.) Despite her family's less-than-respectable business, Deb is beautiful, smart, independent, loyal and kind.Max Ravenscar is Deb's Mr. Darcy. Enormously wealthy, gruff, completely lacking in social graces, yet full of integrity, and perhaps even a little kindness beneath that prickly exterior. The dialogue between Deb and Max felt very authentic to the time period in which the book was set, and at the same time was absolutely delicious, fast-paced and clever.I loved the fact that this novel reminded me so much of Pride and Prejudice. Besides time and place similarities, the writing style and dialogue between characters are pleasantly Austen-esque. There were enough differences, however, to make Faro's Daughter fresh and surprising.Sourcebooks Casablanca has recently re-released a number of Heyer's Regency romances. (Regency romance is a sub-genre of romance set in England between the years 1795-1837.) Though it took a few chapters to get into the groove of this book's style, it was well worth it and I look forward to reading more from this prolific and talented writer.More book reviews at [...]"},{"Title":"Faro's Daughter","review":"This is one of the best romantic comedies I've ever read, second only to 'Venetia' and 'Arabella' (both also by Heyer). The clash of wills between the proud, haughty Max Ravenscar and the indomitable Deborah Grantham are sure to delight and entertain even the most jaded reader. There are plenty of varied characters, a story that never slows down, an almost palpable chemistry between the main couple and lots of very funny moments. My only complaint about this book was that it was a bit short for my tastes, but then again, I much rather prefer a book like this than one that goes on and on and doesn't know when to stop. If you're tired by the campy trash that gets published today labelled as 'romantic fiction', or if you're simply enjoy a good book, you can't go wrong with 'Faro's Daughter'. Satisfaction guaranteed!"},{"Title":"Faro's Daughter","review":"Heyer's story of London in the very early 19th century is rather different this time: Deborah Grantham is the sort-of manager of the gambling house run -- very haphazardly -- by her widowed aunt, Lady Bellingham. The aunt's genteel card parties had been very successful and she thought to make enough operating a full-time establishment to get out of debt, but through a combination of bad luck and poorly managed expenses, they're on the verge of financial ruin. Meanwhile, Deborah finds that she has quite unintentionally swept the young Lord Mablethorpe (several years younger than her, in fact) off his feet and he has declared his undying devotion and made her an offer of marriage when he reaches his majority. She's being tolerant of him but his cousin and financial trustee, the formidable Mr. Ravenscar, a wealthy gambler and sportsman, decides on very little evidence that Deborah must be a fortune-hunter and sets out to protect the boy. He raises his eyebrows at her and insults her in a very ungentlemanly way and in her justified anger she determines to get her revenge -- even though she has no intention whatever of actually marrying Mablethorpe.And that's where Heyer rather loses control. The subsequent plotline is far less realistic than in most of the author's work. (\\"Realistic\\" being a relative term for a Regency romance.) But assault and kidnapping? Sexual blackmail? C'mon. And while period slang and cant is usually one of the pleasures (for some of us) of reading Heyer's books, she tends to overdo it this time. How many \\"yard of tin\\" and \\"planting a facer\\" and \\"beyond anything great\\" can one take in 275 pages? She also gives Deb's old friend, Lucius Kennet a ridiculously overdone bog-trotter manner of expression which often doesn't even scan properly, and which implies that her familiarity with old-style Irish speaking rhythms is clownishly superficial.Heyer's characters, even though they're often Romantic archetypes, almost clich&eacute;s, are generally pretty convincing -- but not this time. Ravenscar, the male protagonist, is an arrogant, self-centered, spoiled bully who becomes enraged if anyone thwarts his least whim. A very unpleasant person whom Deborah could well do without. But Deb herself is also rather self-centered and whim-ridden, as well as petulant, with a tendency to act without thinking and without considering consequences, and with a desire to have things both ways. Neither of them is particularly sympathetic. And yet we're supposed to believe she's secretly in love with Ravenscar? In fact, almost the only characters here one might reasonably care about are Lord Mablethorpe, who is merely nave and inexperienced, and the somewhat feather-brained but irrepressible Arabella, both of whom at least shows some spunk when pressed."},{"Title":"Faro's Daughter","review":"I won't talk about the plot because other reviewers already did, I want to point out that I just love the interactions between the protagonists, if you like your heroine very smart and at the same time very endearing, none of that dumb stubbornness sometimes we found in other authors but a pretty female character, independent (like all other Heyer females!) and very interesting overall. You will have a marvelous time reading this story, it is very good, go ahead and read it!"},{"Title":"Faro's Daughter","review":"I had a huge problem with this book, and that is--it was TOO SHORT!!!

Historically accurate in detail of clothes, houses, means of tranport and manners and engaging"},{"Title":"Faro's Daughter","review":"A superb heroine, a well matched hero, makes this one of Georgette Heyer's most witty and extravagant romances. Intrigue, plots within plots, interesting characters, well worth the read."},{"Title":"Faro's Daughter","review":"This was my introduction to Ms. Heyer's works and I absolutely loved it. It is completely diverting - which is what I was looking for. While the book is predictable in its outcome, the journey along the way is anything but. I have read 5 of her books so far and have found them all delightful. My 25 yr old daughter has been stealing them from me and sharing them with her friends. Crazy twists, hysterical turns, anda satisfying end seem to be a hallmark of Ms. Heyer's regency romances. She has a gift for the absurd and her stories are immensely entertaining. They are also innocent enough, that they can be passed along to teenage nieces and daughters. Definitely well worth the read."},{"Title":"Faro's Daughter","review":"I have very strong feelings about Georgette Heyer's books. The writing is always impeccable. I love her style, love her masterful use of the English language. Whenever I read her books, I'm so glad I can read them in the original English so nothing is lost in translation. However, the plot is where it becomes hit or miss for me. Some books focus entirely on the rescue of irritating waifs rather than the main couple, or the heroine is really, really immature. I was annoyed the entire time I read April Lady and I couldn't really love Sprig Muslin. Luckily, Faro's Daughter is my favorite sort of Heyer: a lovely, concentrated battle of wits between a man and a woman with sparkling results. This book is laugh-out-loud funny and the hero and heroine are both incredibly magnetic. The pages flew for me, and I was sorry to see it end so soon.Max Ravenscar, one of the richest men in London and a confirmed bachelor, is called upon to save his young cousin, Lord Mablethorpe, from the clutches of a wench from a gaming house. Lord Mablethorpe has proposed marriage to this hussy, and it's Ravenscar's job to buy off this woman and save his cousin from a disastrous marriage. Miss Deborah Grantham, said wench, is actually a well-bred young lady who, along with her aunt, has fallen on hard times and must maintain the gaming house for income. She has absolutely no intention of marrying her foolish admirer until his overbearing relative arrives and flings his offensive money in her face. Completely insulted by Ravenscar's preconceived ideas about her lifestyle and his nasty slurs on her honor, she throws all caution to the wind. Deborah declares that she will marry Lord Mablethorpe, and, playing the role of the scheming gold digger, tells Ravenscar that she plans to drain his cousin for every cent he has. Infuriated, Ravenscar is now convinced of her mercenary intentions and becomes determined to find out how much money she's really holding out for. Meanwhile, Deborah gleefully gets into her role and dresses a little tackier, acts a little wilder in public, parading herself in front of Ravenscar on the arm of the unsuspecting Mablethorpe. Thus begins an engrossing and completely amusing battle of wills between two hard-headed people, each trying to call the other's bluff while frantically ignoring the growing attraction between them.I wish I could say more about the plot, except it's such fun that I don't want to ruin it for anyone. Suffice it to say, only Georgette Heyer could write an abduction scene with such mastery and make it believable and hilarious at the same time, while poking fun at the absurdity of the whole situation.Writers should get a clue from Heyer when it comes to writing heroines. Deb is fiery and witty without being a harpy, and utterly charming and sweet without being a coquette. She has an unfortunate tendency to get herself into scrapes, often with the help of her two doting friends, and embroils herself into the most embarrassing situations. Yes, Deb Grantham is one beleaguered woman. Not only does she have to deal with a very silly aunt, but also an army of young people confused about love and desiring her guidance. She also is in charge of paying the bills for her aunt's gaming-house, which leads to no end of stress. Fortunately, Deb has a great sense of humor, tempered with an overly-developed sense of pride. This pride is what gets her into the most trouble. Still, she is always kind and loyal to her friends, and her good nature always wins out in the end. I absolutely loved her.Ravenscar is a true Heyer hero: wealthy, a little hardened by life, charismatic yet intensely arrogant. He is baffled by Deborah and the mass of contradictions she presents; he is certain that she's only after his cousin's title, but as he spends time spying on her, is forced to notice her true goodness and loving disposition. He has a great sense of humor lurking behind his stern exterior, and it is so enjoyable to watch him suppress his amusement in a potentially explosive situation. I think he is a little harsher than the average Heyer hero, especially in the way he bitterly vituperates Deborah after a misunderstanding - but I believe his disappointment is so very deep that he is entitled to those words. Of course, he more than makes up for his bad behavior at the end, and I closed the book with an irrepressible smile on my face. It's hard not to love a self-assured, rigidly aloof man who becomes a big hothead over the woman of his dreams.As many others have noted, there are only kisses in Georgette Heyer's books, but this lack of explicit scenes does not in any way detract from the wonderful chemistry between the two protagonists. I hate using the phrase \\"sizzling chemistry,\\" but it fittingly describes Deborah and Ravenscar. They sizzle when they're together, and it's impossible not to enjoy every second of it.If you've never read a Heyer, I urge you to go read this one now. Even the worst Heyer is so much better than many romances on the market these days, and this is one of her best. I have secondhand copies of her books, mostly scrounged from used book sales. Luckily for us, Sourcebooks Casablanca is reprinting many of Heyer's books with gorgeous covers. I'm planning to buy every single one, maybe even duplicates of my favorites. That's how good she is."},{"Title":"Faro's Daughter","review":"Having previously read at least 9 or 10 Georgette Heyer Regency books and loving them all, I was still not prepared for the laugh out loud surprises that Faro's Daughter brought forth. I litereally laughed til tears were running down my cheeks at the antics of the combating hero and heroine. These two strong personalities were combustible both verbally and physically and upon finishing it the first time, I immediately read it again. I would love this book to be made into a movie. I can picture one of my favorite British actors (RA) as Ravenscar. There is so much witty reparte, humor, drama and romance that I put Faro's Daughter on my wish list. I don't mind borrowing from the library, but I want to own my favorites so I can grab them anytime I want to be transported. Asking someone to pick their favorite Georgette Heyer is like asking them to pick their favorite child. This one is definately a keeper."},{"Title":"Faro's Daughter","review":"When Max Ravenscar's aunt informs him that her son Adrian is in danger of being ensnared by a wench from a gaming house into a most unsuitable marriage, he resolves to do whatever it takes to save his hapless relative from a disastrous alliance. Deborah Grantham, the \\"wench\\" in question and the chief attraction of her aunt's gaming establishment, has beauty and brains to spare, but little in the way of money or societal approbation. Despite her family's money troubles - which seem to accumulate with alarming frequency - Deb is no conniving shrew, out to entrap an impressionable young heir into a mercenary marriage. When Ravenscar high-handedly assumes that Deborah can be bribed, she's outraged. Determined to give the insufferably proud Max his comeuppance, Deb exerts herself to play the role of tacky fortune huntress to the hilt. As the stakes rise and their battle of wills escalates, Deb and Max stand to lose their only chance at happiness if they can't overcome their stubbornness and pride. Rife with comic misunderstandings and outrageous escapades, Faro's Daughter is the unlikely love story between a couple who could make the perfect match - if only they didn't hate each other so much.In Faro's Daughter, Georgette Heyer delivers one of the most obstinate, headstrong romantic leads I've ever encountered in the pages of one of her novels. Max Ravenscar (LOVE that name!) is the Heyer Regency hero taken to the extreme - self-assured and arrogant, he possesses an annoyingly unshakeable confidence in his own judgment. Deborah, on the other hand, is perhaps one of Heyer's most interesting heroines - far from being a proper Regency miss, Deb is witty, resourceful, intelligent, and best of all, a bit scandalous thanks to her position as mistress of her aunt's gaming establishment. I found Heyer's recreation of Regency-era gaming parties to be fascinating - it's an aspect of upper-class life from that time period that I've never really seen explored in fiction. The gambling plotline, combined with Max and Deb's fiery, and often borderline venomous exchanges, brought a darker, edgier tone this novel that I'm not used to seeing in Heyer's Regencies. Generally I love a romance featuring couples attracted to each other in spite of themselves - i.e., Darcy and Elizabeth in Pride and Prejudice, or Beatrice and Benedick in Much Ado About Nothing - but Heyer takes things a bit too far until the final third of Faro's Daughter with Max and Deb for me to rank their relationship with those like-minded classics.Heyer had a gift for populating her Regency romances with laugh-out-loud, entertaining supporting characters and creating the most outlandish situations for her leads to navigate, and Faro's Daughter is no exception. I absolutely loved Deborah's aunt, Lady Bellingham, and her delightfully ditzy way of navigating through life. Her complete incomprehension of why she is beset by overwhelming bills, and the way Deborah's feud with Ravenscar is always about to give her the vapors provide some of the funniest scenes in novel. Lady Bellingham is a classic Heyer creation - over-the-top, lovable ridiculousness, as is the scenario that sees Deb overseeing Ravenscar's kidnapping and lock-up in her cellar. Ravenscar's reaction that indignity was priceless! Humor-wise I feel like Faro's Daughter was a departure for Heyer. I crave her humor and razor-sharp wit, but too often the dialogue that fills these pages felt barbed instead of hilarious. However, the last third of the novel returns to vintage Heyer territory, packed with comic misunderstandings, lightning-fast dialogue, and the emotional heart that I'd been missing earlier in the story. I wouldn't recommend starting with Faro's Daughter if you're looking to explore Heyer's Regencies. While it's not my favorite, Heyer's superb research and sense of time and place shine, and the wildly entertaining wrap-up to Ravenscar and Deborah's feuding made the journey for this long-time Heyer fan worthwhile."},{"Title":"Faro's Daughter","review":"Just wanted to leave a rating more then a review.Deborah Grantham's aunt has established a gambling house.

I wish some wonderful people would turn it into a movie, for it would certainly make a great romantic regency comedy.I found myself laughing out loud, and squealing with delight while reading this book. Our heroine, Deb Grantham, is wonderfully spirited and determined. Deb's aunt, Lady Bellingham, was constantly reaching for her smelling salts, vinaigrette, hartshorn, and having a case of the vapours nearly every time she's around our spirited Deb. The writing is sooo funny! Our hero, Max Ravenscar, is devilishly cunning and relentless. All of the secondary characters were interesting and added to the fun. There are many terrible misunderstandings, prejudices, and comedies of error! There are some hysterical one-liners. The tension was constant through the entire story, thrilling me as to \\"oooo, what's gonna happen next!!??\\" Wait til you read about Deb's plot to kidnap Max. I tell you, it is TOO funny!!!I have read Heyer's \\"Sylvester\\" and \\"Devil's Cub\\". I enjoyed both immensely, but \\"Faro's Daughter\\" is the funniest of the three, and is funny without sacrificing any of the romantic tension. I'll be re-reading this one."},{"Title":"Faro's Daughter","review":"*****Light SPOILERS*****I would give this one 3 1/2 stars, given the choice. The set-up is perfect, but the execution a bit flawed. The hero is a standard-issue sardonic Heyer hero, the heroine interestingly placed in life, and interestingly up against it. Like some of Heyer's other earlier novels, the book succeeds least in its plotting. Everything depends on an intelligent character behaving foolishly, because of a fit of pique, and everyone around her indulging that behavior. It's just a little much, especially when Deborah becomes so intent on teaching Max a lesson that she has him kidnapped. It's worth it, though, for the reactions of minor characters (\\"What good comes from teaching people lessons!?\\" wails the requisite silly old dowager) and for some of Max's reactions, especially during the ludicrous kidnapping sequence, which is redeemed in part by Heyer's apparent awareness that it is ludicrous. Even less-than-stellar Heyer is better than the vast majority of other genre writers."},{"Title":"Faro's Daughter","review":"When young Lord Adrian Maplethorpe proclaims to his mother that he wishes to marry a young lady from a gaming house, she is both floored and horrified. It's obvious to her that the girl must only want him for his money and title. And so Lady Maplethorpe immediately sends for her nephew, Max Ravenscar, to talk some sense into Adrian. He too is surprised at the news and decides to take a look at this girl himself.Max marches himself on down to St. James Square to the home-turned-gaming house of Eliza Bellingham in the hopes of meeting Ms. Deborah Grantham, Ms. Bellingham's niece and object of Adrian's affection.However, the girl he encounters is not the girl he had imagined. Beautiful, funny, smart and not in the least the loose, vulgar thing he was expecting - she quite takes him by surprise. Their first meeting leaves him unsatisfied and eager to find out more about her. They meet up again and Max unveils his proposal to pay her off to stay away from his cousin and that is when things get good!Deb is utterly offended and beyond rage at Max's offer and vows revenge. In a nutshell she tells him to take his money and shove it! She'd even go as far as taking Adrian up on his offer (even though shew had no intention before), even if it meant his ruin, just to spite the \\"most hateful, odious man I have ever met in my life\\". Max is flabbergasted at her rejection! What is this woman up to? She must be holding out for more money, of that he is certain. Thus begins a tug-of-war of wills between Max and Deb.What follows is an endearing and humorous story of two people who drive each other absolutely crazy and end up falling in love.Faro's Daughter is the first novel I have read by Georgette Heyer, the Mother of Regency romance and I can tell you with a certainty that it will not be the last! I'm not usually a romancy kind of gal, but I have to admit that I really enjoyed this novel. It was a light, funny read with memorable characters and some kidnapping thrown in for good measure.I recommend this book to any reader, of any age that likes a nice, sweet story of the heart.Amy says: 5/5"},{"Title":"Faro's Daughter","review":"Shakespeare is always in her work and this is no exception.

Faro's Daughter falls very short of Austen quality!The hero, Ravenscar, spends 99% of the book trying to prevent his cousin from marrying Deborah Grantham because she is considered an unsuitable bride for a member of the \\"ton\\". Although he finally discovers that she is not the \\"harpy\\" that he originally believed, the actual interaction between the two protagonists is so little that a love match at the end is wholly unbelievable. In addition, a great portion of the book is wasted due to repetition and unnecessary conversations between Deborah and supporting characters.One redeeming quality is that there are sections that are genuinely laugh-out-loud funny, however, not enough to make it much more than unsubstantial and dull."},{"Title":"Faro's Daughter","review":"I downloaded the sample to read before buying this book, and found two 'typos' in the first two pages. Why should Amazon recieve $7.99 for a book that they have zero investment in, and nobody to pay royalties to? To issue these shoddy digital editions is terribly disrespectful to the author's memory."},{"Title":"Faro's Daughter","review":"Georgette Heyer's books stand the test of time. I first read these in my teens, and am thrilled to be able to re-read again. Faro's Daughter is a lively romp. Handsome, but stern, hero, a lively heroine, loads of action of the drawing room kind and written in such a fun manner. I thoroughly enjoyed the read. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Faro's Daughter","review":"I read almost all of Georgette Heyer's books years ago. I'm currently rereading her books and they can still make me laugh!"},{"Title":"Faro's Daughter","review":"Again a favorite of mine have read it many times and it still delights and amuses, as always wonderful period detail!"},{"Title":"Faro's Daughter","review":"Georgette Heyer has always been a favourite of mine and this is one book that I had never read. She is always meticulous and accurate about the historical settings of all her novels. Her knowledge of gaming houses in this novel surprises me but it is in this setting that the novel manages to weave its spell between two characters who are down on their luck and have to run the gaming house to enjoy an overlavish lifestyle and the 'aristocracy' who frequent this establishment. they always say that hatred and love make strange bed fellows and you will find both in close proximity in this novel Well worth reading!"},{"Title":"Faro's Daughter","review":"Georgette Heyer is a master storyteller. I especially like this book one of her lesser known ones. Her heroine has spirit, her hero learns humility and her humor shines through."},{"Title":"Faro's Daughter","review":"I love reading Georgette Heyer novels. I really enjoy the plots and the descriptions. She has such a wide vocabulary I learn new words from her novels all the time. Great way to escape from today's fast paced world."},{"Title":"Faro's Daughter","review":"I think this is one of Heyer's best. The play on words and the actions of our characters are supreme. I love how Deborah keeps finding herself in one scrape after another while trying to get her Aunt out of debt. The sport between Deborah and Max is just the best. Deborah has Max kidnapped. Her henchmen are a little overzealous and she's worried for him. Now why if she's that upset at him for insulting her is she in such a stir about how they abducted him. Max is not to be outdone. While he's in the cellar a would be rescuer comes to his aid. He doesn't want rescued he wants to find a way out of the mess himself. I laughed myself silly. And when it's said by the young suitor Adrian that he is perceiving that Deborah being a few years older than him gives her an advantage it's so right on the mark. It is just what one would perceive - if said person has a brain. I laughed out loud so many times during this novel that I can do nothing but recommend it to others. A mishap at the end that goes terribly awry puts Deborah right where Max wants her to end the game."},{"Title":"Faro's Daughter","review":"I loved it! Both the hero and heroine engaged in all sorts of ridiculous escapades, Miss Grantham most of all. I really enjoyed they're sparring and watching them fall in love gradually as the book went on."},{"Title":"Faro's Daughter","review":"In addition to Ms. Heyer's usual wit, skill and period detail, this book has a delightful complication at the end caused by one of the heroine's many admirers who thought he was being helpful. I also enjoy how her characters develop over the course of the book--usually for the better."},{"Title":"Faro's Daughter","review":"Going through a Regency romance (actual literature from the period, not bodice rippers) kick and having very little to chose from there, I managed to stumble across Heyer. I am so glad I did! As much as I love Austen, the sensibility at the time was certainly different than the modern perspective, and even though I love it it can often seem stiff or slow at times. Heyer is the perfect match up of painstakingly research historical accuracy with all the lovely witty dialog of a period novel and a peppier writing style with spunky young women that are easier for a post-women's-lib reader to relate to. The characters (men and women) are strong (even when they're a bit pitiable), likeable, and interesting, make enough mistakes to be thoroughly human, and their actions are always clearly driven by their personalities and circumstances rather than a need to move the plot along. The plots often take on the feel of a fast-paced comedy of errors akin to a good Shakespearean comedy, with all the romance of the Regency period.Now for this book, this is one of my top 10 easily. The characters are a wonderful example of just how sexy a good argument can be. The plot gets particularly madcap, but never pushes it to far. I highly recommend it! If you find you like it I'd also recommendDevil's Cub,The Grand Sophy,Sylvester: or The Wicked Uncle, andBlack Sheep."},{"Title":"Faro's Daughter","review":"Deborah Grantham is well born, well-bred and ever so lovely. None of this matters, however, in the game of love and matrimony in Regency London, because Ms. Grantham earns her living playing cards in one of London's finest gambling houses. And marriage with such a gaming-house wench is just not done, especially not in the echelons of the &quot;ton.&quot; Young Lord Maplethorpe is willing to flaunt society and risk its censure to marry the beautiful Deborah for love. His unhappy mother seeks help from her stepson, the handsomest, cleverest, richest man about town, Max Ravenscar. This unrelenting bachelor meets Deborah, his new foe, across the faro table where they play for power, although they wager for money.And proud Ms. Grantham gives Ravenscar a run for his money as she proves to be more stubborn and high principled than he in this delightful romantic farce. Georgette Heyer writes one of her best novels with &quot;Faro's Daughter.&quot; The witty dialogue, the power plays between the intelligent Deborah, who does not want to be beholden to anyone, let alone to the arrogant Lord who is so willing to believe the worst of her, and the creative subplots and adventures showcase her talent.This is a winner, and a must read for all Ms. Heyer's fans!JANA"},{"Title":"Faro's Daughter","review":"&quot;Women of your stamp should be whipped at the cart-tail!&quot; Thus says Max Ravenscar to the woman he believes to be a scheming strumpet out to snare his young, impressionable, titled and rich nephew. This is not, however, the way to impress Deborah Grantham, who is in fact an entirely honourable young lady despite her presence in her aunt's gaming-house.So Deborah decides to spite Ravenscar; first she rejects out of hand his offers to buy her off, then appears in public with his nephew, Adrian, dressed and behaving as precisely the vulgar harpy her believes her to be. This, of course, only serves to infuriate him even more, and he ups the stakes further.There are some hilarious scenes in this book - the one where Deborah has Ravenscar kidnapped and imprisoned in her cellar (and then... oh, but no spoilers! &lt;g&gt;) is worth the price of this book all on its own.For a sparkling and determined heroine, and a hero who, despite his stiff-necked pride, has a very well-developed sense of both honour and humour, you can't go far wrong with Heyer's Faro's Daughter."},{"Title":"Faro's Daughter","review":"This was my first Georgette Heyer book and I can't tell you how much I enjoyed it! The way Ms. Heyer weaves humor and historical detail into her books is amazing and beautiful. I am so sad that most of her books are out of print, but you can believe that I will be faithfully searching every nook and cranny I can find to get my hands on more!Lord Mablethorpe is a man in love. Well... not exactly. He has proclaimed undying love to Miss Deborah Grantham, but it is painfully obvious that it is just a case of puppy love. However, this is not the story that gets to Mablethorpe's mother's ears.Lady Mablethorpe hears that a wench from the gaming table has ensnared her helpless son into marriage. As Lord Mablethorpe is of respectable lineiage and will come into a handsom fortune, Lady Mablethorpe will not let this come to pass. She has nothing better to do then to call on her nephew, Mr. Max Ravenscar, the richest man in London. Lady Mablethorpe begs him to save her son from the claws of the harpy, and so Mr. Ravenscare accepts. He intends to buy Deborah off at whatever price it takes. When he confronts Deb with the subject of her &quot;ingagement&quot; to Lord Mablethorpe, she is extremely offended. She never had any intention of marrying Lord Mablethorpe (of course she doesn't tell Ravenscar this) and she is not really a woman of the gaming houses. Oh, it's true that she does enjoy a bit of cards and she does run the E.O. table at her aunt's house, but this is because she and her aunt are in dire straits and desperately need money. As a matter of pride, Deb will not take the money from Ravenscar and declares that she will marry Mablethorpe (of course it is a lie) and she will bring him to utter ruin.Coming home in a fit of rage, Deb makes a resolution to act as the harpy that Ravenscar seems to think she is. She tranforms herself into a gaudy, chintzy, totally tasteless female and shocks everyone. The two thouroughly dislike each other, but... love and hate go hand in hand...Oh dear!It is such a shame that all of Georgette Heyer's books are not all in print. I was lucky enough to find _Faro's Daughter_ at my library, I storngly urge you to look for it too. This is what regency and romance is all about, my friends. This is it! The humor, the slang (&quot;I don't give a button what you think!&quot;) the love, the language, all of it. Georgetts Heyer's style of writing should be the basis of every author's book. She does not treat her readers as children and spell everything out for them. Indeed, reading one of her books is an interactive experience. Her plots are unique, if not the origionals. Her characters come alive and basically speek to you. The emotions that I felt while reading _Faro's Daughter_ cannot actually be said out loud... all I can say is read it. You must, you simply must. Georgette Heyer books are must haves for any true romance fan."},{"Title":"Faro's Daughter","review":"&quot;Faro's daughter&quot; is the name given to the beauties who grace gaming houses in Regency London. What tonnish family would not be shocked to discover that its scion is in thrall to such a one? Max is mad and determined to rescue his nephew from Deborah's clutches, but soon discovers that he wants only to replace his nephew in her heart.&quot;Faro's Daughter&quot; is the quintessential Regency novel, one of Heyer's very best. The scene where (almost) all is revealed never fails to make me cry, and when, at last, all ends happily, I always give a satisfied sigh. Deb's aunt is a foolish delight, and for the mawkishly sentimental, there is a happy pair of young lovers as well. A true delight"},{"Title":"Faro's Daughter","review":"The dialoge is witty, the characters are beautifully drawn, and the plot keeps you revited to the book. Faro's Daughter is a contest of wits (and wills) between the lovely Deborah Grantham and the wealthy Max Ravenscar. The two turn out to be an excellent match. My only complaint is that the story ended so quickly. It is one of those books you want to go on and on."},{"Title":"Faro's Daughter","review":"ALL OF MS. HEYER'S wonderfully enthralling heroines, are -- though living in the midst of the male-dominated English Regency period -- closet feminists! Or, at least, are those with whom I am acquainted. I have yet, it seems, to read all of her numerous and wonderous books. But I have, however, read FARO'S DAUGHTER, and know, from it and the other of ther novels that I have read, that I have many new treats in store for me, from reading the rest of her work! : ) This closet feminism of her heroines is all the more amazing, since Ms. Heyer wrote her novels in the only-slightly less male-dominated eras of the 1930's through the 1980's. Yet, her heroines do manage, (in spades!), to retain a definite femininity, and, usually, a great deal of charm. The difference between these very feminine, \\"closet-feminists\\", and, say, the \\"sweet little dears\\" portayed within the novels of Horatio Alger, (heroines who, it appears, did little more than cheer on Mr. Alger's brave male protagonists), is that Ms. Heyer's heroines had minds of their own, (as well as hearts and tender feelings), and, in her novels, it is not only battles with circumstance, and between the genders which is seen....one also sees a battle going on betwixt the heroine's head and her heart. Often, the head prevails...but the heroine's actions -- usually intelligent, well-planned ones, but often leading to hilarious and sometimes unforeseen results -- are always planned, and done, (whether she knows it or not), at the behest of the heroine's heart.This is amply shown in the delightful \\"FARO'S DAUGHTER\\". The heroine, Deborah Gratham, lives with her aunt, a proprietress ofa gaming house. This makes the heroine to be -- despite her wealth, beauty, lineage, (and, yes, brains) -- looked down upon by polite London society of the day. A (very) young aristocratic gentleman, Lord Maplethorpe, frequents the gaming house...and soon decides that he is in love with her...moreover, he is certain that Deborah is in love with him. Enter, (at the behest of Lord Mapelethorp's anguished mother), the young gentleman's uncle, Max Ravenscar...who intends to break up this horrendous affair before it seriously begins. What he doesn't realize is that the affair never began at all: Deborah is NOT in love with the very young Lord Maplethorpe, and is, indeed, at that very moment in the depths of considering how to let the youngster know she is not in love with him, without hurting his youthful, kind feelings. But....Max Ravenscar's bold and arrogant manner, which considers her, conclusively but without evidence, nothing more than a \\"gaming-house title-hunter\\", infuriates the proud and independent-minded Ms. Gratham...who vows revenge on the haughty, jumping-to-erroneous-conclusions Ravenscar.Including a race, a kidnapping, a hilarious dress-up, (and character) deception, and much else besides, this is indeed a most delightful reading romp! Indeed, this novel could well be sub-titled \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", (were not that title already the name of a novel written in similar, elegant fashion)...for truth, true love -- and lost stereotypes -- finally do win out, over Deborah's understandable, but at times over-weening pride, and Max Ravenscar's infuriating prejudices. This is the story of two very head-strong, yet very human people, who find themselves at first at odds, then in battle, but finally in love...as they realize their simularities far outweigh, and finally dissapate, any differences they may have.This is an enjoyable, enthralling book from its beginning to its end. Beneath the petticoats and starched collars, real people emerge...as in all of Heyer's romances. Who says elegance must be dull, or that \\"X\\"-rating is needed for excitement? Not I...and I hazard to guess, not other readers either, once they have read this and other Heyer books. You might, indeed, find yourself writing elegantly, after the 18th centry manner, as I have here-in tried to do, after reading it, and other Heyer novels! Of course, realizing (sadly?), that I am,for better or worse, still a person living amidst the hurly-burly of the 21st century, I do find myself so deeply wishing that at least one of Georgette Heyer's elegant and yet truly realistic novels would, someday very soon, be made into a motion picture! And, although I love all of her books, my vote would go for the hilarious, deeply-moving, fast-paced, insightful FARO'S DAUGHTER to be filmed, first!P.S.: Georgette Heyer's books are NOT for women only! Intelligent, thoughtful gentlemen, who wish to obtain some inkling as to what goes on with-in the feminine mind and mind-set -- today as well as in the past -- would do well to read Ms. Heyer's intelligent, involving, character-as-well-as-plot-driven novels, too!"},{"Title":"Faro's Daughter","review":"Saying typical Georgette Heyer is an accolade that most authors will never receive. Ms. Heyer writes her Regency romances with grace, wit and humor. While this is not my favorite one of her books, it contains all the elements to make it an outstanding romance novel by any other standards. Her heroes are always attractive, strong and compelling and her heroines are spirited and lively. Always a \\"fun\\" read."},{"Title":"Faro's Daughter","review":"This is a wonderful book that will make you laugh out loud.

Mr Max Ravenscar wants to buy of Deb Grantham, who he thinks snared his young cousin. However, Deb is enraged that someone will think her so low and vulgar, and she desides to teach Mr Ravenscar a lesson by pretending the very sort of creature he thinks she is. Since both of them are extremely stubborn and strong willed, neither of them will give in, and things get more complicated when they fall in lov"},{"Title":"Faro's Daughter","review":"This book is a definate favorite of mine and is a drawing room comedy - with a twist!Join Max Ravenscar as he tries to extricate his young cousin from the coils of Miss Grantham - whose aunt runs (gasp!) a Gaming House!Of course, there is much more to the plot than meets the eye, with several different romantic plots running through the books, and a wildly romantic rescue of an innocent young girl.This book is lots of fun, and is enjoyed by all Heyer afficionados."},{"Title":"Faro's Daughter","review":"Another delightfully fun read from Georgette Heyer!My mother was a Jane Austen fan, but dear Jane wrote only SIX novels.Not our marvelous Georgette! She was prolific. And Ms. Heyer's historical research into the social aspects of the Regency era shine through all her books.In Pharo's Daughter, there is this scene. They are going to the Theatre in a box. Her ensemble. Her dress, her accessories, her whole manner are pointedly dreadful. When I read it, I cackled and a guffawed out loud for such an extended period of time that my sister finally just had me read her the scene aloud.This is a love story of opposites attracting in the milieu of Beatrice and Benedict.Georgette Heyers make for marvelous Summer Beach reading or something to nibble on in the Winter chill on the weekend. Pharo's Daughter is totally worth your reading."},{"Title":"Faro's Daughter","review":"It was summer and I just wanted to find SOMETHING new that was just as fun and of the same time period as \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\" After days of hunting I finally found Georgette Heyer and this wonderful book.The heroine is every bit as clever and yet foolish as one of Austen's and I found myself laughing out loud more than once.OK, Ms. Heyer's does not write as well as Jane Austen, but Faro's Daughter is just plain fun to read.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Faro's Daughter","review":"its a wonderful book and makes for lovely reading. heyer wit and style will keep you entertained from the first page to the last.a must buy for anyone who enjoys heyer style romance."},{"Title":"Faro's Daughter","review":"This is Georgette Heyer at her best. it made me laugh out loud and cry and even at the same time!

The ending was greater than I thought would be and it will take you through some emotions.The only con for me was the name calling, even if said in gest, to me that would not deserve a kiss! It bothered me a bit.But that's it. Still a great book that I will most definitely reread!"},{"Title":"Faro's Daughter","review":"Faro's Daughter is one of the first I ever read by Georgette Heyer and the first of her books I got to read on Kindle. I love Heyer for her wit and her minor characters who are often very funny. Yet the romance is believable. I wasn't thrilled with the price, but then I hope my Kindle version will last longer than the crumbling paperbacks I have. Can't wait for her best stuff to appear electronically: A Civil Contract, The Grand Sophy, These Old Shades, etc. . ."},{"Title":"Faro's Daughter","review":"I loved this book!! The plot is fast paced. As always the side characters, especially Deb's aunt and her notion of economizing is hilarious :)) The best part of the book is the witty and clever exchange between Deb & Max. Each thinks he or she is going to 'teach a lesson' to the other and the result is amusing & heartwarming. Unlike other Heyers the ending in this one builds up a good steam and the resolution is very satisfactory. I think I read the last few pages about 10 times!! Its a treat, not to be missed!"},{"Title":"Faro's Daughter","review":"I love Georgette Heyer's novels, and this one was just as great as the rest.
